 Originally involved in the civil rights movement , several of Ford 's public statements and legislative proposals as senator attracted media attention and controversy . He finished in third place in the June 2010 Democratic primary election for Governor of South Carolina . He resigned on May 31 , 2013 , in the midst of a political scandal on public funds spent in adult establishments .

 Ford was born in New Orleans , Louisiana ; his parents were leaders in the African American community . Ford attended Wayne State University and Grambling State University , from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations . He was expelled by the university , despite it being historically black , because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation . Ford was a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King , Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People 's Campaign . He was arrested 73 times for participating in protests during the civil rights movement . In 1973 , he won a draft evasion trial on basis of conscientious objection . Ford worked as a car salesman and later became a full @-@ time legislator . Ford is a lifelong bachelor .

 Ford was elected to serve on the Charleston City Council , where he served from 1974 to 1992 , and ran for the State Senate and was elected on November 3 , 1992 , taking office in 1993 . He was reelected in 1996 , 2000 , 2004 , and 2008 . He served on the Senate Committees on Banking and Insurance , Corrections and <unk> , General , Invitations , Judiciary , and Labor , Commerce and Industry , and was the ranking Democrat on several committees . Ford is a member of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus . Ford resigned on May 31 , 2013 during a brewing campaign finance scandal . 
 Ford has been described as entertaining , controversial , and politically incorrect . He supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama 's appeal to white voters . Ford later apologized for his comments , stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past . Ford 's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green . In the beginning of his campaign , Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised , and although Ford 's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity , because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home . Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin . Ford praised Obama 's election in November 2008 , but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn 's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama 's victory .

 As senator , Ford has introduced many bills with only a small number becoming law , but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills . After becoming senator , Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House . It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag , and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination . Following years of debate , the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford . He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King , Jr . Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays . Ford stated that he hoped the legislation would improve race relations in South Carolina . 
 Ford described the election of judges by popular vote as a major goal and supported increasing the number of judges . He supported giving more authority to law enforcement , including the ability to search people on parole and probation without warrant , making attempted murder a crime with lifelong sentence , and increasing penalties for possession of illegal guns . Ford is a proponent of stricter regulations of the financial industry . He sponsored a 2006 ban on payday lending , which was shown to discriminate against African Americans . In 2008 , Ford blocked all House bills in the Senate until the bill was taken up . The bill failed in the Senate by a close vote and was heavily amended so lenders would not be banned but restricted . The bill then passed with Ford voting in favor but failed to advance after changes made in the House . A bill preventing consumers from taking out more than one loan at a time passed the House in 2009 . Ford supported offshore drilling , stating conservation was not a priority for most citizens of the state . Geologists believe there is little oil to be found off the South Carolina coast . Ford wants to prevent the widening of Interstate 26 through Charleston , calling instead for a study for transportation needs . Ford emphasized the need for more funding for school programs , which he claimed is necessary due to the small number of pupils attending college and to remedy lacks of knowledge in geography and civics , which he wants reinstated as a school subject . Ford was told about favoritism , intimidation and racism in the South Carolina Highway Patrol and publicized it with Glenn McConnell . Subsequently , director and deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety resigned under pressure from governor Mark Sanford . 
 Ford sponsored legislation defining a hate crime " as an assault , intimidation or threat based on ' actual or perceived ' race , religion , color , sex , age , national origin and sexual orientation . " He also introduced several bills concerning gay rights in lodging , hospital visitation rights and partnerships . His partnership bill would provide for civil unions in South Carolina . The effort was judged by state senator Mike Fair as predetermined to fail , but Ford cited the Democratic National Committee 's platform on the issue and argued that Barack Obama 's election showed that a change should be attempted . Even if passed , the measure would be unenforceable , due to a constitutional amendment banning unions similar to marriage in South Carolina . Ford worked to outlaw profanity and saggy pants and to keep music from minors that is " profane , vulgar , lewd , lascivious or indecent . " Ford argued he did not expect these proposals to be approved but wanted to start a discussion specifically targeting young African American men 's fashion as well as rap music . He stated : " You don 't have to emulate prisoners no more . You can emulate somebody like Barack Obama . " 
 Ford often opposed governor Mark Sanford 's political goals , arguing his proposed reforms were unwanted by the public , and he mostly opposed Sanford 's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor , claiming he was removed from the interests of citizens . An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly . He also opposed Sanford 's goal to increase the number of roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford , stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety . The reform would have required all employers to use state driver 's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers . Ford co @-@ sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor 's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members . Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control .

 Ford ran to succeed Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election . His platform included reinstating video poker to the state to generate returns from taxes on the gaming industry in an effort to balance the state budget , something he has proposed since the late 1990s . A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance ; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban . Ford faced state senator Vincent A. <unk> of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in a primary election . <unk> 's campaign has raised $ 33 @,@ 000 as of January 2009 , while Ford 's campaign raised $ 6 @,@ 000 . On June 8 , 2010 , Ford finished in third place in the primary election with 18 percent of the vote .

 = Maryland Route 657 = 
 Maryland Route 657 ( MD 657 ) was a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway ran 1 @.@ 82 miles ( 2 @.@ 93 km ) from MD 36 in Lonaconing north to the Garrett County line , where it continued north as <unk> – Lonaconing Road . MD 657 was designated in the late 1930s . As part of a road maintenance swap enacted in 2008 , the highway was reconstructed in 2010 , then turned over to Allegany County in 2011 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 657 began at MD 36 ( Main Street ) within the Lonaconing Historic District . The state highway headed northwest as Douglas Avenue , a two @-@ lane road with a speed limit of 15 miles per hour ( 24 km / h ) maintained by the town of Lonaconing . After passing Old Beechwood Road , MD 657 left the town of Lonaconing , becoming state @-@ maintained with a new name , Skids Hill Road . The roadway narrowed to 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) and the speed limit increased to 25 miles per hour ( 40 km / h ) as the state highway climbed toward Big Savage Mountain high above Koontz Creek . At the Garrett County line , MD 657 ended and continued north as <unk> – Lonaconing Road toward the top of the ridge . 
 = = History = = 
 Skids Hill Road was improved as a county highway by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1934 . MD 657 was designated when that county highway was brought into the state highway system in 1939 . In 2008 , the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) and Allegany County signed a road transfer agreement in which the state would take over maintenance of Messick Road and a portion of Williams Road near Cumberland . That stretch of highway became part of an extended MD 639 in 2008 . In exchange , the county would assume responsibility for the section of MD 657 outside of the town of Lonaconing . The town would continue to maintain the portion of the route within the town . The change of responsibility for MD 657 would not take place until after MDSHA reconstructed the highway , which was planned for 2010 . In March 2010 , a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) section of the state highway was damaged by a torrent of water released from an abandoned mine following several days of rainfall , requiring an emergency repair project that reduced the roadway 's width at the site from 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to 13 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) . MDSHA began its planned reconstruction of MD 657 from Old Beechwood Road to the Garrett County line , which included added retaining walls and widening the roadway , in April 2010 . The highway fully reopened in December 2010 . The official transfer of maintenance occurred and the MD 657 designation was removed in 2011 .

 = Steep Holm = 
 Steep Holm ( Welsh : Ynys <unk> , Old English : <unk> and later <unk> ) is an English island lying in the Bristol Channel . The island covers 48 @.@ 87 acres ( 19 @.@ 78 ha ) at high tide , expanding to 63 @.@ 26 acres ( 25 @.@ 60 ha ) at mean low water . At its highest point it is 78 metres ( 256 ft ) above mean sea level . It lies within the historic boundaries of Somerset and administratively forms part of North Somerset . Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996 it was administered as part of Avon . Nearby is Flat Holm island ( Welsh : Ynys Echni ) , part of Wales . 
 The Carboniferous Limestone island rises to about 200 feet ( 61 m ) and serves as a wind and wave break , sheltering the upper reaches of the Bristol Channel . The island is now uninhabited , with the exception of the wardens . It is protected as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) with a large bird population and plants including wild peonies . There was a signal station or watchtower on the island in Roman times , but there may have been human habitation as early as the Iron Age . In the 6th century it was home to St Gildas and to a small Augustinian priory in the 12th and 13th centuries . An inn was built in 1832 and used for holidays in the 19th century . A bird sanctuary was established in 1931 and since 1951 has been leased to charitable trusts . It is now owned by the Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust . 
 In the 1860s the island was fortified with ten 7 @-@ inch rifled muzzle loaders as one of the Palmerston Forts for the coastal defence of the Bristol Channel until it was abandoned in 1898 . The infrastructure was reused in World War I and II when Mark VII 6 @-@ inch breech @-@ loading guns and search lights were installed . To enable the movement of materials , soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps initially used mules and then installed a cable @-@ operated winched switchback railway . 
 = = Geology and ecology = = 
 The island is formed of Carboniferous Limestone and is often described as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down ; however , the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down . On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 degrees to the south . There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny near the end of the Carboniferous Period , 300 million years ago . 
 The island rises to about 200 feet ( 61 m ) from the surrounding sea and covers 49 acres ( 20 ha ) at high tide , whereas at low tide it expands to 63 acres ( 25 ha ) due to the tidal range of 43 feet ( 13 m ) , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada . There are many caves on the island , and pot holes up to 60 metres ( 200 ft ) deep in the surrounding sea bed that are believed to be the remnants of collapsed cave systems . The caves on the islands cliffs are at two different levels : the caves in the current inter @-@ tidal zone which are below the water table and are producing stalactites , and many others high up on the cliffs that were on the water line many thousands of years ago . 
 Steep Holm is protected as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) , notification having taken place in 1952 . There is a large bird population , particularly European herring gulls ( Larus argentatus ) and Lesser black @-@ backed gulls ( Larus fuscus ) . There has also been a small population of muntjac deer . The plateau at the top of the island has a layer of soil between 6 inches ( 150 mm ) and 12 inches ( 300 mm ) deep . It has a red colour from veins of iron in the rock and has arrived as sand particles less than 0 @.@ 0039 inches ( 0 @.@ 099 mm ) in diameter . The island is the only site in the UK on which wild peonies ( Paeonia mascula ) grow , although these have been damaged by the fungus botrytis . The wild peony was introduced to the island of Steep Holm , possibly by monks , or brought from the Mediterranean by the Romans . <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) are also common along with golden samphire , buck 's @-@ horn plantain ( Plantago <unk> ) and wild leeks ( Allium ampeloprasum ) . The only reptiles on the island are slow worms ( Anguis fragilis ) .

 = = = Prehistoric to Roman = = = 
 The earliest sign of human activity on the island are prehistoric vertebrae of red deer discovered in Five Johns ' Cave during an exploration in 1975 . Worked flints from the Mesolithic and scrapers from the Neolithic were uncovered as part of the Priory excavations carried out between 1977 and 1992 . 
 Roman remains , possibly a signal station or watchtower , have been identified on the island by an electrical resistance survey . Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II . A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 is likely to be a Celtic head from the Romano @-@ British era , but may be from the Iron Age . In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era , some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware , La Tène style broaches , and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140 AD which was made in southern Spain . There have also been shards of Castor ware . Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and possibly a bath house . Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus ( 268 – 270 ) and Tetricus I ( 271 – 273 ) have also been found . 
 = = = Religious foundations = = = 
 According to legend , first recorded by John Leland in the 16th century , Saint Gildas , the author of De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae , lived on Steep Holm during the 6th century . He arrived on Steep Holm after visiting his friend Saint Cadoc , who lived on Flat Holm as a hermit . Gildas supposedly left the island , after pirates from the Orkneys carried off his servant and furniture , to become Abbot of Glastonbury . The Vikings took refuge on Steep Holm during the summer of 914 and then carried out raids on the coast of Somerset at Watchet and Porlock , according to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . At the end of the 12th century , there was a small priory of Canons Regular of St Michael on the island . The only priory building fully excavated measured 73 feet ( 22 m ) long and 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide , with the cloisters and other structures still to be identified . The date of the original foundation of the priory is unclear ; however , in the early 13th century the patron was William I de Cantilupe . His family were also patrons of Studley Priory in Warwickshire . His grand @-@ daughter married Lord Robert de <unk> who acquired the freehold of the whole island ; however , endowments for the upkeep of the priory were declining , which led to it being abandoned between 1260 and 1265 , the monks returning to Studley Priory . A Blue Lias memorial stone from the abbey , which has a Cross of Lorraine , was found in 1867 during the fortification of the island . It was incorporated into an armoury leading to the naming of the " tombstone battery " . 
 = = = Manorial ownership = = = 
 The island seems to have been held , in association with the local manors of Uphill and Christon , by the Bek family , who granted it to Henry de Lacy , 3rd Earl of Lincoln . Although the mechanism is unclear , it next passed to the Berkeley family with Maurice de Berkeley , the second Baron Berkeley , holding it in 1315 . The site was used again by <unk> in the 14th and 15th centuries . They lived in one of the ruined priory buildings which was rebuilt . By 1453 the overlordship of the island was held by James Butler , 4th Earl of Ormond , and in 1460 the advowson was exercised by Margaret Talbot , Countess of Shrewsbury . In the years following , the ownership of a variety of estates , including Norton Beauchamp , to which Steep Holm was attached , was disputed . In the 16th century Edward Seymour , 1st Duke of Somerset took over , and then lost , large estates including Brean , to which Steep Holm was allied . The Seymour descendants recovered the estates , owning them into the 17th century , although the only activity on Steep Holm seems to have been the employment of gull watchers and fishermen . In 1684 the Norton Beauchamp estate was sold to Edward Ryder . It appears to have been auctioned by decree of the Court of Chancery 11 years later in 1695 , possibly because of difficulties in maintaining sea defenses along the Somerset coast ; however , this seems to have been disputed in the light of outstanding mortgages . In 1699 the estates , including Steep Holm , were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol , whose descendants held it for the next 130 years . Freke 's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes , who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament . During their ownership , probably around 1776 , a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen . It was built using stones from the ruined priory . In 1830 the island was sold again , according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes ; however , other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare named John Baker . 
 In 1832 the island was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House , who established an inn for sailors . The inn was run by the Harris family , using rum and tobacco bought from ships . They claimed that the island was outside the jurisdiction of the excise men until a court case in 1884 . After the Harris family , the inn was run by Mr W. L. Davies , who offered fishing , shooting and boating holidays . To make landing on the island easier , a new pier was built close to the inn . In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm . Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel . The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers , which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports . 
 = = = Palmerston Fort = = = 
 Both Steep Holm and Flat Holm were fortified in the 1860s as a defence against invasion . They form part of a line of defences , known as Palmerston Forts , built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff . The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France , where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy . The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom , under the direction of Lord Palmerston , recommended fortification of the coast , and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system . Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a lime kiln for the manufacture of lime mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores . 
 The concrete gun emplacements were called Summit Battery , Laboratory Battery , Garden Battery and Tombstone Battery . Along with the barracks they have been designated as Grade II listed buildings . The facilities installed included a master @-@ gunners house , a small inn , and a water tank holding 49 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 220 @,@ 000 l ; 59 @,@ 000 US gal ) of rainwater . The water tank is beneath the barracks and collects rainwater from its roof . The brick tank is 16 @.@ 7 metres ( 55 ft ) long , 4 @.@ 8 metres ( 16 ft ) wide and 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) high with a vaulted roof . Armaments included ten 7 @-@ inch rifled muzzle loaders Mk III spread between six batteries . These were later replaced with Armstrong 6 @-@ inch RML guns . Some of the gun batteries are scheduled monuments , and there are the remains of a centralised group of brick @-@ built barrack blocks . In 1898 test firing by HMS Arrogant , an Arrogant @-@ class cruiser , on Rudder Rock battery showed that the fixed gun emplacements used on Steep Holm and other sites were susceptible to attack by modern warships , and the site was no longer active . The military control on the island was maintained until 1908 when it was leased to James <unk> and his family . In 1927 the first test of the RAE Larynx ( from " Long Range Gun with Lynx engine " ) an early pilotless aircraft , to be used as a guided anti @-@ ship weapon , took place just off Steep Holm . 
 = = = World wars = = = 
 These facilities were updated in both World War I and World War II . From 1915 to 1919 the island was requisitioned by the Admiralty as a coastguard station . After the war the <unk> returned to carry out farming and fishing and played host to occasional tourists . In World War II , search light batteries were built on Steep Holm . In 1940 the island 's warden , Harry Cox , who had developed the island into a bird sanctuary since 1931 , was appointed as a coastguard and was supported by Local Defence Volunteers from Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . In 1940 and 1941 the battery was refortified by soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps using mules to transport guns and equipment up the steep cliffs . The armament included Mark VII 6 @-@ inch breech @-@ loading guns taken from World War I naval vessels which had been scrapped , and also included Lewis automatic machine guns against air attack . The Garden Battery was built over two Victorian stone gun emplacements . Engineers from the Royal Pioneer Corps improved the infrastructure including importing sheep to feed the soldiers and , after a case of typhoid fever , shipping drinking water from south Wales . To enable the movement of equipment , the engineers built a new jetty . This was linked to the plateau with a cable @-@ operated winched switchback railway using prefabricated 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) gauge lines which had been captured from the Germans in World War I. The Steep Holm batteries were also connected , by underwater telegraph cable , to the Brean Down Fort batteries , but parts of the cable were stolen for scrap after the end of World War II .

 In 1953 the island was leased by the Steep Holm Trust supported by four local organisations : the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society , Bristol Naturalists Society , Mid @-@ Somerset Naturalists and the Bristol Folk House Archaeological Club . They repaired some of the buildings and established a bird ringing programme . In 1974 their lease expired and was taken over by the Kenneth Allsop Memorial Trust , a charity formed in memory of the broadcaster and naturalist Kenneth Allsop . The Trust purchased the island in 1976 . The mission statement of the Trust is : " To protect , preserve and enhance for the benefit of the public the landscape , antiquities , flora , fauna , natural beauty and scientific interest of the island of Steep Holm in the County of North Somerset and to advance the education of the public in the natural sciences . " 
 Visits can be made to the island . The trust runs day @-@ long boat trips from Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . One barrack block is in use to provide visitor facilities . In 1980 the Bollywood film Shaan was set and partially filmed on the island . 
 = Algoman orogeny = 
 The Algoman orogeny , known as the Kenoran orogeny in Canada , was an episode of mountain @-@ building ( orogeny ) during the Late Archean Eon that involved repeated episodes of continental collisions , compressions and <unk> . The Superior province and the Minnesota River Valley terrane collided about 2 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 500 million years ago . The collision folded the Earth 's crust and produced enough heat and pressure to metamorphose the rock . Blocks were added to the Superior province along a 1 @,@ 200 km ( 750 mi ) boundary that stretches from present @-@ day eastern South Dakota into the Lake Huron area . The Algoman orogeny brought the <unk> Eon to a close , about 2 @,@ 500 million years ago ; it lasted less than 100 million years and marks a major change in the development of the earth ’ s crust . 
 The Canadian shield contains belts of metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks formed by the action of metamorphism on volcanic and sedimentary rock . The areas between individual belts consist of granites or granitic gneisses that form fault zones . These two types of belts can be seen in the Wabigoon , Quetico and Wawa subprovinces ; the Wabigoon and Wawa are of volcanic origin and the Quetico is of sedimentary origin . These three subprovinces lie linearly in <unk> to northeastern @-@ oriented belts about 140 km ( 90 mi ) wide on the southern portion of the Superior Province . 
 The Slave province and portions of the Nain province were also affected . Between about 2 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 700 million years ago these combined with the Sask and Wyoming cratons to form the first supercontinent , the <unk> supercontinent . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Through most of the Archean Eon , the Earth had a heat production at least twice that of the present , which caused tectonic processes to be more active . As a result , plates and continents were smaller . No broad blocks as old as 3 Ga are found in Precambrian shields . Toward the end of the Archean , however , some of these blocks or terranes came together to form larger blocks welded together by greenstone belts . 
 Two such terranes that now form part of the Canadian shield collided about 2 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 500 million years ago . These were the Superior province and the large Minnesota River Valley terrane , the former composed mainly of granite and the latter of gneiss . This led to the mountain @-@ building episode known as the Algoman orogeny in the U. S. ( named for Algoma , <unk> County , Wisconsin ) , and the Kenoran orogeny in Canada . Its duration is estimated at 50 to 100 million years . The current boundary between these terranes is known as the Great Lakes tectonic zone ( GLTZ ) . This zone is 50 km ( 30 mi ) wide and extends in a line roughly 1 @,@ 200 kilometers long from the middle of South Dakota , east through the middle of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan , into the Sudbury , Ontario region . The region remains slightly active today . Rifting in the GLTZ began about 2 @,@ 500 million years ago at the end of the Algoman orogeny . 
 The orogeny affected adjacent regions of northern Minnesota and Ontario in the Superior province as well as the Slave and the eastern part of the Nain province , a far wider region of influence than in subsequent <unk> . It is the earliest datable orogeny in North America and brought the Archean Eon to a close . The end of the Archean Eon marks a major change in the development of the Earth ’ s crust : the crust was essentially formed and achieved thicknesses of about 40 km ( 25 mi ) under the continents . 
 = = Tectonics = = 
 The collision between terranes folded the Earth 's crust , and produced enough heat and pressure to metamorphose then @-@ existing rock . Repeated continental collisions , compression along a north @-@ south axis , and subduction resulted in the uprising of the Algoman Mountains . This was followed by intrusions of granite plutons and <unk> domes within the gneisses about 2 @,@ 700 million years ago ; two examples are the Sacred Heart granite of southwestern Minnesota and the Watersmeet Domes <unk> ( metamorphosed gabbros ) that straddle the border of Wisconsin and Michigan 's Upper Peninsula . After the intrusions solidified , new stresses on the greenstone belt caused movement horizontally along several faults and moved huge blocks of the crust vertically relative to adjacent blocks . This combination of folding , intrusion and faulting built mountain ranges throughout northern Minnesota , northern Wisconsin , Michigan 's Upper Peninsula and southernmost Ontario . Igneous and high @-@ grade metamorphic rocks are associated with the orogeny . 
 By extrapolating the now @-@ eroded and tilted beds upward , geologists have determined that these mountains were several kilometers high . Similar projections of the tilted beds downward , coupled with geophysical measurements on the greenstone belts in Canada , suggest the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the belts project downward at least a few kilometers . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The action of metamorphism on the border between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts . Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts ; the green color comes from minerals , such as chlorite , <unk> and <unk> that formed during metamorphism . After metamorphism occurred , these rocks were folded and faulted into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny . 
 The volcanic beds are 8 to 9 km ( 26 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 ft ) thick . About 2 @,@ 700 million years ago the greenstone belt was subjected to new stresses that caused movement along several faults . Faulting on both small and large scales is typical of greenstone belt deformation . These faults show both vertical and horizontal movement relative to adjacent blocks . Large @-@ scale faults typically occur along the margins of the greenstone belts where they are in contact with enclosed granitic rocks . Vertical movement may be thousands of meters and horizontal movements of many kilometers occur along some fault zones . 
 Some time before 2 @,@ 600 million years ago , masses of magma intruded under and within the igneous and sedimentary rocks , heating and pressing the rocks to metamorphose them into hard greenish greenstones . They began with fissure eruptions of basalt , continued with intermediate and felsic rocks erupted from volcanic centers and ended with deposition of sediments from the erosion of the volcanic pile . The rising magma was extruded under a shallow ancient sea where it cooled to form <unk> greenstones . Some of Minnesota ’ s pillows probably cooled at depths as great as 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) and contain no gas cavities or <unk> . 
 Most greenstone belts , with all of their components , have been folded into <unk> synclines ; the original basaltic rock , which was on the bottom , occurs on the outer margins of the trough . The overlying , younger rock units – rhyolites and greywackes – occur closer to the center of the syncline . The rocks are so intensely folded that most have been tilted nearly 90 ° , with the tops of layers on one side of the synclinal belt facing those on the other side ; the rock sequences are in effect lying on their sides . The folding can be so complex that a single layer may be exposed at the surface many times by subsequent erosion . 
 = = = Volcanic activity = = = 
 As the greenstone belts were forming , volcanoes ejected tephra into the air which settled as sediments to become compacted into the greywackes and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake Vermilion formations . <unk> are poorly sorted mixtures of clay , mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris ; the presence of this debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier . The volcanism took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths . Numerous earthquakes accompanied the volcanism and faulting . 
 = = Superior province = = 
 The Superior province forms the core of both the North American continent and the Canadian shield , and has a thickness of at least 250 km ( 160 mi ) . Its granites date from 2 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 500 million years ago . It was formed by the welding together of many small terranes , the ages of which decrease away from the nucleus . This progression is illustrated by the age of the Wabigoon , Quetico and Wawa subprovinces , discussed in their individual sections . Later terranes docked on the periphery of continental masses with <unk> developing between the fused nuclei and oceanic crust . In general the Superior province consists of east @-@ west trending belts of predominately volcanic rocks alternating with belts of sedimentary and <unk> rocks . 
 Due to down warping along elongate zones , each belt is essentially a large <unk> or <unk> block . The areas between individual belts are fault zones consisting of granite or granitic gneiss . Its western part contains a regional pattern of east @-@ west trending 100 to 200 km ( 60 to 120 mi ) wide granitic greenstone and metasedimentary belts ( subprovinces ) . Western Superior province 's mantle has remained intact since the 2 @,@ 700 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ ago accretion of the subprovinces . 
 Both folding and faulting can be seen in the Wabigoon , Quetico and Wawa subprovinces . These three subprovinces lie linearly in <unk> to northeastern @-@ oriented belts of about 140 km ( 90 mi ) wide ( see figure on right ) . The northernmost and widest province is the Wabigoon . It begins in north @-@ central Minnesota and continues northeasterly into central Ontario ; it is partially interrupted by the Southern province . Immediately to the south , the Quetico subprovince extends as far west in north @-@ central Minnesota , and extends further to the northeast . It is completely interrupted by a narrow band of the <unk> to 1 @,@ 550 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Southern province to the northeast of Thunder Bay . The Wawa subprovince is the most southerly of the three ; it begins in central Minnesota , continues northeast to Thunder Bay , Ontario , Canada , ( where its southern border just skims north Thunder Bay ) and then extends east beyond Lake Superior . The northern boundary continues in a roughly northeasterly heading , while the southern border dips south to follow the northeast shore of Lake Superior . 
 = = = Fault zones = = = 
 The three subprovinces are separated by steeply dipping shear zones caused by continued compression that occurred during the Algoman orogeny . These boundaries are major fault zones . 
 The boundary between the Wabigoon and Quetico subprovinces seems to have been also controlled by colliding plates and subsequent <unk> . This Rainy Lake – Seine River fault zone is a major northeast @-@ southwest trending strike @-@ slip fault zone ; it trends <unk> ° E to cut through the northwest part of Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota and extends westward to near International Falls , Minnesota and Fort Frances , Ontario . The fault has transported rocks in the greenstone belt a considerable distance from their origin . The greenstone belt is 2 to 3 km ( 0 to 0 mi ) wide at the Seven Sisters Islands ; to the west the greenstone <unk> with pods of anorthositic gabbro . Radiometric dating from the Rainy Lake area in Ontario show an age of about 2 @,@ 700 million years old , which favors a moving tectonic plate model for the formation of the boundary . 
 The largest fault is the Vermilion fault separating the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces . It has a <unk> ° E trend and was caused by the introduction of masses of magma . The Vermilion fault can be traced westward to North Dakota . It has had a 19 km ( 12 mi ) horizontal movement with the northern block moving eastward and upward relative to the southern block . The junction between the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces has a zone of biotite @-@ rich migmatite , a rock that has characteristics of both igneous and metamorphic processes ; this indicates a zone of partial melting which is possible only under high temperature and pressure conditions . It is visible as a 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) wide belt . Most of the flattened large crystals in the fault indicate a simple compression rather than a wrenching , shearing or rotational event as the two subprovinces docked . This provides evidence that the Quetico and Wawa subprovinces were joined by the collision of two continental plates , about 2 @,@ 690 million years ago . Structures in the migmatite include folds and foliations ; the foliations cut across both limbs of earlier @-@ phase folds . These cross @-@ cutting foliations indicate that the migmatite has undergone at least two periods of ductile deformation . 
 = = = Wabigoon subprovince = = = 
 The Wabigoon subprovince is a formerly active volcanic island chain , made up of metavolcanic @-@ metasedimentary intrusions . These metamorphosed rocks are volcanically derived greenstone belts , and are surrounded and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths . The subprovince 's greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics , felsic batholiths and felsic plutons aged from 3 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 670 million years old . 
 = = = Quetico subprovince = = = 
 The Quetico gneiss belt extends some 970 km ( 600 mi ) across Ontario and parts of Minnesota . The dominant rocks within the belt are schists and gneisses produced by intense metamorphism of greywackes and minor amounts of other sedimentary rocks . The sediments , alkalic plutons and felsic plutons are aged from 2 @,@ 690 to 2 @,@ 680 million years . The metamorphism is relatively low @-@ grade on the margins and high @-@ grade in the center . The low @-@ grade components of the greywackes were derived primarily from volcanic rocks ; the high @-@ grade rocks are coarser @-@ grained and contain minerals that reflect higher temperatures . The granitic intrusions within the high @-@ grade metasediments were produced by subduction of the ocean crust and partial melting of metasedimentary rocks . Immediately south of Voyageurs National Park and extending to the Vermilion fault is a broad transition zone that contains migmatite . 
 The Quetico gneiss belt represents an accretionary wedge that formed in a trench during the collision of several island arcs ( greenstone belts ) . Boundaries between the gneiss belt and the flanking greenstone belts to the north and south are major fault zones , the Vermilion and Rainy Lake – Seine River fault zones . 
 = = = Wawa subprovince = = = 
 The Wawa subprovince is a formerly active volcanic island chain , consisting of metamorphosed greenstone belts which are surrounded by and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths . These greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics , felsic batholiths , felsic plutons and sediments aged from 2 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 670 million years old . 
 The predominate rock type is a white , coarse @-@ grained , foliated hornblende tonalite . Minerals in the tonalite are quartz , plagioclase , alkali feldspar and hornblende . 
 = = Slave province = = 
 In extensive regions of the Slave province of northern Canada , the magma that later became batholiths heated the surrounding rock to create metamorphic regions called aureoles about 2 @,@ 575 million years ago . These regions are typically 10 to 15 km ( 6 to 9 mi ) wide . The creation of aureoles was a continuous process , but three recognizable metamorphic phases can be correlated with established <unk> phases . The cycle began with a deformation phase unaccompanied by metamorphism . This evolved into the second phase accompanied by broad regional metamorphism as thermal <unk> began . With continued <unk> of the isotherms , the third phase produced minor folding but caused major metamorphic recrystallization , resulting in the emplacement of granite at the core of the thermal dome . This phase occurred at lower pressure because of erosional unloading , but the temperatures were more extreme , ranging up to about 700 ° C ( 1 @,@ 300 ° F ) . With deformation complete , the thermal dome decayed ; minor mineralogical changes occurred during this decay phase . The region has since been effectively stable . 
 Geochronology of several Archean rock units establishes a sequence of events , approximately 75 million years in duration , leading to the formation of a new crustal segment . The oldest rocks , at 2 @,@ 650 million years old , are basic <unk> with largely calc @-@ alkaline characteristics . Radiometric dating indicates ages of 2 @,@ 640 to 2 @,@ 620 million years are recorded for the syn @-@ kinematic quartz diorite batholiths and 2 @,@ 590 to 2 @,@ 100 million years for the major late @-@ kinematic bodies . <unk> <unk> , at 2 @,@ 575 ± 25 million years , are the youngest plutonic units . 
 <unk> and <unk> from two areas traversing one of these aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied . Most of the Slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks . Isotopic ages of these rocks is around 2 @,@ 500 million years ago , the time of the Kenoran orogeny . Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism , intrusion and basement <unk> typical of Archean terranes . <unk> , <unk> intrusive and <unk> metamorphic rocks show <unk> and compositional banding ; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little <unk> exists . Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded ( <unk> ) or occur in plunging anticlines . 
 = = Nain province = = 
 The Archean rocks forming the Nain province of northeastern Canada and Greenland are separated from the Superior terrane by a narrow band of <unk> rocks . Greenland separated from North America less than 100 million years ago and its Precambrian terranes align with Canada 's on the opposite side of Baffin Bay . The southern tip of Greenland is part of the Nain Province , this means it was connected to North America at the end of the Kenoran <unk> . 
 = Stroudwater Navigation = 
 The Stroudwater Navigation is a canal which linked Stroud to the Severn Estuary in England and Wales . It was authorised in 1776 , although part had already been built , as the proprietors believed that an Act of Parliament obtained in 1730 gave them the necessary powers . Opened in 1779 , it was a commercial success , its main cargo being coal . It was 8 miles ( 13 km ) in length and had a rise of 102 feet 5 inches ( 31 @.@ 22 m ) through 12 locks . Following the opening of the Thames and Severn Canal in 1789 , it formed part of a through route from Bristol to London , although much of its trade vanished when the Kennet and Avon Canal provided a more direct route in 1810 . Despite competition from the railways , the canal continued to pay dividends to shareholders until 1922 , and was not finally abandoned until 1954 . 
 Even before its closure , there was interest in retaining the canal for its amenity value . The Stroudwater Canal Society , which later became the Cotswold Canals Trust , was formed in 1972 . Following initial hostility from the Proprietors , who had not been stripped of their powers when the canal had closed , agreement was reached and work began on restoration of the waterway . The project gained popularity , and in 2003 , a bid was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund for £ 82 million to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal . The project had to be split into smaller parts , and only the first phase has so far been funded in this way , when a grant of £ 11 @.@ 9 million was confirmed in 2006 . With match funding , this was to enable the section from ' The Ocean ' at Stonehouse to Wallbridge to be reopened , together with the Wallbridge to Brimscombe Port section of the Thames and Severn . 
 A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the connection from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007 . This section presents some engineering challenges , as it was severed by the construction of the M5 motorway and the A38 road . The roundabout where the A38 joins the <unk> road was built over Bristol Road Lock , and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome . At Stonehouse , the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway has been replaced by a culvert , but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board for its reinstatement , and to create a long @-@ distance footpath along the route . Outside of the main restoration , the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures , with the ultimate goal of re @-@ opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The first plans for making the small River Frome , also known as the Stroudwater , navigable date back to the last three years of the 17th century . The plan was to serve the woollen industry , by carrying coal from the Severn to Stroud and transporting the finished cloth away to markets , but it was opposed by mill owners , and it came to nothing . The idea was revived in 1728 , when John Hore , who had previously succeeded in making the River Kennett navigable , suggested a canal around 8 @.@ 2 miles ( 13 @.@ 2 km ) long , with 12 locks , suitable for 60 @-@ ton barges . An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1730 , with support from those who worked in the cloth industry , but opposition from some of the millers , but it seemed to ignore Hore 's recommendations , in that it was again based on making the river navigable . As the millers were given powers which would have effectively shut the navigation for two months each year , and the tolls were set at a level which would have discouraged traffic , no further action was taken . 
 John <unk> , who had been appointed as a commissioner under the 1730 Act , commissioned the engineer Thomas Yeoman to make a new survey in 1754 , and his new plan was published the following year . It was for a navigation from Wallbridge to the Severn , estimated to cost £ 8 @,@ 145 , which would require 16 locks and four <unk> ( which were probably half @-@ locks or <unk> ) . In order to placate the millers , water for the operation of the locks would be provided by a reservoir below Wallbridge , which would cover 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 8 ha ) and be filled on Sundays , when the mills were inactive and would not be needing the water . Tolls were set at a more realistic level . While support and finance for the scheme were being gained , John Kemmett , Arthur <unk> , James <unk> and Thomas Bridge devised a scheme which used cranes at each mill weir to transfer cargo , stored in boxes , from a boat on one level to another on the other side of the weir . An Act was obtained in 1759 which authorized Kemmett and the others to construct the canal without any locks to avoid loss of water to the mills . The Act allowed two years for completion of the scheme , and although some progress had been made by April 1761 , Kemmett was given an extension of six years at that time . After about 5 miles ( 8 km ) of river had been improved , the works were abandoned as being too costly . 
 By 1774 , canal building was much better understood , and a new attempt was made . The plan was led by <unk> 's son William , who asked Thomas Dadford , Jr . , the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy , who had been the engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction , to carry out a survey . The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills , was put at £ 16 @,@ 750 , and soon £ 20 @,@ 000 had been raised . Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament , since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid , Yeoman , who had carried out the 1754 survey , was asked to survey the route again , and a route was selected , which would require 12 locks . Work started , with Samuel Jones as engineer , but he was replaced by Priddy within a month . A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775 . An injunction was obtained , and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work . A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776 , authorising the raising of £ 20 @,@ 000 and an extra £ 10 @,@ 000 if required . Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes . 
 Work resumed under the supervision of Priddy , but he was soon replaced by Edmund Lingard , who had been the engineer for the Coventry Canal . The canal was opened in stages as it was completed . It reached Chippenham Platt at the end of 1777 , Ryeford in January 1779 , and it was open throughout to the Wallbridge terminus on 21 July 1779 . It had cost £ 40 @,@ 930 , which had been raised by calling £ 150 on each £ 100 share , by borrowing money from the shareholders , by running up debts , and by using the tolls from the parts of the canal which were already open . Traffic was around 16 @,@ 000 tons per year , which enabled the company to repay the debts and to declare a first dividend of five per cent in 1786 . 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 The locks were suitably sized for Severn <unk> , which were 72 by 15 @.@ 5 feet ( 21 @.@ 9 by 4 @.@ 7 m ) , and could carry 60 tons . The canal was not provided with a towing path for horses . Some boats sailed along the canal , but most were bow @-@ hauled by men . Framilode lock at the entrance to the canal was a tide lock , with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide . When a vessel arrived at the junction , a rope would be taken from it to the shore , and attached to a capstan , which would then be used to haul the boat into the lock . Once the canal was open , the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities , and a number of warehouses were built . Many of the shareholders were also involved with the Thames and Severn Canal scheme , which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the River Thames at Lechlade . The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway ; pleasure boats were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of £ 1 ( 2012 : £ 109 @.@ 00 ) for the use of each lock . 
 The main cargo carried was coal . In 1788 , a group of shareholders set up a coal committee , and began trading . At first , the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields , travelling via the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal , or from the Shropshire coalfields , but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the Forest of Dean . This profitable business continued until 1833 . Boats that worked the canal included Severn <unk> , a type of sailing boat which was fitted with ketch , cutter or sloop rigging . Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts , but none are known to have survived to the present day . 
 In 1794 , a basin was built above Framilode lock , so that vessels could wait there until the tide in the Severn was at a suitable level . This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company , but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive . They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built , and the canal was the only part of the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did not have one . It was completed in August 1827 . The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul , and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction , to ensure neither company lost water to the other . The new company paid for its construction . > After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827 , the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less , although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route . 
 Traffic , receipts and dividends steadily increased . Tolls rose from £ 1 @,@ 468 in 1779 to £ 6 @,@ 807 in 1821 . The first dividend of 3 @.@ 75 per cent was paid in 1786 , and had reached 15 @.@ 78 per cent by 1821 . Figures for tonnage are not available for the early years , but were 79 @,@ 359 tons in 1821 . There was a dip in the carriage of merchandise in 1810 , when the Kennet and Avon Canal opened and provided a more convenient route from Bristol to London , but it picked up again after 1819 , when the North Wilts Canal opened , providing a link from <unk> to Abingdon via Swindon and the Wilts and Berks Canal , which was easier than using the Thames . The highest dividend paid was in 1833 , when shareholders received 26 @.@ 33 per cent , after which receipts and dividends steadily dropped . In 1859 in order to allow the passage of a coal barge called the Queen Esther two of the locks were widened . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 The first threat from a railway came in 1825 , when there was a proposal for a line from Framilode Passage to Brimscombe Port . The canal tolls were reduced as a bargaining tool , but the promoters went ahead with their bill . The Stroudwater Company opposed it and it was defeated in Parliament . The Great Western Railway opened a line from Swindon to Gloucester in 1845 , which passed through Stroud , but the effects on the canal were rather less than the effects on the Thames and Severn . However , in 1863 the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway Act was passed , allowing the construction of a railway from Stonehouse to Dudbridge and Nailsworth that directly competed with the canal . Dividends fell below 5 per cent after 1880 although they did not cease entirely until 1922 . Around the same time the connection to the Severn at Framilode became blocked leaving the connection to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as the only link between the canal and the River Severn . The last toll was paid in 1941 , and most of the canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament granted in 1954 . Although this removed the need to maintain the waterway for navigation , the Company of Proprietors was not disbanded , and retained most of their other powers . It consists of those who now own the original shares , although over half of the shares were transferred to a Trust in the 1950s , which prevents hostile takeovers and ensures that the company will always be run for the benefit of the communities through which the canal passes . After the closure of the canal the canal company continued to generate income for many years through the sale of water and some monies produced by property holdings . 
 = = Restoration = = 
 Interest in maintaining the canal for its amenity value began before the canal closed , with the Inland Waterways Association mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952 . They were already formulating plans for the revival of the Thames and Severn Canal , which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn . The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954 , but it was closed nevertheless . 
 The publication in 1972 of Lost Canals of England and Wales , a book by Ronald Russell , resulted in a number of canal restoration societies being formed . The Stroudwater Canal Society was one of them , which was renamed the Stroudwater , Thames and Severn Canal Trust in April 1975 as the scope of the project expanded , and became the Cotswold Canals Trust in July 1990 . Although the Proprietors were initially hostile to the Trust , attitudes changed , and in 1979 granted them permission to start work on the section from Pike Mill Bridge to Ryeford , so that a trip @-@ boat could be used on it . As attitudes changed , the Proprietors bought back sections of the waterway which had previously been sold off . 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 In 2001 , the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established , drawing together people representing the Proprietors , the Cotswold Canals Trust , councils at district and county level , and a number of other interested parties . This provided a suitable structure to drive the restoration forwards . In 2002 , the waterway was identified as being of high priority in the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain 's Inland Navigation Network , and was one of several new projects highlighted at British Waterways ' Unlocked and Unlimited conference held in March . The estimated cost of the project to restore both the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal was £ 82 million . 
 Having raised £ 100 @,@ 000 , the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged the money with the Waterways Trust , in the hope that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received . Andy Stumpf became the full @-@ time Regeneration Programme Manager , working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund ( HLF ) to finance the restoration , and the canal was visited by Charles , Prince of Wales , in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust . A Heritage Survey , which cost £ 60 @,@ 000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association , was carried out , as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy , costing another £ 30 @,@ 000 , all of which were pre @-@ requisites for the main HLF bid . By the time the bid was ready for submission , the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had , and asked British Waterways , who were heading up the application , to break the bid and the project into smaller phases . At the end of 2003 , a provisional grant of £ 11 @.@ 3 million was awarded by the HLF , to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge , and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port . An additional £ 2 @.@ 9 million was received from the European Inter @-@ Regional budget for this first phase . By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006 , it had risen to £ 11 @.@ 9 million , and a further £ 6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency . 
 As part of the process , the Proprietors leased the canal to British Waterways in 2005 . However , British Waterways had to withdraw from the scheme in 2008 , due to financial difficulties , and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council . Following the re @-@ organisation , the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009 . It is a limited company , with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council , the Proprietors , and the Cotswold Canals Trust . Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals , and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax does not have to be paid . The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re @-@ opened . The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed , and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £ 1 @.@ 5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board . This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge . A second application for £ 650 @,@ 000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created . The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to <unk> . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The length being restored in the first phase is around 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) long , and presents some of the biggest difficulties to restoration in the whole 36 @-@ mile ( 58 km ) route . Through Dudbridge , the channel has been used as part of a flood relief scheme by the Environment Agency . Water from the <unk> Brook , which is culverted beneath Stroud , joins the Thames and Severn Canal a short distance above Lower Wallbridge Lock , the first on that canal , while the <unk> Stream joins above the Dudbridge locks , and the <unk> Brook joins between the two locks . The top gates of the locks were replaced with concrete dams , which maintained the water level at normal flows around 3 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 @.@ 0 m ) lower than the navigable levels . Below the <unk> Dudbridge Road bridge , the water was discharged into the River Frome . As a consequence of its flood relief function , the channel here is classified as a " main river " . Designs for reinstatement of the canal have had to accommodate large flows on this section , and include underground <unk> culverts , capable of carrying the full flood flow of all three streams . A new weir which carries a towpath bridge has been constructed where the water leaves the canal to enter the River Frome , and a set of floodgates has been constructed beyond the weir , to protect the canal from high water levels . 
 The second phase of the restoration project will be the section from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul , which has been blocked by both the M5 motorway and the A38 road . A bid was submitted to the Living Landmarks Fund in August 2006 . This is part of the Big Lottery Fund , and £ 16 million was requested . An interim award of £ 250 @,@ 000 was made , to allow the bid to be developed , but the application was rejected in November 2007 . Despite this setback , money for purchasing the land around the M5 and the A38 was part of the phase 1 grant by the HLF . Current proposals for the A38 involve tunnelling under the <unk> roundabout . The original Bristol Road Lock was buried by the construction of the roundabout , and will be reconstructed to the east of it . There are two proposals for passing under the M5 motorway . One is for a new channel alongside the River Frome through an existing culvert , and the other is for a new wider culvert , nearer to the original line of the canal . Below this , the canal used to cross the River Frome at <unk> Aqueduct , but this was demolished in the 1970s , when the canal and river channel were combined as part of a flood defence scheme . 
 In November 2007 work started to clear the canal between Ryeford Double Lock and Oil Mills Bridge . Oil Mills Bridge itself has been rebuilt , with the brickwork left after its demolition being incorporated into the new bridge . By mid @-@ 2012 , when the Inland Waterways Association held a <unk> festival on the refurbished canal , as part of an event called " Stroud on Water " , over 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of canal from Ocean <unk> to the bottom of Dudbridge Locks were open for navigation , as was a second section from the top of the locks to the bottom of Wallbridge Locks on the Thames and Severn Canal . As part of the restoration of the Dudbridge Locks , a hydro @-@ electric installation has been built . The scheme is expected to generate over 100 MWh per year , and income from the sale of the electricity to the national grid will help to fund ongoing maintenance of the canal . 
 In early 2016 , work began on a £ 210 @,@ 000 project to restore Junction Lock at Saul , after a grant of £ 75 @,@ 000 was received from the Heritage Lottery Fund . The lock will not be made navigable , as the canal if infilled beyond the bottom gates , but new lock gates will be fitted , interpretation signs erected , and access will be improved . The structure was on the English Heritage " Buildings at Risk " register prior to work starting .

The rally was led by Jon Stewart , host of the satirical news program The Daily Show , and Stephen Colbert , in @-@ character as a conservative political pundit . About 215 @,@ 000 people attended the rally , according to aerial photography analysis by <unk> for CBS News . 
 The rally was a combination of what initially were announced as separate events : Stewart 's " Rally to Restore Sanity " and Colbert 's counterpart , the " March to Keep Fear Alive . " Its stated purpose was to provide a venue for attendees to be heard above what Stewart described as the more vocal and extreme 15 – 20 % of Americans who " control the conversation " of American politics , the argument being that these extremes demonize each other and engage in counterproductive actions , with a return to sanity intended to promote reasoned discussion . Despite Stewart 's insistence to the contrary , news reports cast the rally as a spoof of Glenn Beck 's Restoring Honor rally and Al Sharpton 's Reclaim the Dream rally .

 On August 28 , 2010 , the Fox News Channel 's Glenn Beck held a " Restoring Honor " rally at the Lincoln Memorial . On the same day , Al Sharpton led a countermarch , called Reclaim the Dream , to mark the 47th anniversary of the historic Great March on Washington . According to New York Magazine , discussion for a satirical public event in response took place behind the scenes at Stewart 's The Daily Show as early as August 12 . Stewart has stated that the rally was never intended to be a means to counter Glenn Beck , but was simply another format for his and Colbert 's style of humor , saying " We saw [ the Restoring Honor rally ] and thought , ' What a beautiful outline . What a beautiful structure to fill with what we want to express in live form , festival form . ' " Before any public discussion by Stewart , Colbert , or their staffs , members of the social news website Reddit independently began to discuss the possibility of a Colbert @-@ led rally , often referred to as a " Restoring Truthiness Rally " ; after the rallies were announced , some news articles credited Reddit for the idea . The rally was produced by Stewart 's Busboy Productions . 
 = = = Announcement = = = 
 Stewart first hinted at the event on the September 7 episode of The Daily Show by declaring that " [ he would ] have an announcement sometime in the near to not so near future . " Colbert , in that night 's episode of The Report , said that he , too , had an announcement to make . In the following days , Stewart and Colbert used their shows to hype their respective announcements , competing over whose would be more significant . The banter finally culminated with Stewart formally announcing the " Rally to Restore Sanity " on the September 16 , 2010 episode of The Daily Show ; Colbert followed by announcing the " March to Keep Fear Alive " on the subsequent episode of The Colbert Report . 
 Stewart declared that his rally was intended for the majority of Americans , " the 70 – 80 <unk> , " who do not hold extreme political views and lack a voice in the media . To illustrate the point , he unveiled a mock motto for the rally : " Take it down a notch for America . " A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as " I disagree with you , but I 'm pretty sure you 're not Hitler . " Colbert responded to Stewart 's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart 's rally and justifying his own " March to Keep Fear Alive . " Noting that this was not the time to be reasonable , Colbert declared , " Now is the time for all good men to freak out for freedom ! " 
 Oprah Winfrey appeared on The Daily Show via video on October 14 , 2010 , to award the attending audience free airfare to the rally . The plane tickets were hidden under the audience members ' seats in the same fashion as she has given away prizes to her own audience members on The Oprah Winfrey Show . In the episode of the Colbert Report airing immediately afterward , Stephen Colbert also offered tickets to his rally . Without Oprah 's support to provide airfare , Colbert instead distributed vouchers for the low @-@ cost Chinatown bus from New York to Washington , D.C. During the show , Colbert also revealed to Stewart that he did not possess a permit to legally organize the " March to Keep Fear Alive , " leading Stewart to propose combining the two events into the " Rally to Restore Sanity and / or Fear " that would feature a new combined logo .

 In the night following the announcement , the pledged number of attendees to the event reached 69 @,@ 000 on Facebook . This number far exceeded the 25 @,@ 000 that the rally organizers had indicated as the estimated number of attendees on the National Park Service application for a rally permit . The demand for hotels during the period of the Rally to Restore Sanity and / or Fear outpaced that of the " Restoring Honor " rally . The rally spawned several grassroots websites and Facebook groups for organizing and discussion , some with more than 10 @,@ 000 followers . Proposals were made for dozens of sister rallies in other major cities , such as Seattle , Chicago , Austin , and Los Angeles to take place on the same day as the demonstration in Washington , D.C. On September 28 , Arianna Huffington announced on The Daily Show that The Huffington Post would provide " as many buses as people to fill them " at a specified meeting place in Manhattan , although her plans were later scaled back and <unk> was imposed . 
 The Wall Street Journal characterized the Rally as a " send @-@ up " of the Washington Restoring Honor rally led by Glenn Beck and the " Reclaim the Dream " commemorative march led by Al Sharpton on August 28 , 2010 . The Canadian Press called the Stewart / Colbert rallies a " not @-@ so @-@ gentle " swipe at Glenn Beck 's " Restoring Honor " rally . During a town hall event on September 29 , President Obama cited the forthcoming rally as representing those people who are concerned with more than just the political beliefs of others , in contrast to " provocative " cable news programs . 
 Many news organizations sought media credentials to cover the rally . Anticipating staff interest in attending for non @-@ professional purposes , NPR barred staffers from attending the rally in a memo that stated : " NPR journalists may not participate in marches and rallies involving causes or issues that NPR covers , nor should they sign petitions or otherwise lend their name to such causes , or contribute money to them . This restriction applies to the upcoming Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert rallies . " NBC and several other media outlets followed suit . Some barred employees from attending the rally outright , while others such as The Washington Post offered more latitude , telling newsroom managers to differentiate between " participating " and " observing . " 
 = = = Charity drive = = = 
 Prior to the announcement of the joint rally , supporters of the movement for a Colbert @-@ led march had begun a drive to raise money for educational charities through <unk> , a charitable organization of which Colbert is a member of the Board of Directors . In the first 24 hours , supporters raised over $ 100 @,@ 000 . In the days that followed , that total increased to over $ 250 @,@ 000 , and by the day of the rally over $ 500 @,@ 000 had been contributed . Jon Stewart promoted the Trust for the National Mall , urging his viewers to make donations on behalf of the rally . As of October 31 , 2010 , over $ 188 @,@ 000 had been donated to the Trust .

 As the number of expected participants grew , the rally was moved from the grounds of the Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol . The stage was on the east side of the rally with an open back , allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances . In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit , the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections , with access aisles lined by portable fences . Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage . 
 Portable toilets and first aid stations were also provided . Because the rally was held the day before the previously scheduled Marine Corps Marathon , the rally planners originally requested to share the portable toilets planned for the marathon runners . The marathon organizers refused , so a second set of portable toilets was ordered . 
 = = = Guests = = = 
 While both Colbert and Stewart were tight @-@ lipped as to the event 's schedule and guests , Metromix 's Washington DC website published a tentative schedule on October 27 , with guest performers said to be confirmed for the event including musicians Sheryl Crow , The Roots and Jeff Tweedy with Mavis Staples along with actors Don Novello ( appearing as Father Guido <unk> ) and Sam Waterston . Other guests included <unk> , Yusuf Islam – formerly known as Cat Stevens , Ozzy Osbourne , The O 'Jays , John Legend , Kid Rock , Tony Bennett , Mythbusters hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman , basketball player Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , and R2 @-@ D2 . 
 = = = Comedy = = = 
 Satirical comedy was woven throughout the rally with Colbert expressing , in parody , that fear was superior to Stewart 's reasonableness . The theme started with Colbert — costumed like Evel Knievel — emerging from his " fear bunker " in a capsule reminiscent of the 2010 Chilean miners ' rescue . Thereafter , Colbert challenged Stewart point by point , usually claiming victory . 
 One of their battles centered around songs about trains . Stewart started with Yusuf Islam singing " Peace Train , " which was interrupted continually by Colbert @-@ backed Ozzy Osbourne singing " Crazy Train . " The audience held up peace signs for " Peace Train " and horn signs for " Crazy Train . " Finally , Stewart and Colbert compromised singing " Love Train " with The O 'Jays . 
 Later , Stewart and Colbert donned matching American flag coats and sang an original song " The Greatest , Strongest Country in the World " with lyrics that reflected common liberal and conservative stereotypes , such as " I love NASCAR halftime shows with tons of TNT . ... My hybrid electric scooter does 100 m @-@ p @-@ g . From gay men who like football ... to straight men who like Glee ... " 
 In the finale , a giant papier @-@ mâché puppet of Colbert ( " <unk> " ) was brought on stage to symbolize his superiority . Peter Pan — played by John Oliver — then appeared and led the crowd in a chant that caused Colbert and his puppet to melt into the stage , thereby handing final victory to Stewart . 
 = = = Medals = = = 
 Stewart gave out " Medals of <unk> " cast in bronze with an image of an owl and the Latin motto Sit vis <unk> , liberally translated by Stewart as " May the Force be with you , " to : 
 Armando Galarraga for his calm response to the blown call that cost him a perfect game . 
 Mick Foley for his contributions outside of wrestling , including his defense of a child mocked for being seen as gay . 
 Velma Hart for her reasoned critical questions delivered to President Barack Obama at a town hall . 
 Jacob Isom for preventing an evangelist from burning a Qur 'an . 
 Colbert awarded " Medals of Fear " cast with an image of a naked man running with scissors and the Latin motto Cave ne cadmium sit , which Colbert translated as " Warning : May contain Cadmium , " to : 
 Several news media outlets , collectively , for barring employees from attending the rally on their own time . 
 A " tight black T @-@ shirt " that Colbert said belonged to CNN 's Anderson Cooper , for always appearing during natural disasters reported on by Cooper . 
 Mark Zuckerberg for making Facebook increase fear with regard to Internet privacy . 
 Zuckerberg 's award was presented in absentia . The media outlets ' award was accepted on their behalf by " someone with more courage — a seven @-@ year @-@ old girl . " Also , videotaped messages were shown of Steven Slater , known from the 2010 JetBlue flight attendant incident , and reality TV star Teresa <unk> , both apologizing for public acts of " unreasonableness . " 
 = = = " A Moment of Sincerity " speech = = = 
 After defeating Colbert 's " <unk> " , Stewart closed the rally with a " moment ... for some sincerity " to explain his intentions for the rally : 
 This was not a rally to ridicule people of faith , or people of activism , or look down our noses at the heartland , or passionate argument , or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear . They are , and we do . But we live now in hard times , not end times . 
 He criticized the role the press plays in polarizing political debates , stating that the media — which he described as " the country ’ s 24 @-@ hour politico – pundit perpetual panic ' conflict @-@ <unk> ' " — only amplifies problems and no longer makes a distinction between " hav [ ing ] animus " and " be [ ing ] enemies . " He warned that demonizing opponents and accepting propaganda makes people " less safe , not more " and that " it is an insult , not only to those people , but to the racists themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate . " 
 Much of the speech was devoted to the idea that " [ m ] ost Americans don ’ t live their lives solely as Democrats , Republicans , liberals or conservatives . " He spoke on the subject of " reasonable compromises " that happen " every day " between persons of different beliefs , citing as an example traffic merging at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York City and Jersey City . 
 = = = Crowd size and television broadcast = = = 
 An aerial photography analysis commissioned by CBS News and carried out by <unk> estimated the crowd at 215 @,@ 000 people , plus or minus 10 % . In comparison , their estimate for the Restoring Honor rally made using the same methods was 87 @,@ 000 people , plus or minus 9 @,@ 000 . USA Today , Voice of America and ABC News all referred to the crowd as tens of thousands of people , with Voice of America noting , " the crowd filled the Mall , from almost in front of the Capitol to the Washington Monument . " 
 According to local news outlet TBD TV , " Massive turnout for Saturday 's rally quickly overwhelmed the Mall , forcing thousands of people into nearby streets and , eventually , just giving up and leaving . " The PA system was criticized for being inadequate for those farther back to hear , with the crowd chanting " louder " several times . Jon Stewart , speaking from the stage , jokingly said there were over 10 million people there , and Stephen Colbert satirically tweeted an estimate of 6 billion . 
 The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority , which maintained its normal Saturday service schedule , announced that Metrorail ridership set a Saturday record of 825 @,@ 437 trips , as compared to about 350 @,@ 000 on a normal Saturday , and beating out the previous record set in 1991 of 786 @,@ 358 trips during the Desert Storm rally . 
 The rally was broadcast live on Comedy Central and C @-@ SPAN . The Comedy Central live broadcast reportedly drew 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 total viewers , with an additional 570 @,@ 000 live video streams on the Internet . 
 = = Response to rally = = 
 Keith Olbermann was prominently featured in a video montage shown at the rally that focused on the anger present in cable news . Two days after the rally , he decided to suspend his " Worst Person in the World " segment on Countdown with Keith Olbermann in the interest of turning down the volume and anger . However , he defended the content of his show by claiming that MSNBC ( the network that hosted Countdown at the time ) differs from Fox News in that " sticking up for the powerless is not the moral equivalent of sticking up for the powerful . " After tallying an online vote among his viewers , Olbermann announced that the segment would return on the November 17 broadcast as the " Not Really Worst Persons in the World . " 
 On Real Time with Bill Maher , Bill Maher criticized the rally , saying that while Stewart and Colbert meant well , the message of the rally promoted a false equivalency between the left and the right , noting , " the big mistake of modern media has been this notion of balance for balance 's sake . That the Left is just as violent and cruel as the Right ... there 's a difference between a mad man and a madman . " 
 On November 11 , Stewart appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show and clarified the message he intended to convey at the rally : that too many have " bought into the idea that the conflict [ in America ] is left versus right " when the conflict is actually " corruption versus not @-@ corruption " and that " both sides have their ways of shutting down debate . " 
 Several websites , including The Huffington Post , dedicated a page to collecting " the funniest signs from the rally . " 
 In the weeks after the rally , the controversy from 20 years earlier over Cat Stevens ' comments about Salman Rushdie was re @-@ ignited , as commentators debated the decision to invite Cat Stevens / Yusuf to perform at the rally . Ben Smith of Politico said that some found Stevens ' appearance at the rally to be a " dissonant note " . Professor Akbar Ahmed said the debate was yet another example of " controversies being dug up and taken out of context to be aired simply because of a rather poisonous environment around Islam . " Salman Rushdie called Stewart after the rally to speak with him about Yusuf 's appearance , but said Stewart " said he was sorry it upset me , but really , it was plain that he was fine with it . <unk> . " Stewart gave his perspective two years later . Stewart , saying that he didn ’ t know about Yusuf ’ s comments at the time , explained : " I ’ m sure he doesn ’ t believe that people should be put to death for apostasy . I said , ‘ look , I ’ m sorry you ’ re upset , but I ’ m sure the guy isn ’ t really like that . Let me talk to him . ' " Yusuf characterized the 1989 episode as a " misunderstanding " , but added , " although why do you have to insult the Prophet ? " Stewart continued , " We get into a whole conversation , and it becomes very clear to me that he is straddling two worlds in a very difficult way . And that he actually still – and it broke my heart a little bit . ... If I had known that , I wouldn ’ t have done it . Because that to me is a deal breaker . Death for free speech is a deal breaker . " In 2014 , as he had in 2010 , conservative talk show host Sean Hannity criticized Jon Stewart for inviting Yusuf . Stewart responded , " point taken on that one ... correct , Mr. Hannity , mistake ! I should have looked into it more ... ... I 'm just not sure you 're the best guy to make the guilt @-@ by @-@ musician @-@ association point . "

 <unk> Babangida ( born 25 September 1973 in Kaduna ) is a retired Nigerian footballer , who played as a winger . Known for his pace , his playing style was sometimes compared to that of Marc Overmars . Babangida spent the majority of his playing career at Ajax . Overall , he played in five different countries on three different continents . At club level , Babangida spent nine years in Netherlands , playing for VVV @-@ Venlo , Roda JC and Ajax , winning the Eredivisie plus KNVB Cup double with the latter side . 
 He played over 30 games for his national side , including four at the 1998 World Cup in France . He participated in two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and won the 1996 Olympics with Nigeria . Babangida made his international debut in 1994 . He lost his place in the squad right before the 2002 World Cup . After a two @-@ year lay @-@ off from international football , Babangida was recalled to the Nigeria team for the 2004 African Cup of Nations preparations in Tunisia . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Babangida , sometimes nicknamed " TJ " , was born into a large family in the city of Kaduna in 1970 . He was married to Rabah ( now his ex ) , the sister of Daniel <unk> 's wife . Two of his nine brothers , Ibrahim and Haruna are also footballers . The former spent five years at <unk> , while the latter became the youngest ever player in the history of Spanish football to have a buy @-@ out clause in his contract and the second youngest player to appear for FC Barcelona , when he made his debut in 1998 as a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old . In 1996 Babangida acted in a commercial add for ABN @-@ AMRO in which he points out his hesitations about a contract of some sort . In 2004 , Babangida signed a $ 2 million contract to bring new footballs to Nigeria . The same year , he opened a shopping mall in Kaduna . Upon retiring from professional football , Babangida has been working as a football agent .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 In 1991 , Babangida , at the age of seventeen , left local club Niger Tornadoes to sign with Dutch Eredivisie side Roda JC , after performing well at the 1991 All @-@ Africa Games . He was loaned out to Roda 's league rivals VVV @-@ Venlo until the end of the season . Babangida made a total of six league appearances , scoring three times in the 1991 – 92 season . Despite Venlo 's relegation to Eerste Divisie , Babangida remained at the club for another year . 
 Babangida received his breakthrough in the 1992 – 93 season as he scored 16 goals , helping Venlo to achieve promotion to Eredivisie . The following season , Babangida returned to Roda , immediately becoming a first @-@ team regular with the <unk> side . Babangida made a total of 29 league appearances for Roda that season , scoring 11 goals . 
 Babangida spent two more seasons at Roda JC . Babangida 's 10 league goals in 1995 – 96 , made him the club 's top scorer that season . In 1995 , Babangida made his European debut , scoring a goal in the UEFA Cup first @-@ round win over Olimpija Ljubljana , Roda 's first European campaign in five years . Roda went on to beat the Slovenian side 5 – 2 on aggregate , but lost to Benfica in the second round . Solid performances at both international and club level led to interest from Dutch side Ajax , as Louis van Gaal was looking to replace Babangida 's compatriot Finidi George , who had recently departed to Real Betis . 
 = = = Ajax = = = 
 Babangida joined Ajax in the summer of 1996 in a long @-@ anticipated € 5 million move . He appeared in 29 league games , scoring four goals in his first season with Ajax . Babangida played an important role in Ajax 's European campaign , scoring three goals , including one against Auxerre in the group stages , and the winning goal in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League encounter with Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón Stadium , that put Ajax through to the semi @-@ finals of the competition . 
 Babangida had a successful second season with the club as he helped Ajax to another Eredivisie title with a 39 @-@ point gap over PSV Eindhoven , while his 13 league goals in 26 games made him the club 's third top scorer , behind Shota Arveladze and Jari Litmanen . Ajax clinched the second title of the season with a 5 – 0 victory over PSV in the KNVB Cup final , with the Nigerian scoring the first goal . 
 Babangida 's fortunes started to change towards the end of 1998 . Having missed the start of the season with malaria , Babangida gradually lost his starting line @-@ up position as Morten Olsen was looking to improve on the team 's inconsistent performances both in the domestic league and in Europe . Babangida started two of his team 's opening Champions League games . The European season , however , ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom of their group behind Olympiacos , Dinamo Zagreb and Porto . Overall , Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season , starting only seven . He didn 't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna Sittard in the final . 
 Babangida saw even less playing time after the 1999 season , as he made a mere eight appearances the following year and didn 't play a single game in the first half of the 2000 – 01 season . In an attempt to offload the player , Ajax came to an agreement with the Turkish Süper Lig side <unk> , who signed Babangida on a half @-@ year loan deal until the end of the season . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 The spell in Turkey , however , proved to be an unhappy time for Babangida and the Ankara side chose no to pursue their interest in the player once the loan deal expired . Looking for a move away from Netherlands , Babangida came close to signing with AJ Auxerre , but received a last @-@ minute call from Ronald Koeman and agreed to join him at Vitesse instead . Another loan move followed . First team player under Koeman , Babangida subsequently lost his place in the starting line @-@ up , when Ronald Koeman left for Ajax and was replaced by Edward <unk> . 
 He then signed a six @-@ month loan deal with Al @-@ Ittihad of Saudi Arabia in 2002 , joining <unk> and Titi Camara , but walked out of the team in November after disagreements with José Oscar Bernardi . Looking to resolve the deadlock with Ajax , Babangida returned to Amsterdam to continue negotiating a termination of his contract with the club . On 30 April 2003 , three years since Babangida played his last game for the club , it was announced that both sides had come to an agreement and the player 's contract was finally terminated . 
 As a free agent , Babangida underwent a successful trial at Chinese side Tianjin <unk> in the summer of 2003 . The move , however , was put off due to the outbreak of SARS in China , and Babangida signed with the second @-@ tier side Changchun Yatai shortly after . His four goals in the second part of the season helped his team to the Jia B title and earned him a recall to the national team for their preparations for the 2004 African Cup of Nations . Babangida scored four more goals for Yatai the following season before retiring in 2004 . 
 = = International career = = 
 Babangida received his first call @-@ up to the senior Nigeria national team for a pre @-@ World Cup friendly against Romania in 1994 . He then played in a friendly against Georgia , but did not make the final squad for 1994 World Cup . 
 Babangida 's international chances were partly limited due to the fact that he often found himself behind Finidi George in the pecking order . He played an important role in his team 's Olympic triumph in Atlanta in 1996 , as Nigeria overcame tough resistance from Brazil and Argentina , packed with the likes of Dida , Roberto Carlos , <unk> , Ronaldo , Rivaldo , Hernan Crespo , Claudio López , Ariel Ortega and Diego Simeone among others . Babangida took part in Nigeria 's 1998 World Cup campaign , playing a total of 120 minutes as he started one game and came on as a sub in the other three . He scored his team 's only goal in the second @-@ round defeat to Denmark . In January 2001 , Babangida appeared in an exhibition game at the Yokohama International Stadium ( known as the Nissan Stadium nowadays ) , playing for FIFA XI in a game against the unified team of Japan and South Korea . 
 Babangida only made his African Nations Cup debut in 2000 as Nigeria withdrew from the 1996 edition in South Africa due to political reasons and missed out on 1998 African Cup of Nations through disqualification . Babangida scored two spectacular goals against South Africa to put Nigeria through to the final against Cameroon , where they drew 2 – 2 , before being narrowly defeated 3 – 4 on penalties . He appeared in all of his team 's five games , starting two . 
 He then featured in Nigeria 's run to the 2002 World Cup finals , scoring two important first @-@ half goals against Ghana on the final day of the 2002 World Cup qualification , helping Nigeria seal the final African region World Cup berth . Babangida played in all of his team 's games at the 2002 Nations Cup , but was dropped ahead of the World Cup , alongside several other experienced players like Sunday <unk> and Finidi George . He was recalled to the national team for the pre @-@ Nations Cup training camp in Faro , Portugal in 2004 , but did not make the final squad , making the 2002 Cup of Nations his last major international tournament .

 = Alfred Russel Wallace = 
 Alfred Russel Wallace OM FRS ( 8 January 1823 – 7 November 1913 ) was a British naturalist , explorer , geographer , anthropologist , and biologist . He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection ; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin 's writings in 1858 . This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in On the Origin of Species . Wallace did extensive fieldwork , first in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago , where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line , which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts : a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin , and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia . 
 He was considered the 19th century 's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the " father of biogeography " . Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co @-@ discoverer of natural selection . These included the concept of warning colouration in animals , and the Wallace effect , a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation . 
 Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas ( such as evolution ) . His advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non @-@ material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment . 
 Aside from scientific work , he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system ( capitalism ) in 19th @-@ century Britain . His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity . He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues ; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore , Indonesia and Malaysia , The Malay Archipelago , was both popular and highly regarded . Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print . 
 Wallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life . His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and , after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments , he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced . Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community , such as Darwin and Charles Lyell , he had no family wealth to fall back on , and he was unsuccessful in finding a long @-@ term salaried position , receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension , through Darwin 's efforts , in 1881 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Alfred Wallace was born in the Welsh village of <unk> , near Usk , Monmouthshire . He was the seventh of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne <unk> . Mary Anne was English ; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry . His family , like many Wallaces , claimed a connection to William Wallace , a leader of Scottish forces during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th century . Thomas Wallace graduated in law , but never practised law . He inherited some income @-@ generating property , but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family 's financial position . His mother was from a middle @-@ class English family from Hertford , north of London . When Wallace was five years old , his family moved to Hertford . There he attended Hertford Grammar School until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836 , when he was aged 14 . 
 Wallace then moved to London to board with his older brother John , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old apprentice builder . This was a stopgap measure until William , his oldest brother , was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor . While in London , Alfred attended lectures and read books at the London Mechanics Institute . Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen and of Thomas Paine . He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years . 
 At the end of 1839 , they moved to Kington , Hereford , near the Welsh border , before eventually settling at Neath in Glamorgan in Wales . Between 1840 and 1843 , Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales . By the end of 1843 , William 's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions , and Wallace , at the age of 20 , left in January . 
 One result of Wallace 's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality . Since Wallace was born in Monmouthshire , some sources have considered him to be Welsh . However , some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh , his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire , the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English , and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh ( even when writing about his time in Wales ) . One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales . It has also been noted that , unlike today , Monmouthshire was technically part of England rather than Wales at the time Wallace was born . 
 After a brief period of unemployment , he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in Leicester to teach drawing , <unk> , and surveying . Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester : he read An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Malthus , and one evening he met the entomologist Henry Bates . Bates was 19 years old , and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal Zoologist . He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects . William died in March 1845 , and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother 's firm in Neath , but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work . After a few months , Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the Vale of Neath . 
 Wallace 's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside , allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects . Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm , which carried out a number of projects , including the design of a building for the Neath Mechanics ' Institute , founded in 1843 . William Jevons , the founder of that institute , was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering . In the autumn of 1846 , John and he purchased a cottage near Neath , where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny ( his father had died in 1843 ) . 
 During this period , he read avidly , exchanging letters with Bates about Robert Chambers ' anonymously published evolutionary treatise Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation , Charles Darwin 's The Voyage of the Beagle , and Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology . 
 = = = Exploration and study of the natural world = = = 
 Inspired by the chronicles of earlier travelling naturalists , including Alexander von Humboldt , Charles Darwin and especially William Henry Edwards , Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist . In 1848 , Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the Mischief . Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the Amazon rainforest for their private collections , selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip . Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species . 
 Wallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near Belém do Pará , then explored inland separately , occasionally meeting to discuss their findings . In 1849 , they were briefly joined by another young explorer , botanist Richard Spruce , along with Wallace 's younger brother Herbert . Herbert left soon thereafter ( dying two years later from yellow fever ) , but Spruce , like Bates , would spend over ten years collecting in South America . 
 Wallace continued charting the Rio Negro for four years , collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography , flora , and fauna . On 12 July 1852 , Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig Helen . After 26 days at sea , the ship 's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship . All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship , mostly collected during the last two , and most interesting , years of his trip , were lost . He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else . 
 Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig <unk> , which was sailing from Cuba to London . The <unk> 's provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers , but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852 . 
 After his return to the UK , Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the Rio Negro . During this period , despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition , he wrote six academic papers ( which included " On the Monkeys of the Amazon " ) and two books ; Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses and Travels on the Amazon . He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists — most significantly , Darwin . 
 From 1854 to 1862 , age 31 to 39 , Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or East Indies ( now Singapore , Malaysia and Indonesia ) , to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history . A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology . His observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the <unk> boundary now known as the Wallace line . 
 Wallace collected more than 126 @,@ 000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago ( more than 80 @,@ 000 beetles alone ) . Several thousand of them represented species new to science . One of his better @-@ known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog <unk> <unk> , known as Wallace 's flying frog . While he was exploring the archipelago , he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection . In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin ; it was published , along with a description of Darwin 's own theory , in the same year . 
 Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as The Malay Archipelago , which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century , and has never been out of print . It was praised by scientists such as Darwin ( to whom the book was dedicated ) , and Charles Lyell , and by non @-@ scientists such as the novelist Joseph Conrad , who called it his " favorite bedside companion " and used it as source of information for several of his novels , especially Lord Jim . 
 = = = Return to England , marriage and children = = = 
 In 1862 , Wallace returned to England , where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas . While recovering from his travels , Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the Zoological Society of London . Later that year , he visited Darwin at Down House , and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and Herbert Spencer . During the 1860s , Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection . He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics , including sexual selection , warning colouration , and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species . In 1865 , he began investigating spiritualism . 
 After a year of courtship , Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom , in his autobiography , he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace . However , to Wallace 's great dismay , she broke off the engagement . In 1866 , Wallace married Annie Mitten . Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce , who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten 's father , William Mitten , an expert on mosses . In 1872 , Wallace built the Dell , a house of concrete , on land he leased in Grays in Essex , where he lived until 1876 . The Wallaces had three children : Herbert ( 1867 – 1874 ) , Violet ( 1869 – 1945 ) , and William ( 1871 – 1951 ) . 
 = = = Financial struggles = = = 
 In the late 1860s and 1870s , Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family . While he was in the Malay Archipelago , the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money , which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace . However , on his return to the UK , Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money , and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago . 
 Despite assistance from his friends , he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a <unk> in a museum . To remain financially solvent , Wallace worked grading government examinations , wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums , and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works . 
 In 1876 , Wallace needed a £ 500 advance from the publisher of The Geographical Distribution of Animals to avoid having to sell some of his personal property . Darwin was very aware of Wallace 's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science . When the £ 200 annual pension was awarded in 1881 , it helped to stabilise Wallace 's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings . 
 = = = Social activism = = = 
 John Stuart Mill was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago . Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association , but the association dissolved after Mill 's death in 1873 . Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when , at the age of 56 , he entered the debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest . He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people , thus breaking the often @-@ abused power of wealthy landowners in British society . In 1881 , Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society . In the next year , he published a book , Land Nationalisation ; Its Necessity and Its Aims , on the subject . He criticised the UK 's free trade policies for the negative impact they had on working @-@ class people . In 1889 , Wallace read Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy and declared himself a socialist . After reading Progress and Poverty , the best selling book by the progressive land reformist Henry George , Wallace described it as " Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century . " 
 Wallace opposed eugenics , an idea supported by other prominent 19th @-@ century evolutionary thinkers , on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit . In the 1890 article " Human Selection " he wrote , " Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent ... " . In 1898 , Wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system , not backed by silver or gold , which impressed the economist Irving Fisher so much that he dedicated his 1920 book Stabilizing the Dollar to Wallace . 
 Wallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for women 's suffrage , and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism . In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people : " ... that all modern wars are dynastic ; that they are caused by the ambition , the interests , the jealousies , and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers , or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers ; and that the results of war are never good for the people , who yet bear all its <unk> " . In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909 , with aviation in its infancy , he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft , arguing against the idea " ... that this new horror is " inevitable , " and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins — for surely no other term can so <unk> describe the dropping of , say , ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy 's capital from an invisible flight of airships . " 
 In 1898 , Wallace published a book entitled The Wonderful Century : Its Successes and Its Failures about developments in the 19th century . The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century ; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including : the destruction and waste of wars and arms races , the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked , a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals , abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums , the environmental damage caused by capitalism , and the evils of European colonialism . Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life , publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death . 
 = = = Further scientific work = = = 
 Wallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary . In 1880 , he published Island Life as a sequel to The Geographic Distribution of Animals . In November 1886 , Wallace began a ten @-@ month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures . Most of the lectures were on Darwinism ( evolution through natural selection ) , but he also gave speeches on biogeography , spiritualism , and socio @-@ economic reform . During the trip , he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before . He also spent a week in Colorado , with the American botanist Alice Eastwood as his guide , exploring the flora of the Rocky Mountains and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how glaciation might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe , Asia and North America , which he published in 1891 in the paper " English and American Flowers " . He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections . His 1889 book Darwinism used information he collected on his American trip , and information he had compiled for the lectures . 
 Wallace assembled a huge collection of flora and fauna which were kept in " cabinets . " Only one of these collections remains in its original cabinet . It consists of 1 @,@ 700 @-@ items of a variety of insects , including butterflies , beetles , moths , shells , flies , bees , praying mantises , tarantulas , seedpods , a hornet 's nest , and a small bird . A collector named Robert Heggestad found this cabinet / collection in Washington DC in 1979 and purchased it for $ 600 ( not knowing who had assembled it ) . Heggestad began documenting references in Wallace 's work to specimens in the cabinet , resulting in a 62 @-@ page report to support the theory that the collection once belonged to Wallace . He also employed graphologist Beverley East to verify the handwriting on the collection . It is Wallace 's only known personal collection still in its original cabinet . Today it is believed that Wallace collected the specimens in the rosewood cabinet for instructional purposes . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On 7 November 1913 , Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard , which he had built a decade earlier . He was 90 years old . His death was widely reported in the press . The New York Times called him " the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included , among others , Darwin , Huxley , Spencer , Lyell , and Owen , whose daring investigations revolutionised and <unk> the thought of the century . " Another commentator in the same edition said " No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the ' Malay Archipelago ' . " 
 Some of Wallace 's friends suggested that he be buried in Westminster Abbey , but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at Broadstone , Dorset . Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried . The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915 . 
 = = Theory of evolution = = 
 = = = Early evolutionary thinking = = = 
 Unlike Darwin , Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the transmutation of species . The concept had been advocated by Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck , Geoffroy Saint @-@ Hilaire , Erasmus Darwin , and Robert Grant , among others . It was widely discussed , but not generally accepted by leading naturalists , and was considered to have radical , even revolutionary connotations . 
 Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier , Richard Owen , Adam Sedgwick , and Charles Lyell attacked it vigorously . It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics , religion and science , and because he was unusually open to marginal , even fringe , ideas in science . 
 He was also profoundly influenced by Robert Chambers ' work , Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation , a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system , the earth , and living things . Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845 : 
 I have a rather more favourable opinion of the ' Vestiges ' than you appear to have . I do not consider it a hasty generalization , but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies , but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem . It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to ; every fact he observes will make either for or against it , and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts , and an object to which they can be applied when collected . 
 In 1847 , he wrote to Bates : 
 I should like to take some one family [ of beetles ] to study thoroughly , principally with a view to the theory of the origin of species . By that means I am strongly of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at . 
 Wallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories . During his work in the Amazon basin , he came to realise that geographical barriers — such as the Amazon and its major tributaries — often separated the ranges of closely allied species , and he included these observations in his 1853 paper " On the Monkeys of the Amazon " . Near the end of the paper he asks the question , " Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country ? " 
 In February 1855 , while working in Sarawak on the island of Borneo , Wallace wrote " On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species " , a paper which was published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History in September 1855 . In this paper , he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species , what would become known as biogeography . His conclusion that " Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species " has come to be known as the " Sarawak Law " . Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin . Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution , this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later . 
 The paper shook Charles Lyell 's belief that species were immutable . Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation , Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea . Around the start of 1856 , he told Darwin about Wallace 's paper , as did Edward Blyth who thought it " Good ! Upon the whole ! ... Wallace has , I think put the matter well ; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species . " Despite this hint , Darwin mistook Wallace 's conclusion for the progressive creationism of the time and wrote that it was " nothing very new ... Uses my simile of tree [ but ] it seems all creation with him . " Lyell was more impressed , and opened a notebook on species , in which he grappled with the consequences , particularly for human ancestry . Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend Joseph Hooker and now , for the first time , he spelt out the full details of natural selection to Lyell . Although Lyell could not agree , he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority . Darwin demurred at first , then began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in May 1856 . 
 = = = Natural selection and Darwin = = = 
 By February 1858 , Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago of the reality of evolution . As he later wrote in his autobiography : 
 The problem then was not only how and why do species change , but how and why do they change into new and well defined species , distinguished from each other in so many ways ; why and how they become so exactly adapted to distinct modes of life ; and why do all the intermediate grades die out ( as geology shows they have died out ) and leave only clearly defined and well marked species , genera , and higher groups of animals ? 
 According to his autobiography , it was while he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus 's idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with the idea of natural selection . Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time ; but historians have questioned this , saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time , he was on the island of Gilolo . From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van <unk> van <unk> . He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo . 
 Wallace describes how he discovered natural selection as follows : 
 It then occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also ; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind , the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species , since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year , as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly . <unk> thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied , it occurred to me to ask the question , why do some die and some live ? And the answer was clearly , on the whole the best fitted live ... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist , then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about ... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required , and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out , and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained . 
 Wallace had once briefly met Darwin , and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories . Although Wallace 's first letter to Darwin has been lost , Wallace carefully kept the letters he received . In the first letter , dated 1 May 1857 , Darwin commented that Wallace 's letter of 10 October which he had recently received , as well as Wallace 's paper " On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species " of 1855 , showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions , and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time . The second letter , dated 22 December 1857 , said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution , adding that " without speculation there is no good and original observation " while commenting that " I believe I go much further than you " . Wallace trusted Darwin 's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay , " On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart <unk> From the Original Type " , with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile . Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago , the Ternate essay was in a private letter . On 18 June 1858 , Darwin received the essay from Wallace . While Wallace 's essay obviously did not employ Darwin 's term " natural selection " , it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures . In this sense , it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years , but had yet to publish . Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying " he could not have made a better short abstract ! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish , but I shall , of course , at once write and offer to send to any journal . " Distraught about the illness of his baby son , Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker , who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin 's priority . Wallace had not asked for publication of his essay , and indeed , doing so probably contravened the copyright law of the time . Wallace 's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858 , along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857 . 
 Communication with Wallace in the far @-@ off Malay Archipelago was impossible without months of delay , so he was not part of this rapid publication . Fortunately , Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact , happy that he had been included at all , and never expressed public or private bitterness . Darwin 's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace 's , and it was unlikely that , without Darwin , Wallace 's views on evolution would have been taken seriously . Lyell and Hooker 's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co @-@ discoverer , and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists . However , the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin . This , combined with Darwin 's ( as well as Hooker 's and Lyell 's ) advocacy on his behalf , would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community . The reaction to the reading was muted , with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries ; but , with Darwin 's publication of On the Origin of Species later in 1859 , its significance became apparent . When Wallace returned to the UK , he met Darwin . Although some of Wallace 's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin 's patience , they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin 's life . 
 Over the years , a few people have questioned this version of events . In the early 1980s , two books , one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks , even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit , but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory . These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing . Research into shipping schedules has shown that , contrary to these accusations , Wallace 's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin 's letter to Lyell .

 After the publication of Darwin 's On the Origin of Species , Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to England in 1862 . In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin , Wallace published the short paper " Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton 's Paper on the Bee 's Cell , And on the Origin of Species " in order to rebuke a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin 's comments in the Origin on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection . 
 An even lengthier defence of Darwin 's work was " Creation by Law " , a review Wallace wrote in 1867 for The Quarterly Journal of Science of the book The Reign of Law , which had been written by George Campbell , the 8th Duke of Argyll , as a refutation of natural selection . After an 1870 meeting of the British Association , Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were " no opponents left who know anything of natural history , so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have . " 
 = = = = Differences between Darwin 's and Wallace 's ideas on natural selection = = = = 
 Historians of science have noted that , while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace 's paper to be essentially the same as his own , there were differences . Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce , whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions , leading populations in different locations to diverge . Some historians , notably Peter J. Bowler , have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin , Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection . However , Malcolm <unk> has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations . 
 Others have noted that another difference was that Wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism keeping species and varieties adapted to their environment . They point to a largely overlooked passage of Wallace 's famous 1858 paper : 
 The action of this principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam engine , which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident ; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude , because it would make itself felt at the very first step , by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow . 
 The <unk> and anthropologist Gregory Bateson would observe in the 1970s that , though writing it only as an example , Wallace had " probably said the most powerful thing that 'd been said in the 19th Century " . Bateson revisited the topic in his 1979 book Mind and Nature : A Necessary Unity , and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and systems theory . 
 = = = = Warning colouration and sexual selection = = = = 
 In 1867 , Darwin wrote to Wallace about a problem he was having understanding how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes . Darwin had come to believe that sexual selection , an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did , explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes . However , Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars . Wallace responded that he and Henry Bates had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste , and that he had been told by John Jenner Weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable . " Now , as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight " , Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection . Darwin was impressed by the idea . At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society , Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic . In 1869 , Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace 's idea . Warning colouration was one of a number of contributions Wallace made in the area of the evolution of animal colouration in general and the concept of protective colouration in particular . It was also part of a lifelong disagreement Wallace had with Darwin over the importance of sexual selection . In his 1878 book Tropical Nature and Other Essays , he wrote extensively on the colouration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection . He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book Darwinism . In 1890 , he wrote a critical review in Nature of his friend Edward Bagnall Poulton 's The Colours of Animals which supported Darwin on sexual selection , attacking especially Poulton 's claims on the " aesthetic preferences of the insect world " . 
 = = = = Wallace effect = = = = 
 In 1889 , Wallace wrote the book Darwinism , which explained and defended natural selection . In it , he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation . Thus it might contribute to the development of new species . He suggested the following scenario . When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point , each adapted to particular conditions , hybrid offspring would be less well @-@ adapted than either parent form and , at that point , natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids . Furthermore , under such conditions , natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation , as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring , and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species . This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect . Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868 , but had not worked it out to this level of detail . It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today , with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity . 
 = = = Application of theory to humans , and role of teleology in evolution = = = 
 In 1864 , Wallace published a paper , " The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man <unk> from the Theory of ' Natural Selection ' " , applying the theory to humankind . Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject , although Thomas Huxley had in Evidence as to Man 's Place in Nature . He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes . Unlike some other Darwinists , including Darwin himself , he did not " regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape " . He saw the evolution of humans in two stages : achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain , and the " recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life . Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that ... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain , bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded . " For this paper he won Darwin 's praise . 
 Shortly afterwards , Wallace became a spiritualist . At about the same time , he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical , artistic , or musical genius , as well as metaphysical musings , and wit and humour . He eventually said that something in " the unseen universe of Spirit " had interceded at least three times in history . The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter . The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals . And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind . He also believed that the raison d 'être of the universe was the development of the human spirit . These views greatly disturbed Darwin , who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non @-@ adaptive mental phenomena . While some historians have concluded that Wallace 's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism , other Wallace scholars have disagreed , and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas . Reaction to Wallace 's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied . Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace 's views on human evolution rather than Darwin 's . Wallace 's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . However , many , including Huxley , Hooker , and Darwin himself , were critical of Wallace . As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated , Wallace 's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy , which were that evolution was not teleological ( purpose driven ) and that it was not anthropocentric ( human @-@ centred ) . Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes , that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes , in a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life , which he later expanded into a book of the same name ; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century . 
 = = = Assessment of Wallace 's role in history of evolutionary theory = = = 
 In many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory , Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin 's own theory . In reality , Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin 's , and was considered by many ( especially Darwin ) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day , whose ideas could not be ignored . One historian of science has pointed out that , through both private correspondence and published works , Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other 's ideas and theories over an extended period . Wallace is the most @-@ cited naturalist in Darwin 's Descent of Man , often in strong disagreement . Wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life . By the 1880s , evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles , but Wallace and August Weismann were nearly alone among prominent biologists in believing that natural selection was the major driving force behind it . In 1889 , Wallace published the book Darwinism as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection . Of all Wallace 's books , it is the most cited by scholarly publications .

 = = = Biogeography and ecology = = = 
 In 1872 , at the urging of many of his friends , including Darwin , Philip Sclater , and Alfred Newton , Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals . He was unable to make much progress initially , in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time . He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification . Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds — which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution — to cover mammals , reptiles and insects as well , Wallace created the basis for the <unk> regions still in use today . He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region . These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges ( such as the one currently connecting North America and South America ) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation . He provided maps that displayed factors , such as elevation of mountains , depths of oceans , and the character of regional vegetation , that affected the distribution of animals . He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions . The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location . The resulting two @-@ volume work , The Geographical Distribution of Animals , was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next 80 years . 
 In this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species , but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species . For example , he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the Northern Hemisphere , migrating between North America and Eurasia and then , much more recently , to South America after which the northern species became extinct , leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia . Wallace was very aware of , and interested in , the mass extinction of megafauna in the late Pleistocene . In The Geographical Distribution of Animals ( 1876 ) he wrote , " We live in a <unk> impoverished world , from which all the <unk> , and fiercest , and strangest forms have recently disappeared " . He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation , but by the time he wrote World of Life ( 1911 ) he had come to believe those extinctions were " due to man 's agency " . 
 In 1880 , Wallace published the book Island Life as a sequel to The Geographical Distribution of Animals . It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands . Wallace classified islands into three different types . Oceanic islands , such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands ( then known as the Sandwich Islands ) formed in mid @-@ ocean and never part of any large continent . Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians , and their inhabitants ( with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity ) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution . He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent ( like Britain ) or much less recently ( like Madagascar ) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna . He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals , such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas . He extensively discussed how changes of climate , particularly periods of increased glaciation , may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands , and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages . Island Life was considered a very important work at the time of its publication . It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence . 
 = = = Environmental issues = = = 
 Wallace 's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world . In Tropical Nature and Other Essays ( 1878 ) , he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion , especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall . Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate , he warned that the extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion . In Island Life , Wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of invasive species . On the impact of European colonisation on the island of Saint Helena , he wrote : 
 ... yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile . The cause of this change is , however , very easily explained . The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin . When this was destroyed , the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil , and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay . This irreparable destruction was caused , in the first place , by goats , which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513 , and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands . These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees , because they eat off the young seedlings , and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest . They were , however , aided by the reckless waste of man . The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651 , and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing , and required some protection . Two of the native trees , redwood and ebony , were good for tanning , and , to save trouble , the bark was <unk> stripped from the trunks only , the remainder being left to rot ; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications ! 
 Wallace 's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career . In The World of Life ( 1911 ) he wrote : 
 These considerations should lead us to look upon all the works of nature , animate or inanimate , as invested with a certain sanctity , to be used by us but not abused , and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced . To pollute a spring or a river , to exterminate a bird or beast , should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes ; ... Yet during the past century , which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud , there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works ; so that never before has there been such widespread ravage of the earth 's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life , and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities ; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion ! 
 = = = Astrobiology = = = 
 Wallace 's 1904 book Man 's Place in the Universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets . He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life , mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase . More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties ( the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time ) . 
 His treatment of Mars in this book was brief , and in 1907 , Wallace returned to the subject with a book Is Mars Habitable ? to criticise the claims made by Percival Lowell that there were Martian canals built by intelligent beings . Wallace did months of research , consulted various experts , and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions . Among other things , Wallace pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the Martian atmosphere , that Lowell 's analysis of Mars 's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature , and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water , let alone a planet @-@ <unk> irrigation system , impossible . Richard Milner comments : " It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace ... who effectively debunked Lowell 's illusionary network of Martian canals . " Wallace originally became interested in the topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in the universe .

 = = = Spiritualism = = = 
 In a letter to his brother @-@ in @-@ law in 1861 , Wallace wrote : 
 ... I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths . I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft @-@ repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity ... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions . To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity . But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature ; whether we have an immortal soul or not , or whatever may be our state after death , I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth , or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood , and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction . 
 Wallace was an enthusiast of phrenology . Early in his career , he experimented with hypnosis , then known as mesmerism . He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects , with considerable success . When he began his experiments with mesmerism , the topic was very controversial and early experimenters , such as John <unk> , had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment . Wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and his later investigations into spiritualism . In 1893 , he wrote : 
 I thus learnt my first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge , never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility , as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men , admittedly sane and honest . The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility , the deniers have always been wrong . 
 Wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of 1865 , possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims , who had been involved with it for some time . After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances , he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality . For the rest of his life , he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine , no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced . Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism . It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier , when his first fiancée broke their engagement , contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism . Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace 's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena , both material and non @-@ material , of the natural world and of human society . 
 Spiritualism appealed to many educated Victorians who no longer found traditional religious doctrine , such as that of the Church of England , acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th @-@ century science . However , several scholars who have researched Wallace 's views in depth have emphasised that , for him , spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief . Among other prominent 19th @-@ century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen , who was one of Wallace 's early idols , the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh , the mathematician Augustus De Morgan , and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers . 
 During the 1860s the stage magician John Nevil Maskelyne exposed the trickery of the Davenport brothers . Wallace was unable to accept that he had replicated their feats utilizing natural methods , and stated that Maskelyne possessed supernatural powers . 
 In 1874 , Wallace visited the spirit photographer Frederick Hudson . A photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced and Wallace declared the photograph genuine , declaring " I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being , acquainted with my mother 's various aspects during life , produced these recognisable impressions on the plate . " However , Hudson 's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872 . 
 Wallace 's very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation . It strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as Henry Bates , Thomas Huxley , and even Darwin , who felt he was overly credulous . Others , such as the physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter and zoologist E. Ray Lankester became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue . Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism , notably William Crookes , were subject to much criticism from the press , with The Lancet as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh . The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace 's work for the rest of his career . When , in 1879 , Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace , Joseph Hooker responded : 
 Wallace has lost caste considerably , not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism , but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association , brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings ... This he is said to have done in an underhanded manner , and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council . 
 Hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request . 
 = = = Flat Earth wager = = = 
 In 1870 , a Flat @-@ Earth proponent named John Hampden offered a £ 500 wager ( equivalent to about £ <unk> in present @-@ day terms ) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river , canal , or lake . Wallace , intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time , designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six @-@ mile ( 10 km ) stretch of canal . Both objects were at the same height above the water , and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well . When seen through the telescope , one object appeared higher than the other , showing the curvature of the earth . 
 The judge for the wager , the editor of Field magazine , declared Wallace the winner , but Hampden refused to accept the result . He sued Wallace and launched a campaign , which persisted for several years , of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief . Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden , but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years . 
 = = = Anti @-@ vaccination campaign = = = 
 In the early 1880s , Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox vaccination . Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty ; but , after studying some of the statistics provided by anti @-@ vaccination activists , he began to question the efficacy of vaccination . At the time , the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted . Moreover , no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked . When Wallace did some research , he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable , in a few cases completely phony , statistics to support their arguments . Always suspicious of authority , Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination , and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were , in fact , due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation . 
 Another factor in Wallace 's thinking was his belief that , because of the action of natural selection , organisms were in a state of balance with their environment , and that everything in nature , even disease @-@ causing organisms , served a useful purpose in the natural order of things ; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results . Wallace and other anti @-@ <unk> pointed out that vaccination , which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner , could be dangerous . 
 In 1890 , Wallace gave evidence before a Royal Commission investigating the controversy . When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony , they found errors , including some questionable statistics . The Lancet averred that Wallace and the other anti @-@ vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics , ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position . The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory , though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety , and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe . Years later , in 1898 , Wallace wrote a pamphlet , Vaccination a Delusion ; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime , attacking the commission 's findings . It , in turn , was attacked by The Lancet , which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission . 
 = = Legacy and historical perception = = 
 As a result of his writing , at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well @-@ known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist . He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics . He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours , such the Royal Society 's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively , and the Order of Merit in 1908 . Above all , his role as the co @-@ discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure . He was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century . Despite this , his fame faded quickly after his death . For a long time , he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science . A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention , including his modesty , his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation , and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas . 
 Recently , he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book @-@ length biographies on him , as well as anthologies of his writings . In 2007 a literary critic for New Yorker magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000 . There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship . In a 2010 book , the environmentalist Tim Flannery claimed that Wallace was ' the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival , ' and suggested that Wallace 's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking . 
 The Natural History Museum , London , co @-@ ordinated commemorative events for the Wallace centenary worldwide in the ' <unk> ' project in 2013 . On 24 January , his portrait was unveiled in the Main Hall of the museum by Bill Bailey , a fervent admirer . On the BBC Two programme " Bill Bailey 's Jungle Hero " , first broadcast on 21 April 2013 , Bailey revealed how Wallace cracked evolution by revisiting places where Wallace discovered exotic species . Episode one featured orangutans and flying frogs in Bailey 's journey through Borneo . Episode two featured birds of paradise . On 7 November 2013 , the 100th anniversary of Wallace 's death , Sir David Attenborough unveiled a statue of Wallace at the museum . The statue was donated by the A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund , and was sculpted by Anthony Smith . It depicts Wallace as a young man , collecting in the jungle . November 2013 also marked the debut of The Animated Life of A. R. Wallace , a paper @-@ puppet animation film dedicated to Wallace 's centennial .

 = Cordelia Chase = 
 Cordelia Chase is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer ; she also appeared on Buffy 's spin @-@ off series , Angel . Portrayed by Charisma Carpenter , the character appears as a series regular in the first three seasons of Buffy , before exiting the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of Angel . The character made her last television appearance in 2004 , appearing as a special guest star in Angel 's one hundredth episode . Cordelia also appears in both canonical and apocryphal Buffy and Angel material such as comic books and novels . 
 Cordelia is introduced in " Welcome to the Hellmouth " as one of Sunnydale High 's popular cheerleaders , attending school alongside vampire slayer Buffy Summers . Through her interactions with Buffy and her friends , she comes to accept the existence of supernatural forces and helps Buffy fight against them . In the television series Angel , Cordelia joins Angel , a heroic vampire with a soul , in forming a detective agency dedicated to stopping supernatural forces and helping the helpless . After Cordelia acquires the ability to see visions of those in need , she becomes a more compassionate and heroic character . In the middle of the third season , she becomes a love interest of the protagonist Angel . In the fourth season of Angel , she appears to take on a villainous role before it is revealed that she is possessed by a malevolent deity ; this storyline eventually leads to her death and subsequent exit from the series . The character makes further canonical appearances in the comic books Buffy Season Eight and Angel : After the Fall , in a dream flashback and as a spirit guide . 
 Created as a foil for Buffy 's titular heroine , Cordelia was initially characterized as " shallow " , " vain " and " self @-@ centered " , and was used in the series to create conflict for the other characters . The character went through changes as she gradually redeemed herself throughout the course of Buffy and Angel , and has received attention in academic texts related to gender studies and social status .

 Cordelia Chase first appears in the premiere episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , titled " Welcome to the Hellmouth " . Introduced as a potential friend for Sunnydale High 's newest student , Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , Cordelia reveals her true colors by cruelly mocking Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) , whom Buffy befriends instead . Ignorant of the supernatural , Cordelia shows up regularly throughout the first season of Buffy to insult and ridicule the other characters . She plays a larger role in the episode " Out of Mind , Out of Sight " , in which she falls victim to a social outcast who wants revenge on popular students for ignoring her so much that she turned invisible . In the season finale , Cordelia helps Buffy and her friends battle vampires , finally coming to terms with the existence of supernatural forces . In season two , Cordelia becomes a more active ally to the " Scooby Gang " and begins a romantic relationship with Xander Harris ( Nicholas Brendon ) . In " Bewitched , Bothered and Bewildered " , dating someone of Xander 's social status causes Cordelia 's ostracism from her popular peers and she reluctantly breaks up with him . However , when Xander performs a love spell to pay her back for hurting him , Cordelia realises how much he cares about her and takes him back , rejecting her superficial friends in the process . In season three 's " Lovers Walk " , Cordelia is heartbroken to see Xander kissing Willow and ends their relationship . By the season three episode " The Wish " , Cordelia slips back into her antagonistic persona from the first season , disassociating herself from the Scooby Gang altogether . In the episode " The Prom " , she reveals that her family 's wealth has been seized for tax fraud . Cordelia later attempts an unsuccessful relationship with Wesley ( Alexis Denisof ) and makes peace with Xander at the prom . In the season three finale , she rallies alongside Buffy and her friends at graduation against the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale ( Harry Groener ) , where Cordelia slays her first vampire . 
 After three seasons on Buffy , Cordelia moved over to star in Angel , a spin @-@ off series focusing on Buffy 's vampire ex @-@ lover Angel ( David Boreanaz ) . The first season of Angel sees Cordelia move to Los Angeles , in the hopes of escaping her new @-@ found poverty by becoming an actress . After Angel saves her life in the series pilot , Cordelia helps him found the supernatural detective agency Angel Investigations , working in an administrative position . She also becomes close to half @-@ demon co @-@ worker Doyle ( Glenn Quinn ) , but their budding romance is ended by his death nine episodes into the series . Before dying in the episode " Hero " , Doyle passes his ability to see people in distress over to Cordelia when he kisses her . Although she initially views the visions as a curse , in the season one finale , a demon causes Cordelia 's visions to overwhelm her — causing her to experience worldwide pain — and upon her recovery she vows to help those in need . In season two 's " Reunion " , Cordelia and the other staff at Angel Investigations are fired by Angel , who is becoming increasingly obsessed with bringing down the evil law firm Wolfram & Hart . Cordelia joins Wesley and Charles Gunn ( J. August Richards ) in re @-@ forming the agency on their own . Angel and Cordelia eventually reconcile in the episode " Epiphany " . As her acting career continues to flounder , Cordelia is sucked into and made princess of a medieval hell dimension called <unk> in the season two episode " Over the Rainbow " . When presented with the opportunity to pass her visions over to a champion named the Groosalugg ( Mark Lutz ) , Cordelia refuses and returns to L.A. with her friends in the season two finale . 
 In season three 's " Birthday " , Cordelia learns from the demon Skip ( David Denman ) that her visions are slowly killing her because human beings are not strong enough to control them . To save her life , Cordelia accepts Skip 's offer to alter history so that she never met Angel in L.A. , instead landing her big break as an actress . However , even in this alternate timeline , Cordelia feels compelled to help others and eventually crosses paths with Angel again , who received the visions in her place and is now insane . Unable to let her friend suffer , Cordelia has Skip return the timeline to normal , and agrees to become half @-@ demon , with new powers , in order to harbor the visions safely . This season also sees Angel become a father , with Cordelia stepping in to mother the infant Connor until he is kidnapped into a hell dimension in the episode " Sleep Tight " , only to emerge as a disturbed teenager ( Vincent Kartheiser ) in " The Price " . In the episode " Waiting in the Wings " , Angel realizes he has romantic feelings for Cordelia , but is prevented from voicing them by the return of Groosalugg . Cordelia dates Groosalugg for the remainder of the season , but Groo notices she loves Angel instead and decides to leave . In the season finale , Cordelia arranges to meet Angel to confess her feelings , but is prevented from doing so by Skip , who informs her that she has become a higher being . Cordelia accepts her duty , and leaves Earth for another dimension . In season four , Cordelia feels trapped in her position as a higher being , and so in the episode " The House Always Wins " she returns to Earth in an amnesiac state . In " Spin the Bottle " , her memories are returned via a spell , along with a vision of a mysterious Beast ( Vladimir <unk> ) . Afterward , she admits to Angel the feelings she once had for him . As L.A. succumbs to the apocalypse in season four 's " Apocalypse , <unk> " , Cordelia begins to behave out @-@ of @-@ character ; she seduces Connor , murders Lilah ( Stephanie Romanov ) in the episode " Calvary " , commands the Beast in " Salvage " , and magically battles former friend Willow to keep Angel from his soul in the episode " Orpheus " . In season four 's " Players " , the team realize that the now pregnant Cordelia is possessed , so Cordelia takes the unstable Connor on the run with her so they may give birth to their supernatural offspring , Jasmine ( Gina Torres ) . In " Inside Out " , Skip explains that Jasmine is his master , and a higher being who possessed Cordelia before her returning to Earth , manipulating events to be born in a new body of her own . 
 Cordelia falls into a post @-@ natal coma for the remainder of season four . Following an eleven @-@ episode absence , Cordelia returns to Angel in season five , in the 100th episode " You 're Welcome " . Having apparently awoken from her coma , Cordelia reunites with Angel Investigations , who she discovers have taken over Wolfram & Hart since their defeat of Jasmine . She chastises Angel for accepting W & H 's " deal with the devil " , and reminds him of his true mission and higher calling . Together , they face and defeat their old enemy Lindsey McDonald ( Christian Kane ) , who had been impersonating Doyle in an attempt to destroy Angel . In the episode 's closing moments , Cordelia reiterates to Angel that she loves him and kisses him , shortly before he receives a phone call reporting that Cordelia died that morning . When Angel turns around , Cordelia is gone . It is later revealed that this encounter — the Powers That Be repaying their debt to Cordelia — allowed Cordelia to pass one last vision over to Angel , giving him the knowledge he needs to bring down the Circle of the Black Thorn . 
 Between 2001 and 2004 , Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4 @-@ minute pilot episode for Buffy the Animated Series , which was set during the show 's first season . Had the series been picked up by a network , it would have featured Cordelia ( voiced by Charisma Carpenter ) in more high @-@ school adventures . Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube , Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form .

 Cordelia also appears in comic books and novels based on the Buffy and Angel television series . The Cordelia Collection , Vol . 1 by Nancy Krulik is a novelization of the Buffy episodes " Out of Mind , Out of Sight " , " Some Assembly Required " and " Homecoming " . These episodes tell specific incidents in which Cordelia becomes targeted : by a scorned classmate , to become a zombie 's bride and by hunters in a case of mistaken identity . She appears in numerous Angel novels as a member of Angel Investigations , but some feature Cordelia more prominently ; in Not Forgotten she uncovers exploitation of child immigrants , while in Haunted she appears as a contestant on a supernatural @-@ themed reality television show when she has a vision about another applicant . Cordelia appears in the majority of Angel comics , published by Dark Horse Comics during 2000 – 2002 and set between episodes of the television series . She appears less frequently in those by IDW Publishing between 2005 and 2011 , mainly in stories set in and after the fifth season . Cordelia typically plays a minimal role in the Dark Horse Angel comics . However , issue seventeen was a " Cordelia Special " , in which demonic items are stashed in Cordelia 's apartment . In the Dark Horse Presents story " Lovely dark and deep " , Cordelia lands a role as the star of a demonic movie . Cordelia appears in the IDW Publishing comic mini @-@ series Angel : The Curse , set after season five , in flashback scenes . She subsequently reappears in the mini @-@ series Angel : Old Friends , which sees Angel battle evil clones of his friends . Cordelia claims to be the genuine article , having returned from the dead , but Angel is unconvinced and kills her ; his suspicions prove correct when her body immediately disintegrates like the other clones . 
 Angel : After the Fall , a canonical comic book continuation of the television series plotted by Joss Whedon and written by Brian Lynch , features the characters of Angel and all of Los Angeles condemned to Hell after the events of the series finale " Not Fade Away " . Cordelia does not appear until the twelfth issue , in which she acts as a guide to Angel in his dying moments ; it is revealed she serves in some capacity as a higher power now . The character departs in issue thirteen . Cordelia also appears in a dream sequence within the twentieth issue of Buffy 's canonical continuation , Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight , titled " After These Messages ... We 'll Be Right Back ! " . Buffy dreams of when she was in her first year at Sunnydale High ; Cordelia 's physical appearance is based on the art style of Loeb and Whedon 's unproduced Buffy animated series . 
 = = Conception and casting = = 
 Cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the series ' main character Buffy Summers . Adapting the concept of the movie into a television series , Whedon decided to reinvent the character of Buffy . The shallow cheerleader of the 1992 Buffy film , as played by Kristy Swanson , had grown more mature and open @-@ minded . Buffy now identified with the social outcasts , such as Willow and Xander . As a result , Cordelia Chase was created to embody the traits of that shallower Buffy . Despite portraying a shallow , valley girl stock character , actress Charisma Carpenter felt that Cordelia in early seasons was not " one @-@ dimensional " , nor was she " as superficial as people thought " . At the same time , Carpenter was critical of her frequent role as the damsel in distress . Angel co @-@ creator and executive producer David Greenwalt describes Cordelia in her Buffy years as " a somewhat shallow , somewhat vain , somewhat self @-@ centered but [ a ] lively and honest character who spoke her mind " . Indeed , even not when superhuman , she showed a lot of hardiness . 
 Charisma Carpenter had originally planned to read for the role of Buffy , but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia . Carpenter , who had dressed casually for the role of Buffy — who she believed " could really be herself " — felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she " was definitely a character to dress for " . Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character , the producers were " really responsive " to Carpenter 's audition , and she left feeling confident she had got the part . After Carpenter 's audition , actress Sarah Michelle Gellar , who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter , was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy . Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase , but turned it down due to other contractual obligations . Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show 's second season . Carpenter , proud of her own character 's growth across the two series , did not envy Gellar for winning the role of Buffy over her .

 = = = Characteristics and analysis = = = 
 Cordelia 's representation of an assertive modern woman and her character arc in Buffy has been commented on in several academic texts , particularly in gender studies , such as " Praising Cordelia : Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls " , or Sex and the Slayer . In the latter , Dr. Lorna Jowett of the University of Northampton describes Cordelia 's initial place in the series where " At first glance , Cordelia seems to have the ' normal life ' Buffy often longs for . She is a familiar character from the teen drama : popular , a cheerleader , the center of cliques ( power as status ) . Furthermore , Cordelia 's exceptionalism is based on ' real ' material privilege rather than supernatural power . She represents in more exaggerated form the unnamed white middle @-@ class heterosexual qualities ( read privilege ) of the other characters ( to the point that it becomes visible ) . " Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia 's status is highlighted by her nickname , " Queen C " , and Harmony 's remark to her , " Cordy , you reign . " Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror , often screaming and running away , and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters . " 
 " Praising Cordelia " argues that both Buffy and Cordelia are representations of assertive and competitive young women , who " represent two kinds of aggressive adolescent girls " . The article focuses on the competitive relationship between the characters . Buffy 's initial friendship with Cordelia is compromised once Cordelia sees the attractive , socially competent Buffy as a threat to her . Even after Cordelia joins the Scooby Gang and becomes Buffy 's friend , theirs is not a friendship of " mutual support , warmth and intimacy " but rather one of " mutual antipathy " . The authors opine that Cordelia , unlike Buffy , is a " representation of the archetypal ' feminine type ' " , one who conforms to the " pervasive stereotypes of femininity while , at the same time , dominating the other girls in the school " and commanding the attention of the boys . Describing her character arc in Buffy , Mary Alice Money views Cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed Buffy characters , one who " reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits . " Jowett argues that Cordelia 's assimilation within the main group is due largely to her relationship with main character Xander , and she is rendered sympathetic to the audience once they witness her rebuff the peer pressure from her old friends . She is further endeared to the viewer when Xander betrays her , because the scenes showing her pain are shown only to the viewer . After Cordelia is cheated on by Xander with Willow she chooses not to go back to him , and instead retains her autonomy . 
 Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth <unk> note how Cordelia is also a subversive representation of feminine stereotypes , describing " Although superficially , Cordelia conforms to the stereotype of the insensitive bitch " , what she actually does is " offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self @-@ assertion " . One of Cordelia 's strongest traits , her honesty , is also highlighted in " Earshot " , where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends , who avoid her to hide these thoughts . For Cordelia however , " her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical " and because of this she embodies an " antithesis of female self @-@ sacrifice " in these years but also " the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women " . Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia 's " lack of depth " becoming " her strength " . She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid however , pointing out " Cordy 's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity , but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible . " Jowett feels Cordelia 's confidence is based in her wealth . Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed , " bitchiness enhances Cordelia 's comic appeal " , as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth @-@ telling . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 In early seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and occasionally for the damsel in distress plot device , which would require series ' heroine Buffy to save her . Any concerns that she was simply one @-@ dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley , which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential . In an article about the psychology of characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Steven C. <unk> writes about how " Cordelia is wealthy and , at first glance , superficial , appearing to care most about her own popularity . However , as the show progresses , we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion . She is a reluctant participant , baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander . " He goes on to describe how Cordelia , and " all the characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes . " Discussing Cordelia 's relationship with Xander , Carpenter says , " A lot of Cordy 's conflict , and a lot of who she is , comes out around Xander . Because she is in love with him in spite of herself , or in spite of him . I have my best moments with [ Nicholas Brendon ] . " However , her character 's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern ; " I wasn 't sure how I felt about it , because I didn 't want to lose my edge . I didn 't want her to be nice ; I didn 't want her to change because that 's who she is . " Carpenter 's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia , and she explains , " That 's why I enjoy playing her so much . She 's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her ? But I [ try ] not to lose her edge , her honesty . " Carpenter claims that Cordelia 's " rough edges " made for difficult experiences with fans , who expected her to be snobby like her character . Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire , which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance , " Graduation Day , Part Two " . 
 Over the course of her appearances in Angel , Cordelia would develop enormously as a character . Describing this evolution , Carpenter comments , " When I first started playing Cordelia , she wasn 't nice . She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility . She 's a team player , which was not the case in the beginning . " Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi @-@ faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress , describing 
 The road Cordelia has travelled , the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress , because there have been so many chances to do so many different emotions . Heroic , vulnerable , just angry , possessed , funny – I get to be all those different things rolled into one . Getting this role , in hindsight ... God I made a good decision , or they did . 
 Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to " selfish , superficial Los Angeles " , which turned out to be her " trial by fire " . 
 Executive producer David Greenwalt was very keen to acquire the character of Cordelia for the spin @-@ off series , commenting , " I desperately wanted her to come to Angel because Angel being dark and broody , we need a big bright smile . " At the same time , Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of Buffy where " All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging , and it was sort of like , where 's Cordelia ? " , leading him to introduce Spike ( James Marsters ) to the cast to accommodate her absence . Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a " rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS . So in episode one of Angel , Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail , actually . " Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins " finding within herself a new level of humanity " . 
 Greenwalt discusses how Cordelia " is sort of forced to become a deeper character " when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless , " She 's sort of living with one foot in the world of ' I want to be an actress ' and with another foot in the world of ' I want to save and help people , and I have a deeper purpose and mission . ' " Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a " vainglorious high schooler to someone who 's almost like a superhero " ; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress . From the tenth episode , " Parting Gifts " , Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series . It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle , whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him . The first season finale saw Cordelia 's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her , and to effectively act this , Carpenter 's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation . The scene took over eight hours to film , and Carpenter was relieved when it was over . The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need , stating " I saw the world and there 's so much pain . We have to help them . " Carpenter explains , " Through the suffering of the world , and through her own experiences , she discovers what 's important in life . " 
 Carpenter pleaded to the producers to let her cut her hair in the second season of Angel , but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a " dark edge of Cordelia " which wasn 't as " warm and effervescent as she usually is " , so for the third season they wanted her to " go shorter and blonder " . Angel 's third season demonstrates Cordelia 's development into a fully @-@ fledged heroine . The episode " Birthday " saw her being offered the chance to live a life where she never met Angel , but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half @-@ demon who can better withstand the visions she carries . In " Billy " , Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly . Carpenter began to train extensively with the show 's stunt co @-@ ordinators both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry . In the episode " Waiting in the Wings " , both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become , with Cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale . Also in this episode , she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another , but their love goes unconsummated . Critically , Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia 's ascension to the heavens at the end of season three to be the " point that the Mutant Enemy Productions writers evidently lost their minds " . She goes on to describe how Cordelia 's compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character . Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when " the character who embraces her privilege ( Cordelia ) gets to become a higher being and exit Angel , and as an overwhelmingly positive force " where later Fred ( Amy Acker ) , " the character who is conflicted about her privilege " in season five " ends up being possessed by a millennia @-@ old demon " . 
 Angel season four played with audience 's expectations of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season 's Big Bad ; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine . The storyline was controversial with fans , and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel 's teenage son . Carpenter has said , " I 'm in denial about that whole storyline . It was creepy . " However , director Terrence O 'Hara comments that Carpenter had " a lot of fun " with playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode " Orpheus " because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia 's new " schizophrenic madwoman " characterization . The episode " Inside Out " saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia 's character , where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite the birth of the child they conceived together . In an effort to stop Connor , the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor 's mother Darla ( Julie Benz ) to convince him not to go through with it . The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black , while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality . Steven S. DeKnight , who wrote and directed the episode , felt this was a brilliant role @-@ reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire . Much of season four 's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter 's real @-@ life pregnancy ; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode " Inside Out " she is left in a coma for the remainder of the fourth season . Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season , 
 It 's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely ; it 's that she seduces a boy she once diapered ; it 's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject . It 's that she 's not Cordy , and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much @-@ beloved character . 
 Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also discuss the treatment of Cordelia ( and Darla ) in " Angel 's Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul : Investigating the Abject in ' Television Horror ' " , from Reading Angel : The TV Spin @-@ off With a Soul by Stacey Abbot . They see the send @-@ offs of Cordelia , Fred and other characters as part of a pattern of highly gendered " elaborated abjection " seen in Angel . They also see Cordelia 's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern : " More so than other characters in [ Buffy ] and Angel , Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape , either symbolically or literally " and recounts the demon impregnation in " Expecting " , and similarly in " Epiphany " , where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in " Through the Looking Glass " . Cordelia even remarks on this , as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her " status as a violated and devalued character " ; Cordelia states , " If you ever figure out how to get us out of here , I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn 't want to impregnate me with his spawn ! " They liken the horror motif in these examples , and in " Inside Out " , to what Barbara Creed called the ' monstrous womb ' in her book The Monstrous @-@ feminine : Film , Feminism , Psychoanalysis . Jes Battis also comments how , in comparison with the Fred @-@ Illyria season five storyline , Cordelia 's storyline is not as positive as Fred 's rebirth , because Fred got to " ' live on ' through Illyria , whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue @-@ haired reincarnation " . Continuing , they say that in fact , there is no meaningful connection between the " real " Cordelia and Jasmine , as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is , " and the ' true ' Cordy wakes up from her coma " . Further illustrating the comparisons , " Fred / Illyria become a joined mother / daughter subjectivity , a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable ; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy , vibrant Cordy that everyone knew . " Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these <unk> , Battis notes 
 Cordelia , a vocal advocate of her own privilege , creates a fully formed supernatural being , Jasmine , who attempts ( shockingly ) to control the world . Fred , on the other hand , who <unk> her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness , has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria . 
 For Angel 's fifth season , as with Buffy 's fourth , Spike steps in to replace Cordelia as a source of comedic dialogue within the series . It is also noted by critics that , in the fifth season , " it doesn 't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia , giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not " . Concerning Cordelia 's last appearance in Angel 's fifth and final season , Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the " mission statement " of the show , as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began . Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to — through Cordelia , who was " there at the beginning " — ask of Angel , " Where are you now ? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that ? " The return to the show 's " original concerns " is echoed by the flashback to Doyle 's first season advertisement ; Sara <unk> points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel " You forgot who you are , " bringing back the show 's link to the city . Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel ' back on track ' , but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations . Writer / director David Fury explains that since " we couldn 't get Sarah " the episode was instead written for Cordelia . He adds , " This turned out to be a <unk> because Charisma was fantastic . " In the original script , Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable . The scene was never shot because " the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9 @-@ month coma was enough . We just didn 't want to tip it too soon , " says Fury .

 Drakengard 2 is an action role @-@ playing game developed by Cavia for the PlayStation 2 . It was released in Japan by Square Enix on June 16 , 2005 and by Ubisoft on February 14 and March 3 , 2006 in North America and Europe respectively . It is the second entry in the Drakengard series and a direct sequel to the original Drakengard : the story revolves around Nowe , a boy raised by the dragon Legna , fighting against a tyrannical faction of Knights , encountering characters from the previous game and becoming entangled in the fate of the world . 
 Like the original , Drakengard 2 combines on @-@ foot hack and slash with aerial combat stages and RPG game mechanics . The previous game 's producer , writer and character designer returned to their respective roles . The game was designed as a more mainstream game in light of the previous game 's dark aesthetic and story . The game sold 206 @,@ 000 copies by the end of 2005 . Western reviews praised the story , but gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay . A spin @-@ off from the series , Nier , was released in 2010 , while a third entry in the series , Drakengard 3 , was released in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As with the original Drakengard , the game is split into chapters and subdivided into ground @-@ based and airborne missions . The story of the game dictates which missions come when during the initial playthrough and how they play out , though as the player progresses , new remixed versions of the various playable levels called " free missions " are unlocked , which allow the player to go through the missions with the story elements removed . The player can jump between the game world 's self @-@ contained areas via a world map unlocked after the first chapter . In between the various chapters and missions , the player builds up their characters using experience points earned in battle : the characters ' weapons and abilities , and the abilities of the player 's dragon , can be gradually improved . The player 's view of the world is through a fixed camera , which tracks the player 's progress across the player area . <unk> in the form of weapons and items such as armor and health points and items needed to progress within the level are also available for the player to seek out . The game features Normal , Hard , and Expert difficulty levels , and there are multiple weapons and items to collect throughout the levels . 
 Combat in the game is similar to its predecessor , with the main series of missions beginning after an opening tutorial . The game features ground @-@ based hack @-@ and @-@ slash gameplay and aerial combat . In ground combat , the player controls multiple characters , switching between them via the pause menu in order to use their different weapons . The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short @-@ range battle , while magical attacks are used for long @-@ range attacks and groups of enemies . The magical attacks vary between the playable characters . Weapons , characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat : weapons have a four @-@ level cap . 
 Aerial gameplay puts the main character atop his dragon , which is guided round by the player to attack enemy formations and large structures on the ground or enemies and airships in the sky . The player can also jump between the dragon and the ground during ground @-@ based missions . The dragon has the ability to launch two types of fireballs : a homing variety that deals damage to single enemies , and a widespread attack which does higher damage to groups . Alongside this , the dragon can perform a special attack called " Dragon Overdrive " , which kills many normal enemy units outright and deals high damage to stronger units and bosses . The dragon also gains experience and levels up through combat , dealing more damage in its attacks as it grows stronger . It also evolves and grows stronger at points directly linked to the game 's narrative .

 Drakengard 2 takes place in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard . In the original game , two powers , the Empire and the Union , were engaged in a religious war over the Seals , magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity . Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus , a human and a dragon who had made a pact ( a magical ritual that linked their souls ) , and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe . Though they ultimately failed , Angelus became the new seal , averting the end of the world . Eighteen years later , the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal , who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land . 
 The game 's main character is Nowe ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a Knight of the Seal gifted with superhuman powers . Nowe 's companion is Legna ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a dragon who helped raise Nowe and was involved in the events of 18 years before . Accompanying Nowe on his journey is Manah ( <unk> , Mana ) , the main antagonist of the first game who now seeks to free the people from the oppression of the Knights ; Eris ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a female Knight of the Seal and Nowe 's childhood friend ; and Urick ( <unk> , <unk> ) a former Knight who made a pact with the Grim Reaper in exchange for his mortality . The main villain of the game is Gismor ( <unk> , <unk> ) , leader of the Knights of the Seal . Returning from the first game are Caim ( <unk> , Kaimu ) , the previous game 's main protagonist ; Angelus ( <unk> , <unk> ) , the current Goddess of the Seal ; and Seere ( <unk> , <unk> ) , once a companion to Caim and now the Hierarch of the Union . Minor characters include the guardians of the Seals , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) and Yaha ( <unk> , Yaha ) , and <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , who helped raise Nowe . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The game begins with Nowe becoming a fully @-@ fledged Knight of the Seal . During his first mission , Nowe begins to doubt the ethics of the Knights ' methods , as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong . During a second mission to ensure the protection of the seal in the District of Soul Flame , Nowe encounters Manah , who kills the guardian <unk> and destroys the seal . Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake , but uses her magic to escape . After returning from the mission , Nowe is poisoned by Gismor , who reveals to have killed Nowe 's adoptive father <unk> . Surviving and escaping with Legna , Nowe is pursued by the Knights , including Eris , who wishes to persuade him to return . Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and , in her mind , free the people from the Knights ' oppression . On their way to the second seal , Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights ' oppression , fully winning him over . The two then fight and kill Lieutenant <unk> , destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water . After this , they are joined by Urick , a former Lieutenant of the Knights , to rout a group of bandits . Attacked by the Knights , they are unexpectedly saved by Caim , who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal . After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light , Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death . Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life , which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district . Urick and Nowe face off against Caim , who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off . Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed . 
 Nowe and Manah head for the final seal in the District of Heavenly Time , guarded by Gismor himself . Nowe and Gismor battle , and Gismor is wounded again , transforming into a shadow @-@ like being and using Eris to block Nowe 's final attack . Believing Eris dead , Nowe and Manah pursue <unk> , but are met by Seere , who unsuccessfully tries to stop them . When they confront Gismor , he reveals himself to be a vindictive survivor of the Empire from eighteen years before . Defeated , Gismor destroys the final seal himself , releasing Angelus from her imprisonment . After Seere reveals the true consequences of Manah 's actions , Nowe and Legna pursue Angelus . When they find her , they find that Angelus has been driven mad by the pain of being the final seal . Caim asks them to kill her , and as she dies , he and Angelus share a final moment together before fading away . With the seals destroyed , the world begins to fall into chaos and Manah is driven mad by the memories of her actions eighteen years before . Legna then take Nowe to the fortress of the holy dragons , where they hear a prophecy concerning Nowe : according to the prophecy , Nowe is a New Breed created to aid the dragons in their war against the Watchers . Nowe then reunites with Eris , who had been healed by Seere , and frees Manah from her madness . Legna then takes the three to the Promised Land , a dragon stronghold which holds the Bone Casket , an object given to the dragons by and imbued with the power of the Watchers which can speed up Nowe 's evolution into the New Breed . It is also where Seere has gone to initiate a new Goddess of the Seal . The game has three endings , each achieved on a separate playthrough . 
 Ending A : The group arrive in the Promised Land and Legna prepares to enact the prophecy , but Nowe instead chooses to find a new Goddess . Legna calls the Holy Dragons to battle , but Seere leads an army of <unk> against them . With everything seeming lost , Manah and Nowe share a final kiss , which triggers Nowe 's transformation into the New Breed . Nowe and Legna do battle , and Legna is killed . Eris then reveals that she is to become the new Goddess . Eris is initiated , and although the world is restored , Nowe and Manah feel sad that no other solution could be found . 
 Ending B : When they arrive , Legna reveals Eris ' fate to become the new Goddess and Nowe chooses to follow Legna 's plan . But upon trying to enter the Casket , it rejects him and fuses with Manah . Legna and Nowe battle Manah , who sacrifices herself to destroy the Bone Casket 's power . Nowe , Legna and Eris then lead the Holy Dragons in their war against the Watchers . 
 Ending C : Events proceed as in Ending B , but when the Casket attacks Manah , she manages to win the fight against it . Legna summons the Holy Dragons and events proceed as in Ending A. After Legna 's defeat and the destruction of the Bone Casket , both the Watchers and the dragons fade , leaving the world safe and humans free to create a new future for themselves .

 Drakengard 2 was announced in December 2004 . Producer Takamasa Shiba and character designer Kimihiko Fujisaka returned to the team , alongside actor Shinnosuke Ikehata , who voiced the dragon Angelus and its partner Caim in the previous game . The original director , Taro Yoko , originally proposed a space adventure involving dragons , but this was vetoed at an early stage . Yoko was not involved in creating the narrative as he had been in Drakengard , being mostly tied up with another project , though he was able to observe the project 's progress . He and Drakengard 2 's director Akira Yasui suffered from creative differences , with the result that Yoko termed their relationship on the project as a " love @-@ hate " story in a 2013 interview concerning the series . Their relationship inspired one of the stories created for an in @-@ game weapon . Yoko was eventually brought on fairly late in the game 's production to act as video editor for the CGI cutscenes and trailers . The game 's cast featured multiple film and television actors , including Ryo Katsuji , Saki <unk> , <unk> and veteran actor Yoshio Harada . Shiba commented at the time that he felt they had gathered a very good voice cast for the game . 
 One of the decisions Yasui made was to make Drakengard 2 far more colorful than the previous game , wanting to do something that was the " opposite " of Drakengard . In contrast to the previous game , the game contained far less of the mature themes found in the original . Shiba , speaking in a 2013 interview , said that the reason for this was that Square Enix , the company 's Japanese publisher , wanted that aspect toned down to make a more mainstream game . It was designed to keep some dark aesthetics from its predecessor , with the previous game 's theme of immorality as one of the key character and narrative themes , as well as themes of war and death . Other themes explored were love and hate , and the ambivalence represented in the world 's prevalent factions ( the Knights of the Seal , and the Cult of Watchers ) . <unk> aspects of the story were the father @-@ son relationship between Nowe and Legna , and how Manah had matured since the events of Drakengard . To promote the game in Japan , Fujisaka created a light @-@ toned joke advertisement under the name <unk> , referring to the original names of the two dragon characters . While Square Enix published the title in Japan , they entered an agreement with developer and publishing company Ubisoft to publish the title overseas . Ubisoft also handled the game 's localization . 
 = = = Character design = = = 
 One of the main concepts for main protagonist Nowe was surpassing one 's father . For the fight between Nowe and Legna , special gameplay functions and mechanics needed to be created for Nowe . Shiba had mixed feelings about the final fight between Legna and Nowe , which he saw as a drastic change from both the first game and the series mechanic of the protagonist riding a dragon . Shiba ended up writing their dialogue to emphasize their relationship and the difficulty of them fighting each other , paralleling earlier scenes between Caim and Angelus . The deaths of Caim and Angelus was intended to be " short and ruthless " , but Yasui had it changed to the more sentimental version present in the game . Dialogue from Caim for the scene was cut from the game due to it clashing with his previous portrayal as a mute . Urick was created to be the supportive " big brother " of the party . 
 Although the main characters were designed by Fujisaka , the character Legna , previously known as the " Black Dragon " , was designed by Taro Hasegawa , who was also monster designer for both Drakengard and Drakengard 2 . In addition to designing the characters , Fujisaka drew the character portraits used for character dialogue boxes during in @-@ game cutscenes , a feature he initially objected to . Nowe , in contrast to the other protagonists of the Drakengard series , was designed around the concept of a stereotypical hero . Nowe was one of Fujisaka 's favorite characters to design , although Shiba was less enthusiastic . Manah 's redesign in Drakengard 2 reflected both her evolved personality and her more traditional depiction as a fantasy heroine . Elements of their designs were taken from Caim and Furiae , representing " passing the torch " between characters . Because of Legna 's different roles in Drakengard and Drakengard 2 , his design and movements were altered for his second incarnation . Eris 's design was inspired by <unk> , a character from Berserk : while he tried not to copy any parts of <unk> 's design , Fujisaka tried to convey it using aspects of her personality . He also tried to balance this part of her depiction with a tender and more feminine side . Another idea he had in mind was the image of an honors student . Her dance @-@ like fighting style was generally suggested by the game 's staff . Caim 's redesign was meant to represent his status as a wanderer . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Drakengard 2 's soundtrack was composed by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki , with supervision by Nobuyoshi Sano , who worked on the music of Drakengard and acted as Sound Director for the game . Due to criticism of his work on the first game , Sano was asked by Shiba to bring in outside help for the second game 's soundtrack : Matsumoto was brought in because of his work on the songs " Yuki no Hana " and " Tsuki no Shizuku " , and , Yoshiki was brought on at Matsumoto 's request . The soundtrack was designed to be a fusion of J @-@ pop and conventional video game music , and to evoke the emotions of the various characters and the feeling of battle . The game 's theme song in Japan , " Hitori " , was sung by Mika Nakashima , who also worked as a sound producer . The theme song for the game 's English release was " Growing Wings " , a localized version of the first game 's theme song sung by Kari Wahlgren .

 Drakengard 2 sold well in Japan . The game was considered a hit in Japan by Ubisoft , selling 100 @,@ 000 units in its first week , and reaching sales of 170 @,@ 000 units by the end of the month , becoming the second best @-@ selling game of June behind Sega 's GBA port of <unk> : King of the Beetles . It eventually sold just over 206 @,@ 000 copies by the end of 2005 . The game was eventually re @-@ released as part of Square Enix 's Ultimate Hits series , re @-@ releases of high @-@ selling titles . Drakengard 2 received a score of 30 / 40 from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu . The game received " average " reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . 
 The story received mixed to positive reviews . IGN 's Ed Lewis said it " admirably [ continued ] the bizarre and fantastically medieval world that was established in the original game . " , while GameSpot 's Greg Meuller called it " Interesting [ ... ] with plenty of twists and turns " . Eurogamer 's Simon Parkin cited the story as being very good , though he found Nowe " a little nauseating to watch as the weighty , dark ( and pretty good ) plot unfolds " , and VideoGamer.com 's Adam Jarvis called the story " one of the highlights of the package " . The 1UP reviewer called the " clear undercurrent of " maybe the good guys are the bad guys , " " one of the main reasons to keep playing the game . In contrast , the reviewer for GameTrailers called it " a cookie @-@ cutter RPG plot " where players could " predict nearly every plot twist the game throws at [ them ] . " , 
 The graphics received mixed reviews . Lewis called them " more interesting than the first game , but marginally so " , and Meuller called them " dated " , with environments seeming " bland and drab , and the enemies [ looking ] generic " . The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations , but cited the environments as bland and felt that there were too few FMVs and too many game engine @-@ driven cutscenes , which he described as " awful " . Parkin criticized the game 's graphic capacities , commenting that players would " stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in the corner to guide your character towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords . " , while Jarvis said that it had not improved from the previous game and called the colors " very murky , drab and dark " . 1UP said that the graphics " [ don 't ] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia 's other titles like Ghost in the Shell : Stand Alone Complex [ or ] Naruto : Uzumaki <unk> " . 
 The gameplay was universally criticized . Parkin called the battle gameplay " lightweight " and the balance between ground and aerial combat poor despite a good character leveling system , while Lewis described it as being without strategy , with the game " just dumping in more boring enemies to wade through " . GameTrailers said that there was " nothing new here . " , while Meuller called it " dull at best and frustrating at worst " . 1UP said that the combat was " almost sickening to look at . " , though he cited the RPG elements as a redeeming feature . Jarvis simply called the gameplay " Same old , same old " , citing it as a major fault of the game .

 In September 2013 , the game was given an honorable mention among Kotaku 's Tim Rogers as one of the best games on the PS2 . Rogers gave praise to the game 's parry mechanic and atmosphere . In the year of its release in Japan , the game received a novelization written by Emi Nagashima under her pen name of Jun Eishima . Yoko and Shiba teamed up again to create another game in the series , but that eventually developed into Nier , a spin @-@ off from the first game 's fifth ending . After Nier 's release , Cavia was absorbed into AQ Interactive , then Yoko left to become a freelance . An attempt by Shiba to begin development of a third Drakengard game at AQ Interactive were unsuccessful . Drakengard 3 was eventually unveiled in 2013 , with Shiba , Yoko and Fujisaka returning to their former roles and the story being set before the original game . Both Shiba and Yoko have voiced their willingness to continue the series on next @-@ generation consoles if there were sufficient sales and funds , while Yoko also expressed interest in making a second spin @-@ off , although he did not specify whether it would be set in the world of Nier or not .

 = Australian Army Reserve = 
 The Australian Army Reserve is a collective name given to the reserve units of the Australian Army . Since the Federation of Australia in 1901 , the reserve military force has been known by many names , including the Citizens Forces , the Citizen Military Forces , the Militia and , unofficially , the Australian Military Forces . In 1980 , however , the current name — Australian Army Reserve — was officially adopted , and it now consists of a number of components based around the level of commitment and training obligation that its members are required to meet . 
 = = Overview = = 
 For the first half of the 20th century , due to a widespread distrust of permanent military forces in Australia , the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning . Following the end of World War II , however , this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment , and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals . Since then , Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army , and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles . As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era , the organisation , structure , training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes , and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments , not only within Regular Army units , but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units . 
 Despite being the main focus upon which Australian defence planning was based , since Federation Reserve units have primarily been used in the role of home defence and to provide a mobilisation platform during times of war . During World War I Australia 's contribution to the fighting came from forces raised outside of the citizens forces that were in existence at the time , and although many citizen soldiers enlisted in these forces , the Citizens Forces units remained in Australia . With the outbreak of World War II a similar situation evolved , with the establishment of an all volunteer expeditionary force , however , with the entry of Japan into the war the threat to Australia became more direct and a number of Militia units were called upon to fight in New Guinea and other areas of the South West Pacific . 
 Following the end of World War II , however , the decision was made to establish a permanent standing defence force and the role of Reserve forces was reduced to the point where for a while their relevance was called into question . Recently , however , there has been a move to develop a more capable Reserve force , as Australia 's overseas military commitments in the Pacific and Middle East have highlighted the importance of the Reserves once more . As such , since 2000 units of the Australian Army Reserve have been deployed to East Timor and the Solomon Islands on peacekeeping duties and many more individual Reservists have been used to provide specialist capabilities and to fill in Regular Army formations being sent overseas .

 = = = Federation to World War I = = = 
 Following the Federation of Australia in 1901 , the amalgamation of the military forces controlled by the six separate , self @-@ governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable , albeit slowly realised , consequence , given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power solely to the Commonwealth . Indeed , this process took some time as , to a large extent , matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time , and there was also a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system . Nevertheless , the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901 , and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army . At the outset , the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part @-@ time volunteers . This was arguably due to two factors . Firstly , there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low , while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army . 
 After the initial transfer of forces in March 1901 , further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments took time to develop . Indeed , it was not until 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed , providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate . Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas , the military forces were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure . As a part of this , state @-@ based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments , supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units , while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries . Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide for the establishment of a regular infantry force , the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part @-@ time militia was set out in legislation . 
 The lack of importance placed on military matters in Australian political circles continued for some time , and the size of the Australian military in this time continued to fall , in part due to the emphasis placed upon mounted units in the new command structure . However , following a number of strategic and political " scares " , defence matters slowly began to take on more primacy in the Australian psyche before a review of defence needs was made in 1909 by Field Marshal Lord Kitchener . The result of this review was the realisation of the need to build a credible defence force that could not only defend the nation , but also possibly contribute to the Imperial defence system ( although this later realisation remained little more than a consideration on paper only ) . The review also validated the compulsory military training scheme that was to be introduced in 1910 , which was directly responsible for expanding the Citizens Forces by up to 50 percent in the three years prior to the outbreak of World War I. 
 Undoubtedly , the scheme proved to have numerous benefits , as many of these youths went on to serve in the First AIF during World War I and the expanded organisation allowed citizens forces officers more experience in commanding formed bodies of men . However , it was the main factor contributing to the decision to recruit the AIF on the basis of voluntary enlistment . Because the army in 1914 was largely made up of young men aged between 19 and 21 who had been enlisted under this scheme , and due to the provisions of the Defence Act that precluded sending conscripts overseas , upon the outbreak of the war it was necessary for the Australian government to raise a separate force , outside of the Citizens Forces organisation for service overseas . Regardless , it has been estimated that up to 50 @,@ 000 militiamen subsequently enlisted in the First AIF during the war . 
 During the precautionary stage on 2 August 1914 , Citizens Forces units were called up to guard essential points and man coastal forts and harbour defences . The first Australian shots ( many sources report the first Allied shots ) of both World War I and World War II were fired by the garrison at Fort Nepean . By June 1918 , 9 @,@ 215 home service troops were on active duty in Australia , alongside 2 @,@ 476 regular soldiers . From 1915 , only skeleton garrisons were maintained at coastal forts , but the personnel manning them were forbidden to enlist in the AIF . This ban was lifted in April 1915 but the presence of a German commerce raider in Australian waters caused a mobilisation from February to April 1916 , while another mobilisation occurred in April 1918 for the same reason . Just before the end of World War I , Australia 's home forces were reorganised to perpetuate the numerical identities of the AIF units . This was done renumbering the infantry regiments that had been formed in 1912 , and giving them the numbers of the AIF units that had been formed in their regimental areas . A total of 60 AIF infantry battalions had seen active service during the war , but there were more than 60 infantry regiments ; as a result , a number of the Citizens Force regiments were reorganised with multiple battalions , while other units were converted to pioneer regiments . 
 = = = Post World War I = = = 
 Following the end of World War I the units that had been raised as part of the AIF were disbanded , and the focus of Australian defence planning returned once more to the maintenance of the Citizens Forces . To this end , a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270 @,@ 000 men in the event of a war , of which half of this would be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment . It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re @-@ organised along the lines of the AIF , adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and maintaining their battle honours . The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation of the Citizens Forces was adopted a month later ; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme , the abolition of infantry regiments and the re @-@ establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF , as well as various other units , such as light horse regiments , as well . 
 There was little support for compulsory military service amongst the public , however , and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt at that time to reduce defence spending , the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented . Although the compulsory training scheme was retained , it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas , essentially ending the scheme in rural areas . The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127 @,@ 000 to only 37 @,@ 000 in 1922 . Throughout the 1920s , numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained , it was little more than a skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically . 
 In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , the compulsory training scheme was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Citizens Forces would be maintained on a part @-@ time , voluntary basis only . At this time it was also decided to change the name of the force , with the title of " Militia " being adopted as it was felt that it implied voluntary service rather than forced . The force would be based upon the five divisions of the old AIF , although it was decided to limit the overall number of units . This force would also be armed with modern weapons and equipment . That , at least , was the promise , however , in reality this never came to fruition and to a large extent they continued to be trained and equipped with 1914 – 18 equipment right up to and during World War II . The result of this change in recruitment policy was a huge drop in the size of the Army , as numbers fell by almost 20 @,@ 000 in one year as there was little prospect for training and as the financial difficulties of the Great Depression began to be felt . As a result , in 1930 the decision was made to disband or amalgamate a number of units and five infantry battalions and two light horse regiments were removed from the order of battle . The following year , nine more infantry battalions were disbanded . 
 Between 1929 and 1937 , the number of soldiers within the Militia who could provide effective service was well below the force 's actual on paper strength as many soldiers were unable to attend even a six @-@ day annual camp out of fear of losing their civilian employment . Also it has been estimated that up to 50 per cent of the Militia 's other ranks were medically unfit . The numbers situation had become so tenuous that it was rare for a battalion to be able to field even 100 men during an exercise , so units accepted men that would not normally meet the medical requirements , indeed it has been stated that men who were " lame and practically blind " were allowed to join in an effort to improve numbers . To illustrate this , in 1936 , the largest battalion — the 30th / 51st Battalion — had just 412 personnel of all ranks , while the 11th / 16th Battalion , which was the smallest , had only 156 men . 
 Financially the Militia was neglected also . Despite the upturn in the economic situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time . As the situation continued to improve , however , the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935 . Indeed , in 1938 the government decided to double the strength of the Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon , and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35 @,@ 000 to 43 @,@ 000 men over the space of three months . This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80 @,@ 000 men serving on a part @-@ time voluntary basis . Nevertheless , there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result , when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and the nation as a whole was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the war , the government 's immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin calling up 10 @,@ 000 militiamen at a time to provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country . This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia , in two drafts of 40 @,@ 000 men , for one month 's continuous training , however , the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940 . On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would be raised for overseas service , but there was still large @-@ scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the Defence Act still precluded conscripts from serving outside of Australian territory , so it was announced that this force would be raised from volunteers only and would not be raised directly from the Militia . Conscripts , however , were required to serve in the Militia , with the result being that the Militia 's ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time . 
 As was the case during World War I , many members of the Militia would go on to serve in the Second AIF . Nevertheless , for a period of time the government attempted to limit the number of militiamen transferring across to the AIF to build defences at home against concerns that Britain might not be able to fulfil its pledge to defend Singapore in the event of an attack there by the Japanese . As such , once again Australia maintained a policy of two armies . For the first two years Australia 's involvement in the war was focused in overseas theatres in Europe , the Middle East and North Africa , and during this time it was the AIF that was involved in the fighting overseas , while units of the Militia were used in garrison duties in Australia and New Guinea , then an Australian territory . During this time , the Militia units came to be derided by the men of the AIF units , with militiamen sometimes being labelled as " chocolate soldiers " or " koalas " . 
 This changed dramatically , however , following the entry of Japan into the war on 8 December 1941 , with the attack on Pearl Harbor and on the British forces in Malaya . Suddenly the war was brought to Australia 's doorstep and there was a risk that the Japanese could attempt to invade the Australian mainland . In April 1942 , the threat of invasion of Australia seemed very real following the loss of Malaya and Singapore and the subsequent Japanese landings in New Guinea . Seeing the threat that the Japanese posed to Australia , the government had begun to bring AIF units back from the Middle East but the bulk of the forces immediately available for the defence of Australia came from the militia , which was at that stage an organisation of some 265 @,@ 000 men organised into five infantry and two cavalry divisions . 
 Despite earlier derision , a number of Militia units went on to perform with distinction during the Pacific War , especially in 1942 , when they fought Japanese forces in New Guinea . As the situation in the Pacific worsened in July 1942 and the Japanese drove towards Port Moresby , members of the Militia found themselves on the front lines . As reinforcements were brought up from Australia , the Militia units that had been sent to New Guinea as garrison troops earlier in the war were called upon to fight a stubborn rearguard action on the Kokoda Track to delay the Japanese advance long enough for these reinforcements to arrive . At the same time , the Militia battalions of the 7th Brigade played a key role in the Battle of Milne Bay , when Australian and United States forces defeated the Japanese in a large @-@ scale battle for the first time during the war . 
 Later in the war , the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed to change the law to allow the transfer of Militia units to the AIF if 65 percent or more of their personnel had volunteered for overseas service . Additionally , changes to the Act meant that Militia units were able to serve anywhere south of the Equator in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , excluding western Java and northern Borneo , and as a result of this , Militia units saw action against Japanese forces in the Dutch East Indies , at Merauke , later in the war . Despite this , the AIF remained the Australian Army 's main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200 @,@ 000 members of the Militia transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict . Nevertheless , 32 Militia infantry battalions , later organised into three Militia divisions ( 3rd , 5th and 11th ) , saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns : Salamaua @-@ Lae , Huon Peninsula , Finisterre Range , New Britain and Bougainville .

 Due to an <unk> of resources early in the war , the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942 . As a result , the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over , and when it had finally come to an end , the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible . Understandably , defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives after the war and as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces ( CMF ) was reformed . 
 Subsequent reviews of defence policy and the strategic situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted in the formation of the Australian Regiment in 1948 , the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army . From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF , signifying if not an end to Australian military planners ' reliance upon citizen soldiers , at least a shift in focus and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II . This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war . Initially , the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50 @,@ 000 men organised into two divisions and other units , however , recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment . Indeed , in its first year of existence , the actual strength of the CMF was only 8 @,@ 698 personnel , although this rose the following year to 16 @,@ 202 and to 32 @,@ 779 in 1950 . In March 1951 , a system of compulsory national service was re @-@ established . 
 The reintroduction of this conscription scheme saw the numbers of the CMF rise substantially but its management and administration required the allocation of a large number of resources and personnel from the Regular Army at a time when the army Regular Army already heavily committed in Korea and Malaya and so the scheme was suspended in 1959 . This was a significant blow to the CMF and its strength fell by more than half in that year to 20 @,@ 000 men . Further changes came with the introduction of the pentropic ( five battle group ) division into the Australian Army in 1960 . This proved a disaster for the CMF , as wholesale changes were made and units removed from the order of battle . Seven artillery regiments were disbanded from an original total of 17 , while 31 infantry battalions were reduced to 17 . This excluded the University Regiments and the Papua New Guinea Volunteer Rifles which remained unchanged . The remaining battalions were later merged into just nine battalions . Meanwhile , the CMF armoured units had already been rationalised in 1957 and as a result the change to the pentropic structure mostly resulted in a change in role only , such as the 4th / 19th Prince of Wales 's Light Horse , which changed from an armoured unit to a reconnaissance regiment . The two CMF armoured brigade headquarters were also disbanded . 
 At the same time , it was decided to amalgamate old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi @-@ battalion state @-@ based regiments . While the pentropic system eventually fell by the wayside , these regiments have endured , maintaining the battle honours of the previously existing Militia units that had perpetuated the units of the AIF and serving as a valuable link to the traditions and service of earlier units . Nevertheless , many CMF soldiers felt that the introduction of these regiments reduced the Army 's links to the community due to the move away from the traditional regionally based system and as a result many of these soldiers chose to leave the organisation . In 1965 , as the pentropic system was abandoned , a further re @-@ organisation of the CMF was undertaken as existing battalions were reduced and additional battalions were raised in the more populous areas , namely in Queensland , Victoria and New South Wales . Concerns about the regional identity of these units were addressed by reintroducing the old numerical designations . In 1966 , the Army authorised the raising of six remote area battalions , one in each state . These units offered special conditions of service for men who could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence . Ultimately though the Tasmanian battalion was never formed . 
 The subordinate relationship between the CMF and Regular Army was further underlined when the national service scheme was re @-@ introduced in 1965 , albeit in the guise of a selective ballot . Whereas previous incarnations of the system had not allowed for national servicemen to be sent overseas ( within various definitions of that term ) , the new scheme was implemented with the express purpose of sending these recruits overseas as Australia 's commitments in the region required a large @-@ scale increase in the Army . Additionally , instead of being used to fill the ranks of the CMF , the scheme was essentially used to expand the Regular Army . Due to the terms of service , national servicemen were required to serve two years full @-@ time in Regular Army units , after which they were required to serve a further three years in the CMF . Despite this , however , potential conscripts were given the option to voluntarily enlist in the CMF prior to their date of birth being announced , thus exempting them from being drafted for overseas service . Due to the desire of many to avoid being sent overseas , as a result of this option , it was estimated that by 1968 almost half of the 35 @,@ 000 men in the CMF had joined to avoid being drafted . 
 This led to a widespread public perception that the CMF was a refuge for " draft dodgers " , and to the creation of an organisation in which the majority of its members had little or no motivation to fulfil their training obligations . Although this was not a universal experience , overall it affected the morale of the CMF and , coupled with the decision by the government not to activate CMF units for service in Vietnam , this led to a decline in genuine voluntary enlistment . To a large extent also , the government 's decision to not use the CMF during this time highlighted the organisation 's increasing structural irrelevance , and questions about the role that the CMF had to play in the defence of Australia would remain until following the end of the Vietnam War . Meanwhile , the last CMF armoured regiment gave up its tanks in 1971 . 
 = = = Post Vietnam War to the new millennium = = = 
 When the Whitlam Government came to power in late 1972 , the CMF was in a very poor state . The new government moved quickly to end conscription , and this caused the CMF 's strength to fall by roughly 5 @,@ 000 to 23 @,@ 119 by June 1973 . In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced , under the chairmanship of Dr. <unk> Millar and the subsequent report developed from this inquiry became known as the Millar Report . Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted , the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time , however , the way in which the government chose to implement the recommendations , and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed to lapse , ultimately served to at least partially justify some of the cynicism voiced in certain CMF circles about the report . 
 The committee found that the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self , depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks . However , it still found that there was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time , although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation in a time of war would be built , instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army . This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force , in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other , and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve . 
 Nevertheless , due to further cuts in defence spending and an eagerness of the government to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal , units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others , thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon recruitment and retention . Further , the decision was made to abolish the old CMF divisions , as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation , but rather a force that could provide individual sub @-@ units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army . <unk> of training was also a result of the Millar Report ; beforehand , recruit training had been an ad hoc process managed mainly by the units themselves . Other issues such as pay and conditions of service , protection of civilian employment and recruitment and retention were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently . 
 Further reviews came in this time as Defence planners attempted to grapple with the questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades . The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb 's 1986 review of Australia 's defence capabilities seemed to provide the Reserves with a definite role . Nevertheless , there remained a reluctance to rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews , as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well @-@ structured reserve force , as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large @-@ scale general readiness over developing a ' hard core ' of capability within the Reserves that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency . 
 In 1991 , in an attempt to rectify this , the Ready Reserve scheme was established . Under this scheme the 6th Brigade , an existing Regular brigade based in Brisbane at the time , was converted to a Ready Reserve formation . The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full @-@ time service before returning to normal Reserve status for a further four years . The scheme showed considerable promise . Nevertheless , due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the newly elected Howard government . 
 By the time that the opening phases of the East Timor operation began in 1999 , the issue regarding the purpose of the Army Reserve still had not been resolved . Instead of being able to provide formed units to augment the Regular Army , the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round @-@ out purposes only . As a result , in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET , mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing . As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000 , however , a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full @-@ time service . 
 The deployment to East Timor highlighted the limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round @-@ out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment . As such , in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier : enacting legislation that enabled the call @-@ up of Reservists to full @-@ time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency , thereby allowing their deployment overseas , while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers . 
 The continuing high operational tempo of the Army after East Timor further emphasised the need to develop the capability of the Army Reserve . Since then increasing numbers of Reservists have been deployed overseas in varying capacities as well as undertaking periods of full @-@ time service in Australia to maintain capabilities within Regular units heavily committed to deployments to Iraq , Afghanistan , East Timor and the Solomon Islands . In lower intensity areas , such as East Timor and the Solomon Islands , formed units of Reservists raised from personnel drawn from many units , have been deployed on peacekeeping duties to relieve the pressure being placed upon the Regular Army and allowing them to focus on the higher intensity combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan . In addition to this Australian Army Reserve units have been deployed on border security duties with the Royal Australian Navy as part of Operation <unk> , as well as participating regularly in multinational exercises such as Rifle Company Butterworth . 
 As such , the role of the Army Reserve now encompasses the ' 3 Rs ' — that is reinforcement , round @-@ out and rotation . With a total strength in 2005 – 06 of just 15 @,@ 579 active personnel , recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners , nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation . Since September 2006 , in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates , Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training . This initiative shows that in recent decades , there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members . In 2008 – 09 total strength included 17 @,@ 064 active personnel . In addition there were another 12 @,@ 496 members of the Standby Reserve .

 = Maryland Senate = 
 The Maryland Senate , sometimes referred to as the Maryland State Senate , is the upper house of the General Assembly , the state legislature of the U.S. state of Maryland . Composed of 47 senators elected from an equal number of constituent single @-@ member districts , the Senate is responsible , along with the Maryland House of Delegates , for passage of laws in Maryland , and for confirming executive appointments made by the Governor of Maryland . 
 It evolved from the upper house of the colonial assembly created in 1650 when Maryland was a proprietary colony controlled by Cecilius Calvert . It consisted of the Governor and members of the Governor 's appointed council . With slight variation , the body to meet in that form until 1776 , when Maryland , now a state independent of British rule , passed a new constitution that created an electoral college to appoint members of the Senate . This electoral college was abolished in 1838 and members began to be directly elected from each county and Baltimore City . In 1972 , because of a Supreme Court decision , the number of districts was increased to 47 , and the districts were balanced by population rather than being geographically determined . 
 To serve in the Maryland Senate , a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 years of age or older . Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years coincident with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected . Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor . The Senate meets for three months every year ; the rest of the year the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time . It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years . In the 2006 election , more than two @-@ thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats . 
 Senators elect a President to serve as presiding officer of the legislative body , as well as a President Pro Tempore . The President appoints chairs and membership of six standing committees , four legislative committees as well as the Executive Nominations and Rules Committees . When compared to other state legislatures in the United States , the Maryland Senate has one of the strongest presiding officers and some of the strongest committee chairs . Senators are also organized into caucuses , including <unk> and demographically @-@ based caucuses . They are assisted in their work by paid staff of the non @-@ partisan Department of Legislative Services and by partisan office staff . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the Maryland Senate lie in the creation of an assembly during the early days of the Maryland colony . This assembly first met in 1637 , making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States . Originally , the assembly was unicameral , but in 1650 , the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now bicameral legislature . These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of the Maryland colony , Cecilius Calvert and his descendants . Thus , the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house , which was elected , tended to be more populist , and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony . 
 The upper house was briefly abolished during the English Civil War , as Puritan governors attempted to consolidate control and prevent the return of any proprietary influence . It was again abolished by Governor Josias <unk> in 1660 , who sought to create a colonial government based on an elected unicameral legislature like that of the Virginia colony . The position of Governor was removed from the legislature in 1675 , but for the following century , its function and powers largely remained the same . 
 In 1776 , following the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War , Maryland threw off proprietary control and established a new constitution . Under this new constitution , the upper house of the General Assembly first became known as the Maryland Senate . The new body consisted of fifteen Senators appointed to five @-@ year terms by an electoral college . The college , made up of two electors from each county and one each from the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis , was limited in its selections only by the stipulation that nine Senators need be from the western shore and six from the eastern shore . 
 The first election under the 1776 constitution took place in 1781 , and the system would not change again until 1838 . In the interim , a number of problems had cropped up in the appointment process , and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen . The electoral college was abolished , terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such that a third of the senate would be elected every two years , and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore . The Senate no longer acted as the Governor 's Council , although they would continue to confirm the Governor 's appointments . Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851 , when terms were shortened to four years , and 1864 , when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one , but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964 . 
 In 1964 , the Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. Sims that state legislative seats must be apportioned on the principle of one man , one vote . A number of state legislatures , including Maryland , had systems based on geography rather than population , and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment . <unk> population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties , such as those on the eastern shore , disproportionate representation . Other counties , especially those in suburban areas , were underrepresented . 
 A special session of the legislature in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats , again by county , but did so in such a way as to make the representation more proportional to population than it had been . Thus , the eastern shore , which had previously elected nine Senators , elected only four after 1965 . This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator , rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts . A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members , elected from districts proportional to the population . These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional . 
 = = Powers and legislative process = = 
 The Maryland Senate , as the upper house of the bicameral Maryland General Assembly , shares with the Maryland House of Delegates the responsibility for making laws in the state of Maryland . Bills are often developed in the period between sessions of the General Assembly by the Senate 's standing committees or by individual Senators . They are then submitted by Senators to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services for drafting of legislative language . Between 2000 and 2005 , an average of 907 bills were introduced in the Senate annually during the three @-@ month legislative session . The bill is submitted , and receives the first of three constitutionally mandated readings on the floor of the Senate , before being assigned to a committee . The decision about whether legislation passes is often made in the committees . Committees can hold legislation and prevent it from reaching the Senate floor . The recommendations of committees on bills carry tremendous weight ; it is rare for the Senate as a whole to approve legislation that has received a negative committee report . Once a committee has weighed in on a piece of legislation , the bill returns to the floor for second hearing , called the " consideration of committee " report , and a third hearing , which happens just before the floor vote on it . 
 Once passed by the Senate , a bill is sent to the House of Delegates for consideration . If the House also approves the bill without amendment , it is sent to the Governor . If there is amendment , however , the Senate may either reconsider the bill with amendments or ask for the establishment of a conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber . Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor , it may either be signed or vetoed . If it is signed , it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation , usually October 1 of that year . If it is vetoed , both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three @-@ fifths majority to overturn the veto . They may not , however , overturn a veto in the first year of a new term , since the bill would have been passed during the previous session . Additionally , joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed , although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter ; it may only decrease the Governor 's budget proposal , not increase it . 
 Unlike the House of Delegates , the Senate has the sole responsibility in the state 's legislative branch for confirming gubernatorial appointees to positions that require confirmation . After the Governor forwards his nomination to the Senate , the Executive Nominations Committee reviews the nominee and makes a recommendation for confirmation or rejection to the Senate as a whole . Only one gubernatorial nominee in recent history has been rejected ; Lynn Buhl , nominated as Maryland Secretary of the Environment by Governor Robert Ehrlich , was rejected over concerns about her qualifications . The Senate also has sole responsibility for trying any persons that have been impeached by the House of Delegates . They must be sworn in before such a trial takes place , and a two @-@ thirds majority is required for conviction of the impeached person .

 = = Organization = = 
 Maryland 's Senate consists of Senators elected from 47 Senate districts . While each Senator has the power to introduce and vote on bills and make motions on the floor , various committees , caucuses , and leadership positions help to organize the work of the Senate . Senators elect a President of the Senate , who serves as the presiding officer of the chamber . They also elect a President Pro Tempore , who presides over the chamber when the President is absent . The President of the Maryland Senate has significant influence over legislation that passes through the body through both formal means , such as his ability to appoint committee chairs and leaders of the majority party , and informal means that are less easily defined . These powers place the President of the Maryland Senate among the strongest state legislature presiding officers in the country . 
 Once legislation is introduced , it is passed to one of the standing committees of the Senate . There are six such committees . As a whole , the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing committees than any other state legislature in the United States . Each committee has between 10 and 15 members . Four of the standing committees deal primarily with legislation ; the Budget and Taxation Committee , the Education , Health , and Environmental Affairs Committee , the Finance Committee , and the Judicial Proceedings Committee . The Chairs of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees will hear a bill , and they therefore have significant influence over legislation . The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate 's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole . Lastly , the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body . It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced by a member of the Senate after the deadline for submission , and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die . Along with serving on the Senate committees , members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates . 
 While the committees are established by formal Senate rules , there are a number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process . The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus , each of which has a leader and a whip , referred to as a majority and minority leader and whip . As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate , their leader is referred to as the Majority Leader , and their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus . The Majority Leader and Minority leader are responsible for managing their party 's participation in debate on the floor . Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates . The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland , caucuses of African @-@ American and female Senators respectively , also play prominent roles in the Senate . 
 Professional services for members of the Senate and the House of Delegates are provided by the Department of Legislative Services , which is non @-@ partisan . Individual members are also assisted by partisan staff members , and those in leadership positions have additional partisan staff . These staff members help to manage the offices of the Senators in the Miller Senate Office Building . Each Senator has one year @-@ round administrative assistant , as well as a secretary who assists them during the legislative session . There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices .

 To be eligible to run for the Maryland Senate , a person must be a citizen and be at least 25 years old . They must also have lived in the state for at least one year , and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months , assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long . No elected or appointed official of the United States government , including the military , may serve in the Senate , excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard . Similarly , no employees of the state government may serve , except for law enforcement officers , firefighters , and rescue workers . 
 = = = Elections and vacancies = = = 
 Members of the Maryland Senate are elected every four years , in off @-@ year elections in the middle of terms for Presidents of the United States . Party nominations are determined by primary elections . The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal elections in the normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November . Should a Senate seat become vacant in the middle of a term , because of death , illness , incapacitation , disqualification , resignation , or expulsion of a member of the Senate , that seat is filled by appointment . The Central Committee of the previous Senator 's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat . Within fifteen days of the Central Committee 's recommendation being selected , the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat . 
 The 47 districts from which Senators are elected are apportioned every ten years on the basis of population . Maryland 's constitution explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts , requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval . As of 2005 , there were approximately 112 @,@ 000 people in each district . Each Senate district also elects three Delegates , and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts . It is rare , however , for an incumbent to be challenged . 
 = = = Salaries and benefits = = = 
 As of the 2006 – 2010 term , most of Maryland 's Senators and Delegates receive $ 43 @,@ 500 in annual pay while presiding officers earn $ 56 @,@ 500 . This pay , relatively low for a state legislator , reflects the part @-@ time nature of the body , which only meets three months out of the year . Most members of the Senate hold additional jobs during the remainder of the year . Senators can also seek reimbursement for expenses related to meals and lodging during the legislative session , and for certain travel expenses related to their duties at any point during the year . They also have access to benefits received by state employees , including health and life insurance as well as retirement savings plans . Maryland has a voluntary legislator pension plan to which both Senators and Delegates have access . Besides receiving their own benefits , Senators can award up to $ 138 @,@ 000 each year in scholarships to students of their choosing if those students meet requirements set by Senate rules . 
 = = = Current makeup = = = 
 As of November 2015 , a majority of seats in the Maryland Senate are held by members of the Democratic Party , with 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans , greater than a two @-@ thirds majority . This dominance is nothing new , as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades . Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City , Montgomery County , and Prince George 's County , while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland . The chamber has also had significant numbers of women and African @-@ Americans serve , with women averaging around 30 % of the seats and African @-@ Americans around 20 % .

 = = Rules and procedures = = 
 Many rules and procedures in the Maryland Senate are set by the state constitution . Beyond the constitutional mandates , rules in the Senate are developed by the Rules Committee . The Senate and House of Delegates both meet for ninety days following the second Wednesday in January , although these sessions may be extended for up to thirty days by majority votes in both houses , and special sessions may be called by the Governor . The Senate meets in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House , which has both gallery seating and a door open to the State House lobby , the latter being mandated by the state constitution . Seating in the Senate is by party , with the leaders of each party choosing the exact seating assignments . Each Senator has offices in Annapolis , in the Miller Senate Office Building . 
 A typical session of the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate . After the call to order , the previous day 's journal is approved , petitions are heard , and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented . First , readings of legislation take place . Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors , often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber . Then the Senators consider legislation . They begin with unfinished business from the previous session , then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees . At the discretion of the presiding officer , the Senate may adjourn at any time , unless a majority of members present object to adjournment . 
 Lobbying is common in Annapolis ; there are more than 700 lobbyists registered with the state . While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy , they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns . Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics , a twelve @-@ member committee that includes six Senators . Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict . Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest , and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state . In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution , members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government .

 The mantled guereza ( Colobus guereza ) , also known simply as the guereza , the eastern black @-@ and @-@ white colobus , or the Abyssinian black @-@ and @-@ white colobus , is a black @-@ and @-@ white colobus , a type of Old World monkey . It is native to much of west central and east Africa , including Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea , Nigeria , Ethiopia , Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda and Chad . The species consists of several subspecies that differ in appearance . It has a distinctive appearance , which is alluded to in its name ; the long white fringes of hair the run along each side of its black trunk are known as a mantle . Its face is framed with white hair and it has a large white tail tuft . 
 The mantled guereza is diurnal and arboreal , found in both deciduous and evergreen forests . It is an adaptable species that can cope with habitat disturbance and prefers secondary forest close to rivers or lakes . Although previously thought only to eat leaves , it also eats seeds , fruits , and arthropods . It is able to digest plant material with a high fibre content with its specialised stomach and may only eat from a few plant species at a time . It is preyed on by birds of prey and some mammals , such as the common chimpanzee and the leopard . 
 The mantled guereza lives in social groups of three to fifteen individuals . These groups normally include a dominant male , several females , and the offspring of the females . It has a polygynous mating system and copulation is initiated with vocal communication . After a gestation period of just over five months , infants are born with pink skin and white fur , which darkens to the adult coloration by three to four months . The mantled guereza is well known for its dawn chorus , the males ' " roar " is a method of long distance communication that reinforces territorial boundaries . It also makes other vocalization and uses body postures , movements , and facial expressions to communicate . 
 The mantled guereza is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) because it is widespread - although it is locally threatened in some areas , the decline is not great enough to list it in a higher category of threat . However , one subspecies found in Kenya is listed as Endangered . It can survive well in degraded forests and in some areas it is more common in logged areas than unlogged ones . The mantled guereza is also threatened by hunting for bushmeat and for its skin .
