 Sing all day long their low sweet song , 
 To the lonely listening hills ;

 As his health declined , Waugh moved to the seaside town of New Brighton . On his death in 1890 , his body was brought back to be buried in the graveyard of St. Paul 's Church , on the edge of the moorland he loved so well .

 And make it my last bed ,

 = Shamanism in the Qing dynasty = 
 Shamanism was the dominant religion of the Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants , the Manchu people . As early as the Jin dynasty ( 1111 – 1234 ) , the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse . There were two kinds of shamans : those who entered in a trance and let themselves be possessed by the spirits , and those who conducted regular sacrifices to heaven , to a clan 's ancestors , or to the clan 's protective spirits . 
 When Nurhaci ( 1559 – 1626 ) , the chieftain of the Jianzhou Jurchens , unified the other Jurchen tribes under his own rule in the early seventeenth century , he imposed the protective spirits of his clan , the Aisin Gioro , upon other clans , and often destroyed their shrines . As early as the 1590s , he placed shamanism at the center of his state 's ritual , sacrificing to heaven before engaging in military campaigns . His son and successor Hong Taiji ( 1592 – 1643 ) , who renamed the Jurchens " Manchu " and officially founded the Qing dynasty ( 1636 – 1912 ) , further put shamanistic practices in the service of the state , notably by forbidding others to erect new tangse for ritual purposes . In the 1620s and 1630s , the Qing ruler conducted shamanic sacrifices at the tangse of Mukden , the Qing capital . In 1644 , as soon as the Qing seized Beijing to begin their conquest of China , they named it their new capital and erected an official shamanic shrine there . In the Beijing tangse and in the women 's quarters of the Forbidden City , Qing emperors and professional shamans ( usually women ) conducted shamanic ceremonies until the abdication of the dynasty in 1912 . 
 Until at least the eighteenth century , shamanism was at the core of Manchu spiritual life and differentiated Manchus from Han Chinese even as Manchu Bannermen garrisoned in various Chinese cities were adopting many aspects of the Chinese lifestyle . In 1747 the Qianlong Emperor ( r . 1735 – 1796 ) commissioned the publication of a " Shamanic Code " to revive and regulate shamanic practices , which he feared were becoming lost . He had it distributed to Bannermen to guide their practice , but we know very little about the effect of this policy . Mongols and Han Chinese were forbidden to attend shamanic ceremonies . Partly because of their secret aspect , these rituals attracted the curiosity of Beijing dwellers and visitors to the Qing capital . Even after the " Shamanic Code " was translated into Chinese and published in the 1780s , outsiders had little understanding of these practices . 
 During his fieldwork among the Tungusic populations of " Manchuria " in the 1910s , Russian anthropologist S. M. Shirokogoroff found enough surviving practices to build a theory of shamanism that shaped later theoretical debates about shamanism . Since the late 1980s , however , these theories have been criticized for neglecting the relation between shamanism and the state . Historians are now arguing that shamanistic practices in northeast Asia were intimately tied to the establishment of states , an analysis that fits the Qing case very well . 
 = = Background = = 
 Shamanism is the religion most typical of Tungusic peoples of Northeast Asia . The word " shaman " itself ( <unk> in the Manchu language ) appears in every <unk> @-@ Manchurian language and seems to be of Tungusic origins . The most common religion among the Manchus was shamanism , which they and their ancestors the Jurchens practiced long before their leaders conquered China as emperors of the Qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1911 ) . 
 = = Historical origins to 1644 = = 
 = = = Early Jurchen shamanism = = = 
 The Manchu name for a shamanic shrine or altar to the spirits is tangse . Because its Chinese equivalent tangzi ( <unk> ) means " hall , " it may seem that tangse was derived from Chinese , but only around 1660 did tangse start to be translated as tangzi . Before that , it was rendered into Chinese as <unk> ( <unk> ) , or " visitation temple . " The term tangse may have originated in the portable " god boxes " ( also " tangse " ) in which the Jurchens placed god figurines when they were still mobile hunters . Once Jurchen bands started to settle into palisaded villages ( their typical kind of settlement ) , their tangse became permanent fixtures of the village . 
 Each clan — <unk> , a village or association of villages who claimed to share common ancestors — had its sacred protective spirits ( <unk> ) . The shaman ( often a woman ) was in charge of placating spirits and dead ancestors and of contacting them to seek a good hunt or harvest , quick healing , success in battle , and other such favors . The point of contact between the community and the spirits was the " spirit pole " ( Manchu : <unk> ; Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) . Shamans played a crucial role in these early Jurchen communities , as the authority of the clan headman often depended on the assent of the shaman . 
 There were two kinds of Jurchen shamanistic rituals , corresponding to two kinds of shamans . The most common was " domestic ritual " : ritual @-@ based sacrifices to Heaven and to the clan 's ancestors conducted by hereditary shamans from that clan . " Primitive ritual , " on the other hand , was performed by people who had undergone a " shamanic illness , " which was seen as a sign that they had been chosen by the spirits . Entering into a trance , these " transformational " shamans let themselves be possessed by various animal spirits and sought the help of these spirits for purposes like healing or exorcism . These shamans set up an altar in their own houses and received a different kind of training from hereditary shamans . 
 Manchu shamans typically wore an apron , a feathered cap denoting their ability to fly to the spirit world , and a belt with dangling bells , and carried a knife , two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the top , and a drum they used during ceremonies . These attributes could still be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia in the early twentieth century . 
 = = = Shamanism after the rise of Nurhaci = = = 
 Jurchen shamanic practices were transformed by the rise of Qing founder Nurhaci ( 1559 – 1626 ) . As he started to unify the Jurchen tribes , Nurhaci destroyed the tangse of the defeated tribes and replaced their protective deities with the magpie , the totemic animal of his own clan , the Aisin Gioro . Tribes that voluntarily joined Nurhaci were allowed to keep their own gods . This absorption of other clans ' shamanic rituals into those of Nurhaci 's clan started a process of " state codification of religion " that continued into the eighteenth century . 
 In another transformation that " mirrored the process of political centralization " in Nurhaci 's state , the traditional Jurchen belief in multiple heavens was replaced by one Heaven called " <unk> ama " or " <unk> han . " This new shamanic Heaven became the object of a state cult similar to that of the Jurchen rulers ' cult of Heaven in the Jin dynasty ( 1115 – 1234 ) and to <unk> Khan 's worship of <unk> in the thirteenth century . This state sacrifice became an early counterpart to the Chinese worship of Heaven . From as early as the 1590s , Nurhaci appealed to Heaven as , " the arbiter of right and wrong . " He worshipped Heaven at a shamanic shrine in 1593 before leaving for a campaign against the <unk> , a Jurchen tribe that belonged to the rival <unk> confederacy . Qing annals also report that when Nurhaci announced his Seven Great Grievances against the Ming dynasty in April 1618 , he conducted a shamanic ceremony during which he burned an oath to Heaven written on a piece of yellow paper . This ceremony was deliberately omitted from the later Chinese translation of this event by the Qing court . 
 Nurhaci 's son Hong Taiji ( r . 1626 – 1643 ) , who renamed the Jurchens " Manchus " in 1635 , forbade commoners and officials from erecting shamanic shrines for ritual purposes , making the tangse " the monopoly of the ruler . " He also banned shamans from treating illness , albeit with little success . The Old Manchu Archives , a chronicle documenting Manchu history from 1607 to 1636 , show that state rituals were held at the tangse of the Qing capital Mukden in the 1620s and 1630s . Just before commanding Banner troops into China in early 1644 , Prince Dorgon ( 1612 – 1650 ) , who was then regent to the newly enthroned Shunzhi Emperor ( r . 1643 – 1661 ) , led the other Manchu princes in worshipping Heaven at the Mukden tangse . 
 Shamans could also be used for personal purposes , as when Nurhaci 's eldest son <unk> supposedly tried to bewitch the entire Aisin Gioro lineage with the help of shamans in 1612 .

 = = = The Beijing tangse = = = 
 In 1644 , just a few months after the Qing seized the city of Beijing from the peasant rebels who had pushed the last emperor of the Ming dynasty to suicide , the Manchus constructed a new tangse in the city , modeled on the tangse of the former Qing capital Mukden . This " Manchu shamanist sanctuary , " an octagonal building whose shape was specific to the Aisin Gioro clan , was located outside the Imperial City to the southeast , but still within the Inner City occupied by Bannermen , making it convenient for imperial visits . There , the emperor made offerings to Heaven and various other deities , including the horse spirit and the Manchu progenitor . Chinese and Mongols were strictly forbidden from entering this ritual area . 
 The Qing state 's main shamanistic ritual was performed at the tangse by the emperor on the first day of the New Year . In the Shunzhi ( 1644 – 1661 ) , Kangxi ( 1662 – 1722 ) , and Yongzheng ( 1723 – 1735 ) eras , this ceremony was the emperor 's first activity on the first day of the New Year , but sometime during the Qianlong era ( 1736 – 1796 ) it fell to the second rank after private sacrifices to the Aisin Gioro ancestors . Even with this somewhat diminished importance , these shamanic rites continued to the end of the dynasty . 
 The tangse was destroyed in 1900 by foreign powers in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising as part of reprisals for the two @-@ month siege of the international Legation Quarter . A new shrine was rebuilt inside the palace in December 1901 . Its former site became part of the expanded Italian legation . Historian Mark Elliott notes that in today 's Beijing , the old tangse would have been located on East Chang 'an Avenue , " directly opposite the ' modern ' wing of the Beijing Hotel . " 
 = = = Kunning Palace = = = 
 Daily shamanistic rites were also conducted in the women 's quarters , in the Palace of Earthly Tranquility ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Kunning gong ) , a building located near the north gate of the Forbidden City , on the central axis of the palace complex . This palace had served as the Empress 's residence under the Ming dynasty , but the Qing converted it for ritual use , installing a " spirit pole " to present sacrifices to heaven , changing the style of the windows , and setting up large cauldrons to cook sacrificial food . 
 The shamans in the Kunning Palace were all women . In the Shunzhi era ( 1644 – 1661 ) , the sacrifices were performed by the wives of Aisin Gioro men and by the emperor 's consorts . After that , the <unk> were selected from the wives of " imperial guards " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , high officials belonging to Gioro households registered in the " Upper Three Banners , " which belonged directly to the emperor . These <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , who were assisted by eunuchs , were managed by the " Office of Shamanism " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , a bureau under the authority of the Imperial Household Department . Only members of the imperial clan could attend such ceremonies . 
 = = = Role in Qing rulership = = = 
 The Qing emperor used shamanism to promote the dynasty 's legitimacy among the Tungusic peoples — such as the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — who lived near the northeastern borders of the empire . They were taught the Manchu language and Manchu fashion , as well as legends recounting how Qing founder Nurhaci had been assisted by the spirits in his many exploits . Qing emperors adopted different images to address the different subjects of their multi @-@ ethnic empire . As khan of the Manchus and Mongols , he presented himself as an incarnation of the bodhisattva ( " enlightened being " ) Manjusri and as a universal Buddhist ruler protector of Tibetan Buddhism . As emperor of China ( huangdi ) , he sponsored civil examinations based on the Confucian Classics and worshipped at the Altar of Heaven . Shamanism was thus only one aspect of the Qing 's " extraordinarily flexible view of community and rulership " . 
 = = = Healing rituals = = = 
 Besides state ritual , the Manchus often resorted to shamans to treat illness . In 1649 Dorgon 's brother Dodo , who had helped the Qing conquer southern China in 1645 , fell ill with smallpox , a highly contagious disease that the Manchus particularly dreaded . He called a shaman named <unk> to his bedside , but the shaman 's ritual therapies failed and Dodo died in April 1649 at the age of 35 . After variolation began in 1681 , shamanic sacrifices were performed for imperial sons who survived inoculation . The Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 – 1722 ) attempted to cure his sixth son <unk> ( <unk> ) with shamanic rites in June 1685 , but that son died a few days later . 
 = = The " Shamanic Code " of 1747 = = 
 In the 1740s , the Qianlong Emperor worried that shamanic traditions were becoming lost , especially among the Manchu Bannermen who lived in garrisons throughout the empire . To fight this trend , in 1741 he commissioned a " Shamanic Code " , based on the rites of the imperial clan , that would explain the use of shamanic instruments and the meaning of Manchu ritual incantations , many of which had been transmitted by <unk> who were not fluent in Manchu , to the point of becoming nonsensical . It was completed in 1747 . Its full title in Manchu was <unk>

 <unk> Wylie : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which scholars have translated variously as " Imperially commissioned Manchu rituals for sacrificing to deities and to Heaven , " " Rites for the Manchu worship of Heaven and the spirits , " and " Imperially commissioned code of rituals and sacrifices of the Manchus . " The Code attempted to formalize Manchu shamanistic practices . Historian Pamela Crossley sees it as part of the Qianlong Emperor 's attempts to " standardize the cultural and spiritual life of the Manchus , " taking the practices of the imperial clan as a model . 
 Though the Shamanic Code was first kept in manuscript form , French Jesuit Joseph @-@ Marie Amiot had a study on it , " <unk> des <unk> <unk> <unk> et <unk> par l 'empereur comme chef de sa religion " , published in Amsterdam in 1773 . In 1777 the Qianlong Emperor ordered the code translated into Chinese for inclusion in the Siku <unk> . The Manchu version was printed in 1778 , whereas the Chinese @-@ language edition , titled <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , was completed in 1780 or 1782 . 
 The compilation of this Code " opened Qing shamanism to bureaucratic review " and modified the practices of ordinary Manchus . The Code was distributed to Bannermen to guide their practices . Commercial editions were even produced for sale to the common public . One of these editions , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , dated 1828 , has survived . Even though this " Shamanic Code " did not fully unify shamanic practice among the Banners , it " helped systematize and reshape what had been a very fluid and diverse belief system . " 
 = = Diversity of practices = = 
 There is little evidence concerning the shamanic practices of common Bannermen in the garrisons . We know that after the publication of the " Shamanic Code " some clans ( like the <unk> ) and tribes ( like the <unk> ) also wrote down their rituals and incantations , showing that the court model was not always followed . Shamanic sacrifices among ordinary households were simpler than those of the imperial clan . Noble Manchus in Beijing often erected spirit poles in their private homes , but because Manchu households were forbidden from having private tangse shrines , they made offerings to the spirit at a small altar called a <unk> , where they installed portraits of their ancestors as well as a clan genealogy . 
 The worship of heaven in the Chinese imperial tradition paralleled shamanistic sacrifices , but only the emperor made offerings to the Chinese heaven , whereas ordinary Manchus could also worship shamanistic heaven . Both Chinese and Manchu heaven were an " all @-@ encompassing principle of cosmic order and human destiny " that could be used to give the state legitimacy . 
 In their shamanic ceremonies , Manchus worshipped a number of gods , including non @-@ Tungusic deities . Guandi and the bodhisattva ( Buddhist " enlightened being " ) Guanyin were two of a " handful of Chinese gods " who were integrated into the rituals of the state tangse and Kunning Palace . One of the four ritual sites in the tangse was a large hall where the Buddha , Guanyin , and Guandi received offerings several times a year , including at the New Year . Ordinary Manchu households rarely sacrificed to Buddhist deities , but almost all of them worshipped Guandi because of his association with war . 
 = = Shamanism and Manchu identity = = 
 At least into the eighteenth century , shamanism served to strengthen Manchu ethnic identity by forming " the spiritual core of Manchu life . " The Qing emperors also used shamanism to shape Manchu identity . In an edict dated 17 April 1727 in which he opposed Jesuit attempts to convert Chinese and Manchus to Catholicism , the Yongzheng Emperor ( r . 1722 – 1735 ) singled out Manchu converts for criticism . To the emperor , the " Lord of Heaven " — the Jesuit name for God in Chinese — was none other than the Heaven the Chinese and Manchus already worshipped . To convince Manchu nobles that they should use existing Manchu rituals for worshipping Heaven , he explained that , " In the empire we have a temple for honoring Heaven and sacrificing to Him . We Manchus have Tiao <unk> . The first day of every year we burn incense and paper to honor Heaven . We Manchus have our own particular rites for honoring Heaven . " In this edict , which we know through a French translation by court Jesuit Antoine <unk> , Tiao <unk> refers to Tiao Shen ( <unk> , literally " spirit @-@ jumping " ) , the Chinese name of the Manchu shamanic ceremony . 
 According to historian Pamela Crossley , proficiency with shamanism was among the qualities that the Qianlong Emperor ( r . 1735 – 1796 ) promoted as being part of the " Old Way " ( fe <unk> ) of the Manchus when he attempted to formalize the Manchu heritage late in his reign . Mark Elliott has countered that he has never seen shamanism listed among " the qualities the court expected of Manchus " in any Qing documents , and that shamanism was therefore " never formally enunciated as part of the Manchu Way " ( <unk> <unk> ) . Nicola di Cosmo of the Institute for Advanced Studies comments that once Manchu rituals were codified into formal regulations , they became " mere simulacra of the ancestral cults " and lost their place at the center of the spiritual life of Manchu clans . Nonetheless the persistence of shamanistic practices at the Qing court into the twentieth century suggests that the Manchus were not automatically " sinicized " by the sole fact that they ruled over China . 
 Elliott argues that " shamanism contributed to Manchu identity ... by constructing a very obvious boundary between Manchu and Han . " Chinese residents and visitors , who were forbidden to observe the rituals performed at the shamanic shrine , saw these rites as " different and mysterious " or " secret and alien . " A visitor to Beijing in the early Qing remarked that the <unk> was one of the three things one didn 't ask about in the capital . The difference between shamanic rites and Chinese rituals still " aroused significant interest . " Korean visitors from Joseon , for instance , often " asked questions about the secret Manchu rites in the <unk> . " Writers who wanted to satisfy their readers ' curiosity about these exotic practices could only speculate or rely on the late eighteenth @-@ century Shamanic Code . This is why nineteenth @-@ century Chinese accounts about Manchu rituals are " fragmentary and often error @-@ prone , " while their explanations of ritual language are " positively confusing . " 
 = = Scholarly interpretations = = 
 During his fieldwork among the Tungusic peoples of " Manchuria " from 1912 to 1918 , Russian anthropologist S. M. Shirokogoroff ( 1887 – 1939 ) found enough surviving practices to develop an influential theory of shamanism . He noted that the northern Tungus had been heavily influenced by Manchu language and culture : they wore Manchu clothing and hairstyle , read Manchu books , and conducted weddings and funerals according to Manchu customs . As he also discovered , the Manchus venerated many Buddhist deities , so much that he hypothesized that northeast Asian shamanism was an outgrowth of Buddhism . This thesis has not been widely accepted . His definition of shamanism , however , has been widely discussed . Equipped with specific ritual implements , the shaman enters into a trance to gain control of harmful spirits who cause illness or misfortune to a clan or a tribe . His role is recognized by his society , and there is an explicit explanation of how he masters the spirits . 
 Shirokogoroff claimed that true shamanism only existed among the Tungus and the Manchus , but despite his warnings that Tungus shamanism could only be understood in relation to all other elements of Tungus culture , and that his findings should therefore not serve to develop a general interpretation of shamanism , Shirokogoroff 's ideas have shaped theoretical debates about shamanism . Social anthropologists Raymond Firth ( 1901 – 2002 ) and Ioan Myrddin Lewis ( b . 1930 ) — the latter a student of E. E. Evans @-@ Pritchard — drew from Shirokogoroff 's work to emphasize the social roles of shamans . Lewis 's influential analysis of spirit possession was also directly inspired by Shirokogoroff . Historian of religion Mircea Eliade ( 1907 – 1986 ) borrowed from the Russian ethnologist and many others to build his seminal theory of shamanism , which he presented in Shamanism : Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy ( 1964 , based on a French original dated 1951 ) . Eliade 's notion of " classic shamanism " or " shamanism in the strict and proper sense " was based on Siberian models . But whereas Shirokogoroff emphasized that control over the spirits was the chief function of shamanic rituals , Eliade stated that the ecstatic and visionary spirit @-@ journey induced by trance was the most central aspect of shamanism . 
 Shirokogoroff 's and Eliade 's views of shamanism were both centered on individuals and on the role of shamans in small groups . Shirokogoroff , for instance , considered eighteenth @-@ century Qing shamanism too formalized to be authentic . Historians of northeast Asia have criticized Eliade 's and Shirokogoroff 's interpretations because they neglect the political roles of shamans and shamanism 's relation with the state . Eliade 's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic , individualistic , and socially transgressive led him and his followers to neglect historical contexts in which shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state , as it did under the Qing . 
 = Exponentiation = 
 Exponentiation is a mathematical operation , written as bn , involving two numbers , the base b and the exponent n . When n is a positive integer , exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base : that is , bn is the product of multiplying n bases : 
 <formula> 
 In that case , bn is called the n @-@ th power of b , or b raised to the power n . 
 The exponent is usually shown as a superscript to the right of the base . Some common exponents have their own names : the exponent 2 ( or 2nd power ) is called the square of b ( b2 ) or b squared ; the exponent 3 ( or 3rd power ) is called the cube of b ( b3 ) or b cubed . The exponent − 1 of b , or 1 / b , is called the reciprocal of b . 
 When n is a negative integer and b is not zero , bn is naturally defined as 1 / b − n , preserving the property bn × bm = bn + m . 
 The definition of exponentiation can be extended to allow any real or complex exponent . Exponentiation by integer exponents can also be defined for a wide variety of algebraic structures , including matrices . 
 Exponentiation is used extensively in many fields , including economics , biology , chemistry , physics , and computer science , with applications such as compound interest , population growth , chemical reaction kinetics , wave behavior , and public @-@ key cryptography .

 The term power was used by the Greek mathematician Euclid for the square of a line . Archimedes discovered and proved the law of exponents , 10a 10b 
 = 10a + b , necessary to manipulate powers of 10 . In the 9th century , the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn <unk> al @-@ Khwārizmī used the terms mal for a square and <unk> for a cube , which later Islamic mathematicians represented in mathematical notation as m and k , respectively , by the 15th century , as seen in the work of Abū al @-@ Hasan ibn Alī al @-@ <unk> . 
 In the late 16th century , Jost Bürgi used Roman numerals for exponents . 
 Early in the 17th century , the first form of our modern exponential notation was introduced by Rene Descartes in his text titled La <unk> ; there , the notation is introduced in Book I. 
 Nicolas <unk> used a form of exponential notation in the 15th century , which was later used by Henricus <unk> and Michael Stifel in the 16th century . The word " exponent " was coined in 1544 by Michael Stifel . Samuel <unk> introduced the term indices in 1696 . In the 16th century Robert Recorde used the terms square , cube , <unk> ( fourth power ) , <unk> ( fifth ) , <unk> ( sixth ) , second <unk> ( seventh ) , and <unk> ( eighth ) . <unk> has been used to refer to the fourth power as well . 
 Some mathematicians ( e.g. , Isaac Newton ) used exponents only for powers greater than two , preferring to represent squares as repeated multiplication . Thus they would write polynomials , for example , as ax + <unk> + <unk> + d . 
 Another historical synonym , involution , is now rare and should not be confused with its more common meaning . 
 In 1748 Leonhard Euler wrote " consider exponentials or powers in which the exponent itself is a variable . It is clear that quantities of this kind are not algebraic functions , since in those the exponents must be constant . " With this introduction of transcendental functions , Euler laid the foundation for the modern introduction of natural logarithm as the inverse function for y =

 The expression b2 
 = b ⋅ b is called the square of b because the area of a square with side @-@ length b is b2 . It is pronounced " b squared " . 
 The expression b3 = 
 b ⋅ b ⋅ b is called the cube of b because the volume of a cube with side @-@ length b is b3 . It is pronounced " b cubed " . 
 The exponent indicates how many copies of the base are multiplied together . For example , 35 
 = 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3 = 
 243 . The base 3 appears 5 times in the repeated multiplication , because the exponent is 5 . Here , 3 is the base , 5 is the exponent , and 243 is the power or , more specifically , the fifth power of 3 , 3 raised to the fifth power , or 3 to the power of 5 . 
 The word " raised " is usually omitted , and very often " power " as well , so 35 is typically pronounced " three to the fifth " or " three to the five " . The exponentiation bn can be read as b raised to the n @-@ th power , or b raised to the power of n , or b raised by the exponent of n , or most briefly as b to the n .

 In the base 2 ( binary ) number system , integer powers of 2 are written as 1 followed or preceded by a number of zeroes determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent . For example , two to the power of three is written as 1000 in binary . 
 = = = = Powers of one = = = = 
 The powers of one are all one : 1n = 1 . 
 = = = = Powers of zero = = = = 
 If the exponent is positive , the power of zero is zero : 0n 
 = 0 , where n > 0 . 
 If the exponent is negative , the power of zero ( 0n , where n < 0 ) is undefined , because division by zero is implied . 
 If the exponent is zero , some authors define 00 = 
 1 , whereas others leave it undefined , as discussed below under § Zero to the power of zero . 
 = = = = Powers of minus one = = = = 
 If n is an even integer , then ( − 1 ) n 
 = 1 . 
 If n is an odd integer , then ( − 1 ) n = 
 − 1 . 
 Because of this , powers of − 1 are useful for expressing alternating sequences . For a similar discussion of powers of the complex number i , see § Powers of complex numbers . 
 = = = Large exponents = = = 
 The limit of a sequence of powers of a number greater than one diverges ; in other words , the sequence grows without bound : 
 bn → ∞ as n → ∞ when b > 1 
 This can be read as " b to the power of n tends to + ∞ as n tends to infinity when b is greater than one " . 
 Powers of a number with absolute value less than one tend to zero : 
 bn → 0 as n → ∞ when | b | < 1 
 Any power of one is always one : 
 bn 
 = 1 for all n if b = 
 1 
 If the number b varies tending to 1 as the exponent tends to infinity then the limit is not necessarily one of those above . A particularly important case is 
 ( 1 + 1 / n ) n → e as n → ∞ 
 See § The exponential function below . 
 Other limits , in particular of those that take on an indeterminate form , are described in § Limits of powers below . 
 = = Rational exponents = = 
 An nth root of a number b is a number x such that xn 
 = b . 
 If b is a positive real number and n is a positive integer , then there is exactly one positive real solution to xn = 
 b . This solution is called the principal nth root of b . It is denoted n √ b , where √ is the radical symbol ; alternatively , the principal root may be written b1 / n . For example : 41 / 2 
 = 2 , 81 / 3 = 
 2 . 
 The fact that <formula> solves <formula> follows from noting that 
 <formula> 
 If n is even , then xn 
 = b has two real solutions if b is positive , which are the positive and negative nth roots ( the positive one being denoted <formula> ) . If b is negative , the equation has no solution in real numbers for even n . 
 If n is odd , then xn = 
 b has one real solution . The solution is positive if b is positive and negative if b is negative . 
 The principal root of a positive real number b with a rational exponent u / v in lowest terms satisfies 
 <formula> 
 where u is an integer and v is a positive integer . 
 Rational powers u / v , where u / v is in lowest terms , are positive if u is even ( and hence v is odd ) ( because then bu is positive ) , and negative for negative b if u and v are odd ( because then bu is negative ) . There are two roots , one of each sign , if b is positive and v is even ( as exemplified by the case in which u 
 = 1 and v = 
 2 , whereby a positive b has two square roots ) ; in this case the principal root is defined to be the positive one . 
 Thus we have ( − 27 ) 1 / 3 
 = − 3 and ( − 27 ) 2 / 3 = 
 9 . The number 4 has two 3 / <unk> roots , namely 8 and − 8 ; however , by convention 43 / 2 denotes the principal root , which is 8 . Since there is no real number x such that x2 
 = − 1 , the definition of bu / v when b is negative and v is even must use the imaginary unit i , as described more fully in the section § Powers of complex numbers . 
 Care needs to be taken when applying the power identities with negative nth roots . For instance , − 27 = 
 ( − 27 ) ( ( 2 / 3 ) ⋅ ( 3 / 2 ) ) 
 = ( ( − 27 ) 2 / 3 ) 3 / 2 = 
 93 / 2 = 27 is clearly wrong . The problem here occurs in taking the positive square root rather than the negative one at the last step , but in general the same sorts of problems occur as described for complex numbers in the section § Failure of power and logarithm identities . 
 = = Real exponents = = 
 The identities and properties shown above for integer exponents are true for positive real numbers with non @-@ integer exponents as well . However the identity 
 <formula> 
 cannot be extended consistently to cases where b is a negative real number ( see § Real exponents with negative bases ) . The failure of this identity is the basis for the problems with complex number powers detailed under § Failure of power and logarithm identities . 
 Exponentiation to real powers of positive real numbers can be defined either by extending the rational powers to reals by continuity , or more usually as given in § Powers via logarithms below . 
 = = = Limits of rational exponents = = = 
 Since any irrational number can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers , exponentiation of a positive real number b with an arbitrary real exponent x can be defined by continuity with the rule 
 <formula> 
 where the limit as r gets close to x is taken only over rational values of r . This limit only exists for positive b . The ( ε , δ ) <unk> of limit is used , this involves showing that for any desired accuracy of the result bx one can choose a sufficiently small interval around x so all the rational powers in the interval are within the desired accuracy . 
 For example , if x 
 = π , the nonterminating decimal representation π = 
 3 @.@ 14159 ... can be used ( based on strict monotonicity of the rational power ) to obtain the intervals bounded by rational powers 
 <formula> , <formula> , <formula> , <formula> , <formula> , <formula> , ... 
 The bounded intervals converge to a unique real number , denoted by <formula> . This technique can be used to obtain the power of a positive real number b for any irrational exponent . The function fb ( x ) = bx is thus defined for any real number x . 
 = = = The exponential function = = = 
 The important mathematical constant e , sometimes called Euler 's number , is approximately equal to 2 @.@ 718 and is the base of the natural logarithm . Although exponentiation of e could , in principle , be treated the same as exponentiation of any other real number , such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties . Among other things , these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents , such as complex numbers or even matrices , while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents . 
 As a consequence , the notation ex usually denotes a generalized exponentiation definition called the exponential function , exp ( x ) , which can be defined in many equivalent ways , for example by : 
 <formula> 
 Among other properties , exp satisfies the exponential identity 
 <formula> 
 The exponential function is defined for all integer , fractional , real , and complex values of x . In fact , the matrix exponential is well @-@ defined for square matrices ( in which case this exponential identity only holds when x and y commute ) , and is useful for solving systems of linear differential equations . 
 Since exp ( 1 ) is equal to e and exp ( x ) satisfies this exponential identity , it immediately follows that exp ( x ) coincides with the repeated @-@ multiplication definition of ex for integer x , and it also follows that rational powers denote ( positive ) roots as usual , so exp ( x ) coincides with the ex definitions in the previous section for all real x by continuity . 
 = = = Powers via logarithms = = = 
 The natural logarithm ln ( x ) is the inverse of the exponential function ex . It is defined for b > 0 , and satisfies 
 <formula> 
 If bx is to preserve the logarithm and exponent rules , then one must have 
 <formula> 
 for each real number x . 
 This can be used as an alternative definition of the real number power bx and agrees with the definition given above using rational exponents and continuity . The definition of exponentiation using logarithms is more common in the context of complex numbers , as discussed below . 
 = = = Real exponents with negative bases = = = 
 Powers of a positive real number are always positive real numbers . The solution of x2 
 = 4 , however , can be either 2 or − 2 . The principal value of 41 / 2 is 2 , but − 2 is also a valid square root . If the definition of exponentiation of real numbers is extended to allow negative results then the result is no longer well @-@ behaved . 
 Neither the logarithm method nor the rational exponent method can be used to define br as a real number for a negative real number b and an arbitrary real number r . Indeed , er is positive for every real number r , so ln ( b ) is not defined as a real number for b ≤ 0 . 
 The rational exponent method cannot be used for negative values of b because it relies on continuity . The function f ( r ) = 
 br has a unique continuous extension from the rational numbers to the real numbers for each b > 0 . But when b < 0 , the function f is not even continuous on the set of rational numbers r for which it is defined . 
 For example , consider b 
 = − 1 . The nth root of − 1 is − 1 for every odd natural number n . So if n is an odd positive integer , ( − 1 ) ( m / n ) = 
 − 1 if m is odd , and ( − 1 ) ( m / n ) 
 = 1 if m is even . Thus the set of rational numbers q for which ( − 1 ) q = 
 1 is dense in the rational numbers , as is the set of q for which ( − 1 ) q = − 1 . This means that the function ( − 1 ) q is not continuous at any rational number q where it is defined . 
 On the other hand , arbitrary complex powers of negative numbers b can be defined by choosing a complex logarithm of b . 
 = = = Irrational exponents = = = 
 If a is a positive algebraic number , and b is a rational number , it has been shown above that ab is algebraic . This remains true even if one accepts any algebraic number for a , with the only difference that ab may take several values ( see below ) , all algebraic . Gelfond – Schneider theorem provides some information on the nature of ab when b is irrational ( that is not rational ) . It states : 
 If a is an algebraic number different from 0 and 1 , and b an irrational algebraic number , then all the values of ab are transcendental numbers ( that is , not algebraic ) . 
 = = Complex exponents with positive real bases = = 
 = = = Imaginary exponents with base e = = = 
 A complex number is an expression of the form <formula> , where x and y are real numbers , and i is the so @-@ called imaginary unit , a number that satisfies the rule <formula> . A complex number can be visualized as a point in the ( x , y ) plane . The polar coordinates of a point in the ( x , y ) plane consist of a non @-@ negative real number r and angle θ such that x 
 = r cos θ and y = 
 r sin θ . So 
 <formula> 
 The product of two complex numbers z1 
 = x1 + <unk> , z2 = 
 x2 + <unk> is obtained by expanding out the product of the binomials and simplifying using the rule <formula> : 
 <formula> 
 As a consequence of the angle sum formulas of trigonometry , if z1 and z2 have polar coordinates ( r1 , θ1 ) , ( r2 , θ2 ) , then their product <unk> has polar coordinates equal to ( <unk> , θ1 + θ2 ) . 
 Consider the right triangle in the complex plane which has 0 , 1 , 1 + ix / n as vertices . For large values of n , the triangle is almost a circular sector with a radius of 1 and a small central angle equal to x / n radians . 1 + ix / n may then be approximated by the number with polar coordinates ( 1 , x / n ) . So , in the limit as n approaches infinity , ( 1 + ix / n ) n approaches ( 1 , x / n ) n 
 = ( 1n , nx / n ) = 
 ( 1 , x ) , the point on the unit circle whose angle from the positive real axis is x radians . The cartesian coordinates of this point are ( cos x , sin x ) . So e ix 
 = cos x + <unk> x ; this is Euler 's formula , connecting algebra to trigonometry by means of complex numbers . 
 The solutions to the equation ez = 
 1 are the integer multiples of 2πi : 
 <formula> 
 More generally , if ev 
 = w , then every solution to ez = 
 w can be obtained by adding an integer multiple of 2πi to v : 
 <formula> 
 Thus the complex exponential function is a periodic function with period 2πi . 
 More simply : <unk> 
 = − 1 ; ex + iy = 
 ex ( cos y + i sin y ) . 
 = = = Trigonometric functions = = = 
 It follows from Euler 's formula stated above that the trigonometric functions cosine and sine are 
 <formula> 
 Before the invention of complex numbers , cosine and sine were defined geometrically . The above formula reduces the complicated formulas for trigonometric functions of a sum into the simple exponentiation formula 
 <formula> 
 Using exponentiation with complex exponents may reduce problems in trigonometry to algebra . 
 = = = Complex exponents with base e = = = 
 The power z = ex + iy can be computed as ex ⋅ <unk> . The real factor ex is the absolute value of z and the complex factor <unk> identifies the direction of z . 
 = = = Complex exponents with positive real bases = = = 
 If b is a positive real number , and z is any complex number , the power bz is defined as ez ⋅ ln ( b ) , where x 
 = ln ( b ) is the unique real solution to the equation ex = 
 b . So the same method working for real exponents also works for complex exponents . 
 For example : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 The identity ( bz ) u = <unk> is not generally valid for complex powers . The power bz is a complex number and any power of it has to follow the rules for powers of complex numbers below . A simple counterexample is given by : 
 <formula> 
 The identity is , however , valid for arbitrary complex <formula> when <formula> is an integer . 
 = = Powers of complex numbers = = 
 Integer powers of nonzero complex numbers are defined by repeated multiplication or division as above . If i is the imaginary unit and n is an integer , then in equals 1 , i , − 1 , or − i , according to whether the integer n is congruent to 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 modulo 4 . Because of this , the powers of i are useful for expressing sequences of period 4 . 
 Complex powers of positive reals are defined via ex as in section Complex exponents with positive real bases above . These are continuous functions . 
 Trying to extend these functions to the general case of <unk> powers of complex numbers that are not positive reals leads to difficulties . Either we define discontinuous functions or multivalued functions . Neither of these options is entirely satisfactory . 
 The rational power of a complex number must be the solution to an algebraic equation . Therefore , it always has a finite number of possible values . For example , w 
 = z1 / 2 must be a solution to the equation w2 = 
 z . But if w is a solution , then so is − w , because ( − 1 ) 2 = 1 . A unique but somewhat arbitrary solution called the principal value can be chosen using a general rule which also applies for nonrational powers . 
 Complex powers and logarithms are more naturally handled as single valued functions on a Riemann surface . Single valued versions are defined by choosing a sheet . The value has a discontinuity along a branch cut . Choosing one out of many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous , and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray . 
 Any nonrational power of a complex number has an infinite number of possible values because of the multi @-@ valued nature of the complex logarithm . The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which , amongst its other properties , ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base . 
 <unk> a real number to a complex power is formally a different operation from that for the corresponding complex number . However , in the common case of a positive real number the principal value is the same . 
 The powers of negative real numbers are not always defined and are discontinuous even where defined . In fact , they are only defined when the exponent is a rational number with the denominator being an odd integer . When dealing with complex numbers the complex number operation is normally used instead . 
 = = = Complex exponents with complex bases = = = 
 For complex numbers w and z with w ≠ 0 , the notation wz is ambiguous in the same sense that log w is . 
 To obtain a value of wz , first choose a logarithm of w ; call it log w . Such a choice may be the principal value Log w ( the default , if no other specification is given ) , or perhaps a value given by some other branch of log w fixed in advance . Then , using the complex exponential function one defines 
 <formula> 
 because this agrees with the earlier definition in the case where w is a positive real number and the ( real ) principal value of log w is used . 
 If z is an integer , then the value of wz is independent of the choice of log w , and it agrees with the earlier definition of exponentiation with an integer exponent . 
 If z is a rational number m / n in lowest terms with z > 0 , then the countably infinitely many choices of log w yield only n different values for wz ; these values are the n complex solutions s to the equation sn = <unk> . 
 If z is an irrational number , then the countably infinitely many choices of log w lead to infinitely many distinct values for wz . 
 The computation of complex powers is facilitated by converting the base w to polar form , as described in detail below . 
 A similar construction is employed in quaternions . 
 = = = Complex roots of unity = = = 
 A complex number w such that wn 
 = 1 for a positive integer n is an nth root of unity . Geometrically , the nth roots of unity lie on the unit circle of the complex plane at the vertices of a regular n @-@ gon with one vertex on the real number 1 . 
 If wn = 
 1 but wk ≠ 1 for all natural numbers k such that 0 < k < n , then w is called a primitive nth root of unity . The negative unit − 1 is the only primitive square root of unity . The imaginary unit i is one of the two primitive 4th roots of unity ; the other one is − i . 
 The number <unk> / n is the primitive nth root of unity with the smallest positive argument . ( It is sometimes called the principal nth root of unity , although this terminology is not universal and should not be confused with the principal value of n √ 1 , which is 1 . ) 
 The other nth roots of unity are given by 
 <formula> 
 for 2 ≤ k ≤ n . 
 = = = Roots of arbitrary complex numbers = = = 
 Although there are infinitely many possible values for a general complex logarithm , there are only a finite number of values for the power <unk> in the important special case where q 
 = 1 / n and n is a positive integer . These are the nth roots of w ; they are solutions of the equation zn = 
 w . As with real roots , a second root is also called a square root and a third root is also called a cube root . 
 It is conventional in mathematics to define w1 / n as the principal value of the root . If w is a positive real number , it is also conventional to select a positive real number as the principal value of the root w1 / n . For general complex numbers , the nth root with the smallest argument is often selected as the principal value of the nth root operation , as with principal values of roots of unity . 
 The set of nth roots of a complex number w is obtained by multiplying the principal value w1 / n by each of the nth roots of unity . For example , the fourth roots of 16 are 2 , − 2 , 2i , and − 2i , because the principal value of the fourth root of 16 is 2 and the fourth roots of unity are 1 , − 1 , i , and − i . 
 = = = Computing complex powers = = = 
 It is often easier to compute complex powers by writing the number to be <unk> in polar form . Every complex number z can be written in the polar form 
 <formula> 
 where r is a nonnegative real number and θ is the ( real ) argument of z . The polar form has a simple geometric interpretation : if a complex number u + iv is thought of as representing a point ( u , v ) in the complex plane using Cartesian coordinates , then ( r , θ ) is the same point in polar coordinates . That is , r is the " radius " r2 
 = u2 + v2 and θ is the " angle " θ = 
 <unk> ( v , u ) . The polar angle θ is ambiguous since any integer multiple of 2π could be added to θ without changing the location of the point . Each choice of θ gives in general a different possible value of the power . A branch cut can be used to choose a specific value . The principal value ( the most common branch cut ) , corresponds to θ chosen in the interval ( − π , π ] . For complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part using the principal value gives the same result as using the corresponding real number . 
 In order to compute the complex power wz , write w in polar form : 
 <formula> 
 Then 
 <formula> 
 and thus 
 <formula> 
 If z is decomposed as c + di , then the formula for wz can be written more explicitly as 
 <formula> 
 This final formula allows complex powers to be computed easily from decompositions of the base into polar form and the exponent into Cartesian form . It is shown here both in polar form and in Cartesian form ( via Euler 's identity ) . 
 The following examples use the principal value , the branch cut which causes θ to be in the interval ( − π , π ] . To compute ii , write i in polar and Cartesian forms : 
 <formula> 
 Then the formula above , with r 
 = 1 , θ = 
 π / 2 , c 
 = 0 , and d = 
 1 , yields : 
 <formula> 
 Similarly , to find ( − 2 ) 3 + <unk> , compute the polar form of − 2 @,@ 
 <formula> 
 and use the formula above to compute 
 <formula> 
 The value of a complex power depends on the branch used . For example , if the polar form i = <unk> / 2 is used to compute ii , the power is found to be e − <unk> / 2 ; the principal value of ii , computed above , is e − π / 2 . The set of all possible values for ii is given by : 
 <formula> 
 So there is an infinity of values which are possible candidates for the value of ii , one for each integer k . All of them have a zero imaginary part so one can say ii has an infinity of valid real values . 
 = = = Failure of power and logarithm identities = = = 
 Some identities for powers and logarithms for positive real numbers will fail for complex numbers , no matter how complex powers and complex logarithms are defined as single @-@ valued functions . For example : 
 The identity log ( bx ) 
 = x ⋅ log b holds whenever b is a positive real number and x is a real number . But for the principal branch of the complex logarithm one has 
 <formula> 
 Regardless of which branch of the logarithm is used , a similar failure of the identity will exist . The best that can be said ( if only using this result ) is that : 
 <formula> 
 This identity does not hold even when considering log as a multivalued function . The possible values of log ( wz ) contain those of z ⋅ log w as a subset . Using Log ( w ) for the principal value of log ( w ) and m , n as any integers the possible values of both sides are : 
 <formula> 
 The identities ( bc ) x = 
 <unk> and ( b / c ) x 
 = bx / cx are valid when b and c are positive real numbers and x is a real number . But a calculation using principal branches shows that 
 <formula> 
 and 
 <formula> 
 On the other hand , when x is an integer , the identities are valid for all nonzero complex numbers . 
 If exponentiation is considered as a multivalued function then the possible values of ( − 1 × − 1 ) 1 / 2 are { 1 , − 1 } . The identity holds but saying { 1 } = 
 { ( − 1 × − 1 ) 1 / 2 } is wrong . 
 The identity ( ex ) y = <unk> holds for real numbers x and y , but assuming its truth for complex numbers leads to the following paradox , discovered in 1827 by Clausen : For any integer n , we have : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 but this is false when the integer n is nonzero . 
 There are a number of problems in the reasoning : 
 The major error is that changing the order of exponentiation in going from line two to three changes what the principal value chosen will be . 
 From the multi @-@ valued point of view , the first error occurs even sooner . Implicit in the first line is that e is a real number , whereas the result of e1 + <unk> is a complex number better represented as e + <unk> . Substituting the complex number for the real on the second line makes the power have multiple possible values . Changing the order of exponentiation from lines two to three also affects how many possible values the result can have . <formula> , but rather <formula> multivalued over integers n .

 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Exponentiation can be defined in any monoid . A monoid is an algebraic structure consisting of a set X together with a rule for composition ( " multiplication " ) satisfying an associative law and a multiplicative identity , denoted by 1 . Exponentiation is defined inductively by : 
 <formula> for all <formula> 
 <formula> for all <formula> and non @-@ negative integers n 
 <unk> include many structures of importance in mathematics , including groups and rings ( under multiplication ) , with more specific examples of the latter being matrix rings and fields . 
 = = = Matrices and linear operators = = = 
 If A is a square matrix , then the product of A with itself n times is called the matrix power . Also <formula> is defined to be the identity matrix , and if A is invertible , then <formula> . 
 Matrix powers appear often in the context of discrete dynamical systems , where the matrix A expresses a transition from a state vector x of some system to the next state Ax of the system . This is the standard interpretation of a Markov chain , for example . Then <formula> is the state of the system after two time steps , and so forth : <formula> is the state of the system after n time steps . The matrix power <formula> is the transition matrix between the state now and the state at a time n steps in the future . So computing matrix powers is equivalent to solving the evolution of the dynamical system . In many cases , matrix powers can be expediently computed by using eigenvalues and eigenvectors . 
 Apart from matrices , more general linear operators can also be <unk> . An example is the derivative operator of calculus , <formula> , which is a linear operator acting on functions <formula> to give a new function <formula> . The n @-@ th power of the differentiation operator is the n @-@ th derivative : 
 <formula> 
 These examples are for discrete exponents of linear operators , but in many circumstances it is also desirable to define powers of such operators with continuous exponents . This is the starting point of the mathematical theory of semigroups . Just as computing matrix powers with discrete exponents solves discrete dynamical systems , so does computing matrix powers with continuous exponents solve systems with continuous dynamics . Examples include approaches to solving the heat equation , Schrödinger equation , wave equation , and other partial differential equations including a time evolution . The special case of <unk> the derivative operator to a non @-@ integer power is called the fractional derivative which , together with the fractional integral , is one of the basic operations of the fractional calculus . 
 = = = Finite fields = = = 
 A field is an algebraic structure in which multiplication , addition , subtraction , and division are all well @-@ defined and satisfy their familiar properties . The real numbers , for example , form a field , as do the complex numbers and rational numbers . Unlike these familiar examples of fields , which are all infinite sets , some fields have only finitely many elements . The simplest example is the field with two elements <formula> with addition defined by <formula> and <formula> , and multiplication <formula> and <formula> . 
 Exponentiation in finite fields has applications in public key cryptography . For example , the Diffie – Hellman key exchange uses the fact that exponentiation is computationally inexpensive in finite fields , whereas the discrete logarithm ( the inverse of exponentiation ) is computationally expensive . 
 Any finite field F has the property that there is a unique prime number p such that <formula> for all x in F ; that is , x added to itself p times is zero . For example , in <formula> , the prime number p = 2 has this property . This prime number is called the characteristic of the field . Suppose that F is a field of characteristic p , and consider the function <formula> that raises each element of F to the power p . This is called the Frobenius automorphism of F. It is an automorphism of the field because of the Freshman 's dream identity <formula> . The Frobenius automorphism is important in number theory because it generates the Galois group of F over its prime subfield . 
 = = = In abstract algebra = = = 
 Exponentiation for integer exponents can be defined for quite general structures in abstract algebra . 
 Let X be a set with a power @-@ associative binary operation which is written <unk> . Then xn is defined for any element x of X and any nonzero natural number n as the product of n copies of x , which is recursively defined by 
 <formula> 
 One has the following properties 
 <formula> 
 If the operation has a two @-@ sided identity element 1 , then x0 is defined to be equal to 1 for any x . 
 <formula> 
 If the operation also has two @-@ sided inverses and is associative , then the magma is a group . The inverse of x can be denoted by x − 1 and follows all the usual rules for exponents . 
 <formula> 
 If the multiplication operation is commutative ( as for instance in abelian groups ) , then the following holds : 
 <formula> 
 If the binary operation is written additively , as it often is for abelian groups , then " exponentiation is repeated multiplication " can be reinterpreted as " multiplication is repeated addition " . Thus , each of the laws of exponentiation above has an analogue among laws of multiplication . 
 When there are several power @-@ associative binary operations defined on a set , any of which might be iterated , it is common to indicate which operation is being repeated by placing its symbol in the superscript . Thus , x ∗ n is x ∗ ... ∗ x , while x # n is x # ... # x , whatever the operations ∗ and # might be . 
 Superscript notation is also used , especially in group theory , to indicate conjugation . That is , gh = h − <unk> , where g and h are elements of some group . Although conjugation obeys some of the same laws as exponentiation , it is not an example of repeated multiplication in any sense . A <unk> is an algebraic structure in which these laws of conjugation play a central role . 
 = = = Over sets = = = 
 If n is a natural number and A is an arbitrary set , the expression An is often used to denote the set of ordered n @-@ tuples of elements of A. This is equivalent to letting An denote the set of functions from the set { 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , n − 1 } to the set A ; the n @-@ tuple ( a0 , a1 , a2 , ... , an − 1 ) represents the function that sends i to ai . 
 For an infinite cardinal number κ and a set A , the notation <unk> is also used to denote the set of all functions from a set of size κ to A. This is sometimes written <unk> to distinguish it from cardinal exponentiation , defined below . 
 This generalized exponential can also be defined for operations on sets or for sets with extra structure . For example , in linear algebra , it makes sense to index direct sums of vector spaces over arbitrary index sets . That is , we can speak of 
 <formula> 
 where each Vi is a vector space . 
 Then if Vi 
 = V for each i , the resulting direct sum can be written in exponential notation as V ⊕ N , or simply VN with the understanding that the direct sum is the default . We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get Vn , although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n , this is defined only up to isomorphism . Taking V to be the field R of real numbers ( thought of as a vector space over itself ) and n to be some natural number , we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra , the real vector space Rn . 
 If the base of the exponentiation operation is a set , the exponentiation operation is the Cartesian product unless otherwise stated . Since multiple Cartesian products produce an n @-@ tuple , which can be represented by a function on a set of appropriate cardinality , SN becomes simply the set of all functions from N to S in this case : 
 <formula> 
 This fits in with the exponentiation of cardinal numbers , in the sense that | SN | = 
 | S | | N | , where | X | is the cardinality of X. When " 2 " is defined as { 0 , 1 } , we have | 2X | = 2 | X | , where 2X , usually denoted by P ( X ) , is the power set of X ; each subset Y of X corresponds uniquely to a function on X taking the value 1 for x ∈ Y and 0 for x <unk> Y. 
 = = = In category theory = = = 
 In a Cartesian closed category , the exponential operation can be used to raise an arbitrary object to the power of another object . This generalizes the Cartesian product in the category of sets . If 0 is an initial object in a Cartesian closed category , then the exponential object 00 is isomorphic to any terminal object 1 . 
 = = = Of cardinal and ordinal numbers = = = 
 In set theory , there are exponential operations for cardinal and ordinal numbers . 
 If κ and λ are cardinal numbers , the expression <unk> represents the cardinality of the set of functions from any set of cardinality λ to any set of cardinality κ . If κ and λ are finite , then this agrees with the ordinary arithmetic exponential operation . For example , the set of 3 @-@ tuples of elements from a 2 @-@ element set has cardinality 8 = 23 . In cardinal arithmetic , <unk> is always 1 ( even if κ is an infinite cardinal or zero ) . 
 Exponentiation of cardinal numbers is distinct from exponentiation of ordinal numbers , which is defined by a limit process involving transfinite induction . 
 = = Repeated exponentiation = = 
 Just as exponentiation of natural numbers is motivated by repeated multiplication , it is possible to define an operation based on repeated exponentiation ; this operation is sometimes called hyper @-@ 4 or tetration . <unk> tetration leads to another operation , and so on , a concept named <unk> . This sequence of operations is expressed by the Ackermann function and Knuth 's up @-@ arrow notation . Just as exponentiation grows faster than multiplication , which is faster @-@ growing than addition , tetration is faster @-@ growing than exponentiation . Evaluated at ( 3 , 3 ) , the functions addition , multiplication , exponentiation , and tetration yield 6 , 9 , 27 , and <unk> ( 
 = 327 = 
 333 = 33 ) respectively .

 = = = Discrete exponents = = = 
 There are many widely used formulas having terms involving natural @-@ number exponents that require 00 to be evaluated to 1 . For example , regarding b0 as an empty product assigns it the value 1 , even when b 
 = 0 . Alternatively , the combinatorial interpretation of b0 is the number of empty tuples of elements from a set with b elements ; there is exactly one empty tuple , even if b = 
 0 . Equivalently , the set @-@ theoretic interpretation of 00 is the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set ; there is exactly one such function , the empty function . 
 = = = Polynomials and power series = = = 
 Likewise , when working with polynomials , it is often necessary to assign <formula> the value 1 . A polynomial is an expression of the form <formula> where x is an indeterminate , and the coefficients <formula> are real numbers ( or , more generally , elements of some ring ) . The set of all real polynomials in x is denoted by <formula> . Polynomials are added <unk> , and multiplied by the applying the usual rules for exponents in the indeterminate x ( see Cauchy product ) . With these algebraic rules for manipulation , polynomials form a polynomial ring . The polynomial <formula> is the identity element of the polynomial ring , meaning that it is the ( unique ) element such that the product of <formula> with any polynomial <formula> is just <formula> . Polynomials can be evaluated by specializing the indeterminate x to be a real number . More precisely , for any given real number <formula> there is a unique <unk> ring homomorphism <formula> such that <formula> . This is called the evaluation homomorphism . Because it is a <unk> homomorphism , we have <formula> That is , <formula> for all specializations of x to a real number ( including zero ) . 
 This perspective is significant for many polynomial identities appearing in combinatorics . For example , the binomial theorem <formula> is not valid for x 
 = 0 unless 00 = 
 1 . Similarly , rings of power series require <formula> to be true for all specializations of x . Thus identities like <formula> and <formula> are only true as functional identities ( including at x 
 = 0 ) if 00 = 
 1 . 
 In differential calculus , the power rule <formula> is not valid for n 
 = 1 at x = 
 0 unless 00 = 1 . 
 = = = Continuous exponents = = = 
 Limits involving algebraic operations can often be evaluated by replacing <unk> by their limits ; if the resulting expression does not determine the original limit , the expression is known as an indeterminate form . In fact , when f ( t ) and g ( t ) are real @-@ valued functions both approaching 0 ( as t approaches a real number or ± ∞ ) , with f ( t ) > 0 , the function f ( t ) g ( t ) need not approach 1 ; depending on f and g , the limit of f ( t ) g ( t ) can be any nonnegative real number or + ∞ , or it can diverge . For example , the functions below are of the form f ( t ) g ( t ) with f ( t ) , g ( t ) → 0 as t → 0 + , but the limits are different : 
 <formula> . 
 Thus , the two @-@ variable function xy , though continuous on the set { ( x , y ) : x > 0 } , cannot be extended to a continuous function on any set containing ( 0 , 0 ) , no matter how one chooses to define 00 . However , under certain conditions , such as when f and g are both analytic functions and f is positive on the open interval ( 0 , b ) for some positive b , the limit approaching from the right is always 1 . 
 = = = Complex exponents = = = 
 In the complex domain , the function <unk> may be defined for nonzero z by choosing a branch of log z and defining <unk> as ew log z . This does not define <unk> since there is no branch of log z defined at z = 0 , let alone in a neighborhood of 0 . 
 = = = History of differing points of view = = = 
 The debate over the definition of <formula> has been going on at least since the early 19th century . At that time , most mathematicians agreed that <formula> , until in 1821 Cauchy listed <formula> along with expressions like <formula> in a table of indeterminate forms . In the 1830s Libri published an unconvincing argument for <formula> , and Möbius sided with him , erroneously claiming that <formula> whenever <formula> . A commentator who signed his name simply as " S " provided the counterexample of <formula> , and this quieted the debate for some time . More historical details can be found in Knuth ( 1992 ) . 
 More recent authors interpret the situation above in different ways : 
 Some argue that the best value for <formula> depends on context , and hence that defining it once and for all is problematic . According to Benson ( 1999 ) , " The choice whether to define <formula> is based on convenience , not on correctness . If we refrain from defining <formula> then certain assertions become unnecessarily awkward . The consensus is to use the definition <formula> , although there are textbooks that refrain from defining <formula> . " 
 Others argue that <formula> should be defined as 1 . Knuth ( 1992 ) contends strongly that <formula> " has to be 1 " , drawing a distinction between the value <formula> , which should equal 1 as advocated by Libri , and the limiting form <formula> ( an abbreviation for a limit of <formula> where <formula> ) , which is necessarily an indeterminate form as listed by Cauchy : " Both Cauchy and Libri were right , but Libri and his defenders did not understand why truth was on their side .

 The IEEE 754 @-@ 2008 floating point standard is used in the design of most floating point libraries . It recommends a number of functions for computing a power : 
 pow treats 00 as 1 . This is the oldest defined version . If the power is an exact integer the result is the same as for pown , otherwise the result is as for powr ( except for some exceptional cases ) . 
 pown treats 00 as 1 . The power must be an exact integer . The value is defined for negative bases ; e.g. , pown ( − 3 @,@ 5 ) is − 243 . 
 powr treats 00 as NaN ( Not @-@ a @-@ Number – undefined ) . The value is also NaN for cases like powr ( − 3 @,@ 2 ) where the base is less than zero . The value is defined by <unk> × log ( base ) . 
 = = = = Programming languages = = = = 
 Most programming language with a power function are implemented using the IEEE pow function and therefore evaluate 00 as 1 . The later C and C + + standards describe this as the normative behaviour . The Java standard mandates this behavior . The .NET Framework method <unk> also treats 00 as 1 . 
 = = = = Mathematics software = = = = 
 Sage simplifies b0 to 1 , even if no constraints are placed on b . It takes 00 to be 1 , but does not simplify 0x for other x . 
 Maple distinguishes between integers 0 , 1 , ... and the corresponding floats 0 @.@ 0 , 1 @.@ 0 , ... ( usually denoted 0 . , 1 . , ... ) . If x does not evaluates to a number , then x0 and <unk> are respectively evaluated to 1 ( integer ) and 1 @.@ 0 ( float ) ; on the other hand , 0x is evaluated to the integer 0 , while <unk> is evaluated as <unk> If both the base and the exponent are zero ( or are evaluated to zero ) , the result is Float ( undefined ) if the exponent is the float 0 @.@ 0 ; with an integer as exponent , the evaluation of 00 results in the integer 1 , while that of 0 @.@ 0 results in the float 1 @.@ 0 . 
 <unk> also simplifies b0 to 1 even if no constraints are placed on b , but issues an error for 00 . For x > 0 , it simplifies 0x to 0 . 
 Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha simplify b0 into 1 , even if no constraints are placed on b . While Mathematica does not simplify 0x , Wolfram Alpha returns two results , 0 for x > 0 , and " indeterminate " for real x . Both Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha take 00 to be " ( indeterminate ) " . 
 Matlab , Python , Magma , GAP , singular , <unk> / GP and the Google and iPhone calculators evaluate 00 as 1 . 
 = = Limits of powers = = 
 The section § Zero to the power of zero gives a number of examples of limits that are of the indeterminate form 00 . The limits in these examples exist , but have different values , showing that the two @-@ variable function xy has no limit at the point ( 0 , 0 ) . One may consider at what points this function does have a limit . 
 More precisely , consider the function f ( x , y ) 
 = xy defined on D = 
 { ( x , y ) ∈ R2 : x > 0 } . Then D can be viewed as a subset of R2 ( that is , the set of all pairs ( x , y ) with x , y belonging to the extended real number line R 
 = [ − ∞ , + ∞ ] , endowed with the product topology ) , which will contain the points at which the function f has a limit . 
 In fact , f has a limit at all accumulation points of D , except for ( 0 , 0 ) , ( + ∞ , 0 ) , ( 1 , + ∞ ) and ( 1 , − ∞ ) . Accordingly , this allows one to define the powers xy by continuity whenever 0 ≤ x ≤ + ∞ , − ∞ ≤ y ≤ + ∞ , except for 00 , ( + ∞ ) 0 , 1 + ∞ and 1 − ∞ , which remain indeterminate forms . 
 Under this definition by continuity , we obtain : 
 x + ∞ = 
 + ∞ and x − ∞ 
 = 0 , when 1 < x ≤ + ∞ . 
 x + ∞ = 
 0 and x − ∞ 
 = + ∞ , when 0 ≤ x < 1 . 
 <unk> = 
 0 and ( + ∞ ) y 
 = + ∞ , when 0 < y ≤ + ∞ . 
 <unk> = 
 + ∞ and ( + ∞ ) y 
 = 0 , when − ∞ ≤ y < 0 . 
 These powers are obtained by taking limits of xy for positive values of x . This method does not permit a definition of xy when x < 0 , since pairs ( x , y ) with x < 0 are not accumulation points of D. 
 On the other hand , when n is an integer , the power xn is already meaningful for all values of x , including negative ones . This may make the definition 0n = 
 + ∞ obtained above for negative n problematic when n is odd , since in this case xn → + ∞ as x tends to 0 through positive values , but not negative ones .

 Computing bn using iterated multiplication requires n − 1 multiplication operations , but it can be computed more efficiently than that , as illustrated by the following example . To compute 2100 , note that 100

 This series of steps only requires 8 multiplication operations instead of 99 ( since the last product above takes 2 multiplications ) . 
 In general , the number of multiplication operations required to compute bn can be reduced to Θ ( log n ) by using exponentiation by squaring or ( more generally ) addition @-@ chain exponentiation . Finding the minimal sequence of multiplications ( the minimal @-@ length addition chain for the exponent ) for bn is a difficult problem for which no efficient algorithms are currently known ( see <unk> sum problem ) , but many reasonably efficient heuristic algorithms are available . 
 = = Exponential notation for function names = = 
 Placing an integer superscript after the name or symbol of a function , as if the function were being raised to a power , commonly refers to repeated function composition rather than repeated multiplication . Thus , f 3 ( x ) may mean f ( f ( f ( x ) ) ) ; in particular , f − 1 ( x ) usually denotes the inverse function of f . <unk> functions are of interest in the study of fractals and dynamical systems . Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1 / 2 ( x ) . 
 For historical reasons , this notation applied to the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions has a specific and diverse interpretation : a positive exponent applied to the function 's abbreviation means that the result is raised to that power , while an exponent of − 1 denotes the inverse function . That is , <unk> x is just a shorthand way to write ( sin x ) 2 without using parentheses , whereas sin − 1 x refers to the inverse function of the sine , also called <unk> x . Each trigonometric and hyperbolic has its own name and abbreviation both for the reciprocal ; for example , 1 / ( sin x ) 
 = ( sin x ) − 1 = 
 <unk> x , as well as for its inverse , for example cosh − 1 x = <unk> x . A similar convention applies to logarithms , where log2 x usually means ( log x ) 2 , not log log x .

 The superscript notation xy is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for typewriters and computer terminals that align the baselines of all characters on each line . Many programming languages have alternate ways of expressing exponentiation that do not use <unk> :

 = Fellows v. Blacksmith = 
 Fellows v. Blacksmith , 60 U.S. ( 19 How . ) 366 ( 1857 ) , is a United States Supreme Court decision involving Native American law . John Blacksmith , a Tonawanda Seneca , sued agents of the Ogden Land Company for common law claims of trespass , assault , and battery after he was forcibly evicted from his sawmill by the Company 's agents . The Court affirmed a judgement in Blacksmith 's favor , notwithstanding the fact that the Seneca had executed an Indian removal treaty and the Company held the exclusive right to purchase to the land by virtue of an interstate compact ratified by Congress . 
 Citing the trust relationship between the federal government and the tribes , the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government , not private parties ( whether through self @-@ help or through the courts ) . In other words , the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties . At the same time , the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid , and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was fraudulent . 
 Fellows was one of several encounters of the Taney Court with the aboriginal title . It was the first litigation of aboriginal title in the United States in the Court by an indigenous plaintiff since Cherokee Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) . According to a contemporary New York Times article : " The questions involved are of great magnitude , and affect more or less the title to a large portion of the State of New York . " In Fellows , the court found " its first opportunity to consider the power of the federal government over Indian lands in New York . " Following the precedents of the Marshall Court , Fellows was " decided at a time when the government was still dealing with Indian tribes as if they were semi @-@ sovereign nations . " 
 The plaintiffs ' lawyer John H. Martindale ( future New York Attorney General ) also represented the interests of the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians in three companion cases in the New York state courts . The third such case , New York ex rel . Cutler v. Dibble ( 1858 ) , also reached the Supreme Court , which held that state nonintercourse acts ( U.S. state laws prohibiting non @-@ Indians from acquiring Indian lands ) are not preempted by the Commerce Clause , the federal Nonintercourse Act , or federal treaties . Ely S. Parker , one of the administrators of the Blacksmith estate , went on to draft the surrender at Appomattox and to become the first indigenous Commissioner of Indian Affairs .

 = = = Precedent = = = 
 The Marshall Court ( 1801 — 1835 ) had repeatedly taken up the issue of aboriginal title in the United States . However , with the exception of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) , which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction , all the disputes had been between non @-@ Indians — typically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians . The uniform rule of these cases , enunciated most clearly in Johnson v. M 'Intosh ( 1823 ) , was that non @-@ Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases . However , the purchase at issue in Fellows , the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) , had been ratified by the federal government . 
 The Court had not yet encountered a party claiming to actually possess aboriginal title in a case in which it had jurisdiction , so it had not yet definitively resolved the question of whether the holders of aboriginal title could avail themselves of the common law causes of action of trespass or ejectment . At the end of his opinion in Fletcher v. Peck ( 1810 ) , Marshall had stated that ejectment could not be obtained against the holder of aboriginal title . The Taney Court ( 1836 — 1864 ) , in Marsh v. Brooks ( 1850 ) , went further in declaring that the holder of aboriginal title could obtain ejectment , stating : " That an action of ejectment could be maintained on an Indian right to occupancy and use , is not open to question . " In the oral arguments of that case , Cherokee Nation had been cited as authority for the argument that " Indians cannot sue on their aboriginal title in court of the United States . " The plaintiffs in Fellows had sued under the related cause of action of trespass . 
 An 1821 opinion of U.S. Attorney General William Wirt , interpreting Fletcher and Johnson , argued that : " The Seneca Indians must be protected in the enjoyment of exclusive possession of their lands , as defined and bounded in the Treaty of Canandaigua , until they have voluntarily relinquished it . " 
 = = = Dispute = = = 
 Both the sovereignty over and land title to modern @-@ day western New York was disputed between the colonies , and then states , of New York and Massachusetts , both claiming the lands by virtue of their colonial charters . This dispute was resolved on December 16 , 1786 by the Treaty of Hartford , an interstate compact providing that the lands would be part of the territory of New York , but Massachusetts would retain the pre @-@ emption rights , the exclusive right to purchase the Indian lands . The compact was approved by the Congress of the Confederation on October 8 , 1787 . 
 Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham acquired the right of pre @-@ emption to the lands at issue in Fellows v. Blacksmith from Massachusetts in 1788 as part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase . However , Phelps and Gorham only consummated the right of pre @-@ emption for a tract east of the Genesee River in 1788 . Phelps and Gorham defaulted on their payments to Massachusetts in 1790 , causing the pre @-@ emption rights to return to the state . Massachusetts then conveyed the pre @-@ emption rights to Samuel Ogden on behalf of Robert Morris on May 12 , 1791 . Morris retained the pre @-@ emptive right to the Morris Reserve for himself , but sold the pre @-@ emptive right to the lands in question to the Holland Land Company on July 20 , 1793 ( the Holland Purchase ) . 
 The Holland Land Company consummated much of its pre @-@ emptive right in the Treaty of Big Tree ( 1797 ) , extinguishing all Seneca aboriginal title west of the Genesee River except in ten reservations . The dispute concerned one of those reservations . The Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) had provided for the relocation of the Seneca people from New York to present @-@ day Kansas , with the exception of four reservations : the Buffalo Creek Reservation , the Cattaraugus Reservation , the Allegany Reservation , and the Tonawanda Reservation . However , the Seneca refused to be relocated . Another treaty with the Senecas from 1842 modified the prior treaty : the Senecas were to keep Cattaraugus and Allegany , but still cede Buffalo Creek and Tonawanda . The Seneca Nation of New York was established in 1848 . The Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians seceded from the Seneca Nation and achieved independent federal recognition ( after the decision ) in 1857 .

 Facts 
 John Blacksmith was a member of the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians and the sachem of the Wolf Clan . Blacksmith had constructed a " Indian sawmill and yard " on his enclosed tract within the Tonawanda Reservation in Pembroke , Genesee County , New York circa 1826 . Blacksmith had not received compensation for the value of his improvements ( the sawmill and yard ) , as provided for by the 1838 and 1842 treaties , because he forcibly refused to let the treaty arbitrators onto his property for the survey . The Ogden Land Company claimed title to the Tonawanda Reservation by virtue of its right of pre @-@ emption , consummated by the treaties . Agents of the company " expelled and dispossessed " Blacksmith " with force of arms . " 
 Supreme Court ( trial court ) 
 The suit was originally brought by John Blacksmith in 1846 . Represented by lawyer John H. Martindale , Blacksmith sued Joseph Fellows and Robert Kendle , agents of the Land Company , for the torts of assault and battery and trespass , <unk> clausum <unk> , with the sawmill as the locus in quo . Blacksmith 's wife and Ely S. Parker ( Blacksmith 's successor as sachem of the Wolf Clan ) , together the administrators of Blacksmith 's estate , succeeded Blacksmith as plaintiffs . 
 After a jury trial , the New York Supreme Court held for Blacksmith . 
 Supreme Court , General Term 
 The New York Supreme Court General Term ( " circuit court " ) denied a new trial , holding that the payment of the appraisal value of the improvements determined by the arbitrator was a condition precedent to the conveyance in the treaty . 
 Court of Appeals 
 Before the New York Court of Appeals , Fellows was represented by J. C. Spencer , who made three arguments . First , he argued that the right to bring an action for trespass based on aboriginal title accrued only to an Indian nation , not an individual Indian . As Spencer noted , the Seneca Nation itself was prohibited by law from bringing an action " by a private attorney . " Second , he argued that Fellows ' title was valid . Third , he argued that the Seneca 's rights under the treaty were only enforceable against the federal government , and did not affect the defendant 's title as a condition precedent . The court reporter did not publish Martindale 's responses . 
 The Court of Appeals , 6 @-@ 1 , sided with Blacksmith . Judge John Worth Edmonds delivered the majority opinion , joined by Chief Judge Charles H. Ruggles and Judges Addison Gardiner , Freeborn G. Jewett , Alexander S. Johnson , and Watson . Judge Welles dissented and Judge Gridley was absent . 
 The Court of Appeals held that Blacksmith could independently bring the claim for trespass , for which he need only show a right to possession . The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows ' title was invalid , because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent . Welles , in dissent , agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass , but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent ; he would have reversed and granted a new trial , with costs . The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court , after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court . 
 U.S. Supreme Court oral argument 
 John H. Martindale argued the case for the Tonawanda Senecas before the Court . Commissioner R.H. Gillet and J.L. Brown of the Ogden Land Company argued for the defendants . Arguments started on January 15 , 1857 and were adjourned until January 17 . 
 One of the plaintiffs , Ely S. Parker personally attended the oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington , D.C. According to the New York Times : 
 All who heard their cases argued before the Supreme Court of the United States , a few months since , will recollect seeing this same Indian , and that he was well posted on the points he desired his counsel to press upon the attention of the Court . 
 A letter to the editor of the New York Times — which criticizes a previous article for creating the " impression that the Indians at Tonawanda are very nearly the equal in agriculture , general intelligence , and in the customs of civilized life , of their white neighbors " — concurs with this assessment of Parker 's role : 
 I have not a word to say in the disparagement of the intellectual ability of Ely S. Parker , their head chief , and cheerfully unite with " <unk> " in awarding him the credit for making valuable suggestions to his counsel on the argument of the case in the Supreme Court of the United States [ . ] Indeed , I am inclined to the belief , that to him is due the credit of originating and suggesting to his counsel the only available point in the case , and the one on which it was there decided , for the case had been ten years in the Courts of this State , and this point was never before made , nor was it made in the Supreme Court of the United States , in the original brief of counsel for the Indians , filed pursuant to the rules of the Court . It was first made in a supplementary brief printed after the opening argument of counsel on the other side had been commenced , and not handed in until the second day , just previous to its conclusion . 
 Opinion announcement 
 Chief Justice Roger Taney was not present at the opinion announcement for Fellows because he was at home working on the opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford , which was announced the next day . The Taney court had inherited from the preceding Marshall Court voluminous decisions on the status of aboriginal title in the United States . None of those decisions was cited in either opinion . Dred Scott , in dicta , opined the following on aboriginal title : 
 The situation of [ blacks ] was altogether unlike that of the Indian race . The latter . . . were situated in territories to which the white race claimed the ultimate right of dominion . But that claim was acknowledged to be subject to the right of the Indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper , and neither the English nor colonial Governments claimed or exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied , nor claimed the right to the possession of the territory , until the tribe or nation consented to cede it . 
 Justice John Catron , concurring in Dred Scott , also noted in dicta that : 
 [ B ] ecause Congress has express power to regulate commerce among the Indian tribes and to prohibit intercourse with the Indians , that therefore Dr. Emerson 's title might be defeated within the country ceded by the Indians to the United States as early as 1805 . . . . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 Justice Samuel Nelson delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court , affirming the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals . 
 Effect of the Treaty 
 The Court observed : 
 Neither treaty made any provision as to the mode or manner in which the removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place . The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations , or of the four , as the case would have been under the first treaty . The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force ; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained , the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right , and must be affirmed . 
 The Court noted that previous removals of Indians had been undertaken by the federal government " according to the usage and practice of the Government , by its authority and under its care and superintendence . " " [ A ] ny other mode of a forcible removal , " the Court argued , would not " be consistent with the peace of the country , or with the duty of the Government to these dependent people , who have been influenced by its counsel and authority to change their habitations . " 
 Because the treaty had been negotiated " with them as a quasi nation , possessing some of the attributes of an independent people , and to be dealt with accordingly , " the Court held that " unless otherwise expressly stipulated " only the federal government had the " authority or power " to execute the agreement . The Court remarked that the Senecas were " in a state of pupilage , and hold the relation to the Government as a ward to his guardian . " The nature of that relationship between the Seneca and the federal government was incompatible with the Seneca being expelled by " irregular force and violence , " or even " through the intervention of the courts of justice . " Thus , the court held that the private beneficiaries of Native American treaties could neither expel tribes by force or by a cause of action for ejectment . The court observed that " this interpretation is in accordance with the usages and practice of the Government in providing for the removal of Indian tribes from their ancient possessions , with the fitness and propriety of the thing itself , " and with the text of the treaty . 
 The Court concluded : " We hold that the performance was not a duty that belonged to the grantees , but for the Government under the treaty . " 
 Validity of the Treaty 
 The Court did not accept the plaintiffs ' arguments that the treaty was invalid because it was not signed by tribal leaders with the authority to cede the relevant lands or because the signatories were fraudulently induced to sign . <unk> to the enrolled bill rule ( the only citation of case law in the opinion ) , the Court held that " the treaty , after executed and ratified by the proper authorities of the Government , becomes the supreme law of the land , and the courts can no more go behind it for the purpose of annulling its effect and operation . " 
 Conditions Precedent 
 Because its aforementioned holdings required affirmance , the Court did not reach the alternate ground for decision of the trial court that the appraisal and the payments were conditions precedent .

 Lawyer John H. Martindale , of <unk> & Martindale , also represented Tonawanda Seneca plaintiffs in three other contemporary suits against the Land Company and its grantees : People ex rel . Blacksmith v. Tracy ( N.Y. Sup . 1845 ) ; People ex rel . Waldron v. Soper ( N.Y. 1852 ) ; and New York ex rel . Cutler v. Dibble ( U.S. 1858 ) . At the time , Martindale ( the future New York Attorney General ) was well known for litigating personal injury torts against railroads , especially New York Central Railroad . 
 Whereas Fellows was brought in the New York Supreme Court under the common law cause of action of trespass , these three suits were brought ( as required by statute ) in the Genesee County Court under a state statute prohibiting non @-@ Indians from residing on Indian lands . That statute provided : 
 [ I ] t shall be unlawful for any person or persons , other than Indians , to settle or reside upon any lands belonging to or occupied by any nation or tribe of Indians within this state ; and that all leases , contracts and agreements made by any Indians , whereby any person or persons , other than Indians , shall be permitted to reside upon such lands , shall be absolutely void ; and if any person or persons shall settle or reside on any such lands , contrary to this act , it shall be the duty of any judge of any court of Common Pleas of the county within which such lands shall be situated , on complaint made to him , and on due proof of the fact of such settlement or residence , to issue his warrant , under his hand and seal , directed to the sheriff of such county , commanding him , within ten days after the receipt thereof , to remove such person or persons so settling or residing , with his , her or their families , from such lands . 
 The statute further provided : 
 that it shall be the duty of the district attorneys respectively of the several counties in this state in which any lands belonging to any Indian tribe shall be situated , ( among other things ) to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands , forbidden by the act ; and from time to time to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands , and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed . 
 From 1821 – 1846 , the district attorney would have been appointed ; thereafter , the office was elected . Martindale was the district attorney of Genesee County from 1842 – 1844 and again from 1847 – 1849 . Thus , Martindale himself filed the complaints in People ex rel . Blacksmith v. Tracy and People ex rel . Waldron v. Soper , and his successor , Seth Wakeman ( 1850 – 1855 ) filed the complaint in New York ex rel . Cutler v. Dibble . Although Martindale was district attorney when the complaint in Tracy was filed , he lost the election and attempted to litigate the mandamus issue as a private attorney . 
 The results of the three suits were mixed . Martindale was defeated in the New York Supreme Court and New York Court of Appeals , respectively , in the first two , but had prevailed in the Court of Appeals and , ultimately , the U.S. Supreme Court in the third . 
 = = = People ex rel . Blacksmith v. Tracy = = = 
 Martindale ( in his final days as district attorney ) filed the complaint on January 8 , 1845 . Evidence , including the testimony of Ely S. Parker , was presented on January 11 . Judge Phineas L. Tracy , of the Genesee County Court ( 1841 – 1845 ) , declined to issue a warrant to the Genesee County Sheriff to remove the Ogden grantees . 
 Still in January , Martindale applied to the Supreme Court for mandamus , and the court issued an alternative mandamus ( essentially , an order to show cause why peremptory mandamus should not issue ) on March 6 , 1845 , which was served March 25 . On April 19 , the deadline was extended to the first Tuesday in June . Before the Supreme Court , Martindale was joined by New York Attorney General John Van Buren and opposed by A. Taber and J. L. Brown . 
 That June , Judge Jewett granted Tracy 's motion to quash , without costs . The court held that only the district attorney could bring such an action to enforce the statute : 
 I am of opinion that by the terms and spirit of the statute under which this proceeding has been had , no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee ( in which the lands intruded upon are situated ) could regularly be a relator . The remedy for the act complained of is provided by the statute , as well as the officers to carry it into execution . It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act , and from time to time to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands , and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed . Without the act , John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands ; and with the act , no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions , or to cause the intruders to be removed , but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated . 
 The court also found the affidavit of Parker to be insufficient as a factual matter to comply with the terms of the statute . However , even if the district attorney had brought the action and the affidavit had been sufficient , the Supreme Court still would have denied mandamus as a matter of law . 
 = = = People ex rel . Waldron v. Soper = = = 
 In the second suit , Martindale — in a second term , this time as an elected district attorney — filed the complaint under the same statute on January 3 , 1849 . Judge Horace U. Soper , of the Genesee County Court ( 1847 – 1850 ) , granted the writ of removal on January 9 , 1849 . The New York Supreme Court General Term ( Judges Mullet , Sill , and Marvin ) , sitting in Buffalo , New York , granted a writ of certiorari , and affirmed in March 1849 . " Waldron " is the only party subject to the writ of removal named in the Court of Appeals opinion ( the only reported opinion ) and only by last name . 
 The Court of Appeals reversed and annulled the writ in October 1852 . Judge John Worth Edmonds , for a unanimous court , gave two reasons . First , it held that the court had no power to proceed against the majority of the defendants because they were not properly summoned and caused to appear . Second , with respect to defendant Waldron ( who had voluntarily appeared ) , the court held that " it does not appear that these lands were owned by the Indians . "

 In a third suit , Martindale 's successor as district attorney , Seth Wakeman ( 1845 – 1850 ) , filed a complaint against Asa Cutler , John Underhill , and <unk> Underhill ( grantees of the Land Company ) under the same statute , on February 19 , 1853 . Thomas Black , a Seneca who had made some improvements and apparently been compensated for the same , allegedly consented to the <unk> presence . Judge Edgar C. Dibble , of the Genesee County Court ( 1846 , 1851 – 1854 ) and a one @-@ time partner of Martindale , granted the writ of removal . The Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed on September 4 , 1854 , holding that " the Seneca nation had not duly granted and conveyed the reserve in question to Ogden and Fellows . " The judgement of the Supreme Court was delivered by Judge Marvin , joined by judges Bowen and Green . Judge Mullet dissented without opinion . 
 The Court of Appeals — after the second argument — also affirmed in September 1857 . The majority opinion was authored by Judge Brown , joined by Judges Comstock , Paige , Shankland , and Bowen . The Court of Appeals held that the state statute did not violate the New York Constitution and that a jury trial was not required because the defendants had no property right . In closing , the Court of Appeals cited the U.S. Supreme Court 's recent decision in Fellows . Chief Judge Hiram <unk> , joined by Judge Alexander S. Johnson , concurred on the constitutionality of the 1821 state statute , but dissented on the grounds that the treaties extinguished the aboriginal title , and thus the state statute either did not apply or violated the treaty . Judge Selden recused . 
 By the time Fellows was decided , Dibble had reached the U.S. Supreme Court but had not yet been argued . The Court eventually affirmed in 1858 , holding that the state statute did not violate the Indian Commerce Clause , the federal Nonintercourse Act , or the treaty .

 = = = Enrolled treaty doctrine = = = 
 The key claim advanced by lawyer John H. Martindale in all four cases had been that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was invalid because it was not signed by the Seneca leaders with the authority to cede the Tonawanda Reservation , and the signatures it did contain were obtained by coercion or fraud . This argument had not prevailed before the New York Courts or the Supreme Court . As Brown notes : 
 The principal point , however , on which the counsel relied , and which he hoped to establish , was that the <unk> were not bound by the Treaties , because the chiefs there protested against and refused to sign them . To this point his main argument has always , in all stages of the litigation been addressed , and he has pressed it upon the consideration of the Courts , with the utmost pertinacity . It was , however , decided against him in the Blacksmith case , argued last Winter at Washington and has never been decided in his favor by any Court . 
 Fellows is among the earliest cases where the Supreme Court applied treaties , including treaties between the United States and Native American tribes , as binding law . Fellows has been cited as authority for the enrolled treaty doctrine ; analogous to the enrolled bill rule for statutes , the enrolled treaty doctrine prevents inquiry into the legitimacy of the formation of treaties once ratified by the Senate . This doctrine was later used to deny relief ( or , to deny more relief ) to Native American tribes who claimed that treaties were entered into fraudulently or signed by persons without authority to bind the tribe . Fellows was also decided before the Supreme Court began distinguishing between self @-@ executing and non @-@ self executing treaties . Regardless , treaties between the United States and Native Americans continued to be regarded as self @-@ executing . 
 = = = Seneca land claims = = = 
 A contemporary New York Times article opined that : " The questions involved are of great magnitude , and affect more or less the title to a large portion of the State of New York . " Although the Seneca prevailed in the lawsuit , title to a large portion of the state was not called into question due to the court 's refusal to entertain the Seneca 's claims regarding the invalidity of the treaty . According to Armstrong , the result of the decision was mixed : 
 The decision was not all that the Indians had hoped for — it was a victory on narrow legal grounds rather than a vindication of their cause — but it was a victory . The Court 's ruling meant that as long as the federal government was determined to take no action to remove them from Tonawanda , the Ogden Company was powerless to do so . 
 Fellows was " decided at a time when the government was still dealing with Indian tribes as if they were semi @-@ sovereign nations . " The Tonawanda Seneca were never relocated to Kansas , and a new 1857 treaty confirmed their title to a 7 @,@ 549 @-@ acre reservation . This treaty ended 15 years of litigation between the Tonawanda Band and the Ogden Land Company . 
 The Seneca , again represented by Martindale , prevailed in New York ex rel . Cutler v. Dibble ( 1858 ) . Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy ( 1896 ) also involved a Seneca plaintiff represented by a Civil War general . There , the plaintiffs challenged the Phelps and Gorham Purchase under the Nonintercourse Act . Fellows was not cited . In 1899 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a $ 1 @,@ 967 @,@ 056 judgment of the Court of Claims ( pursuant to an enabling statute ) against the federal government based on the 1838 treaty . Fellows was cited by Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida ( 1974 ) for the proposition that " the possessory right claimed is a federal right to the lands at issue in this case . " 
 = = = Litigants = = = 
 Plaintiff Ely S. Parker went on to become a member of General Ulysses S. Grant 's staff during the American Civil War , drawing up the terms of the surrender at Appomattox Court House . After the war , President Grant appointed Parker as Commissioner of Indian Affairs , the first indigenous head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs . According to his New York Times obituary , Parker " negotiated the removal of his tribe from this State to the fertile and pleasant lands on Green Bay , Wisconsin . " 
 The Seneca 's lawyer , John H. Martindale , later appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court , as New York Attorney General , in In re New York Indians ( 1866 ) , arguing that the state had the right to tax the Senecas . The Court disagreed . In the case below , plaintiffs Joseph Fellows ( the defendant in Fellows ) , Louisa Troup , and George R. Babcock sought to recover a plot of land from Robert Denniston ( in his official capacity as New York State Comptroller ) and Thomas W. Olcott , the purchaser at the tax foreclosure sale . Fellows , Troup , and Babcock argued that the state had no power to tax the Seneca . In re New York Indians , agreeing , cited Fellows : 
 Until the Indians have sold their lands , and removed from them in pursuance of the treaty stipulations , they are to be regarded as still in their ancient possession , and are in under their original rights , and entitled to the undisturbed enjoyment of them . This was the effect of the decision in the case of Fellows v. Blacksmith . The time for the surrender of the possession , according to their consent given in the treaty , had not expired when these taxes were levied . The period within which the removal was to take place , under the treaty of 1838 , was five years from the time it went into effect . It was not proclaimed till 1840 , and under that of 1842 the time did not expire till 1846 . The taxation of the lands was premature and illegal . 
 = Guitar Hero ( video game ) = 
 Guitar Hero is a music rhythm video game developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for the PlayStation 2 video game console . It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series . Guitar Hero was released on November 8 , 2005 in North America , April 7 , 2006 in Europe and June 15 , 2006 in Australia . The game 's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks @-@ like game to America . 
 The game features a guitar @-@ shaped controller ( resembling a miniature Gibson SG ) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music . The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks , in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen . The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock , from the 1960s up through 2005 , in addition to bonus tracks . Guitar Hero became a surprise hit , earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications , and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century . The game 's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise , which has earned more than $ 2 billion in sales , spawning several sequels , expansions , and other game @-@ related products . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay is similar to other music and rhythm video games , in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song . The basic mechanics are based on Konami 's Guitar Freaks . In the case of Guitar Hero , the player may use either the guitar peripheral ( a 3 / 4 @-@ scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as bundled with the game , or a third @-@ party version ) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes . The guitar peripheral has five different @-@ colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck , and a strum bar and a whammy bar on the body of the guitar . The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game 's menus . Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes , matching in color and position to the fret buttons , that scroll down the screen on a fret board . To hit or play a note , the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar at the same time as that note passes a marked area on the screen . Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer @-@ on and pull @-@ off techniques where the player does not need to strum each note . The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar , allowing both left @-@ handed and right @-@ handed players to utilize the guitar controller . A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game 's manual . 
 The player is awarded points for correctly hitting notes , chords and sustains . The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing a series of consecutive notes successfully . A " Rock Meter " tracks the player 's performance based on success or failure of hitting notes , and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player . The player can also earn " Star Power " by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains . Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway , Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically , or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller . Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes . Thus , players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed . 
 = = = Modes and other features = = = 
 Guitar Hero 's main mode of play is Career Mode , where the player and in @-@ game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four or five songs . Completing songs in this mode unlocks the songs for play within the other game modes . Players can choose their on @-@ stage character and their guitar ; these elements have no effect on gameplay but affect the visuals during the performance . In Career Mode , players can earn money from their performances that is redeemable at the in @-@ game store , where bonus content , such as additional songs , guitars and finishes , can be unlocked . Quick Play mode allows the player to play any unlocked track , selecting the difficulty , the character , venue and guitar . After successfully completing a song in either Career or Quick Play mode , the player is given a score and a rating between three @-@ five stars , depending on his or her overall performance . 
 Multiplayer mode offers two players the chance to compete against each other on the same song . Two fret boards will appear on screen , one for each player , as they alternate playing sections of the song in a dueling manner . The player with the highest score at the end of the song wins . 
 The four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him or her progress in skill . The first difficulty level , Easy , only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play . Medium introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes , and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes . Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn , but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player . 
 = = Development = = 
 According to Rob Kay , the game 's Lead Designer , the idea of Guitar Hero was directly inspired by Konami 's Guitar Freaks arcade game , where the player used a guitar @-@ shaped controller to interact with the game . At the time , GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America . RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix . RedOctane 's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service , and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America . The Huangs raised $ 1 @.@ 75 million for the effort , despite being turned down by some investors who " thought [ the idea ] was too weird " . Greg Fischbach , one of the founders of Acclaim Entertainment , noted , regretfully several years later , they had passed on Guitar Hero , questioning " Who 's going to buy a peripheral like that ? " The Huangs approached Harmonix , who had previously made music video games such as Frequency , Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar @-@ based video game for those controllers . With a budget of about one million dollars ( which Kay noted was " pretty tiny for a video game " ) , the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero . Kay noted that " No one had any notions about it being a massive success ; we all just thought it would be fun to do . " Harmonix 's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice @-@ president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game 's creation , who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching Frequency to Microsoft that no music @-@ rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it , prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose . 
 The team quickly recognized that " the controller really was the kind of magic sauce for what we wanted to do " . They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out . These aspects included the note @-@ matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game . The third key aspect was the use of Star Power " to provide a little more depth to the game — some replay value , some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes " . Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller . The controller initially had pressure @-@ sensitive fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar , but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex . The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power , in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game . The team had spent " precious development time and resources " into creating a free @-@ style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay . 
 " Gem tracks " , the pattern of notes for a song , were developed by a team in Harmonix , taking usually a day to develop the tracks for one song . Tracks were designed to include key notes to " make [ the player ] feel as if [ he is ] a brilliant musician " . Software algorithms were used to assess the difficulty of the tracks , and the quality assurance team helped to rebalance the tracks for accuracy and difficulty . The software also allowed Harmonix to quickly make changes to the set list or to recreate the tracks for a song to make sure the overall difficulty of the game was appropriate . 
 At the onset of development , the team did not have any idea of what songs would be present in the final game . Kay noted that " We wanted 30 or 40 songs for the game and put a hundred on our wish list . " The game was to focus mostly on hard rock songs , but the team was limited by what could be licensed . The team also felt " morally obligated " to include older , classic rock songs like The Ramones ' " I Wanna Be Sedated " to the younger target audience of the game . Harmonix had to modify the track list throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues , requiring the team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of the track list . WaveGroup Sound were used to create the covers of the licensed songs provided in the game . Marcus Henderson of the band <unk> provided many of the lead guitar tracks for the covers . WaveGroup Sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs . In the case of Black Sabbath 's " Iron Man " , the team learned that the vocal effects were created by having Ozzy Osbourne sing from behind a metal fan . The team sought out the same model of fan through Craigslist to generate the same effect in the game 's cover . Many of the bonus songs were from groups that Harmonix employees were part of or knew . Additionally , a " Be a Guitar Hero " contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song to be included in the game . The winning song was " Cheat on the Church " by Graveyard BBQ . Black Label Society 's song , " Fire it Up " , was included two weeks before the game was completed at the request of Zakk Wylde . The final song list was set very near to the shipping date . 
 Guitar Hero started with " super @-@ basic Pong @-@ style graphics " for the game display . The final game art was led by Ryan Lesser , using the art team 's involvement in the music scene . Based on the experience from Frequency and Amplitude , the team realized that " people don 't necessarily relate to really abstract visuals " , and included the depictions of live performances as previously used in Karaoke Revolution . House of Moves were used to assist in creation motion capture for the on @-@ screen animations . The appearance of Star Power was made to resemble electricity , both to reflect the use of the electric guitar as well to conceptually demonstrate the excitement of the performance and the virtual audience . 
 Guitar Hero was initially released to retail stores in a bundle that packaged the game disc and a Gibson SG guitar controller , priced at $ 69 @.@ 99 . Since its release , stand @-@ alone copies of the games and the guitar controller have been released , including both RedOctane and third @-@ party controllers from TAC and Nyko . <unk> , another controller company that has produced guitar controllers , was set to initially be part of the game 's development , creating a version of the game for the Xbox , but had to pull out due to a lawsuit by <unk> ; <unk> 's Darrel Richardson stated they had to pay $ 300 @,@ 000 to get out of their contract with RedOctane .

 Guitar Hero features 47 playable songs , 30 of which are " main setlist " tracks that are covers of popular songs .

All cover tracks are credited on screen with the phrase " as made famous by " ( e.g. , " ' I Wanna Be Sedated ' , as made famous by The Ramones " ) . The other 17 songs are master recordings selected from indie groups .

 Guitar Hero received critical acclaim upon release . It received a score of 91 @.@ 96 % on GameRankings and 91 / 100 on Metacritic . IGN praised the " fantastic soundtrack " and " great peripheral " , further commenting that mini @-@ Gibson SG controller " is what makes Guitar Hero , rather than what breaks it " . GameSpot echoed these sentiments , stating Guitar Hero had a " great guitar controller " and " killer soundtrack " and was possibly the " best rhythm game ever made " . Many reviews praised the game 's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song . Play said the game " gives bedroom air guitarists a chance to live out their rock ' n ' roll fantasies " . GameSpy 's review commented on the length of the songs , in that " once you hit the three minute mark or so , things start to feel ' too long ' " . Eurogamer said , " the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may detract from the package from an importer 's perspective " and " it would have been truly amazing with a better track list " . 
 Shortly after release , Guitar Hero became an unexpected hit ; it was the second @-@ highest @-@ selling PlayStation 2 title in February 2006 according to the NPD Group . Game sales amounted to $ 45 million in 2005 . Since then , the game has sold about 1 @.@ 53 million copies through December 2007 . The success of the game has spawned a one billion dollar Guitar Hero franchise , including four sequels on several seventh generation consoles , seven expansions , a mobile phone @-@ based version , and a portable version for the Nintendo DS . Harmonix no longer is involved in development of the series , due to its acquisition by MTV . Harmonix has since developed Rock Band using designs similar to those that based Guitar Hero 's success . 
 The game and its sequels have created interest in young adults and children in learning how to play a real guitar , and has been considered as a " cultural phenomenon " that has created a significant cultural impact . At the end of 2009 , several journalists , including Wired , G4TV , CNN , the San Jose Mercury News , the Toronto Star , Inc . , The Guardian , and Advertising Age , considered Guitar Hero to be one of the most influential products of the first decade of the 21st century , attributing it as the spark leading to the growth of the rhythm game market , for boosting music sales for both new and old artists , for introducing more social gaming concepts to the video game market , and , in conjunction with the Wii , for improving interactivity with gaming consoles .

 Steffen Peters ( born September 18 , 1964 ) is a German @-@ born equestrian who competes for the United States in dressage . He has participated in three Olympic Games , winning a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics . Peters has been successful in numerous other international competitions , including winning team bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games , two individual bronze medals at the 2010 World Equestrian Games and individual and team gold at the 2011 Pan Am Games . The horse upon which he won many of his titles , Ravel , was retired in 2012 , and Peters is currently working with a new international competition horse , Legolas . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Peters was born in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Germany . He began riding at age seven , and competing in weekend dressage shows . By 15 , he was competing outside of Germany , at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark . He received his first horse , Udon , at age 16 as a gift from his father ; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics . In 1984 , he spent the summer training in San Diego , California , before returning to Germany to perform his army service . In 1985 , he returned to the United States with Udon . In 1991 , he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor , Lila <unk> , who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters ' Arroyo Del Mar training barn . Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992 , saying , " The whole idea of being so patriotic , of feeling so close to one 's country makes a difference . There are not too many other countries where the people are so patriotic . I really enjoy this about America . " Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife , Shannon . Their large dressage barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012 , around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders . Outside of his competition and training schedule , he teaches in around 30 training seminars each year . His staff call him " a machine " with regard to his training and competition schedule , and in addition to riding , he participates in swimming , cycling and tennis . 
 = = Competitive career = = 
 Peters ' show record before the 1992 Summer Olympics made him a hopeful to compete for the US team . However , his citizenship papers were not processed in time to compete in the Olympic trials , and so he did not compete in Barcelona . Peters won his first Olympic medal when he rode with the US dressage team to a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , together with Robert Dover , Michelle Gibson and Guenter Seidel . Peters , riding Floriano , was an alternate for the US team at the 2004 Summer Olympics , and did not compete . In 2006 , with an aging Floriano , Peters and the US team won bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games . Soon after , he began riding TC Ravel , who would become his most successful horse . Despite being gelded while in quarantine after his shipment from the Netherlands and suffering an injury in 2007 that prevented training , Ravel carried Peters to a qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics . In individual dressage competition at the Games , Peters placed fourth , riding Ravel . The US team finished fourth at the 2008 Games , but was disqualified after team member Courtney King 's horse tested positive for <unk> , a banned substance . In 2009 , Peters and Ravel had the highest scores in all three portions of the prestigious German Aachen World Equestrian Festival Grand Prix competition , leading them to be the first American pair to be named the Aachen Grand Prix Champions . 
 Ravel and Peters went on to win the 2009 World Cup Final , two bronze medals in individual competition at the 2010 World Equestrian Games , and be twice named the US Grand Prix Dressage Champions . In 2009 , The Chronicle of the Horse named Peters and Ravel Horse and Horseman of the Year , and the United States Equestrian Federation ( USEF ) named Ravel as Horse of the Year . At the time , the Chronicle called him a " natural athlete with a balanced seat and an inherent understanding of the horse . He 's calm under pressure and has a reputation for having ice water in his veins . " In 2011 , riding <unk> 's Magic , he took gold in both the team and individual dressage events at the 2011 Pan Am Games . At the 2012 Summer Olympics he came 17th in the individual dressage and was part of the US team which came 6th , again riding Ravel . Peters retired Ravel from competition after the 2012 Olympic Games , after over 40 Grand Prix wins , and the same year the horse was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame . Peters ' new international competition horse is Legolas , currently the world 's top dressage horse , and a prospect for the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games , to be held in Normandy , France . 
 Peters is the first person to be awarded the USEF 's Equestrian of the Year Award three times , having won the honor in 2008 , 2009 and 2011 .

 Gardner Lake is a small lake which borders the towns of Salem , Montville and <unk> in Connecticut . Named after the Gardner family which owned a large portion of the surrounding land , the 528 @-@ acre ( 214 ha ) lake has been expanded in size with the construction of an earthen dam . Three state parks are located around Gardner Lake . Minnie Island State Park , the smallest state park , is a pine knoll . Hopemead State Park is a former campground that abuts the lake 's eastern shore . Gardner Lake State Park primarily serves as a boat launch and swimming area , but has been beset by problems with trash and vandalism since the area was improved in 2008 . Four campgrounds , a marina and dozens of private residences surround the lake . The lake is used for fishing and boating . 
 = = History = = 
 Gardner Lake is a natural lake and is named for the Gardner family which owned a large portion of the surrounding area , but the history of the lake itself is more identified as the site of " an extremely public miscalculation " . Thomas LeCount , a grocer from Niantic , Connecticut wanted to move his two @-@ story summer house from the south side of the lake to the east side of the lake , but believed that moving the house conventionally would be inefficient . LeCount raised up his fully furnished house and placed it on sleds and waited until February 1895 when the lake was frozen . After moving the house about 300 feet ( 91 m ) off the south shore , the house slid sideways into a snowbank . The ice cracked as LeCount attempted to pull the house back , before abandoning the work at nightfall . That night , the mill operators utilized some of the lake 's water for power and made a gap between the ice and surface of the water , causing the house to crack through the ice and pitch over . LeCount 's summer home remained in this position until the spring thaw where it came to rest in 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) of water with the second story and attic positioned above the water like a small lighthouse . For years , the house was the subject of children who fished off it in summer and ice skated through the house in the winter , but an enduring tale told by fishermen is that the house 's piano could be heard playing on quiet nights . By 2005 , the house was mostly rotted away . 
 Though Gardner Lake is a 528 @-@ acre ( 214 ha ) natural lake that has been increased in size by the construction of a 168 feet ( 51 m ) earthen dam . The dam raises the water level up 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) to an average depth of 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) . The area surrounding Gardner Lake has dozens of private homes , four campgrounds and a marina .

 Gardner Lake State Park is a small 9 @.@ 75 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 95 ha ) Connecticut state park located on the south portion of the lake and provides access for fishing , swimming , and boating on the lake . Added to the state park list in 2001 , it expected to be open around 2002 and serves as one of the few public inland swimming areas <unk> dog <unk> the New London County area . 
 In 2001 , the State of Connecticut paid $ 550 @,@ 000 to acquire the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park . The land was acquired from the estate of Carmine <unk> and returned a beach to public service that had been a private resort for 60 years . The Town of Salem had sought to acquire the land , but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state . In 2008 , the state spent about $ 1 million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles . In 2012 , the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits . Concerns included littering , unkempt toilets , swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011 . In response to the issues , patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers . The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group , Friends of Gardner Lake , and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours . 
 Gardner Lake State Park is located off Connecticut Route 354 and features accessible parking , chemical toilets and a paved boat launch area . This state park designated area is primarily to provide boating and recreational access to the lake , though there is also a small beach for visitors to use . As of 2014 , the park does not have a parking fee .

 Minnie Island State Park is a pine grown @-@ knoll that is located in the deepest portion of the lake . It is unmarked and undeveloped island that also is Connecticut 's smallest state park at 0 @.@ 88 acres . The island acquired its name when a local man declared it to be Minnie Island , because he took his wife , Minnie , to it for picnics . Joseph Leary , author of A Shared Landscape writes , " [ a ] s far back as anyone can remember , the island was a frequent landing place for boating parties and a great place for local children to explore . " The island was claimed by both the towns of Salem , Connecticut and Montville , Connecticut though it was not in the land records of either town . This went unnoticed until a man attempted to purchase the island , and then made attempted to establish claim to the island . The man introduced a bill to authorize the sale by the state to establish title to the island , but instead the Connecticut General Assembly drafted and passed a bill to turn the island into a park . 
 Minnie Island State Park offers opportunities for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat . Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity , which is redundant because the island is accessible by boat . The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded and it is difficult to find a spot to dock .

 Hopemead State Park is currently undeveloped 70 acre park on the eastern shore of the lake . The land was originally Solomon Gardner 's farm until it was purchased as a summer getaway by the Fuller family . The property was named Camp <unk> , an acronym from Fuller 's three daughters , and contained a house and an artist 's studio . Camp <unk> was used a boys camp for a number of years with permission by the Fuller family . It was later renamed Hopemead , literally " Hope Meadow " , by the Fuller daughters who believed it to be a sanctuary with spiritual overtones . In 1954 , the land was donated to the State of Connecticut to become a state park . The state found the land is unsuitable for development and demolished the dilapidated buildings , with the intention of letting Hopemead return to a natural state . Joseph Leary notes that the wildlife has thrived in the area , but notes that the cacophony of noises and calls is simply " divine " . The park offers opportunities for hiking and fishing .

 The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection , now the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection has been stocking the lake with walleye since 1993 . The walleye populations have been reported to be growing and they join the lake 's " excellent populations of bull head and catfish " . <unk> bass , largemouth bass , yellow perch are also found in the pond , but have been reported as " fair " reports and also good reports for trout . Local fishing tournaments also occur at Gardner Lake . As a result of the improvements to the boat launch area , boating and kayaking have increased greatly and police had to up the patrols at the lake . The area is patrolled by the Montville police and it costs the majority of annual budget , but the service was seen as beneficial to ensure the safety of boaters and enforcing the rules .

 = Group 3 element = 
 Group 3 is a group of elements in the periodic table . This group , like other d @-@ block groups , should contain four elements , but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group . Scandium ( Sc ) and yttrium ( Y ) are always included , but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum ( La ) and actinium ( Ac ) , or by lutetium ( Lu ) and lawrencium ( Lr ) ; less frequently , it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements ( with all the lanthanides and actinides included ) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium . The group itself has not acquired a trivial name ; however , scandium , yttrium and the lanthanides are sometimes called rare earth metals . 
 Three group 3 elements occur naturally , scandium , yttrium , and either lanthanum or lutetium . Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior , while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium . This is in accordance with the trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors . This trend is seen from hafnium , which is almost identical chemically to zirconium , to mercury , which is quite distant chemically from cadmium , but still shares with it almost equal atomic size and other similar properties . They all are silvery @-@ white metals under standard conditions . The fourth element , either actinium or lawrencium , has only radioactive isotopes . Actinium , which occurs only in trace amounts , continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration ; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium . So far , no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element . <unk> ( Ubu ) , which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium , might be synthesized in the near future , it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known , ununoctium . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1787 , Swedish part @-@ time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock near the Swedish village of Ytterby , Sweden ( part of the Stockholm Archipelago ) . Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten , he named it ytterbite . Finnish scientist Johan Gadolin identified a new oxide or " earth " in Arrhenius ' sample in 1789 , and published his completed analysis in 1794 ; in 1797 , the new oxide was named yttria . In the decades after French scientist Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements , it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements , meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within , which in this case would have been yttrium . Until the early 1920s , the chemical symbol " <unk> " was used for the element , after which " Y " came into common use . Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium ( III ) chloride with potassium to form metallic yttrium and potassium chloride . 
 In 1869 , Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his periodic table , which had empty spaces for elements directly above and under yttrium . Mendeleev made several predictions on the upper neighbor of yttrium , which he called eka @-@ boron . Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team discovered the missing element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite and prepared 2 grams of scandium ( III ) oxide of high purity . He named it scandium , from the Latin Scandia meaning " Scandinavia " . Chemical experiments on the element proved that Mendeleev 's suggestions were correct ; along with discovery and characterization of gallium and germanium this proved the correctness of the whole periodic table and periodic law . Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev 's prediction , but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev . Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture , at 700 – 800 ° C , of potassium , lithium , and scandium chlorides . 
 Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain , Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach , and American chemist Charles James as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia , which was thought by most chemists to consist entirely of ytterbium . Welsbach proposed the names cassiopeium for element 71 ( after the constellation Cassiopeia ) and aldebaranium ( after the star Aldebaran ) for the new name of ytterbium but these naming proposals were rejected , although many German scientists in the 1950s called the element 71 cassiopeium . Urbain chose the names neoytterbium ( Latin for " new ytterbium " ) for ytterbium and lutecium ( from Latin Lutetia , for Paris ) for the new element . The dispute on the priority of the discovery is documented in two articles in which Urbain and von Welsbach accuse each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other . The Commission on Atomic Mass , which was responsible for the attribution of the names for the new elements , settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones . An obvious problem with this decision was that Urbain was one of the four members of the commission . The separation of lutetium from ytterbium was first described by Urbain and the naming honor therefore went to him , but neoytterbium was eventually reverted to ytterbium and in 1949 , the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium . Ironically , Charles James , who had modestly stayed out of the argument as to priority , worked on a much larger scale than the others , and undoubtedly possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time . 
 Lawrencium was first synthesized by the Albert Ghiorso and his team on February 14 , 1961 , at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory ( now called the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ) at the University of California in Berkeley , California , United States . The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three @-@ milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron @-@ 10 and boron @-@ 11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator ( HILAC ) . The nuclide 257103 was originally reported , but then this was reassigned to 258103 . The team at the University of California suggested the name lawrencium ( after Ernest O. Lawrence , the inventor of cyclotron particle accelerator ) and the symbol " Lw " , for the new element , but " Lw " was not adopted , and " Lr " was officially accepted instead . Nuclear @-@ physics researchers in Dubna , Soviet Union ( now Russia ) , reported in 1967 that they were not able to confirm American scientists ' data on 257103 . Two years earlier , the Dubna team reported 256103 . In 1992 , the IUPAC Trans @-@ fermium Working Group officially recognized element 103 , confirmed its naming as lawrencium , with symbol " Lr " , and named the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co @-@ discoverers of lawrencium . 
 So far , no experiments were conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element ; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements , then the next element in the group should be element 153 , unpenttrium ( <unk> ) . However , after element 120 , filling electronic configurations stops obeying Aufbau principle . According to the principle , unpenttrium should have an electronic configuration of [ Uuo ] <unk> and filling the 5g @-@ subshell should be stopped at element 138 . However , the 7d @-@ orbitals are calculated to start being filled on element 137 , while the 5g @-@ subshell closes only at element 144 , after filling of 7d @-@ subshell begins . Therefore , it is hard to calculate which element should be the next group 3 element . Calculations suggest that <unk> ( Upp , element 155 ) could also be the next group 3 element . If lanthanum and actinium are considered group 3 elements , then element 121 , unbiunium ( Ubu ) , should be the fifth group 3 element . The element is calculated have electronic configuration of [ Uuo ] <unk> / 21 , which is not associated with transition metals , without having a partially filled d @-@ subshell . No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium , unbiunium or any element that could be considered the next group 3 element ; however , unbiunium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not been tried to be created and thus has chances to be , while unpenttrium , <unk> or any other element considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip instabilities that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at <unk> .

 Like other groups , the members of this family show patterns in their electron configurations , especially the outermost shells , resulting in trends in chemical behavior . However , lawrencium is an exception , since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1 / 2 subshell due to relativistic effects . 
 Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group ; chemical properties of both actinium and especially lawrencium are not well @-@ characterized . The remaining elements of the group ( scandium , yttrium , lutetium ) are reactive metals with high melting points ( 1541 ° C , 1526 ° C , 1652 ° C respectively ) . They are usually oxidized to the + 3 oxidation state , even through scandium , yttrium and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states . The reactivity of the elements , especially yttrium , is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer , which prevents further reactions . Scandium ( III ) oxide , yttrium ( III ) oxide , lanthanum ( III ) oxide and lutetium ( III ) oxide are white high @-@ temperature @-@ melting solids . Yttrium ( III ) oxide and lutetium ( III ) oxide exhibit weak basic character , but scandium ( III ) oxide is amphoteric . Lanthanum ( III ) oxide is strongly basic .

 Elements that show tripositive ions with electronic configuration of a noble gas ( scandium , yttrium , lanthanum , actinium ) show a clear trend in their physical properties , such as hardness . At the same time , if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium , several trends are broken . For example , scandium and yttrium are both soft metals . Lanthanum is soft as well ; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite far from the nucleus compared to the nuclei charges . Due to the lanthanide contraction , lutetium , the last in the lanthanide series , has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge , thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult , and thus making the metal harder . However , lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties , such as melting and boiling points . Very little is known about lawrencium , and none of its physical properties have been confirmed . 
 = = Group borders = = 
 It is disputed whether lutetium and lawrencium should be included in group 3 , rather than lanthanum and actinium . Other d @-@ block groups are composed of four transition metals , and group 3 is sometimes considered to follow suit . Scandium and yttrium are always classified as group 3 elements , but it is controversial which elements should follow them in group 3 , lanthanum and actinium or lutetium and lawrencium . Scerri has proposed a resolution to this debate on the basis of moving to a 32 @-@ column table and consideration of which option results in a continuous sequence of atomic number increase . He thereby finds that group 3 should consist of Sc , Y , Lu , Lr . The current IUPAC definition of the term " <unk> " includes fifteen elements including both lanthanum and lutetium , and that of " transition element " applies to lanthanum and actinium , as well as lutetium but not lawrencium , since it does not correctly follow the Aufbau principle . Normally , the 103rd electron would enter the d @-@ subshell , but quantum mechanical research has found that the configuration is actually [ Rn ] <unk> due to relativistic effects . IUPAC thus has not recommended a specific format for the in @-@ line @-@ f @-@ block periodic table , leaving the dispute open . 
 Lanthanum and actinium are sometimes considered the remaining members of group 3 . In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms , these elements do not possess any partially filled f @-@ orbitals , thus continuing the scandium — yttrium — lanthanum — actinium trend , in which all the elements have relationship similar to that of elements of the calcium — strontium — barium — radium series , the elements ' left neighbors in s @-@ block . However , different behavior is observed in other d @-@ block groups , especially in group 4 , in which zirconium , hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking a clear trend . 
 In other tables , lutetium and lawrencium are classified as the remaining members of group 3 . In these tables , lutetium and lawrencium end ( or sometimes succeed ) the lanthanide and actinide series , respectively . Since the f @-@ shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals , they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals compared to the other lanthanides and actinides , and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium . 
 Some tables , including the official IUPAC table refer to all lanthanides and actinides by a marker in group 3 . This sometimes is believed to be the inclusion of all 30 lanthanide and actinide elements as included in group 3 . <unk> , as electropositive trivalent metals , all have a closely related chemistry , and all show many similarities to scandium and yttrium , but they also show additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f @-@ orbitals which are not common to scandium and yttrium . 
 Exclusion of all elements is based on properties of earlier actinides , which show a much wider variety of chemistry ( for instance , in range of oxidation states ) within their series than the lanthanides , and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful . However , these elements are destabilized , and if they were stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws , they would be similar to lanthanides as well . Also , the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides , with only the valence + 3 ( and sometimes + 2 ) shown . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 Scandium , yttrium , and lutetium tend to occur together with other lanthanides ( except promethium ) tend to occur together in the Earth 's crust , and are often harder to extract from their ores . The abundance of elements in Earth 's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon , the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30 parts per million ( ppm ) ; the abundance of scandium is 16 ppm , while that of lutetium is about 0 @.@ 5 ppm . For comparison , the abundance of copper is 50 ppm , that of chromium is 160 ppm , and that of molybdenum is 1 @.@ 5 ppm . 
 Scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals . Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as gadolinite , euxenite , and thortveitite are the only known concentrated sources of this element , the latter containing up to 45 % of scandium in the form of scandium ( III ) oxide . Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places ; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well . 
 The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite , ( Ce , La , etc . ) PO4 , which contains 0 @.@ 003 % of the element . The main mining areas are China , United States , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka and Australia . Pure lutetium metal is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US $ 10 @,@ 000 / kg , or about one @-@ fourth that of gold . 
 = = Production = = 
 The most available element in group 3 is yttrium , with annual production of 8 @,@ 900 tonnes in 2010 . Yttrium is mostly produced as oxide , by a single country , China ( 99 % ) . Lutetium and scandium are also mostly obtained as oxides , and their annual production by 2001 was about 10 and 2 tonnes , respectively . 
 Group 3 elements are mined only as a byproduct from the extraction of other elements . The metallic elements are extremely rare ; the production of metallic yttrium is about a few tonnes , and that of scandium is in the order of 10 kg per year ; production of lutetium is not calculated , but it is certainly small . The elements , after purification from other rare earth metals , are isolated as oxides ; the oxides are converted to fluorides during reactions with hydrofluoric acid . The resulting fluorides are reduced with alkaline earth metals or alloys of the metals ; metallic calcium is used most frequently . For example : 
 Sc2O3 + 3 HF → 2 ScF3 + 3 H2O 
 2 ScF3 + 3 Ca → 3 CaF2 + 2 Sc

 Group 3 elements are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility , and have low availability to the biosphere . No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms . The radioactivity of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells , causing radiation poisoning . 
 Scandium has no biological role , but it is found in living organisms . Once reached a human , scandium concentrates in the liver and is a threat to it ; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic , even through in general scandium is not toxic . Scandium is known to have reached the food chain , but in trace amounts only ; a typical human takes in less than 0 @.@ 1 micrograms per day . Once released into the environment , scandium gradually accumulates in soils , which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles , animals and humans . Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment , due to the fact that damps and gases can be inhaled with air . This can cause lung embolisms , especially during long @-@ term exposure . The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals , causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system . 
 Yttrium has no known biological role , though it is found in most , if not all , organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver , kidney , spleen , lungs , and bones of humans . There is normally as little as 0 @.@ 5 milligrams found within the entire human body ; human breast milk contains 4 ppm . Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 ppm ( fresh weight ) , with cabbage having the largest amount . With up to 700 ppm , the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations . 
 Lutetium has no biological role as well , but it is found even in the highest known organism , the humans , concentrating in bones , and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys . Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature ; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides . Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content , so it is not known how much the average human takes in , but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year , all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants . Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic , but insoluble ones are not . 
 The high radioactivity of lawrencium would make it highly toxic to living cells , causing radiation poisoning .

 The Pike @-@ Pawnee Village Site , or Hill Farm Site , designated <unk> by archaeologists , is a site near the village of Guide Rock in Webster County , in the south central portion of the state of Nebraska , in the Great Plains region of the United States . It was the location of a village of the Kitkehahki band of the Pawnee people , in a region of the Republican River valley that they occupied intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s . 
 In 1806 , the village was visited by a Spanish expedition led by Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and , soon after , by an American expedition led by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike . At the village , Pike persuaded the Pawnee leaders to haul down a Spanish flag that they had received from Melgares , and to raise the flag of the United States in its stead . 
 The location of the village visited by Pike was not known for many years . In the early 20th century , two sites were proposed : this one in Nebraska , and one in Republic County in northern Kansas . A dispute between the historical societies of the two states ensued , titled " The War Between Nebraska and Kansas " . The dispute was eventually resolved in favor of the Nebraska site . 
 Investigations conducted at the site by William Duncan Strong , Waldo Wedel , and A. T. Hill were instrumental in the development of Great Plains archaeology , and of Pawnee archaeology in particular . 
 The site is a National Historic Landmark , and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places .

 The site lies on a terrace on the Republican River 's south side , near the village of Guide Rock . At the terrace 's north edge is a near @-@ vertical 25 – 30 @-@ foot ( 8 – 9 m ) bank ; the floodplain of the river extends about one @-@ fourth mile ( about one @-@ half kilometer ) from the bank 's base to the present channel . The remains of over 100 earth lodges lie on the terrace between the bank and hills to the south , which rise 125 feet ( 38 m ) above the site . On the hills are five cemeteries . The village complex also includes a council site and two open courts where a hoop game was played . 
 The village extended for at least 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) from east to west . On its east and west sides were creeks , now dry , that ran northward into the Republican . At the time of the village 's occupation , springs in the western creek flowed year @-@ round ; these would have provided a more convenient source of water than the river , since access to the latter was hampered by the steep bank . The springs ceased to flow at some time after the land came under cultivation in the 1870s . 
 Not far downstream from the site is a hill known to the Pawnees as Pa @-@ <unk> , or " hill that points the way " . In the traditional Pawnee religion , this was one of five lodges of the <unk> , spirit animals with supernatural healing powers .
