 Rickey dispatched scout Charley Barrett to investigate Bottomley . The Cardinals decided to invite Bottomley to a tryout in late 1919 , and signed him to a $ 150 @-@ a @-@ month ( $ 2 @,@ 047 in current dollar terms ) contract . Bottomley began his professional career in minor league baseball in 1920 . That year , Bottomley played for the Mitchell Kernels of the Class @-@ D South Dakota League , posting a .312 batting average in 97 games , as Barrett continued to scout him . He also played six games for the Sioux City Packers of the Class @-@ A Western League . During his time in the minor leagues , the media began to call Bottomley " Sunny Jim " , due to his pleasant disposition . 
 The next season , Bottomley played for the Houston Buffaloes of the Class @-@ A Texas League . Bottomley suffered a leg injury early in the season which became infected , and impeded his performance during the season . Bottomley managed only a .227 batting average in 130 games and struggled with his fielding . Unable to sell Bottomley to Houston for $ 1 @,@ 200 after the season ( $ 15 @,@ 920 in current dollar terms ) , Rickey sold Bottomley to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class @-@ AA International League for $ 1 @,@ 000 ( $ 13 @,@ 267 in current dollar terms ) . Fully recovered from his leg injury in 1922 , Bottomley batted .348 with 14 home runs , 15 triples , and a .567 slugging percentage for the Chiefs . After the season , the Cardinals purchased Bottomley from the Chiefs for $ 15 @,@ 000 ( $ 212 @,@ 058 in current dollar terms ) . 
 Bottomley made his Major League Baseball debut for the St. Louis Cardinals on August 18 , 1922 . Replacing Jack Fournier , Bottomley batted .325 in 37 games . The Cardinals named Bottomley their starting first baseman in 1923 . As a rookie , Bottomley batted .371 , finishing second in the National League ( NL ) behind teammate Rogers Hornsby , who batted .384 . His .425 on @-@ base percentage also finished second in the NL behind Hornsby , while he finished sixth in slugging percentage , with a <unk> mark . His 94 runs batted in ( RBIs ) were tenth @-@ best in the league . 
 Bottomley posted a .316 batting average in 1924 . In a game against the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 16 , 1924 , Bottomley set the major league record for RBIs in a single game , with 12 , breaking Wilbert Robinson 's record of 11 , set in 1892 . Robinson was serving as the manager of the Dodgers at the time . This mark has since been tied by Mark <unk> in 1993 . Finishing the season with 111 RBIs , placing third in the NL , Bottomley 's 14 home runs were seventh @-@ best in the NL , while his .500 slugging percentage was good for tenth .

Bottomley hit .325 with 31 home runs and 136 RBIs in 1928 , leading the league in home runs and RBIs . He also became the second Major League player in history to join the 20 – 20 – 20 club . That year , he won the League Award , given to the most valuable player of the NL . The Cardinals reached the 1928 World Series , and Bottomley batted .214 as they lost to the New York Yankees . 
 In 1929 , Bottomley hit 29 home runs , finishing seventh in the NL , while his 137 RBIs were fifth @-@ best , and his <unk> slugging percentage placed him in eighth . After having what manager Gabby Street considered a " poor year " in 1930 , Bottomley struggled in the 1930 World Series , batting <unk> in 22 at @-@ bats , as the Cardinals lost to the Philadelphia Athletics . Following the series , Bottomley described his World Series performance as " a bust as far as hitting goes " . 
 Amid questions about Bottomley 's status with the Cardinals heading into the 1931 season , he demonstrated renewed hitting ability during spring training . Despite the presence of Ripper Collins , a superior fielder who transferred to the Cardinals from the Rochester Red Wings of the International League , Street announced that Bottomley would remain the starting first baseman . However , Bottomley suffered an injury and struggled early in the 1931 season after returning to the game , and it appeared that he might lose his job to Collins , who filled in for Bottomley during his injury . Bottomley returned to form after his return , and he finished the season with a <unk> batting average , placing third behind teammate Chick Hafey 's <unk> and Bill Terry 's <unk> , the closest batting average finish in MLB history . His <unk> slugging percentage was the sixth best in the league . The Cardinals reached the 1931 World Series , with Bottomley batting .160 , as the Cardinals defeated the Athletics . That offseason , other teams began to attempt to trade for either Bottomley or Collins . Bottomley batted .296 in 1932 , though he only played in 91 games . 
 = = = Cincinnati Reds = = = 
 After the 1932 season , the Cardinals traded Bottomley to the Cincinnati Reds for <unk> Carroll and Estel Crabtree , in an attempt to partner Bottomley with Chick Hafey in developing a more potent offensive attack . Bottomley had also sought Cincinnati 's managerial position that offseason , which instead went to <unk> Bush . 
 Bottomley threatened to quit baseball in a salary dispute with the Reds , as he attempted to negotiate a raise from his $ 8 @,@ 000 salary ( $ 146 @,@ 242 in current dollar terms ) , a reduction from the $ 13 @,@ 000 salary ( $ 225 @,@ 471 in current dollar terms ) he earned with the Cardinals the previous year . He and the Reds eventually came to terms on a one @-@ year contract believed to be worth between $ 10 @,@ 000 and $ 13 @,@ 000 . Bottomley finished eighth in the NL with 83 RBIs in 1933 , and ninth with 13 home runs . In three seasons with the Reds , Bottomley failed to hit higher than .283 or record more than 83 RBIs in a season . Bottomley left the Reds during spring training in 1935 due to a salary dispute , deciding to return to the team in April . 
 = = = St. Louis Browns = = = 
 Before the 1936 season , the Reds traded Bottomley to the St. Louis Browns of the American League ( AL ) , who were managed by Hornsby , for Johnny Burnett . During a July road trip , Bottomley announced his retirement as a result of an injured back ; however , he changed his mind and decided to remain with the team . Bottomley batted .298 for the 1936 season . 
 Bottomley decided to return to baseball in 1937 . When the Browns struggled during the 1937 season , beginning the season with a 25 – 52 win @-@ loss record , the Browns fired Hornsby and named Bottomley their player @-@ manager . Bottomley led the Browns to 21 more victories , as the team finished the season in eighth place , with a 46 – 108 record . The Browns trailed the seventh place Athletics by 9 1 ⁄ 2 games , and were 56 games out of first place . As a player , Bottomley batted .239 in 65 games during the 1937 season . Bottomley was among the ten oldest players in the AL that year . 
 The Browns did not retain Bottomley after the 1937 season , replacing him with Street , who served as his first assistant during the 1937 season . In 1938 , Bottomley served as the player @-@ manager of Syracuse . After a bad start to the season , and with team president Jack Corbett not adding capable players , Bottomley resigned and was replaced with Dick Porter . Bottomley also indicated that he did not want to continue playing . 
 Bottomley also holds the single @-@ season record for most unassisted double plays by a first baseman , with eight . Bottomley is also known as the only man to be sued for hitting a home run when a fan was hit by the ball when he was not looking . He had over 100 RBIs in each season from 1924 to 1929 . Bottomley was the second player in baseball history to hit 20 or more doubles , triples , and home runs in one season ( Frank Schulte being the first ) and the first of two players ( Lou Gehrig being the other ) to collect 150 or more doubles , triples , and home runs in a career .

 Bottomley married Elizabeth " Betty " Browner , who operated a St. Louis beauty parlor , on February 4 , 1933 . The couple had no children . After he retired from baseball in 1938 , Bottomley and his wife moved to the Bourbon , Missouri , area , where he raised Hereford cattle . In 1939 , Bottomley became a radio broadcaster , signing a deal with <unk> , an AM broadcasting station , to broadcast Cardinals and Browns games . 
 Bottomley returned to baseball as a scout for the Cardinals in 1955 . In 1957 , he joined the Chicago Cubs as a scout and managed the Pulaski Cubs of the Class D Appalachian League . While managing in Pulaski , Bottomley suffered a heart attack . The <unk> moved to nearby Sullivan , Missouri . Bottomley died of a heart ailment in December 1959 . He and his wife Betty were interred in the International Order of Fellows Cemetery , Sullivan , Missouri .

 Bottomley was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame posthumously in 1974 by the Veterans Committee . The Baseball Writers ' Association of America charged that the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members . Charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee . When Bottomley was elected , the Veterans Committee included Frankie Frisch , a teammate of Bottomley 's with the Cardinals . Frisch and Bill Terry , also a member of the Veterans Committee at the time , shepherded the selections of teammates Jesse Haines in 1970 , Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971 , Ross Youngs in 1972 , George Kelly in 1973 , and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976 . This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years . In 2014 , the Cardinals announced Bottomley among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014 . 
 The city park in Sullivan is named for Bottomley . A museum in Nokomis , Illinois , the Bottomley @-@ Ruffing @-@ Schalk Baseball Museum , is dedicated to Bottomley and fellow Hall of Famers Ray Schalk and Red Ruffing , who were also Nokomis natives . 
 = HMS Vigilant ( 1777 ) = 
 HMS Vigilant was a merchantman converted into a warship during the American Revolution . After serving as a transport in North American waters from 1775 , she was purchased by the Royal Navy ( RN ) and modified for shore bombardment duties in 1777 . She was instrumental in the eventual British success during the siege of Fort Mifflin that same year and supported British operations in Georgia and South Carolina in 1779 – 80 . Her heavy armament proved to be more than Vigilant was designed to handle and she was condemned and disposed of in 1780 . 
 = = Description and service = = 
 Built at Whitby in 1774 , the ship was named the Grand Duchess of Russia and she was chartered by the Navy Board to serve as a transport at the beginning of 1775 . While being modified at Deptford Dockyard in February , the ship was surveyed and found to be barque @-@ rigged and just over 308 tons burthen in size . A survey in New York two years later gave her length as 120 ft ( 36 @.@ 6 m ) , measured at the keel , with a beam of 36 ft ( 11 @.@ 0 m ) . Naval historian Rif Winfield quotes her tonnage as 684 14 ⁄ 94 burthen with a length at the gundeck of 122 feet 6 inches ( 37 @.@ 3 m ) and beam of 34 ft 10 in ( 10 @.@ 6 m ) . 
 Grand Duchess of Russia departed for Boston , Massachusetts carrying 150 marines on 30 March 1775 and she remained in North American waters for the next two years . Vice Admiral Lord Howe , commander of the North American Station , informed the Admiralty on 23 April that he had purchased the Grand Duchess of Russia and commissioned her as HMS Vigilant to bombard targets ashore . The ship received fourteen 24 @-@ pounder guns from the 50 @-@ gun ship Centurion and two 9 @-@ pounder and four 6 @-@ pounder guns from the hospital ( prison ) ship Jersey . Additional gun ports were cut in Vigilant 's side to allow two guns to be switched from one side to give her a broadside of nine guns . The 150 men of her crew were made up from the crews of Howe 's flagship , the third rate Eagle , Centurion , and the fourth rate Preston while her 30 marines were drawn from the marine brigade at Halifax . 
 Her conversion was completed by the end of June and her first task was to cover the evacuation of British troops from Perth Amboy , New Jersey on 29 July . The following month , Vigilant served as Howe 's flagship when he landed British troops at Elkton , Maryland , at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay , during the Philadelphia Campaign . In October , the ship sailed for the mouth of the Delaware River to attack the American fortifications defending Philadelphia . During this voyage , she rolled so badly during heavy weather that the round shot fell out of her guns and it was later decided that she should not put to sea with her guns mounted except during the summer months . Vigilant was not designed to carry such heavy weights as the 2 @,@ 200 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 000 kg ) 24 pounders up high in the ship and cutting gun ports in her sides further weakened her structure . 
 The first attack on Fort Mifflin on 22 – 23 October had been a disaster with two British ships run aground and burnt . For the second attack three weeks later , Vigilant 's crew was reinforced with an extra 50 men to work the guns and 24 riflemen to suppress the defenders of the fort during the attack . The ship 's sides were reinforced and two guns were transferred to the starboard side of the ship . Her trim was maintained by placing casks of water on the port side . While other ships bombarded the fort from the main channel , Vigilant and a smaller ship worked their way up a secondary channel to the rear of the fort . They were able to silence the fort 's guns by 6 p.m. , and the Americans evacuated five hours later , despite the ship 's grapeshot and small arms fire . During the attack Vigilant only lost three men killed and five wounded ; her hull had only been hit several times , but her rigging was shot to pieces . In recognition of the ship 's success , her commander , Lieutenant John Henry , was promoted to the command of the frigate Fowey . 
 Vigilant was generally inactive while the British occupied Philadelphia , but she sailed to New York City when the British evacuated the city in June 1778 . She joined the small British squadron there upon the approach of a French squadron under the command of the Comte d 'Estaing in July , but the French declined to engage the British ships . The ship accompanied the British squadron to Newport , Rhode Island as it attempted to lift the Franco @-@ American siege , but Vigilant was badly damaged when a storm interrupted the planned battle on 13 August . Despite the damage , she supported British troops on 29 – 30 August as they pursued the retreating Americans who had abandoned the siege after the French ships sailed to Boston for repairs . A few days later , on 4 September , the ship collided with the sloop @-@ of @-@ war Raven during the British raid on New London , Connecticut and had her bow stove in by the other ship . Vigilant was quickly repaired in New York and participated in the attack on Little Egg Harbor River in October . 
 At the beginning of December , the ship sailed from New York to Savannah , Georgia to assist in the attack on that city . Despite dismounting her main armament , the ship had to keep one or more pumps running continuously during the voyage to prevent her from sinking . She arrived at Savannah on 28 December , after the British had secured the city . Her nine @-@ pounder guns were ordered removed when she was reclassified as a 20 @-@ gun armed transport on 22 December . Throughout 1779 , Vigilant supported British operations along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina , despite running aground several times . Lacking substantial repairs during this time , the ship 's condition deteriorated until her crew refused to take her to sea from Beaufort , South Carolina on 28 February 1780 to support the planned siege of Charleston . She was then surveyed and condemned as " utterly unfit for sea " and decommissioned on 9 April . Her crew and armament were loaded aboard the transport Margaret & Martha and taken to Charleston where they were transferred to the transport Margery , which had been purchased and renamed Sandwich to serve as Vigilant 's replacement . The ship was burnt at Beaufort sometime later that year . 
 = David Falk = 
 David B. Falk ( born 1950 ) is an American sports agent who primarily works with basketball players in the National Basketball Association . Falk began his career representing professional tennis players for Donald Dell 's ProServ and is best known for representing sports icon Michael Jordan for the entirety of Jordan 's career . Besides Jordan , Falk has represented more than 100 other NBA players , and is generally considered to be the most influential player agent the NBA has seen . During the peak years of Falk 's career in the 1990s , he was often considered the second @-@ most powerful person in the NBA behind Commissioner David Stern , and in 2000 he had at least one client on all but two NBA teams . He was listed among the " 100 Most Powerful People in Sports " for 12 straight years from 1990 to 2001 by The Sporting News , and was also named one of the Top 50 Marketers in the United States by Advertising Age in 1995 . 
 Falk negotiated the then @-@ highest contracts in NBA history for Patrick Ewing and Danny Ferry . He also negotiated professional sports ' first $ 100 million contract for Alonzo Mourning as part of an unprecedented free agency period , during which his company , FAME , changed the entire salary structure of the NBA , negotiating more than $ 400 million in contracts for its free agent clients in a six @-@ day period . 
 In January 2007 , Falk re @-@ launched FAME , and today serves as its founder and CEO . He represented 9 players in 2012 ; in the prime of his sports agent career in the 1990s he represented as many as 40 players at a time . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Falk was born to a middle @-@ class Jewish family on Long Island , New York , the second of three children . Falk 's father had never finished high school and owned two butcher shops on Long Island , while his mother , Pearl Falk , had two master 's degrees , spoke six languages , and had worked as an interpreter in World War II for Nelson Rockefeller in Latin American affairs . Falk described his mother , a teacher and inspirational force as " a perfectionist " , and called her " the biggest influence in my life " , the one who drove him to achieve great heights . 
 " Nothing was really ever good enough . I brought home my college board scores — I think I got just under 1 @,@ 400 the first time . She was crushed . She didn 't understand how I could do so poorly . I think that I share a lot of those qualities . She used to have an expression that I would say is the guiding principle of my life : Always shoot for the stars and never settle for second best . " 
 Falk 's mother was an avid New York Knicks fan , a fact which influenced Falk 's career decision upon his career path . Longtime childhood friend and colleague , Attorney Reid Kahn , remembers Falk proclaiming that he wanted to represent professional athletes in the fourth grade . Another high school friend noted that Falk was not good enough to make any of the teams at Douglas MacArthur High School ( Levittown , New York ) , but that he was an ardent sports fan who frequently watched baseball games at Shea Stadium . 
 He graduated Syracuse University in 1972 , with a degree in economics , and subsequently , George Washington University Law School , where he earned a J.D. with honors in 1975 . 
 During his law school years , his parents separated . Falk maintained minimal contact with his father , but remained very close with his mother until her death in 1988 . 
 Falk lives in Rockville , Maryland with his wife , Rhonda ( Frank ) . Rhonda served as an undergraduate admissions counselor for George Washington University for five years , where she recruited students from the New England area as well as from the Caribbean . For 10 years she worked as a production manager for <unk> , a software company in Rockville , Maryland . She later moved into the software publishing division and managed the distribution and sales of software through international resellers around the world . She also serves on the board of directors of Woodmont Country Club .

 After many attempts to establish contact with agents Bob Woolf of Boston and Larry Fleisher , Falk turned to ProServ 's Donald Dell in 1974 . Falk attempted to get Dell on the phone for " six or seven weeks . " Finally , annoyed at Dell 's seeming unavailability , Falk called Dell 's office " about 17 times in a three @-@ hour period " until Dell took his call . When Dell informed him that ProServ was not hiring , Falk offered to work for free . Dell consented to take on Falk as an unpaid intern while he was attending law school , finally offering him a full @-@ time job starting at $ 13 @,@ 000 after his graduation from George Washington University Law School in 1975 . 
 Dell was a former pro tennis player and primarily represented tennis players , so he allowed Falk to handle a large portion of ProServ 's NBA dealings . Falk proved to be a capable agent and negotiator , as he signed the # 1 NBA Draft picks in 1976 ( John Lucas ) and 1981 ( Mark Aguirre ) , and negotiated the first million @-@ dollar NBA shoe deal for James Worthy in 1982 . 
 ProServ had an inside track with North Carolina after they successfully represented a number of N.C. basketball alumni , including Tom <unk> , Phil Ford , Dudley Bradley , and James Worthy . In 1984 , the same year Michael Jordan entered the NBA Draft , Frank <unk> and Lee Fentress , two of Dell 's ProServ partners , left to start a competing firm , Advantage International . Dell and Falk signed # 3 pick Jordan , while <unk> and Fentress signed Sam Perkins . 
 = = = Nike shoe deal : " Air Jordan " = = = 
 After signing Jordan , Falk quickly made the first great deal for him : the Nike shoe deal . At the start of the 80s , only Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar had a six @-@ figure shoe deal for $ 100 @,@ 000 ( with Adidas ) , and Nike was a small player next to companies like Converse , which had virtually owned the market on basketball shoes through the 1970s . After James Worthy signed an 8 @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 2 million endorsement deal with New Balance in 1982 , also negotiated by Falk , Falk decided to make large demands to shoe companies for Jordan 's services , including his own shoe line and a royalty . 
 " We decided to stretch the envelope " , Falk said . " Instead of calling up the companies and asking them how much they would pay Michael Jordan , we called them up and asked them to make a presentation and explain what they could do to promote him . Needless to say , this got a lot of quizzical replies . " 
 Unbeknownst to Falk and Jordan , Nike had decided to target Jordan as their player of the future . Jordan himself was initially reticent ; throughout college he had worn Converse because of the company 's endorsement deal with Tar Heels coach Dean Smith , and off the court , he wore Adidas . Jordan had never worn or even seen a Nike shoe before the company contacted him . 
 Nike 's initial offer was $ 250 @,@ 000 , his own shoe line , and a percentage of the revenues . Jordan already had a standing offer from Adidas for $ 500 @,@ 000 , and Falk demanded that Nike match the figure in addition to the revenue percentage . Nike came back with an offer of $ 500 @,@ 000 and a smaller cut . Falk agreed . 
 " David Falk elected to take more guaranteed money and less revenue percentage " , said ( Nike Scout ) Sonny Vaccaro . " So out of the chute he lost himself a lot of money . But in retrospect , it really amounted to nothing . It wasn 't a big @-@ time bidding war . Probably the most determining thing was Adidas wasn 't going to offer him a lot of money . It was the first time that the athlete was going to share in the royalties of the shoe . That was the gamble . " 
 The deal was all the more significant because it was considered difficult to market African @-@ American players in 1984 , especially in a team sport like basketball . In fact , Nike insisted on several " outs " in its initial contract with Jordan : the shoe line could be dropped if certain sales figures were not met , or if Jordan failed to make the NBA All @-@ Star Game in his first three years . The shoe line was expected to earn $ 3 million for Nike in about three to four years . As it turned out , the Air Jordan sneaker earned Nike $ 130 million in 1985 alone , making their $ 500 @,@ 000 contract with Jordan one of the great bargains of all time , a precursor to Jordan 's more lucrative deals with Nike , including a 1997 deal for $ 30 million . Jordan 's relationship with Nike is often considered the most successful sports endorsement relationship in history . 
 = = = Marketing Michael Jordan = = = 
 Falk soon proved himself to be a capable agent with many innovative marketing ideas . He allowed Nike to establish Jordan 's primary image , then began splitting it up among other advertisers , including Coca @-@ Cola , Chevrolet , Gatorade , McDonald 's , Ball Park Franks , Wilson Sporting Goods , <unk> , Wheaties , Hanes , and MCI . Falk 's ideas stretched to all areas of the marketplace , including a fragrance ( called simply " Michael Jordan " ) made by the Beverly Hills designer <unk> , which was cited as the best @-@ marketed product of 1996 by the American Marketing Association . Falk even came up with the idea of teaming Bugs Bunny and Jordan together in a feature film , and then sold the concept to Warner Bros. in 1993 . The ensuing film , Space Jam , was executive produced by Falk and released in 1996 . Perhaps most importantly , Falk " set a precedent by ' opting out ' Jordan from the league 's licensing program , in effect reclaiming Jordan 's image for his own use . " Jordan himself was very grateful for his agent 's remarkable negotiating and marketing abilities , even with Falk 's penchant for making powerful enemies along the way . 
 " A lot of people don 't like David , but he 's the best at what he does " , Jordan told USA Today last year . " What he does is get underneath your skin , whoever he 's negotiating with , because he figures out what your objectives are , your angles . He understands the market ; he understands the players . He 's a brash , arrogant , egotistical , aggressive negotiator , which is good , because when you have someone represent you , you want him to do that . Marketing @-@ wise , he 's great . He 's the one who came up with the concept of ' Air Jordan . ' " 
 Due partly to Falk 's tenacity and partly to Michael Jordan 's own professional success and personal magnetism , Jordan became " indisputably the most powerful and effective endorser of products in American history , ... ( making ) the business of hawking products more lucrative than playing the game . " Jordan 's success was such that he turned down $ 300 million worth of endorsement deals in the space of 4 months in 1998 . 
 = = = ProServ split , establishment and sale of FAME = = = 
 In 1992 , after great early success , Falk considered himself underpaid and underappreciated . He split with ProServ and Donald Dell to establish his own company , Falk Associates Management Enterprises ( FAME ) . 
 " I paid more in taxes this year ( 1996 ) than I earned in 17 years working for Donald Dell " , Falk said with some lingering bitterness . " I 'm all for loyalty , but that has to be a two @-@ way street . " 
 In the split , a messy professional divorce , Falk brought all of his considerable client list with him , but agreed to provide Dell with 50 % of fees for Dell 's former clients and 17 @.@ 5 % of Falk 's income for new contracts . Dell " sought arbitration to enforce the agreement , claiming that Falk ' unilaterally ' had rewritten clients ' third @-@ party contracts to reduce fees to Dell . " 
 Falk and partners Curtis Polk and Mike Higgins soon propelled FAME to the top of the NBA player representation business . At its peak , the company consisted of about 25 people and represented 45 players . During FAME 's 7 @-@ year existence , it represented " an unprecedented 6 first @-@ round draft picks in the NBA , negotiated over $ 400 million in contracts for its free @-@ agent clients , and negotiated four of the five largest contracts in team sports history . " Just prior to the company 's sale in 1998 , the contracts of Falk 's players totaled almost $ 800 million . 
 In 1998 , Falk sold FAME to the entertainment group SFX for $ 100 million , while remaining the group 's president . In the space of a year , SFX bought 14 private sports representation companies for a combined $ 1 @.@ 5 billion and consolidated them into SFX Sports Group in 1999 , naming Falk as Chairman . Ironically , one of the companies SFX acquired was ProServ , and Falk found himself in charge of the company that he had left on such bitter terms . 
 During his Chairmanship at SFX Sports Group from 1999 to 2001 , " Falk oversaw the acquisition of a dozen sports agencies that enabled SFX to represent approximately 20 percent of MLB and NBA players . " Largely due to the work of Falk and fellow agent Arn Tellem , the umbrella SFX Sports Group represented 78 NBA players in contract negotiations in 2000 , and came to represent approximately one @-@ third of NBA players in 2002 .

 = = = 1995 NBA lockout = = = 
 Falk was one of the key figures in the 1995 NBA lockout . The lockout originally occurred when the players wanted a soft salary cap , while the owners wanted a hard salary cap . Falk led a rebellion on the National Basketball Players Association ( NBPA ) by establishing a dissident faction of 16 players and a number of agents ( including players Michael Jordan , Patrick Ewing , Alonzo Mourning , Reggie Miller , and fellow agents Marc Fleisher and Arn Tellem ) that began advocating for NBPA decertification . The goal was to strip NBA management of antitrust protection , making the salary cap and other forms of collective bargaining violations of antitrust laws , win a settlement in court , and then immediately re @-@ form the Players ' Union . NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Falk 's involvement in the negotiations , saying that he was " trashing his own clients . " Kenny <unk> , the Charlotte Hornets ' player representative , went so far as to blame the entire lockout on Falk . 
 " I think this whole thing has been manufactured by David Falk " , <unk> told The Charlotte Observer Friday night . " The guys he used to initiate the decertification drive aren 't concerned with the union and the everyday little guy . These guys have been in the league 10 or 11 years and have yet to voice an opinion about what 's going on . Then all of a sudden David Falk doesn 't like what 's going on . " 
 Despite considerable support , decertification was defeated by a vote of the Players ' Union , 226 – 134 . But even though Falk did not manage to decertify the NBPA , his influence helped to lead to the <unk> of a luxury tax on salaries , and ultimately led to a deal that increased the players ' portion of NBA revenues from 52 % to 57 % , as well as the salary structure that saw Michael Jordan make $ 33 million for the 1998 season alone . Some argued that the concessions Falk gained from the owners through his role in the 1995 lockout were the primary cause of another lockout that occurred just three seasons later .

 During the 1998 – 99 lockout , Falk was often described as the " invisible hand " that guided union negotiations . The NBPA President during the lockout , Patrick Ewing , was a client of Falk 's . Falk was also the agent of " nearly half " of the union 's 19 @-@ member negotiating committee , including Alonzo Mourning , Juwan Howard , and Dikembe Mutombo . Though his presence in negotiations was already assumed , Falk publicly stated in an October 31 , 1998 New York Times article that he would " roll up his sleeves and exert as much influence as he ( could ) behind the scenes , ... ( planning ) to take a more proactive role in ending the lockout . " 
 Shortly after his statements in the Times article , Falk and Arn Tellem , who together represented more than 70 of the NBA 's 400 players , organized a charity exhibition game , with part of the proceeds going to financially pinched NBA players . The rosters had a number of Falk clients , and some saw the game as a threat by Falk " to create a new league through a partnership with the entertainment giant SFX , which [ had ] recently purchased Falk 's company for $ 150 million . " The game was played on December 19 , 1998 in the Atlantic City Convention Center , featuring 16 All @-@ Stars and drawing a crowd of about 6 @,@ 000 people . Falk and the other organizers had originally planned to give 90 % of the proceeds to NBA players , but public criticism caused them to instead give almost all of the $ 1 million to national and local charities . 
 Meanwhile , Falk was being criticized on multiple fronts for his role in lockout negotiations . NBA Commissioner David Stern accused Falk and Arn Tellem specifically of " holding the deal hostage " to reap benefits for their high @-@ end clients . Fellow player agent Harold MacDonald disparaged what he saw as Falk 's excessive influence on the union 's president , Patrick Ewing : 
 " Every time I see Patrick say something , it 's almost like watching the Energizer bunny " , said the agent Harold MacDonald , who represents Derrick Coleman and Terry Mills . " I 'm just waiting for Falk to put in another battery , and off Patrick goes again . Hardly any influence ? Give me a break . " 
 Isiah Thomas , who was President of the Players ' Union from 1988 to 1994 , blasted Falk by saying that " he 's been trying to take over the union for years , " and many saw Falk as the controlling influence in the union 's negotiations . Falk 's involvement in the 1998 lockout also led to Mike Lupica famously dubbing Falk " Rasputin off the bench " in a New York Daily News article , " the rare person who could make a writer root for a sports owner . " The lockout finally ended just 29 hours before the cancellation of the entire NBA season after the players overwhelmingly ratified the latest deal put forward , 179 @-@ 5 .

 Falk 's client list , with Michael Jordan its centerpiece , made him one of the primary movers and shakers in the NBA , able to leverage teams into agreeing to his terms on contracts and trades . Some speculated that Falk engineered as many as one of every five NBA trades during the height of his power , and he was often considered the second @-@ most powerful man in basketball behind NBA Commissioner David Stern . In The Sporting News ' list of the " 100 Most Powerful People in Sports " , Falk was listed no lower than # 32 for 10 straight years from 1991 to 2000 , peaking at # 14 from 1998 to 1999 . 
 " Falk has massive leverage " , says the general manager of one N.B.A. team who didn 't want his name used for fear of angering Falk . " If he just had Michael , he would be considered a marketing genius , which he is . But David represents so many players that he is a major force . He pretty much gets what he asks for . " 
 A 1999 deal in which Falk forced the Minnesota Timberwolves to trade Stephon Marbury gives a good indication of how Falk used his power . Falk threatened the Timberwolves by telling them that Marbury would walk away in free agency at the end of the season if he was not traded , as well as suggesting that he would dump his stable of free agents into the lap of Chicago Bulls GM Jerry Krause if Marbury was not moved . As the Minnesota Timberwolves started looking around for possible trade scenarios , Falk even went so far as to veto a trade that would have brought Kerry Kittles ( another Falk client ) to Minnesota for Marbury , claiming that Kittles had no interest in playing for Minnesota . The Timberwolves were eventually forced to send Marbury to New Jersey in a three @-@ team trade . Minnesota 's General Manager , Kevin McHale , was greatly embittered about the trade , and has been quoted as saying that " If a nuclear bomb dropped on earth , two things would survive : roaches and David Falk . " 
 A second trade which resulted from Falk 's influence was the 2000 mega @-@ deal which moved Knicks All @-@ Star center Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics in a four @-@ team trade involving 12 players and 5 draft picks . Falk apparently made threats to the Knicks that he would move Glen Rice to the Miami Heat if they did not consent to trade Ewing , who supposedly wanted out of New York . 
 Falk was frequently blasted for making use of threats and side @-@ deals to move his clients around and maximize their earnings , but he remained unapologetic , arguing that he was simply looking after the best interests of his clients . 
 " That 's called leverage " , he said . " Every company in the world uses leverage whenever they engage in any negotiation . It 's bad for the teams and good for the players . I work for the players . " 
 = = = Building wealth for clients and himself = = = 
 As early as 1992 , even before his departure from ProServ , other NBA agents had begun acknowledging that Falk generally negotiated the contracts that defined the market for the year , and set the standard by which other agents were judged . By the end of the 1995 NBA lockout , Falk controlled enough top players that he was seen as " <unk> ( ing ) the structure and the economics of the entire league , " so much so that during one six @-@ day period in the summer of 1996 , he negotiated six contracts — for Jordan , Alonzo Mourning , Juwan Howard , Kenny Anderson , Dikembe Mutombo and Lee Mayberry — worth more than $ 335 million . Since Falk usually earned 4 % of player contracts , which is the maximum amount allowed by the Players ' Union , he made roughly $ 13 million for these 6 deals alone . He was so successful at negotiating contracts that in 1998 , just before he sold FAME to SFX Entertainment , the contracts of Falk 's players totaled just under $ 800 million . 
 Falk also earned as much as 20 % of player endorsement deals and off @-@ court income , and with Michael Jordan 's endorsement deals alone soaring to over $ 40 million annually in the mid @-@ 90s , Falk counted his yearly income in the tens of millions . He also negotiated notable shoe endorsements for James Worthy , Boomer Esiason ( the first NFL player to endorse the Reebok Pump ) and Allen Iverson . Falk was not well @-@ liked around the league , with even NBA executives acknowledging that they felt he held a disproportionate amount of power . As the negotiator behind four of the five largest contracts in team sports history and the pre @-@ eminent agent in the NBA , Falk was a contributor to the spike in player salaries that saw the average NBA contract rise from $ 330 @,@ 000 in 1984 , the year Jordan was signed , to $ 4 @.@ 5 million in 2001 , when he stepped down as Chairman of SFX Sports Group . Falk himself scoffed at the venom that was frequently directed his way : 
 " There 's always something to criticize -- I have too much power or too many clients . I scoff at that . Think about it : If you lived on a block with $ 300 @,@ 000 houses and you sold yours for $ 2 @.@ 5 million , your neighbors would thank you . But in my business they don 't . That used to make me angry . Now I 'm just amused . " 
 = = = Professional legacy = = = 
 Falk 's enduring legacy can best be described as the NBA 's new star @-@ centered focus . Falk 's idea was that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan , Jordan himself should get a large proportion of the benefit . 
 " Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport " , Falk is saying . " Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves . In that environment , a Michael Jordan , Alonzo Mourning , Juwan Howard , Shaquille O 'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans . Fans come to watch them play primarily . They create marketing opportunities , new stadiums , luxury boxes , and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money . The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood , where Jim Carrey makes $ 16 million a film and the second star makes $ 2 million . That 's what I believe as an economics major and as a neo @-@ capitalist . " 
 As David Halberstam put it in his book Playing for Keeps : Michael Jordan and the World He Made , 
 Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other , and each profited to a remarkable degree from their special collaboration . It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds , went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again , but it is also true that David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player , going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar .

 = Auricularia auricula @-@ judae = 
 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae , known as the Jew 's ear , wood ear , jelly ear or by a number of other common names , is a species of edible Auriculariales fungus found worldwide . The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear @-@ like shape and brown colouration ; it grows upon wood , especially elder . Its specific epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an elder tree ; the common name " Judas 's ear " eventually became " Jew 's ear " , while today " jelly ear " and other names are sometimes used . The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide , where it grows upon both dead and living wood . 
 In the West , A. auricula @-@ judae was used in folk medicine as recently as the 19th century for complaints including sore throats , sore eyes and jaundice , and as an astringent . Although it is not widely consumed in the West , it has long been popular in China , to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century . Today , the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes , such as hot and sour soup , and also used in Chinese medicine . It is also used in Ghana , as a blood tonic . Modern research into possible medical applications have variously concluded that A. auricula @-@ judae has antitumour , hypoglycemic , anticoagulant and cholesterol @-@ lowering properties . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature as Tremella auricula by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum , and later ( 1789 ) described by Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Tremella auricula @-@ judae . However , the genus Tremella is now reserved for fungal species that live as parasites on other fungi . Tremella auricula @-@ judae is now considered a basionym . In 1791 , Bulliard transferred the species to the genus Peziza . In 1822 , Elias Magnus Fries transferred the species to <unk> , and , in so doing , sanctioned the name . In 1860 , Miles Joseph Berkeley described the species as a member of <unk> , a genus described by Fries in 1848 , now considered synonymous with Auricularia . 
 The species was given the name Auricularia auricula @-@ judae in 1888 by Joseph Schröter . The specific name of A. auricula @-@ judae comprises auricula , the Latin word meaning ear , and <unk> , meaning of Judas . Under binomial nomenclature , a species name can comprise only two words ; but the taxonomists responsible for this naming hyphenated the specific name to " bend the rules " and keep the name " within the letter of the law " . The name was criticised by mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd , who said " Auricularia auricula @-@ <unk> is cumbersome and in addition is a slander on the Jews " . Though critical of Lucien Marcus Underwood , saying he " would probably not have known the Jew 's ear from the calves ' liver " , he followed him in using Auricularia auricula , which was in turn used by Bernard Lowy in an article on the entire genus . Despite this , Auricularia auricula @-@ judae is the currently recognised name for the species by many sources , though Auricularia auricula is still occasionally used . 
 As well as the obligate synonyms from Bulliard , Fries and Berkeley , there are numerous other synonymous names . Mycologist George Willard Martin , writing in 1943 , noted that the species was known by at least 12 binomials , of which none appeared to be valid , and noted that " the citations given for the various names are extremely erratic " . Mycologist Mary F. Barrett attributes " such multiplication of names " to " the wide distribution of the Judas ' ear , its ability to grow upon many different kinds of decaying wood , and to its great variation in size , colour and shape " . 
 The fungus is associated with Judas Iscariot because of the belief that he hanged himself on an elder tree after his betrayal of Jesus Christ . Folklore suggests that the ears are Judas 's returned spirit , and are all that are left to remind us of his suicide . The common name of the fungus was originally " Judas 's ear " , but this was later shortened to " Judas ear " and , in the late 19th century , shortened again to " Jew 's ear " . Common names for the fungus which refer to Judas can be traced back to at least the end of the 16th century ; for instance , in the 17th century , Thomas Browne wrote of the species : 
 In Jews ' ears something is conceived extraordinary from the name , which is in propriety but fungus <unk> , or an excrescence about the roots of elder , and <unk> not the nation of the Jews , but Judas Iscariot , upon a conceit he hanged on this tree ; and is become a famous medicine in <unk> , sore throats , and <unk> , ever since . 
 While the term " Jew 's meat " was a deprecatory term used for all fungi in the Middle Ages , the term is unrelated to the name " Jew 's ear " . A further change of name to " jelly ear " was recommended in the List of Recommended Names for Fungi . The idea was rejected by mycologist Patrick Harding who considered it " to be the result of political correctness where it is not necessary " , and who " will continue to call [ the species ] Jew 's ear " , explaining that , while anti @-@ Semitism was commonplace in Britain , the name " Jew 's ear " is in reference to Judas , who was a Jew . However , the name has been adopted in some recent field guides . 
 Unrelated common names include the " ear fungus " , " common ear fungus " , " the Chinese Fungus " , " the pig 's ear " , " the wood ear " , " the black wood ear " , " the tree ear " , and " <unk> " . The species was known as " fungus <unk> " among herbalists , in reference to <unk> , the generic name for elder .

 The fruit body of A. auricula @-@ judae is normally 3 to 8 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) across , but can be as much as 12 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) . It is distinctively shaped , typically being reminiscent of a floppy ear , though the fruit bodies can also be cup @-@ shaped . It is normally attached to the substrate laterally and sometimes by a very short stalk . The species has a tough , gelatinous , elastic texture when fresh , but it dries hard and brittle . The outer surface is a bright reddish @-@ tan @-@ brown with a purplish hint , often covered in tiny , downy hairs of a grey colour . It can be smooth , as is typical of younger specimens , or undulating with folds and wrinkles . The colour becomes darker with age . The inner surface is a lighter grey @-@ brown in colour and smooth . It is sometimes wrinkled , again with folds and wrinkles , and may have " veins " , making it appear even more ear @-@ like .

 The spores of A. auricula @-@ judae are long and sausage shaped , ranging in size from 16 to 18 micrometres ( μm ) long by 6 to 8 μm thick . The spores themselves are white , cream or yellowish , and are hyaline . The spores can sometimes be seen in a whitish mass on the underside of the fruit body . The species has elongated cylindrical basidia with three transverse septa ( internal cross @-@ walls dividing the hyphae ) . Basidia 60 @-@ <unk> 4 @-@ <unk> ; sterigmata lateral , well developed , 3 @-@ <unk> long . Spores smooth , hyaline , reniform to allantoid , 14 @-@ 18 Χ 6 @-@ <unk> , <unk> .

 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae is similar to A. <unk> in colour and texture , and " may be confused with it if only external features are considered " . The spore and basidia sizes of the two species are slightly different , but this is not a reliable way to tell them apart . A. cornea is another similar species in the same genus , but has distinct internal differences , is normally more pilose ( more covered in soft hair ) and tends to fruit in larger numbers . 
 = = Habitat , ecology and distribution = = 
 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae grows upon the wood of deciduous trees and shrubs , favouring elder . In up to 90 % of cases , the mushroom is found on elder , but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder . It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus ( known in the United Kingdom as sycamore ) , beech , ash , spindle , and in one particular case , the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden . Recently , A. auricula @-@ judae has been recorded from semi @-@ evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats , India . This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees , on main trunk , decaying logs , etc . This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized <unk> . A. auricula @-@ judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size , shape and colour . In Australia , it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests ; in the rainforests , it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs . It favours older branches , where it feeds as a <unk> ( on dead wood ) or a weak parasite ( on living wood ) , and it causes white rot . 
 Commonly growing solitarily , it can also be gregarious ( in a group ) or caespitose ( in a tuft ) . Spores are ejected from the underside of the fruit bodies with as many as several hundred thousand an hour , and the high rate continues when the bodies have been significantly dried . Even when they have lost some 90 % of their weight through dehydration , the bodies continue to release a small number of spores . It is found all year , but is most common in autumn . It is widespread throughout temperate and sub @-@ tropical zones worldwide , and can be found across Europe , North America , Asia , Australia , South America and Africa . There has been some debate about the appearance of the species in the tropics ; while it has been frequently reported there , Bernard Lowy , in an article on Auricularia , said that " of the specimens I have examined , none could be assigned here " .

 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae has a soft , jelly @-@ like texture . Though edible , it was not held in high culinary regard in the west for many years . It has been likened to " eating an Indian rubber with bones in it " , while in 19th @-@ century Britain , it was said that " it has never been regarded here as an edible fungus " . It has a mild flavour , and is useful for mixed mushroom recipes , but is still considered bland in the west . It can be dried and rehydrated , sometimes swelling to a very large size . Young specimens are best , but the species is not edible when raw , needing to be cooked thoroughly . The whole fruit body can be eaten , but should be thoroughly washed before cooking . Cooking can sometimes take a comparatively long time . The nutritional content of 100 g ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) of dried fungus includes 370 kcal , 10 @.@ 6 g of protein , 0 @.@ 2 g of fat , 65 g of carbohydrate , 5 @.@ 8 g ash , and 0 @.@ 03 % mg of carotene . Fresh mushrooms contain about 90 % moisture . Dried specimens may be ground up into a powder and used to absorb excess liquid in soups and stews , as it <unk> into tiny fragments . 
 Both A. auricula @-@ judae and the similar A. polytricha are popular in China , where the medicinal use of food is common ; a soup containing the species is used medicinally for dealing with colds and fevers by reducing the heat of the body . There is evidence that the species were being cultivated in China as early as the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) . Li Shizhen , in his Pen Tsao Kang Mu , quotes Tang Ying @-@ chuan from that period as saying " ... put the steamed bran on logs , cover with straw , Wood Ear will grow " . In the early 20th century , large volumes of A. auricula @-@ judae were exported from Australia to China , and it is today still sold in Asian food shops for culinary use . It is also popular in Vietnam , although the climate is there more suited to A. polytricha . A report on small @-@ scale fungi cultivation concluded that A. auricula @-@ judae would be suitable for cultivation only in cooler climates . According to a 2010 publication , the annual production of Auricularia species worldwide is the fourth highest among all industrially cultivated culinary and medicinal mushrooms , and in China , the estimated output was roughly 1 @.@ 655 million tonnes ( based on 2003 data ) , most of which are A. polytricha however ( which has by and large replaced A. auricula @-@ judae in international trade ) . 
 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae is also in cultivation elsewhere in the world , for instance , in Ghana . In the Brong @-@ <unk> and Ashanti regions , it is grown with what is referred to as the " plastic bag method " . Sawdust is packed into polypropylene bags and then sterilised by steam for several hours . Once the sawdust has cooled , Sorghum grain spawn is added , and the bags are kept in moderately dark conditions . Once the sawdust is exposed to a humid environment , A. auricula @-@ judae fruit bodies begin to grow . Elsewhere in the world , a study on the use of mushrooms by the Bini people inhabiting a remote village in southern Nigeria found that the local inhabitants collected and ate A. auricula @-@ judae , but that it was not one of the mushrooms they used medicinally . 
 Collection of the mushroom for culinary use has also been documented in Nepal . However , the Nepalese do not consider it a choice mushroom for eating ; of the three grades given to edible mushrooms , it was given the worst . Again , unlike other mushrooms , no medicinal use was reported . The mushroom has also been the only non @-@ morel species exported from Nepal for culinary use . 
 Other places where A. auricula @-@ judae has been recorded as commonly consumed include Poland , Mozambique and Indonesia , while , in Bolivia , <unk> 's monkeys have been recorded as commonly eating the sporocarps . 
 = = = Folk medicine = = = 
 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae has been used as a medicinal mushroom by many herbalists . It was used as a poultice to treat inflammations of the eye , as well as a palliative for throat problems . The 16th @-@ century herbalist John Gerard , writing in 1597 , recommended A. auricula @-@ judae for a very specific use ; other fungi were used more generally . He recommends the preparation of a liquid extract by boiling the fruit bodies in milk , or else leaving them steeped in beer , which would then be sipped slowly in order to cure a sore throat . The resultant broth was probably not dissimilar to the Chinese soups that use A. polytricha . Carolus Clusius , writing in 1601 , also said that the species could be gargled to cure a sore throat , and John Parkinson , writing in 1640 , reported that boiling in milk or steeping in vinegar was " the onely use the are put unto that I know " . 
 Writing in 1694 , herbalist John <unk> described A. auricula @-@ judae by saying " It grows to the Trunk of the Elder @-@ Tree . Being dried it will keep a good year . <unk> 'd in Milk , or infus 'd in <unk> ' tis good to gargle the Mouth or Throat in <unk> , and other inflammations of the Mouth and Throat . And being infus 'd in some proper Water , it is good in Diseases of the Eyes . " The species also saw use as an astringent due to its ability to absorb water . There are recorded medicinal usages from Scotland , where it was again used as a gargle for sore throats , and from Ireland , where , in an attempt to cure jaundice , it was boiled in milk . The medicinal use of A. auricula @-@ judae continued until at least 1860 , when it was still sold at Covent Garden ; at the time , it was not considered edible in the United Kingdom . 
 Medicinal use in Indonesia was also recorded in the 1930s , and was more recently reported in modern @-@ day Ghana . A report for the 2005 Commonwealth Forestry Conference examining the possible effects of deforestation in southern Ghana on medicinal and edible fungi found that A. auricula @-@ judae was in use as a blood tonic . 
 = = = Pharmacology = = = 
 Auricularia auricula @-@ judae has been the subject of research into possible medicinal applications . Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent antitumour properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours . This was despite the conclusion of earlier research indicating that , while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had antitumour effects , extracts from A. auricula @-@ judae did not . Further , research on genetically diabetic mice showed that a polysaccharide extracted from A. auricula @-@ judae had a hypoglycemic effect ; mice fed with food including the polysaccharide showed reduced plasma glucose , insulin , urinary glucose and food intake . 
 Another chemical extracted from the species was an acidic polysaccharide ( made up of mostly mannose , glucose , glucuronic acid and <unk> ) which showed anticoagulant properties . The article concluded that " the polysaccharides from these mushrooms may constitute a new source of compounds with action on coagulation , platelet aggregation and , perhaps , on thrombosis " . Another study reported that the species may be effective in stopping platelet binding in vitro , with possible uses regarding hypercholesterolemia . Research has shown that A. auricula @-@ judae can be used to lower cholesterol levels generally , and , in particular , is one of two fungi shown to reduce the level of bad cholesterol .

 The species is referred to in Christopher Marlowe 's play The Jew of Malta . <unk> proclaims : " The hat he wears , Judas left under the elder when he hanged himself " . Later , the species was probably partially the inspiration for Emily Dickinson 's poem beginning " The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants " , which depicts a mushroom as the " ultimate betrayer " . Dickinson had both a religious and naturalistic background , and so it is more than likely that she knew of the common name of A. auricula @-@ judae , and of the folklore surrounding Judas 's suicide . 
 = Jersey Act = 
 The Jersey Act was introduced to prevent the registration of most American @-@ bred Thoroughbred horses in the British General Stud Book . It had its roots in the desire of the British to halt the influx of American @-@ bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century . Many American @-@ bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling , which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in that country . The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American @-@ bred horses were purebred . 
 In 1913 the Jockey Club and the owners of the General Stud Book passed a regulation named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club 's senior steward , Lord Jersey , prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered . Despite protests from American breeders the regulation was in force until 1949 . Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage being caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War . In addition , by 1949 the impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses ' ancestry . 
 = = Background = = 
 Before the introduction in 1913 of what became popularly known — " with <unk> taste " according to a correspondent writing in The Times — as the Jersey Act , Thoroughbred horses in the United Kingdom were registered in the General Stud Book , the stud book for British and Irish Thoroughbreds . The rules allowed a horse to be registered if all of the horse 's ancestors were registered in the General Stud Book or if it had been bred outside of Britain or Ireland and was registered in the stud book of its country of origin . Overall the General Stud Book had the most stringent rules for registration of Thoroughbreds at the time , around 1900 ; other countries , including the United States , France , Australia and Russia , were considered by the British and Irish to be much laxer and to have allowed some non @-@ Thoroughbred horses into their national stud books . 
 The outlawing of race @-@ track betting in parts of the United States between 1900 and 1913 led to a large influx of American @-@ bred horses into Britain and Ireland , giving rise to fears among British breeders that they would be swamped by the American bloodlines and their own stock would become worthless . The biggest state to outlaw betting was New York , which passed the Hart – Agnew Law in 1908 . By 1911 , the average price for yearlings sold at auction was at a record low of $ 230 ( $ 5 @,@ 840 as of 2016 ) . Before 1900 , most horses were imported into Britain to race , and rarely stayed for a breeding career . The outlawing of gambling resulted in large numbers of American horses that could no longer be supported , and many were shipped to Europe for racing . Because of the downturn in the horse market in the US , it was assumed that most of the horses sent to Europe would stay there permanently and , after retirement from the racetrack , would enter their breeding careers outside the US . Between 1908 and 1913 , over 1500 Thoroughbreds were exported from the United States . Those exported included 24 horses who had been or would later become champions – among them Artful , Colin , Henry of Navarre , Peter Pan , and Ballot . 
 The American Stud Book , the registration book for American Thoroughbreds , was not founded until 1873 , much later than the General Stud Book , and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other national stud books , unlike the General Stud Book rules . In addition , many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War , as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers . The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules . Adding to the problem was the fact that American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England , starting with Iroquois , who won the 1881 Epsom Derby . 
 J. B. Haggin , an American breeder and owner of the historic Elmendorf Farm , had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale , including the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio , and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead , the English racing market would be overwhelmed . As a first step , the English racing authorities began to limit the number of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse , turning away a number of American breeders . The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book , but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 The owners of the General Stud Book , <unk> , consulted with the Jockey Club , the United Kingdom 's racing authority , and discussions were held about the problems in pedigrees recorded in the American Stud Book . At a meeting of the Jockey Club in spring 1913 , Victor Child Villiers , Lord Jersey , the club 's senior steward , proposed a resolution limiting the registration of American bloodlines . It passed unanimously in May , and a new regulation was placed in the General Stud Book , Volume 22 : 
 No horse or mare can , after this date , be considered as eligible for admission unless it can be traced without flaw on both sire 's and dam 's side of its pedigree to horses and mares themselves already accepted in the earlier volumes of the book . 
 Although named the Jersey Act by a critical foreign press , after Lord Jersey , the new regulation did not have the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse , not by the United Kingdom government . Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club , which had no authority over registration , only over racing matters . The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse that had already been registered in the General Stud Book , effectively excluding most American @-@ bred Thoroughbreds . 
 = = Effects = = 
 The new rule was not applied retroactively , therefore all American @-@ bred horses registered before 1913 remained on the register , and their descendants were also eligible for registration . Of the 7 @,@ 756 mares in Volume 27 of the General Stud Book , published in 1933 , 930 would have been ineligible under the new rule . The Jersey Act did have an immediate impact however , as the winner of the 1914 Epsom Derby , Durbar II , was ineligible for registration , as his dam , Armenia , was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible for the General Stud Book . 
 The main problem for American breeders was the presence of the blood of Lexington in their breeding programs . Lexington 's pedigree on his dam 's side was suspect in the eyes of British racing authorities , and as he had been the leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16 years , his descendants were numerous . Most American @-@ bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once , and he was not the only horse with suspect bloodlines registered in the American Stud Book . 
 Most British breeders thought the regulation necessary and welcomed it , whereas most American breeders found it insulting , and believed that it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market . The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though , including even one senior member of the Jockey Club , Lord Coventry , whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration . Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition , probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market . The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication , the Racing Calendar , and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club 's meeting minutes for 1913 . Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks , which led to the growth of racing in the United States ; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming . 
 The Jersey Act did not prevent the racing of horses containing the banned bloodlines , as horses with the suspect breeding raced and won in England , but they were considered to be " half @-@ bred " . A number of American @-@ bred horses carrying the lines of Lexington had already been imported into England , including Americus , Rhoda B , and <unk> , and because they were grandfathered in , they and their descendants were allowed to be registered in the General Stud Book . Neither did it prevent the racing of horses that were not registered in the General Stud Book ; it just prevented registration in the General Stud Book . American bloodlines , whether registered in the General Stud Book or not , dominated English racing in the 1920s and 1930s . Horses that were <unk> for General Stud Book registration , but were allowed to race , were identified with a Maltese cross in programs and auction listings . 
 A number of American breeders , including the then @-@ chairman of the American Jockey Club , William Woodward , Sr. , lobbied hard throughout the 1930s to have the regulation removed . Woodward , and other defenders of the American bloodlines , argued that the racing performance of the horses proved their purity , even if they could not produce papers that did so . Woodward declared in 1935 that " If we do not get together , we will grow apart . " Those arguing for keeping the Jersey Act in effect pointed out that the General Stud Book is a record of bloodlines , not a work recording racing ability . 
 The Jersey Act 's major effect was the opposite of what was intended . In the years before the Second World War British and Irish breeders had relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines , a source that was unavailable during the war , and concerns were beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding . Additionally , by the end of the war American @-@ bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world , effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second @-@ rate , and harming the rebuilding of English racing . There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees , thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the General Stud Book . 
 = = 1949 amendment = = 
 <unk> , publishers of the Stud Book , approached the Jockey Club in 1948 to ask if it agreed that the Jersey Act was " too restrictive " . The rule was subsequently modified in June 1949 , after the racing careers of a number of horses such as <unk> and Djebel persuaded the Jockey Club to reconsider . A number of French @-@ bred Thoroughbreds began to race in England after the Second World War , but because they carried American lines they were considered half @-@ breds . In 1948 two of England 's five classic races were won by half @-@ bred horses , My Babu and Black Tarquin , prompting the Jockey Club to amend the rule in the preface to the General Stud Book , to state that : 
 Any animal claiming admission from now onwards must be able to prove satisfactorily some eight or nine crosses pure blood , to trace back for at least a century , and to show such performances of its immediate family on the Turf as to warrant the belief in the purity of its blood . 
 The amendment removed the stigma of not being considered purebred from American @-@ bred horses . A major consideration was that by the late 1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most horses ' ancestry that it no longer made much sense to exclude them . Neither did it make much sense to exclude some of the most successful racehorses in Europe from registration . Weatherby 's further amended its regulations in 1969 , introducing the word " thoroughbred " to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the General Stud Book . In 2006 , Blood @-@ Horse Publications , publisher of The Blood @-@ Horse magazine , chose the " repeal " of the Jersey Act as the 39th most important moment in American Thoroughbred horse racing history .

 What It 's Like Being Alone is a Canadian television program which aired on CBC Television in 2006 . It is a black comedy created by Brad Peyton , and combines clay animation with voice work by Stacey DePass , Adam Reid , Dwayne Hill , Julie Lemieux , Peter <unk> , and Andrew Sabiston . 
 Having debuted on 26 June 2006 , the series lasted only until 18 September of that year . The storylines of the thirteen episodes that aired during this timeframe center on the many attempts of fictional mutant children living in an orphanage to get adopted . Princess Lucy , a grey , fat , and warty orphan , is the main character , and the plot begins with her arrival at the orphanage . Critics regarded the series as unusual , and it received notably poor ratings . Commentators considered these ratings to reflect a generally poor performance of CBC programming in 2006 .

 The storylines of What It 's Like Being Alone revolve around the residents of the fictional Gurney Orphanage , a dark , run @-@ down building . The orphanage has been described by a columnist as Victorian , and it may be set in a bog on the Canadian island of Newfoundland . 
 Aldous is the eldest of the orphans . She is tall , depressed , very gothic and obsessed with her own death , and carries a black umbrella . She spends most of her time moping about the orphanage and writing depressing poetry . It is insinuated that she actually cares for the other orphans , without letting this on too much . Aldous is voiced by Stacey DePass . 
 Armie is a boy with no limbs , except for his left arm . He glides around on a skateboard , and often falls over when he uses his arm for something . He is happy and hopeful , despite his obvious handicap . Armie is voiced by Adam Reid .

Like a sunset , but only if you 're on fire . " Charlie is voiced by Peter <unk> . 
 Princess Lucy is a short , fat , warty and grey girl who believes she is a princess .

 The pilot of the series aired with some anticipation . Beforehand , columnist Randall <unk> had written that " I suspect [ it ] will be the highlight of the evening , " noting the series had been described as " wondrous and fiendishly humorous . " The first episode , titled " The Gurney Orphanage For Beginners , " features Princess Lucy and her suitcase falling from the sky in front of the orphanage and killing three rabbits . Upon getting up and seeing the orphanage , Princess Lucy believes she has found her castle and royal family . Instead , she is surprised to find the building is full of mutant orphans , and devastated to learn she is an orphan herself . She tries to escape , but finds any way out blocked by a lake monster and a dangerous forest , among other things . 
 Eventually , a woman agrees to adopt Lucy . However , the other orphans see that the woman will probably not provide the best home for her , and intervene . Lucy ultimately decides that she belongs in the orphanage more so than her ideal castle .

 The series was continued with twelve more episodes : Themes explored include " social issues , pop culture references and humour . " Due to the show having the visual appearance of a children 's television series , each episode was preceded by a content warning , stating that the show was intended for an adult audience and that " parental discretion " was advised . 
 " Do Orphans Dream of Electric Parents ? " is the second episode . It is about Brian Brain inventing robots and making them his parents , only to find that the robots want to divorce each other . In the next episode , " An Orphans Life Indeed " , Princess Lucy seeks a best friend , but her vanity causes her to decide that only she can be her own best friend . Lucy then clones herself , but the clones prove troublesome . Seymore , who is in love with Lucy , ultimately solves the problem by slaughtering the clones with a chainsaw . One critic remarked that this was a particularly " disturbing " scene for the series . 
 The fourth episode , called " The Perfect Lesson " , sees the orphans trying to perform a play to impress visiting prospective parents . It is from this episode that the show 's title is derived , as the play repeatedly refers to " what it 's like being alone " . This was followed by the episode aired on 24 July , " The Poster Child " which is about a corporation that attempts to adopt Aldous to use her in advertisements . Aldous , under a witch 's curse , must accept this shallow adoption or die . 
 In the episode " Fire the Reverend " , a religious speaker visits the orphanage and confuses Charlie with Satan ; the real Satan and his son later emerge , and Charlie finds out that while he is mistaken for being evil , Satan 's son is trying to shed the perception that he is good . Eventually Charlie saves the day by persuading Satan and his son to leave the orphanage . The seventh episode is entitled " Red , White and Orphanage " . It is about another orphanage abducting Brian Brain in order to exploit him in their plans for world domination . This was followed by " Sammy 's Episode " , which is about Sammy taking various medications , as well as shock therapy . The ninth episode is " A Tale of Almost Unbearable Sadness , " which is focussed on declining morale in the orphanage and exploration of the dangerous forest . 
 Alternate names for the tenth episode are " Lucky Lucy " and " You Gotta Know When to Hold ' em " . In it , Princess Lucy bets that Byron and Beasly cannot be cleaned and wins . She afterwards gambles more but nearly loses the orphanage in the process . The episode " Armie Loves Cigarettes " sees Armie taking up smoking . According to the Internet Movie Database , the second last episode and season finale aired on the same day , 18 September . The twelfth and second last episode is called " A Frightful Flu , " and in it Aldous entrusts care for the ailing orphans to a witch . The final episode , " Silver Screen Lucy " or " The Sweet Stink of Success , " is about the orphans making short films to impress a prospective parent , but he ends up adopting Nanny Goodapple and Beasly and Byron , leaving the orphanage to Aldous . 
 = = Production = = 
 The show was created by Brad Peyton of Newfoundland and Labrador , who explained that he identified himself as a " freak " growing up , and was thus motivated to try " celebrating flawed characters " in his work ; he also employed stereotypical views of orphanages in the series . Peyton had previously made a black comedy short film called Evelyn : The Cutest Evil Dead Girl , and afterwards declined to shoot a major film . Instead , he turned to What It 's Like Being Alone . He described the genesis of the series : 
 I had a friend who was depressed , so I went over to her house and started drawing . I made her a little book . She liked it and said I should try to sell it . So I photocopied 200 at <unk> and sold them at Pages Books . Made like $ 150 dollars . That book turned into What It 's Like Being Alone . 
 Peyton explained the writing by saying " it always comes out of an emotional place . " One of the writers was Karen Walton , who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps . The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton 's personal interest in it , although he later claimed that a day 's work could lead to seconds ' worth of material . A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams , with some of the animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride . The characters were made out of plastic and foam . Additionally , some animation was done through computers . Each character 's figure had a number of add @-@ on lips to express various sounds , and their eyes and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production . The figures could also be fastened into a surface , moved and fastened in again to portray movement . Peyton remarked that " The hardest thing is timing and pacing . " Still , he also liked to emphasize that the series did not cost too much money to produce . 
 The airing of the series had been stalled for a year , perhaps due to difficulties within the CBC . To get CBC to adopt the series , Peyton showed the company a commercial with the CBC logo in blood , remarking that " It 's been way too long that you 've waited to have your logo covered in blood . " He had also said that What It 's Like Being Alone was meant to attract university and high school students as an audience , and he felt that these people did not ordinarily watch the CBC . CBC itself was looking for original material , and was enthusiastic about the series because it seemed to stand out among Canadian television productions . Peyton 's co @-@ producer was Fred Fuchs , who later rose in the CBC staff ; one critic believed Fuchs ' promotion to be a reason why CBC adopted the series . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Critics generally found the series to be unusual . CBC critic Stephen Cole commented that What It 's Like Being Alone has " arguably the most surreal opening sequence in TV history " with a shift in view from a black and white Canadian flag to the orphan characters . He questioned whether the show indicated the CBC had adopted " Addams Family values " and said that it was " the wildest CBC comedy since Twitch City . " 
 One television critic briefly said that What It 's Like Being Alone is a " weird show , " and simply advised individual viewers to see it for themselves . If they " relate " to it , the critic added , " a ' Yikes ! ' is in order . " Bill Brioux of the Toronto Sun commented that in combining a feel one would usually expect from Tim Burton with elements of Sesame Street , What It 's Like Being Alone would probably not appeal fully to any demographic , despite its originality . Additionally , he felt Princess Lucy would be tiresome , and said he had hoped the show were more amusing . 
 In terms of ratings , the series did not do well . The Toronto Star described it as one of CBC 's " prime @-@ time dogs " with an audience of 78 @,@ 000 people . The executive Richard Stursberg was blamed for cancelling the more popular Da Vinci 's City Hall and This is Wonderland to make room for this and other shows , and in general for being a " one @-@ man wrecking ball " for the CBC ( the series The One : Making a Music Star had also flopped on CBC in 2006 ) . On 18 September , the series finale had only 163 @,@ 000 viewers , part of the perceived " shocking " low ratings CBC received that year , along with the low ratings of the documentary series Hockey : A People 's History and a mini @-@ series about former @-@ Quebec premier René Lévesque . 
 = Economy of England in the Middle Ages = 
 The economy of England in the Middle Ages , from the Norman invasion in 1066 , to the death of Henry VII in 1509 , was fundamentally agricultural , though even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers . Norman institutions , including serfdom , were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature , well @-@ established towns involved in international trade . Over the next five centuries the economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis , resulting in significant political and economic change . Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies , including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies , the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period . By the end of the period , England had a weak government , by later standards , overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry , and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations . 
 The 12th and 13th centuries saw a huge development of the English economy . This was partially driven by the growth in the population from around 1 @.@ 5 million at the time of the creation of the Domesday Book in 1086 to between 4 and 5 million in 1300 . England remained a primarily agricultural economy , with the rights of major landowners and the duties of serfs increasingly enshrined in English law . More land , much of it at the expense of the royal forests , was brought into production to feed the growing population or to produce wool for export to Europe . Many hundreds of new towns , some of them planned , sprung up across England , supporting the creation of guilds , charter fairs and other important medieval institutions . The descendants of the Jewish financiers who had first come to England with William the Conqueror played a significant role in the growing economy , along with the new Cistercian and Augustinian religious orders that came to become major players in the wool trade of the north . Mining increased in England , with the silver boom of the 12th century helping to fuel a fast @-@ expanding currency . 
 Economic growth began to falter by the end of the 13th century , owing to a combination of over @-@ population , land shortages and depleted soils . The loss of life in the Great Famine of 1315 – 17 shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased ; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population , with major implications for the post @-@ plague economy . The agricultural sector shrank , with higher wages , lower prices and shrinking profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system of cash rents for lands . The Peasants Revolt of 1381 shook the older feudal order and limited the levels of royal taxation considerably for a century to come . The 15th century saw the growth of the English cloth industry and the establishment of a new class of international English merchant , increasingly based in London and the South @-@ West , prospering at the expense of the older , shrinking economy of the eastern towns . These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company . Together with improvements in metalworking and shipbuilding , this represents the end of the medieval economy , and the beginnings of the early modern period in English economics . 
 = = Invasion and the early Norman period ( 1066 – 1100 ) = = 
 William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066 , defeating the Anglo @-@ Saxon King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings and placing the country under Norman rule . This campaign was followed by fierce military operations known as the Harrying of the North in 1069 – 70 , extending Norman authority across the north of England . William 's system of government was broadly feudal in that the right to possess land was linked to service to the king , but in many other ways the invasion did little to alter the nature of the English economy . Most of the damage done in the invasion was in the north and the west of England , some of it still recorded as " wasteland " in 1086 . Many of the key features of the English agricultural and financial system remained in place in the decades immediately after the conquest . 
 = = = Agriculture and mining = = = 
 = = = = English agriculture = = = = 
 Agriculture formed the bulk of the English economy at the time of the Norman invasion . Twenty years after the invasion , 35 % of England was covered in arable land , 25 % was put to pasture , 15 % was covered by woodlands and the remaining 25 % was predominantly moorland , fens and heaths . Wheat formed the single most important arable crop , but rye , barley and oats were also cultivated extensively . In the more fertile parts of the country , such as the Thames valley , the Midlands and the east of England , legumes and beans were also cultivated . Sheep , cattle , oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings , although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter . 
 = = = = Manorial system = = = = 
 In the century prior to the Norman invasion , England 's great estates , owned by the king , bishops , monasteries and thegns , had been slowly broken up as a consequence of inheritance , wills , marriage settlements or church purchases . Most of the smaller landowning nobility lived on their properties and managed their own estates . The pre @-@ Norman landscape had seen a trend away from isolated hamlets and towards larger villages engaged in arable cultivation in a band running north – south across England . These new villages had adopted an open field system in which fields were divided into small strips of land , individually owned , with crops rotated between the field each year and the local woodlands and other common lands carefully managed . Agricultural land on a manor was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage and cultivate directly , called demesne land , and the majority of the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants , who would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord 's demesne fields or through cash or produce . Around 6 @,@ 000 watermills of varying power and efficiency had been built in order to grind flour , freeing up peasant labour for other more productive agricultural tasks . The early English economy was not a subsistence economy and many crops were grown by peasant farmers for sale to the early English towns . 
 The Normans initially did not significantly alter the operation of the manor or the village economy . William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite , creating vast estates in some areas , particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex . The biggest change in the years after the invasion was the rapid reduction in the number of slaves being held in England . In the 10th century slaves had been very numerous , although their number had begun to diminish as a result of economic and religious pressure . Nonetheless , the new Norman aristocracy proved harsh landlords . The wealthier , formerly more independent Anglo @-@ Saxon peasants found themselves rapidly sinking down the economic hierarchy , swelling the numbers of unfree workers , or serfs , forbidden to leave their manor and seek alternative employment . Those Anglo @-@ Saxon nobles who had survived the invasion itself were rapidly assimilated into the Norman elite or economically crushed . 
 = = = = Creation of the forests = = = = 
 The Normans also established the royal forests . In Anglo @-@ Saxon times there had been special woods for hunting called " hays " , but the Norman forests were much larger and backed by legal mandate . The new forests were not necessarily heavily wooded but were defined instead by their protection and exploitation by the crown . The Norman forests were subject to special royal jurisdiction ; forest law was " harsh and arbitrary , a matter purely for the King 's will " . Forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds , raw materials , goods and money . Revenue from forest rents and fines came to become extremely significant and forest wood was used for castles and royal ship building . Several forests played a key role in mining , such as the iron mining and working in the Forest of Dean and lead mining in the Forest of High Peak . Several other groups bound up economically with forests ; many monasteries had special rights in particular forests , for example for hunting or tree felling . The royal forests were accompanied by the rapid creation of locally owned parks and chases . 
 = = = Trade , manufacturing and the towns = = = 
 Although primarily rural , England had a number of old , economically important towns in 1066 . A large amount of trade came through the Eastern towns , including London , York , Winchester , Lincoln , Norwich , Ipswich and Thetford . Much of this trade was with France , the Low Countries and Germany , but the North @-@ East of England traded with partners as far away as Sweden . Cloth was already being imported to England before the invasion through the <unk> trade . 
 Some towns , such as York , suffered from Norman sacking during William 's northern campaigns . Other towns saw the widespread demolition of houses to make room for new motte and bailey fortifications , as was the case in Lincoln . The Norman invasion also brought significant economic changes with the arrival of the first Jews to English cities . William I brought over wealthy Jews from the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London , apparently to carry out financial services for the crown . In the years immediately after the invasion , a lot of wealth was drawn out of England in various ways by the Norman rulers and reinvested in Normandy , making William immensely wealthy as an individual ruler . 
 The minting of coins was decentralised in the Saxon period ; every borough was mandated to have a mint and therefore a centre for trading in bullion . Nonetheless , there was strict royal control over these moneyers , and coin dies could only be made in London . William retained this process and generated a high standard of Norman coins , leading to the use of the term " sterling " as the name for the Norman silver coins . 
 = = = Governance and taxation = = = 
 William I inherited the Anglo @-@ Saxon system in which the king drew his revenues from : a mixture of customs ; profits from re @-@ minting coinage ; fines ; profits from his own demesne lands ; and the system of English land @-@ based taxation called the geld . William reaffirmed this system , enforcing collection of the geld through his new system of sheriffs and increasing the taxes on trade . William was also famous for commissioning the Domesday Book in 1086 , a vast document which attempted to record the economic condition of his new kingdom . 
 = = Mid @-@ medieval growth ( 1100 – 1290 ) = = 
 The 12th and 13th centuries were a period of huge economic growth in England . The population of England rose from around 1 @.@ 5 million in 1086 to around 4 or 5 million in 1300 , stimulating increased agricultural outputs and the export of raw materials to Europe . In contrast to the previous two centuries , England was relatively secure from invasion . Except for the years of the Anarchy , most military conflicts either had only localised economic impact or proved only temporarily disruptive . English economic thinking remained conservative , seeing the economy as consisting of three groups : the ordines , those who fought , or the nobility ; <unk> , those who worked , in particular the peasantry ; and <unk> , those who prayed , or the clerics . Trade and merchants played little part in this model and were frequently vilified at the start of the period , although they were increasingly tolerated towards the end of the 13th century . 
 = = = Agriculture , fishing and mining = = = 
 = = = = English agriculture and the landscape = = = = 
 Agriculture remained by far the most important part of the English economy during the 12th and 13th centuries . There remained a wide variety in English agriculture , influenced by local geography ; in areas where grain could not be grown , other resources were exploited instead . In the Weald , for example , agriculture centred on grazing animals on the woodland pastures , whilst in the Fens fishing and bird @-@ hunting was supplemented by basket @-@ making and peat @-@ cutting . In some locations , such as Lincolnshire and Droitwich , salt manufacture was important , including production for the export market . Fishing became an important trade along the English coast , especially in Great Yarmouth and Scarborough , and the herring was a particularly popular catch ; salted at the coast , it could then be shipped inland or exported to Europe . Piracy between competing English fishing fleets was not unknown during the period . Sheep were the most common farm animal in England during the period , their numbers doubling by the 14th century . Sheep became increasingly widely used for wool , particularly in the Welsh borders , Lincolnshire and the Pennines . Pigs remained popular on holdings because of their ability to scavenge for food . Oxen remained the primary plough animal , with horses used more widely on farms in the south of England towards the end of the 12th century . Rabbits were introduced from France in the 13th century and farmed for their meat in special warrens . 
 The underlying productivity of English agriculture remained low , despite the increases in food production . Wheat prices fluctuated heavily year to year , depending on local harvests ; up to a third of the grain produced in England was potentially for sale , and much of it ended up in the growing towns . Despite their involvement in the market , even the wealthiest peasants prioritised spending on housing and clothing , with little left for other personal consumption . Records of household belongings show most possessing only " old , worn @-@ out and mended utensils " and tools . 
 The royal forests grew in size for much of the 12th century , before contracting in the late 13th and early 14th centuries . Henry I extended the size and scope of royal forests , especially in Yorkshire ; after the Anarchy of 1135 – 53 , Henry II continued to expand the forests until they comprised around 20 % of England . In 1217 the Charter of the Forest was enacted , in part to mitigate the worst excesses of royal jurisdiction , and established a more structured range of fines and punishments for peasants who illegally hunted or felled trees in the forests . By the end of the century the king had come under increasing pressure to reduce the size of the royal forests , leading to the " Great <unk> " around 1300 ; this significantly reduced the extent to the forests , and by 1334 they were only around two @-@ thirds the size they had been in 1250 . Royal revenue streams from the shrinking forests diminished considerably in the early 14th century . 
 = = = = Development of estate management = = = = 
 The Normans retained and reinforced the manorial system with its division between demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour . Landowners could profit from the sales of goods from their demesne lands and a local lord could also expect to receive income from fines and local customs , whilst more powerful nobles profited from their own regional courts and rights . 
 During the 12th century major landowners tended to rent out their demesne lands for money , motivated by static prices for produce and the chaos of the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153 . This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s , spurred by the greater political stability . In the first years of John 's reign , agricultural prices almost doubled , at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves . Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management , creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates . 
 New land was brought into cultivation to meet demand for food , including drained marshes and fens , such as Romney Marsh , the Somerset Levels and the Fens ; royal forests from the late 12th century onwards ; and poorer lands in the north , south @-@ west and in the Welsh Marches . The first windmills in England began to appear along the south and east coasts in the 12th century , expanding in number in the 13th , adding to the mechanised power available to the manors . By 1300 it has been estimated that there were more than 10 @,@ 000 watermills in England , used both for grinding corn and for fulling cloth . Fish ponds were created on most estates to provide freshwater fish for the consumption of the nobility and church ; these ponds were extremely expensive to create and maintain . Improved ways of running estates began to be circulated and were popularised in Walter de Henley 's famous book Le <unk> de <unk> , written around 1280 . In some regions and under some landowners , investment and innovation increased yields significantly through improved ploughing and fertilisers – particularly in Norfolk , where yields eventually equalled later 18th @-@ century levels . 
 = = = = Role of the Church in agriculture = = = = 
 The Church in England was a major landowner throughout the medieval period and played an important part in the development of agriculture and rural trade in the first two centuries of Norman rule . The Cistercian order first arrived in England in 1128 , establishing around 80 new monastic houses over the next few years ; the wealthy Augustinians also established themselves and expanded to occupy around 150 houses , all supported by agricultural estates , many of them in the north of England . By the 13th century these and other orders were acquiring new lands and had become major economic players both as landowners and as middlemen in the expanding wool trade . In particular , the Cistercians led the development of the grange system . Granges were separate manors in which the fields were all cultivated by the monastic officials , rather than being divided up between demesne and rented fields , and became known for trialling new agricultural techniques during the period . Elsewhere , many monasteries had significant economic impact on the landscape , such as the monks of Glastonbury , responsible for the draining of the Somerset Levels to create new pasture land . 
 The military crusading order of the Knights Templar also held extensive property in England , bringing in around £ 2 @,@ 200 per annum by the time of their fall . It comprised primarily rural holdings rented out for cash , but also included some urban properties in London . Following the dissolution of the Templar order in France by Philip IV of France , Edward II ordered their properties to be seized and passed to the Hospitaller order in 1313 , but in practice many properties were taken by local landowners and the Hospital was still attempting to reclaim them twenty @-@ five years later . 
 The Church was responsible for the system of tithes , a levy of 10 % on " all agrarian produce ... other natural products gained via labour ... wages received by servants and labourers , and to the profits of rural merchants " . Tithes gathered in the form of produce could be either consumed by the recipient , or sold on and bartered for other resources . The tithe was relatively onerous for the typical peasant , although in many instances the actual levy fell below the desired 10 % . Many clergy moved to the towns as part of the urban growth of the period , and by 1300 around one in twenty city dwellers was a clergyman . One effect of the tithe was to transfer a considerable amount of agriculture wealth into the cities , where it was then spent by these urban clergy . The need to sell tithe produce that could not be consumed by the local clergy also spurred the growth of trade . 
 = = = = Expansion of mining = = = = 
 Mining did not make up a large part of the English medieval economy , but the 12th and 13th centuries saw an increased demand for metals in the country , thanks to the considerable population growth and building construction , including the great cathedrals and churches . Four metals were mined commercially in England during the period , namely iron , tin , lead and silver ; coal was also mined from the 13th century onwards , using a variety of refining techniques . 
 Iron mining occurred in several locations , including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean , as well as in Durham and the Weald . Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent , especially by the late 13th century . By the end of the 12th century , the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques , including tunnels , trenches and bell @-@ pits . Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery , and by the 14th century the first water @-@ powered iron forge in England was built at <unk> . As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal , demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell @-@ pits and strip mining . 
 A silver boom occurred in England after the discovery of silver near Carlisle in 1133 . Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland , Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year , more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe . The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th @-@ century royal finances . Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon , exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments . Tin formed a valuable export good , initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries . Lead was usually mined as a by @-@ product of mining for silver , with mines in Yorkshire , Durham and the north , as well as in Devon . Economically fragile , the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production . 
 = = = Trade , manufacturing and the towns = = = 
 = = = = Growth of English towns = = = = 
 After the end of the Anarchy , the number of small towns in England began to increase sharply . By 1297 , 120 new towns had been established , and in 1350 – by when the expansion had effectively ceased – there were around 500 towns in England . Many of these new towns were centrally planned : Richard I created Portsmouth , John founded Liverpool , and successive monarchs followed with Harwich , Stony Stratford , Dunstable , Royston , Baldock , Wokingham , Maidenhead and Reigate . The new towns were usually located with access to trade routes in mind , rather than defence , and the streets were laid out to make access to the town 's market convenient . A growing percentage of England 's population lived in urban areas ; estimates suggest that this rose from around 5 @.@ 5 % in 1086 to up to 10 % in 1377 . 
 London held a special status within the English economy . The nobility purchased and consumed many luxury goods and services in the capital , and as early as the 1170s the London markets were providing exotic products such as spices , incense , palm oil , gems , silks , furs and foreign weapons . London was also an important hub for industrial activity ; it had many blacksmiths making a wide range of goods , including decorative ironwork and early clocks . <unk> @-@ working , using English tin and lead , was also widespread in London during the period . The provincial towns also had a substantial number of trades by the end of the 13th century – a large town like Coventry , for example , contained over three hundred different specialist occupations , and a smaller town such as Durham could support some sixty different professions . The increasing wealth of the nobility and the church was reflected in the widespread building of cathedrals and other prestigious buildings in the larger towns , in turn making use of lead from English mines for roofing . 
 Land transport remained much more expensive than river or sea transport during the period . Many towns in this period , including York , Exeter and Lincoln , were linked to the oceans by navigable rivers and could act as seaports , with Bristol 's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade in wine with Gascony by the 13th century , but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time . Transport remained very costly in comparison to the overall price of products . By the 13th century , groups of common carriers ran carting businesses , and carting brokers existed in London to link traders and carters . These used the four major land routes crossing England : Ermine Street , the Fosse Way , Icknield Street and Watling Street . A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network . 
 In the 13th century , England was still primarily supplying raw materials for export to Europe , rather than finished or processed goods . There were some exceptions , such as very high @-@ quality cloths from Stamford and Lincoln , including the famous " Lincoln Scarlet " dyed cloth . Despite royal efforts to encourage it , however , barely any English cloth was being exported by 1347 . 
 = = = = Expansion of the money supply = = = = 
 There was a gradual reduction in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England ; under Henry II , only 30 boroughs were still able to use their own moneyers , and the tightening of controls continued throughout the 13th century . By the reign of Edward I there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the demand for new coins . The amount of money in circulation hugely increased in this period ; before the Norman invasion there had been around £ 50 @,@ 000 in circulation as coin , but by 1311 this had risen to more than £ 1 million . At any particular point in time , though , much of this currency might be being stored prior to being used to support military campaigns or to be sent overseas to meet payments , resulting in bursts of temporary deflation as coins ceased to circulate within the English economy . One physical consequence of the growth in the coinage was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers , being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled . 
 = = = = Rise of the guilds = = = = 
 The first English guilds emerged during the early 12th century . These guilds were fraternities of craftsmen that set out to manage their local affairs including " prices , workmanship , the welfare of its workers , and the suppression of interlopers and sharp practices " . Amongst these early guilds were the " guilds merchants " , who ran the local markets in towns and represented the merchant community in discussions with the crown . Other early guilds included the " craft guilds " , representing specific trades . By 1130 there were major weavers ' guilds in six English towns , as well as a fullers ' guild in Winchester . Over the following decades more guilds were created , often becoming increasingly involved in both local and national politics , although the guilds merchants were largely replaced by official groups established by new royal charters . 
 The craft guilds required relatively stable markets and a relative equality of income and opportunity amongst their members to function effectively . By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon . The first strains were seen in London , where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level , making it hard for craftsmen to both manufacture goods and trade in them , and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poorer craftsmen . As a result , under Edward III many guilds became companies or livery companies , chartered companies focusing on trade and finance , leaving the guild structures to represent the interests of the smaller , poorer manufacturers . 
 = = = = Merchants and the development of the charter fairs = = = = 
 The period also saw the development of charter fairs in England , which reached their heyday in the 13th century . From the 12th century onwards , many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair , usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting for two or three days . The practice increased in the next century and over 2 @,@ 200 charters were issued to markets and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270 . Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased : the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants , circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen . At the same time , wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices , wax , preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs , again bypassing the usual London merchants . 
 Some fairs grew into major international events , falling into a set sequence during the economic year , with the Stamford fair in Lent , St Ives ' in Easter , Boston 's in July , Winchester 's in September and Northampton 's in November , with the many smaller fairs falling in @-@ between . Although not as large as the famous Champagne fairs in France , these English " great fairs " were still huge events ; St Ives ' Great Fair , for example , drew merchants from Flanders , Brabant , Norway , Germany and France for a four @-@ week event each year , turning the normally small town into " a major commercial emporium " . 
 The structure of the fairs reflected the importance of foreign merchants in the English economy and by 1273 only one @-@ third of the English wool trade was actually controlled by English merchants . Between 1280 and 1320 the trade was primarily dominated by Italian merchants , but by the early 14th century German merchants had begun to present serious competition to the Italians . The Germans formed a self @-@ governing alliance of merchants in London called the " Hanse of the Steelyard " – the eventual Hanseatic League – and their role was confirmed under the Great Charter of 1303 , which exempted them from paying the customary tolls for foreign merchants . One response to this was the creation of the Company of the Staple , a group of merchants established in English @-@ held Calais in 1314 with royal approval , who were granted a monopoly on wool sales to Europe . 
 = = = = Jewish contribution to the English economy = = = = 
 The Jewish community in England continued to provide essential money @-@ lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the usury laws , and grew in the 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen . The Jewish community spread beyond London to eleven major English cities , primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints , all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority . By the time of the Anarchy and the reign of Stephen , the communities were flourishing and providing financial loans to the king . 
 Under Henry II , the Jewish financial community continued to grow richer still . All major towns had Jewish centres , and even smaller towns , such as Windsor , saw visits by travelling Jewish merchants . Henry II used the Jewish community as " instruments for the collection of money for the Crown " , and placed them under royal protection . The Jewish community at York lent extensively to fund the Cistercian order 's acquisition of land and prospered considerably . Some Jewish merchants grew extremely wealthy , Aaron of Lincoln so much that upon his death a special royal department had to be established to <unk> his financial holdings and affairs . 
 By the end of Henry 's reign the king ceased to borrow from the Jewish community and instead turned to an aggressive campaign of tallage taxation and fines . Financial and anti @-@ Semite violence grew under Richard I. After the massacre of the York community , in which numerous financial records were destroyed , seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews . After an initially peaceful start to John 's reign , the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community , imprisoning the wealthier members , including Isaac of Norwich , until a huge , new <unk> was paid . During the Baron 's War of 1215 – 17 , the Jews were subjected to fresh anti @-@ Semitic attacks . Henry III restored some order and Jewish money @-@ lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation . The Jewish community became poorer towards the end of the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by Edward I , being largely replaced by foreign merchants . 
 = = = Governance and taxation = = = 
 During the 12th century the Norman kings attempted to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion . After the invasion the king had enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands , the Anglo @-@ Saxon geld tax and fines . Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues , especially in order to pay for mercenary forces . One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system , and kings adopted the French feudal aid model , a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary ; another method was to exploit the scutage system , in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king . Taxation was also an option , although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions . Instead , a succession of kings created alternative land taxes , such as the tallage and carucage taxes . These were increasingly unpopular and , along with the feudal charges , were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215 . As part of the formalisation of the royal finances , Henry I created the Chancellor of the Exchequer , a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls , a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices . 
 Royal revenue streams still proved insufficient and from the middle of the 13th century there was a shift away from the earlier land @-@ based tax system towards one based on a mixture of indirect and direct taxation . At the same time , Henry III had introduced the practice of consulting with leading nobles on tax issues , leading to the system whereby the Parliament of England agreed on new taxes when required . In 1275 , the " Great and Ancient Custom " began to tax woollen products and hides , with the Great Charter of 1303 imposing additional levies on foreign merchants in England , with the poundage tax introduced in 1347 . In 1340 , the discredited tallage tax system was finally abolished by Edward III . Assessing the total impact of changes to royal revenues between 1086 and 1290 is difficult . At best , Edward I was struggling in 1300 to match in real terms the revenues that Henry II had enjoyed in 1100 , and considering the growth in the size of the English economy , the king 's share of the national income had dropped considerably . 
 In the English towns the burgage tenure for urban properties was established early on in the medieval period , and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services . Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls , <unk> for streets , and <unk> , a temporary tax for the repair of bridges . Combined with the lex <unk> , which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading , these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns . 
 The 12th century also saw a concerted attempt to curtail the remaining rights of unfree peasant workers and to set out their labour rents more explicitly in the form of the English Common Law . This process resulted in the Magna Carta explicitly authorising feudal landowners to settle law cases concerning feudal labour and fines through their own manorial courts rather than through the royal courts . These class relationships between lords and unfree peasants had complex economic implications . Peasant workers resented being unfree , but having continuing access to agricultural land was also important . Under those rare circumstances where peasants were offered a choice between freedom but no land , and continued servitude , not all chose freedom and a minority chose to remain in servitude on the land . Lords benefited economically from their control of the manorial courts and dominating the courts made it easier to manipulate land ownership and rights in their own favour when land became in particularly short supply at the end of this period . Many of the labour duties lords could compel from the local peasant communities became less useful over the period . Duties were fixed by custom , inflexible and understandably resented by the workers involved . As a result , by the end of the 13th century the productivity of such forced labour was significantly lower than that of free labour employed to do the same task . A number of lords responded by seeking to commute the duties of unfree peasants to cash alternatives , with the aim of hiring labour instead . 
 = = Mid @-@ medieval economic crisis – the Great Famine and the Black Death ( 1290 – 1350 ) = = 
 = = = Great Famine = = = 
 The Great Famine of 1315 began a number of acute crises in the English agrarian economy . The famine centred on a sequence of harvest failures in 1315 , 1316 and 1321 , combined with an outbreak of murrain , a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319 – 21 and the fatal ergotism , a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat . Many people died in the ensuing famine , and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses , dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children , although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations . Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged , sometimes on a mass scale . Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half , significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat , and food prices almost doubled , with grain prices particularly inflated . Food prices remained at similar levels for the next decade . Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather . 
 Various factors exacerbated the crisis . Economic growth had already begun to slow significantly in the years prior to the crisis and the English rural population was increasingly under economic stress , with around half the peasantry estimated to possess insufficient land to provide them with a secure livelihood . Where additional land was being brought into cultivation , or existing land cultivated more intensively , the soil may have become exhausted and useless . Bad weather also played an important part in the disaster ; 1315 – 16 and 1318 saw torrential rains and an incredibly cold winter , which in combination badly impacted on harvests and stored supplies . The rains of these years were followed by drought in the 1320s and another fierce winter in 1321 , complicating recovery . Disease , independent of the famine , was also high during the period , striking at the wealthier as well as the poorer classes . The commencement of war with France in 1337 only added to the economic difficulties . The Great Famine firmly reversed the population growth of the 12th and 13th centuries and left a domestic economy that was " profoundly shaken , but not destroyed " . 
 = = = Black Death = = = 
 The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348 , re @-@ occurring in waves during 1360 – 62 , 1368 – 69 , 1375 and more sporadically thereafter . The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life , between around 27 % mortality amongst the upper classes , to 40 – 70 % amongst the peasantry . Despite the very high loss of life , few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself , but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether . The medieval authorities did their best to respond in an organised fashion , but the economic disruption was immense . Building work ceased and many mining operations paused . In the short term , efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre @-@ epidemic working conditions . Coming on top of the previous years of famine , however , the longer @-@ term economic implications were profound . In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth , the English population would not begin to recover for over a century , despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence . The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture , wages and prices for the remainder of the medieval period . 
 = = Late medieval economic recovery ( 1350 – 1509 ) = = 
 The events of the crisis between 1290 and 1348 and the subsequent epidemics produced many challenges for the English economy . In the decades after the disaster , the economic and social issues arising from the Black Death combined with the costs of the Hundred Years War to produce the Peasants Revolt of 1381 . Although the revolt was suppressed , it undermined many of the vestiges of the feudal economic order , and the countryside became dominated by estates organised as farms , frequently owned or rented by the new economic class of the gentry . The English agricultural economy remained depressed throughout the 15th century ; growth at this time came from the greatly increased English cloth trade and manufacturing . The economic consequences of this varied considerably from region to region , but generally London , the South and the West prospered at the expense of the Eastern and the older cities . The role of merchants and trade became increasingly seen as important to the country , and usury gradually became more widely accepted , with English economic thinking increasingly influenced by Renaissance humanist theories . 
 = = = Governance and taxation = = = 
 Even before the end of the first outbreak of the Black Death , there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices , with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351 . The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose , putting pressure on the landed classes , and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production , trading and retailing . A rising amount of the royal courts ' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70 % by the 1370s . Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts , leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims . With the wages of the lower classes still rising , the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363 . These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high @-@ status clothes , and reflected the significance of the consumption of high @-@ quality breads , ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period . 
 The 1370s also saw the government facing difficulties in funding the war with France . The impact of the Hundred Years War on the English economy as a whole remains uncertain ; one suggestion is that the high taxation required to pay for the conflict " shrunk and depleted " the English economy , whilst others have argued for a more modest or even neutral economic impact for the war . The English government clearly found it difficult to pay for its army and from 1377 turned to a new system of poll taxes , aiming to spread the costs of taxation across the entirety of English society . 
 = = = = Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 = = = = 
 One result of the economic and political tensions was the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 , in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels . The rebels had many demands , including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents . The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn ; up to 7 @,@ 000 rebels were executed in the aftermath . As a result of the revolt , parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade , drawing 80 % of tax revenues from the exports of wool . Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422 , although they reduced them in later years . As a result , successive monarchs found that their tax revenues were uncertain , and Henry VI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century . England 's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation , including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of Henry VII . 
 = = = Agriculture , fishing and mining = = = 
 = = = = Collapse of the demesne and the creation of the farming system = = = = 
 The agricultural sector of the English economy , still by far the largest , was transformed by the Black Death . With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death , wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century . As their incomes increased , labourers ' living conditions and diet improved steadily . A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye , and to replace bread in their diet with more meat , had been apparent since before the Black Death , but intensified during this later period . Nonetheless , England 's much smaller population needed less food and the demand for agricultural products fell . The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult . Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and wage costs increased ; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts , fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381 . Despite attempts to increase money rents , by the end of the 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining , with revenues falling as much as 55 % between the 1380s and 1420s . 
 Noble and church landowners responded in various ways . They began to invest significantly less in agriculture and land was increasingly taken out of production altogether . In some cases entire settlements were abandoned , and nearly 1 @,@ 500 villages were lost during this period . Landowners also abandoned the system of direct management of their demesne lands , which had begun back in the 1180s , and turned instead to " farming " out large blocks of land for fixed money rents . Initially , livestock and land were rented out together under " stock and lease " contracts , but this was found to be increasingly impractical and contracts for farms became centred purely on land . Many of the rights to church parish tithes were also " farmed " out in exchange for fixed rents . This process was encouraged by the trend for tithe revenues being increasing " appropriated " by central church authorities , rather than being used to support local clergy : around 39 % of parish tithes had been centralised in this way by 1535 . As the major estates transformed , a new economic grouping , the gentry , became evident , many of them benefiting from the opportunities of the farming system . Land distribution remained heavily unequal ; estimates suggest that the English nobility owned 20 % of English lands , the Church and Crown 33 % , the gentry 25 % , and the remainder was owned by peasant farmers . Agriculture itself continued to innovate , and the loss of many English oxen to the murrain sickness in the crisis increased the number of horses used to plough fields in the 14th century , a significant improvement on older methods . 
 = = = = Forests , fishing and mining = = = = 
 The royal forests continued to diminish in size and decline in economic importance in the years after the Black Death . Royal enforcement of forest rights and laws became harder after 1348 and certainly after 1381 , and by the 15th century the royal forests were a " shadow of their former selves " in size and economic significance . In contrast , the English fishing industry continued to grow , and by the 15th century domestic merchants and financiers owned fleets of up to a hundred fishing vessels operating from key ports . Herring remained a key fishing catch , although as demand for herring declined with rising prosperity , the fleets began to focus instead on cod and other deep @-@ sea fish from the Icelandic waters . Despite being critical to the fishing industry , salt production in England diminished in the 15th century due to competition from French producers . The use of expensive freshwater fish ponds on estates began to decline during this period , as more of the gentry and nobility opted to purchase freshwater fish from commercial river fisheries . 
 Mining generally performed well at the end of the medieval period , helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods . Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself , leading to a doubling of prices . Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically , but picked up again over the next few years . By the turn of the 16th century , the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline , leading to the commencement of bell and surface mining to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century . Lead mining increased , and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500 . Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death , and coal production declined as a result , remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless , some coal production was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century . Iron production continued to increase ; the Weald in the South @-@ East began to make increased use of water @-@ power , and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England 's main iron @-@ producing region . The first blast furnace in England , a major technical step forward in metal smelting , was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald . 
 = = = Trade , manufacturing and the towns = = = 
 = = = = Shrinking towns = = = = 
 The percentage of England 's population living in towns continued to grow but in absolute terms English towns shrunk significantly as a consequence of the Black Death , especially in the formerly prosperous east . The importance of England 's Eastern ports declined over the period , as trade from London and the South @-@ West increased in relative significance . Increasingly elaborate road networks were built across England , some involving the construction of up to thirty bridges to cross rivers and other obstacles . Nonetheless , it remained cheaper to move goods by water , and consequently timber was brought to London from as far away as the Baltic , and stone from Caen brought over the Channel to the South of England . Shipbuilding , particular in the South @-@ West , became a major industry for the first time and investment in trading ships such as cogs was probably the single biggest form of late medieval investment in England . 
 = = = = Rise of the cloth trade = = = = 
 Cloth manufactured in England increasingly dominated European markets during the 15th and early 16th centuries . England exported almost no cloth at all in 1347 , but by 1400 around 40 @,@ 000 cloths a year were being exported – the trade reached its first peak in 1447 when exports reached 60 @,@ 000 . Trade fell slightly during the serious depression of the mid @-@ 15th century , but picked up again and reached 130 @,@ 000 cloths a year by the 1540s . The centres of weaving in England shifted westwards towards the Stour Valley , the West Riding , the Cotswolds and Exeter , away from the former weaving centres in York , Coventry and Norwich . 
 The wool and cloth trade was primarily now being run by English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners . Increasingly , the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South @-@ West . By the 1360s , 66 – 75 % of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80 % ; London managed around 50 % of these exports in 1400 , and as much as 83 % of wool and cloth exports by 1540 . The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London , such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London , continued , and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers , rather than the other way around . <unk> grew during the period , and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities . 
 There were some reversals . The attempts of English merchants to break through the Hanseatic league directly into the Baltic markets failed in the domestic political chaos of the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s and 1470s . The wine trade with Gascony fell by half during the war with France , and the eventual loss of the province brought an end to the English domination of the business and temporary disruption to Bristol 's prosperity until wines began to be imported through the city a few years later . Indeed , the disruption to both the Baltic and the Gascon trade contributed to a sharp reduction in the consumption of furs and wine by the English gentry and nobility during the 15th century . 
 There were advances in manufacturing , especially in the South and West . Despite some French attacks , the war created much coastal prosperity thanks to the huge expenditure on shipbuilding during the war , and the South @-@ West also became a centre for English piracy against foreign vessels . <unk> continued to grow , and in particular pewter working , which generated exports second only to cloth . By the 15th century pewter working in London was a large industry , with a hundred pewter workers recorded in London alone , and pewter working had also spread from the capital to eleven major cities across England . London goldsmithing remained significant but saw relatively little growth , with around 150 goldsmiths working in London during the period . Iron @-@ working continued to expand and in 1509 the first cast @-@ iron cannon was made in England . This was reflected in the rapid growth in the number of iron @-@ working guilds , from three in 1300 to fourteen by 1422 . 
 The result was a substantial influx of money that in turn encouraged the import of manufactured luxury goods ; by 1391 shipments from abroad routinely included " ivory , mirrors , <unk> , armour , paper ... , painted clothes , spectacles , tin images , razors , calamine , treacle , sugar @-@ candy , marking irons , patens ... , ox @-@ horns and quantities of wainscot " . Imported spices now formed a part of almost all noble and gentry diets , with the quantities being consumed varying according to the wealth of the household . The English government was also importing large quantities of raw materials , including copper , for manufacturing weapons . Many major landowners tended to focus their efforts on maintaining a single major castle or house rather than the dozens a century before , but these were usually decorated much more luxurious than previously . Major merchants ' dwellings , too , were more lavish than in previous years . 
 = = = = Decline of the fair system = = = = 
 Towards the end of the 14th century , the position of fairs began to decline . The larger merchants , particularly in London , began to establish direct links with the larger landowners such as the nobility and the church ; rather than the landowner buying from a chartered fair , they would buy directly from the merchant . Meanwhile , the growth of the indigenous England merchant class in the major cities , especially London , gradually crowded out the foreign merchants upon whom the great chartered fairs had largely depended . The crown 's control over trade in the towns , especially the emerging newer towns towards the end of the 15th century that lacked central civic government , was increasingly weaker , making chartered status less relevant as more trade occurred from private properties and took place all year around . Nonetheless , the great fairs remained of importance well into the 15th century , as illustrated by their role in exchanging money , regional commerce and in providing choice for individual consumers . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 The first studies into the medieval economy of England began in the 1880s , principally around the work of English jurist and historian Frederic Maitland . This scholarship , drawing extensively on documents such as the Domesday Book and the Magna Carta , became known as the " Whiggish " view of economic history , focusing on law and government . Late Victorian writers argued that change in the English medieval economy stemmed primarily from the towns and cities , leading to a progressive and universalist interpretation of development over the period , focusing on trade and commerce . Influenced by the evolution of Norman laws , Maitland argued that there was a clear discontinuity between the Anglo @-@ Saxon and Norman economic systems . 
 In the 1930s the Whiggish view of the English economy was challenged by a group of scholars at the University of Cambridge , led by Eileen Power . Power and her colleagues widened the focus of study from legal and government documents to include " agrarian , archaeological , demographic , settlement , landscape and urban " evidence . This was combined with a neo @-@ positivist and econometric leaning that was at odds with the older Victorian tradition in the subject . Power died in 1940 , and her student and later husband , Michael Postan took forward their work , coming to dominate the post @-@ war field . Postan argued that demography was the principal driving force in the medieval English economy . In a distinctly Malthusian fashion , Postan proposed that the English agrarian economy saw little technical development during the period and by the early 14th century was unable to support the growing population , leading to inevitable famines and economic depression as the population came back into balance with land resources . Postan began the trend towards stressing continuities between the pre- and post @-@ invasion economies , aided by fresh evidence emerging from the use of archaeological techniques to understand the medieval economy from the 1950s onwards . 
 A Marxist critique of Postan emerged from the 1950s onwards , captured in the academic journal Past & Present . This school of thought agreed that the agrarian economy was central to medieval England , but argued that agrarian issues had less to do with demography than with the mode of production and feudal class relations . In this model the English economy entered the crisis of the early 14th century because of the struggles between landlords and peasant for resources and excessive extraction of rents by the nobility . Similar issues underpinned the Peasants Revolt of 1381 and later tax rebellions . Historians such as Frank Stenton developed the " honour " as a unit of economic analysis and a focus for understanding feudal relations in peasant communities ; Rodney Hilton developed the idea of the rise of the gentry as a key feature for understanding the late medieval period . 
 Fresh work in the 1970s and 1980s challenged both Postan 's and Marxist approaches to the medieval economy . Local studies of medieval economics , often in considerable detail and fusing new archaeological techniques and rescue archaeology with historical sources , often ran counter to their broader interpretations of change and development . The degree to which feudalism really existed and operated in England after the initial years of the invasion was thrown into considerable doubt , with historians such as David Crouch arguing that it existed primarily as a legal and fiscal model , rather than an actual economic system . Sociological and anthropological studies of contemporary economies , including the work of Ester Boserup showed many flaws with Postan 's key assumptions about demography and land use . The current academic preference is to see the English medieval economy as an " overlapping network of diverse communities " , in which active local choices and decisions are the result of independent agency , rather than historical determinism .

 The Østensjø Line opened as a light rail on 18 December 1923 . On 29 October 1967 , the upgraded metro standard was first used , and the line was connected to the Oslo Metro . A month later , the extension to Skullerud opened . The work with building the extension between Skullerud and Mortensrud was originally planned to start in 1992 , with completion planned for 1994 . However , construction did not start until 1995 . The 2 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) extension is built to allow speeds of 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) , and represents a considerable longer distance between stations than what is normal on the network . Most of the section is in tunnels , though there are also two viaducts . The extension ( without the new station ) cost NOK 215 million . The line runs somewhat south of the station , allowing space to line up trains , and for future further extension of the line . 
 The station was taken into use on 24 November 1997 , but not officially opened until 4 January 1998 . On the day of the official opening , the bus terminal was taken into use . The station costs NOK 35 million . At the time , it was estimated to have about 6000 daily users — both boarding and disembarking , including the bus terminal .

 The Vorbunker ( upper bunker or forward bunker ) was an underground concrete structure originally intended to be a temporary air @-@ raid shelter for Adolf Hitler and his guards and servants . It was located behind the large reception hall that was added onto the old Reich Chancellery , in Berlin , Germany , in 1936 . The bunker was officially called the " Reich Chancellery Air @-@ Raid Shelter " until 1943 , when the complex was expanded with the addition of the Führerbunker , located one level below . On 16 January 1945 , Hitler moved into the Führerbunker . He was joined by his senior staff , including Martin Bormann . Later , Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels moved into the Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker . The Goebbels family lived in the Vorbunker until their deaths on 1 May 1945 .

 In 1933 , Adolf Hitler decided to expand the Reich Chancellery ( Reichskanzlei ) , which he considered too small for his needs . On 21 July 1935 , Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall ( that could also be used as a ballroom ) to be built onto the old Chancellery . The drawings were unique because of the large cellar that led a further one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half meters down to a bunker which later became known as the Vorbunker . 
 The Vorbunker 's roof was 1 @.@ 6 meters ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) thick , twice as thick as that of the bunker underneath the nearby Air Ministry building . The thick walls of the Vorbunker supported the weight of the reception hall overhead . It had three entry points , to the north , west , and south . Construction was completed in 1936 . It had 12 rooms branching out from a single corridor . 
 The Führerbunker was built by the Hochtief company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in Berlin . It was finished by 1944 and was connected to the Vorbunker by a stairway set at right angles ( not a spiral staircase ) . The two bunkers could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door . A permanent guard detail was posted by the steel door . The Führerbunker was located about 8 @.@ 5 metres ( 28 ft ) beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery , 120 meters ( 390 ft ) north of the new Reich Chancellery building at Voßstraße 6 . The Führerbunker was located 2 @.@ 5 meters lower than the Vorbunker and to the west @-@ southwest of it . The accommodations for Hitler were moved to the Führerbunker , and by February 1945 it had been decorated with high @-@ quality furniture taken from the Chancellery , along with several framed oil paintings .

 The first air @-@ raid drills for the Berlin central government district , which included the Reich Chancellery , occurred in the autumn of 1937 . The protocol for the drills stated , in part : 
 To carry out the air raid drills , a precise regulation is required for the three office buildings , Wilhelmstraße 77 , Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1 ... The officials and residents of Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1 can go to the substitute shelters in Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1 . The inhabitants of the Reich Chancellor House , Wilhelmstraße 77 , will use the shelter under the ballroom . 
 The only residents of Wilhelmstraße 77 were Hitler and his bodyguards , adjutants , orderlies and servants . It is unknown if the Vorbunker was used before January 1945 . Hitler transferred his headquarters to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 , where he ( along with his influential private secretary , Reichsleiter Martin Bormann and others ) remained until the end of April . Thereafter , the Vorbunker was used by various military officers and housed men from Hitler 's personal bodyguard . In April 1945 , as the Battle in Berlin raged on , Joseph Goebbels showed his strong support for Hitler by moving his family into the Vorbunker . He occupied a room in the Führerbunker which had recently been vacated by Hitler 's personal physician , Theodor Morell . Two rooms in the Vorbunker were used for food supply . <unk> <unk> , Hitler 's personal cook / dietitian , made meals in the kitchen , which was equipped with a refrigerator and a wine store . 
 On the evening of 1 May 1945 , Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist , Helmut Kunz , to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious , an ampule of cyanide could be crushed in each of their mouths . According to Kunz 's later testimony , he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Stumpfegger , Hitler 's personal doctor , who administered the cyanide . 
 Afterwards , Goebbels and his wife went up the stairs to ground level and through the Führerbunker 's emergency exit to the bombed @-@ out garden behind the Reich Chancellery . There are several different accounts on what followed . According to one account , Goebbels shot his wife and then himself . Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards by Goebbels ' SS adjutant , Günther Schwägermann . Schwägermann testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden . He waited in the stairwell and heard the " shots " sound . Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and outside . There he saw the lifeless bodies of the couple . Following Joseph Goebbels ' prior order , Schwägermann told an SS soldier to make sure Goebbels ' was dead . The soldier fired into Goebbels ' body , which did not move . The bodies were then doused with petrol , but the remains were only partially burned and not buried . 
 At 01 : 00 on 2 May , the Soviets picked up a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps requesting a cease @-@ fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge . Early in the morning of 2 May , the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery . General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling , the commander of the Berlin Defense Area , surrendered with his staff at 06 : 00 . Down in the Führerbunker , Chief of the Army General Staff General Hans Krebs and Hitler 's Chief Adjutant Generalleutnant Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head . Johannes Hentschel , the master electro @-@ mechanic for the bunker complex , stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left , as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water . He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09 : 00 on 2 May . The bodies of Goebbels six children were discovered on 3 May . They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker ; the clear mark of cyanide appeared on their faces .

 The ruins of both Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 as part of an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany . The bunker complex largely survived , although some areas were partially flooded . In December 1947 the Soviets tried to blow up the bunkers , but only the separation walls were damaged . In 1959 the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery , including the bunker complex . In 1974 , 1 @.@ 5 meters ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) of water was pumped from inside the bunkers , and the East Germany Stasi conducted a survey of the interior of the Vorbunker and took external measurements of the Führerbunker . Since it was near the Berlin Wall , the site was undeveloped and neglected until after reunification . 
 During the construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988 – 89 , several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews . In April 1988 , the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo @-@ journalists . Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery . The interior floor of the Vorbunker was covered with a muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years . Old empty wine bottles were found on the floor of the kitchen and wine store room . Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children . At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker . However , the men could go no further than the mid @-@ landing , as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947 . After these inspections , work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex . The Vorbunker 's top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down . The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable . The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker ( which had been in the Chancellery gardens ) was occupied by a car park . 
 On 8 June 2006 , during the lead @-@ up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup , an information board was installed to mark the location of the bunker complex . Hitler 's bodyguard , Rochus Misch , one of the last people living who was in the bunker complex at the time of Hitler 's suicide , was on hand for the ceremony . The board , including a schematic diagram , can be found at the corner of In den <unk> and Gertrud @-@ <unk> @-@ Straße , two small streets about three minutes ' walk from Potsdamer Platz . 
 = Francis Amasa Walker = 
 Francis Amasa Walker ( July 2 , 1840 – January 5 , 1897 ) was an American economist , statistician , journalist , educator , academic administrator , and military officer in the Union Army . 
 Walker was born into a prominent Boston family , the son of the economist and politician Amasa Walker , and he graduated from Amherst College at the age of 20 . He received a commission to join the 15th Massachusetts Infantry and quickly rose through the ranks as an assistant adjutant general . Walker fought in the Peninsula Campaign and was wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville but subsequently participated in the Bristoe , Overland , and Richmond @-@ Petersburg Campaigns before being captured by Confederate forces and held at the infamous Libby Prison . In July 1866 , he was nominated by President Andrew Johnson and confirmed by the United States Senate for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general United States Volunteers , to rank from March 13 , 1865 , when he was age 24 . 
 Following the war , Walker served on the editorial staff of the Springfield Republican before using his family and military connections to gain appointment as the Chief of the Bureau of Statistics from 1869 to 1870 and Superintendent of the 1870 census where he published an award @-@ winning Statistical Atlas visualizing the data for the first time . He joined Yale University 's Sheffield Scientific School as a professor of political economy in 1872 and rose to international prominence serving as a chief member of the 1876 Philadelphia Exposition , American representative to the 1878 International Monetary Conference , President of the American Statistical Association in 1882 , and inaugural President of the American Economic Association in 1886 , and vice president of the National Academy of Sciences in 1890 . Walker also led the 1880 census which resulted in a twenty @-@ two volume census , cementing Walker 's reputation as the nation 's preeminent statistician . 
 As an economist , Walker debunked the wage @-@ fund doctrine and engaged in a prominent scholarly debate with Henry George on land , rent , and taxes . Walker argued in support of bimetallism and although he was an opponent of the nascent socialist movement , he argued that obligations existed between the employer and the employed . He published his International Bimetallism at the height of the 1896 presidential election campaign in which economic issues were prominent . Walker was a prolific writer , authoring ten books on political economy and military history . In recognition of his contributions to economic theory , beginning in 1947 , the American Economic Association recognized the lifetime achievement of an individual economist with a " Francis A. Walker Medal " . 
 Walker accepted the presidency of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1881 , a position he held for fifteen years until his death . During his tenure , he placed the institution on more stable financial footing by aggressively fund @-@ raising and securing grants from the Massachusetts government , implemented many curricular reforms , oversaw the launch of new academic programs , and expanded the size of the Boston campus , faculty , and student enrollments . MIT 's Walker Memorial Hall , a former students ' clubhouse and one of the original buildings on the Charles River campus , was dedicated to him in 1916 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Walker was born in Boston , Massachusetts , the youngest son of Hanna ( née Ambrose ) and Amasa Walker , a prominent economist and state politician . The Walkers had three children , Emma ( born 1835 ) , Robert ( born 1837 ) , and Francis . Because the Walkers ' next @-@ door neighbor was Oliver Wendell Holmes , Sr. , the junior Walker and junior Holmes were playmates as young children and renewed their friendship later in life . The family moved from Boston to North Brookfield , Massachusetts in 1843 and remained there . As a boy he had both a noted temper as well as a magnetic personality . 
 Beginning his schooling at the age of seven , Walker studied Latin at various private and public schools in Brookfield before being sent to the Leicester Academy when he was twelve . He completed his college preparation by the time he was fourteen and spent another year studying Greek and Latin under the future suffragist and abolitionist Lucy Stone , and entered Amherst College at the age of fifteen . Although he had planned to matriculate at Harvard after his first year at Amherst , Walker 's father believed his son was too young to enter the larger college and insisted he remain at Amherst . While he had entered with the class of 1859 , Walker became ill during his first year there and fell back a year . He was a member of the Delta Kappa and Athenian societies as a freshman , joined and withdrew from Alpha Sigma Phi as a sophomore on account of " <unk> " , and finally joined Delta Kappa Epsilon . As a student , Walker was awarded the Sweetser Essay Prize and the Hardy Prize for extemporaneous speaking . He graduated in 1860 as Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in law . After graduation , he joined the law firm of Charles Devens and George Frisbie Hoar in Worcester , Massachusetts .

 As tensions between the North and South increased over the winter of 1860 – 1861 , Walker equipped himself and began drilling with Major Devens ' 3rd Battalion of Rifles in Worcester and New York . Despite his older brother Robert serving in the 34th Massachusetts Infantry , his father objected to his youngest son mobilizing with the first wave of volunteers . Walker returned to Worcester but began to lobby William Schouler and Governor John Andrew to grant him a commission as a second lieutenant under Devens ' command of the 15th Massachusetts . Following his 21st birthday and the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 , Walker secured the consent of his father to join the war effort as well as assurances by Devens that he would receive an officer 's commission . However , the lieutenancy never materialized and Devens instead offered Walker an appointment as a sergeant major , which he assumed on August 1 , 1861 , after re @-@ tailoring his previously ordered lieutenant 's uniform to reflect his enlisted status . However , by September 14 , 1861 , Walker had been recommended by Devens and reassigned to Brig. Gen. Darius N. Couch as assistant adjutant general and promoted to captain . Walker remained in Washington , D.C. , over the winter of 1861 – 1862 and did not see combat until May 1862 at the Battle of Williamsburg . Walker also served at Seven Pines as well as at the Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula Campaign in the summer of 1862 under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan in the Army of the Potomac . 
 = = = Second Army Corps = = = 
 Walker remained at the Berkeley Plantation until his promotion on August 11 to major and transferral with General Couch to the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac . Although the II Corps later saw action at the battles of Antietam and Fredericksburg , the latter being under the new command of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside , Walker and the Corps did not join <unk> 's Mud March over the winter . Walker was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 1 , 1863 , and remained with the II Corps . He fought the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863 , where his hand and wrist were shattered and neck lacerated by an exploding shell . A record of the 1880 Census indicated that he had " compound fracture of the metacarpal bones of the left hand resulting in permanent extension of his hand . " Later in 1896 , as the President of MIT , he would receive one of the first radiographs in the country , which documented the extent of the damage to his hand . He did not return to service until August 1863 . Walker participated in the Bristoe Campaign and narrowly escaped encirclement during the Battle of Bristoe Station before withdrawing and encamping near the Berry Hill Plantation for much of the winter and spending some leave in the North . 
 After extensive reorganization during the winter of 1863 – 1864 , Walker and the Army of the Potomac fought in the Overland Campaign through May and June 1864 . The Battle of Cold Harbor in early June took a substantial toll on the ranks of the II Corps and Walker injured his knee during the battle . In the ensuing Richmond @-@ Petersburg Campaign , Walker was appointed a brevet colonel . However , on August 25 , 1864 , as he rode to find Maj. Gen. John Gibbon at the front during the Second Battle of Ream 's Station , Walker was surrounded and captured by the 11th Georgia Infantry . On August 27 , Walker was able to escape from a marching prisoner column with another prisoner but was recaptured by the 51st North Carolina Infantry after trying to swim across the Appomattox River and nearly drowning . After being held as a prisoner in Petersburg , he was transferred to the infamous Libby Prison in Richmond , where his older brother was also held . In October 1864 , Walker was released with thirty other prisoners as a part of an exchange . 
 Walker returned to North Brookfield to recuperate and resigned his commission on January 8 , 1865 , as a result of his injuries and health . At the end of the war , Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock recommended that Walker be brevetted as a brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers in recognition of his meritorious services during the war and especially his gallant conduct at Chancellorsville . On July 9 , 1866 , Walker was nominated by President Andrew Johnson for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general , U.S. Volunteers , to rank from March 13 , 1865 ( when he was age 24 ) , for gallant conduct at the battle of Chancellorsville and meritorious services during the war . The U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23 , 1866 . 
 After the war , Walker became a companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States . 
 = = Postbellum activity = = 
 By late spring 1865 , Walker regained sufficient strength and began to assist his father by lecturing on political economy at Amherst as well as assisting him in the preparation of The Science of Wealth . He also taught Latin , Greek , and mathematics at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton , Massachusetts until being offered an editorial position at the Springfield Republican by Samuel Bowles . At the Republican , Walker wrote on Reconstruction era politics , railroad regulation , and representation . 
 = = = 1870 Census = = = 
 While his editorial career was moving forward , Walker called upon his own as well as his father 's political contacts to secure an appointment under David Ames Wells as the Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Statistics and Deputy Special Commissioner of Internal Revenue in January 1869 . On January 29 , 1869 , Major General J.D. Cox , who had also previously served in McClellan 's army and was currently the Secretary of the Interior under President Grant 's administration , notified the twenty @-@ nine @-@ year @-@ old Walker that he was being nominated to become the Superintendent of the 1870 census . After he was confirmed by the Senate , Walker sought to strike a moderate reformist position free from the inefficient and unscientific methods of the 1850 and 1860 censuses ; however , the required legislation was not passed and the census proceeded under the rules governing previous collections . Among the problems facing Walker included a lack of authority to determine , enforce , or control the marshals ' personnel , methods , or timing all of which were regularly manipulated by local political interests . Additionally , the 1870 census would not only occur five years after Civil War but would also be the first in which emancipated African Americans would be fully counted in the census . 
 Owing to the confluence of these problems , the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism , and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker 's health during the spring of 1871 . Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall , despite an offer from The New York Times to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $ 8 @,@ 000 ( $ 143 @,@ 300 in 2009 ) , accepted Secretary Columbus Delano 's offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871 . The appointment was simultaneously a go @-@ around to continue to fund Walker 's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress ' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal @-@ ridden predecessor . Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter , culminating in the publication of the Statistical Atlas of the United States that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census . The Atlas won him praise from both the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as well as a First Class medal from the International Geographical Congress . 
 = = = Indian Bureau = = = 
 Despite his Census @-@ related efforts , Walker did not neglect his obligations as Indian Affairs Superintendent . In the post @-@ war era , the government redoubled efforts to issue western land grants to settlers , ranchers , miners , and railroads which only served to heighten tensions with the Native American tribes who had already been displaced from their homelands as well as stripped of their ostensible sovereignty following an 1872 act of Congress . The U.S. Army and various Indian tribes engaged in open hostilities throughout the 1860s and 1870s . Walker harbored no benevolence for the Indians , characterizing them as " <unk> , " " garrulous , " " lazy , " " cowardly in battle , " and " beggar @-@ like " even after an expedition along the Platte River to meet various chieftains . Walker echoed Grant 's recommendation that the Native Americans be secured on reservations of limited mineral or agricultural value so they could be educated and reformed . In November 1872 , an eruption of settler @-@ Indian violence in Oregon known as the Modoc War hastened Walker 's disinterest in the position and he resigned as Commissioner on December 26 , 1872 to take a faculty position at Yale . However , Walker also criticized his successors ' graft , corruption , and abuse of power in subsequent years and published The Indian Question in 1874 . 
 = = = Other engagements = = = 
 1876 was a busy year for Walker . Henry Brooks Adams sought to recruit Walker to be the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of his Boston Post after failing to recruit Horace White and Charles <unk> for the position . That spring , Walker was nominated to run for the Secretary of the State of Connecticut , running on a platform that would later be embodied by the " <unk> " movement , but ultimately lost to Marvin H. Sanger by a margin of 7 @,@ 200 votes out of 99 @,@ 000 cast . In the summer , the faculty of Amherst attempted to recruit him to become the President , but the position went instead to the Rev. Julius Hawley Seelye to appease the more conservative trustees . 
 Walker 's rise to prominence was further accelerated by his appointment by Charles Francis Adams , Jr. as the Chief of the Bureau of Awards at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia . Previous world expositions in Europe were fraught with national factionalism and a superabundance of awards . Walker imposed a much leaner operation replacing juries with judges and being more selective in awarding prizes . Walker won formal international recognition when he was named a " Knight Commander " by Sweden and Norway and a " <unk> " by Spain . He was also invited to serve as Assistant Commissioner General for the 1878 Paris Exposition . The Centennial Exposition affected Walker 's later career by greatly increasing his interest in technical education as well as introducing him to MIT President John D. Runkle and Treasurer John C. Cummings . 
 = = = 1880 Census = = = 
 Walker accepted a re @-@ appointment as the superintendent of the 1880 Census because a new law , spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield , had been passed to allow him to appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence . Notably , the 1880 Census 's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker 's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated . Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work . The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty @-@ two volumes , was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time , and definitively established Walker 's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation . The Census was again delayed as a result of its size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance . Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated . Following Garfield 's 1880 election , there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior , but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead . 
 = = Academic career = = 
 As his Census obligations diminished in 1872 , Walker reconsidered becoming an editorialist and even briefly entertained the idea of becoming a shoe manufacturer with his brother @-@ in @-@ law back in North Brookfield . However , in October 1872 , he was unanimously offered to fill Daniel Coit Gilman 's vacated post at Yale 's recently established Sheffield Scientific School led by the mineralogist George Jarvis Brush . While at Yale , Walker served as a member of the School Committee at New Haven ( 1877 – 1880 ) and the Connecticut Board of Education ( 1878 – 1881 ) . 
 Walker was awarded honorary or ad eundem degrees from Amherst ( M.A. 1863 , Ph.D. 1875 , LL.D. 1882 ) , Yale ( M.A. 1873 , LL.D. 1882 ) , Harvard ( LL.D. 1883 ) , Columbia ( LL.D. 1887 ) , St. Andrews ( LL.D. 1888 ) , Dublin ( LL.D. 1892 ) , Halle ( Ph.D. 1894 ) , and Edinburgh ( LL.D. 1896 ) . He was elected as an honorary member of the Royal Statistical Society in 1875 and the National Academy of Sciences in 1878 where he served as the vice president from 1890 until his death . In addition to being elected as the president of the American Statistical Association in 1882 , he helped found and launch the International Statistical Institute in 1885 and was named its " President @-@ adjoint " in 1893 . Walker also served as the inaugural president of the American Economic Association from 1885 to 1892 . He took appointments as a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University ( its first professor of economics ) from 1877 to 1879 , lecturer at Harvard University in 1882 , 1883 , and 1896 , and trustee at Amherst College from 1879 to 1889 . 
 = = = Wages @-@ fund theory = = = 
 Walker 's scholarly contributions are widely recognized as having broadened , liberalized , and modernized economic and statistical theory with his contributions to wages , wealth distribution , money , and social economics . Although his arguments presage both neoclassical economics and <unk> , he is not readily classified into either . As a Professor of Political Economy , his first major scholarly contribution was on his The Wages Question which set out to debunk the wage @-@ fund doctrine as well as address the then @-@ radical notion of obligations between the employer and the employed . His theory of wage distribution later came to be known as residual theory and set the stage for contributions by John Bates Clark on the marginal productivity theory . Despite Walker 's advocacy of profit sharing and expansion of educational opportunities using trade and industrial schools , he was an avowed opponent of the nascent socialist movement and published critiques of Edward Bellamy 's popular novel Looking Backward . 
 = = = Henry George debates = = = 
 Beginning in 1879 , Walker and the political economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents , land , money , and taxes . Based on a series of lectures delivered at Harvard , Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George 's 1879 Progress and Poverty . Walker 's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation , but rather constriction of the money supply . Walker also criticized George 's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient . 
 = = = Bimetallism = = = 
 In August 1878 , Walker represented the United States at the third International Monetary Conference in Paris while also attending the 1878 Exposition . Not only were the attempts by the United States to re @-@ establish an international silver standard defeated , but Walker also had to scramble to complete the report on the Exposition in only four days . Although he returned to the U.S. in October disheartened by the failure of the conference and exhausted by his obligations at the Exposition , the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation . 
 Walker published International Bimetallism in 1896 roundly critiquing the demonetization of silver out of political pressure and the impact of this change on prices and profits as well as worker employment and wages . Walker 's reputation and position on the issue isolated him among public figures and made him a target in the press . The book was published in the midst of the 1896 presidential election pitting populist " silver " candidate William Jennings Bryan against the capitalist " gold " candidate William McKinley and the competing interpretations of the nation 's leading economist 's stance on the issue became a political football during the campaign . The presidential candidate and economist were not close allies as Walker advocated a double standard by all leading financial nations while Bryan argued for the United States ' unilateral shift to a silver standard . The rift was heightened by the east @-@ west divide on the issue as well as Walker 's general distaste for political populism ; Walker 's position was supported by conservative bankers and statesmen like Henry Lee Higginson , George F. Hoar , John M. Forbes , and Henry Cabot Lodge .

 Political Economy , the first edition published in 1883 , was one of the most widely used textbooks of the 19th century as a component of the American Science Series . Robert Solow criticized the third edition ( 1888 ) for being devoid of facts , figures , and mostly full of off @-@ the @-@ cuff judgments on the practices and capacities of native Americans and immigrants , but generally embodying the state of the art of economics at the time . 
 Walker also took an interest in demographics later in his career , particularly towards the issues of immigration and birth rates . He published The Growth of the United States in 1882 and Restriction on Immigration in 1896 arguing for increasing restrictions out of concern about the diminished industrial and intellectual capacity of the most recent wave of immigrants . Walker also argued that unrestricted immigration was the major reason behind nineteenth @-@ century native American fertility decline , but while the argument was politically popular and became widely accepted in mobilizing restrictions on immigration , it rested upon a surprisingly facile statistical analysis that was later refuted . Writing on immigrants from southern Italy , Hungary , Austria , and Russia in The Atlantic , Walker claimed , 
 " The entrance into our political , social , and industrial life of such vast masses of peasantry , degraded below our utmost conceptions , is a matter which no intelligent patriot can look upon without the gravest apprehension and alarm . These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement . They have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which made it comparatively easy to deal with the immigration of the olden time . They are beaten men from beaten races ; representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence . Centuries are against them , as centuries were on the side of those who formerly came to us . They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which fit men to take up readily and easily the problem of self @-@ care and self @-@ government , such as belong to those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak @-@ trees of old Germany to make laws and choose chieftains . " 
 Based upon his experiences in the military , Walker published two books describing the history of the Second Army Corps ( 1886 ) as well as a biography of General Winfield Scott Hancock ( 1884 ) . Walker was elected Commander of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in 1883 was also the President of the National Military Historical Association . 
 = = MIT presidency = = 
 Established in 1861 and opened in 1865 , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) saw its financial stability severely undermined following the Panic of 1873 and subsequent Long Depression . Seventy @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old founder William Barton Rogers was elected interim president in 1878 after John Daniel Runkle stepped down . Rogers wrote Walker in June 1880 to offer him the Presidency , and Walker evidently debated the opportunity for some time as Rogers sent follow @-@ up inquiries in January and February 1881 requesting his committed decision . Walker ultimately accepted in early May and was formally elected President by the MIT Corporation on May 25 , 1881 , resigning his Yale appointment in June and his Census directorship in November . However , the assassination attempt on President Garfield in July 1881 and the ensuing illness before Garfield 's death in September upset Walker 's transition and delayed his formal introduction to the faculty of MIT until November 5 , 1881 . On May 30 , 1882 , during Walker 's first Commencement exercises , Rogers died mid @-@ speech where his last words were famously " bituminous coal " . 
 MIT 's inability to secure a more stable financial footing during this era can largely be attributed to the existence of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard . Given the choice between funding technological research at the oldest university in the nation , or at an independent and adolescent institution , potential benefactors were indifferent or even hostile to funding MIT 's competing mission . Earlier overtures from Harvard President Charles William Eliot towards consolidation of the two schools were rejected or disrupted by Rogers in 1870 and 1878 . Despite his tenure at the analogous Sheffield School of Yale University , Walker remained committed to MIT 's independence from a larger institution . Walker also repeatedly received overtures from Leland Stanford to become the first president of his new university in Palo Alto , California , but Walker remained committed to MIT owing to his Boston upbringing . 
 = = = Aid and expansion = = = 
 In light of the difficulties in raising capital for these expansions and despite MIT 's privately endowed status , Walker and other members of the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $ 200 @,@ 000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ( $ 4 @,@ 446 @,@ 000 in 2009 dollars ) . After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker 's extensive connections and civic experience , in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $ 300 @,@ 000 over two years to the Institute , which would lead to a total of $ 1 @.@ 6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921 . 
 Walker sought to erect a new building to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square , in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston . Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two @-@ ninths of its current lot , Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere . With the financial health of the Institute only beginning to recover , Walker began construction on the partially @-@ funded expansion , fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds . The strategy was only partially successful , as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second @-@ to @-@ none but also lacked the outward architectural grandeur of its sister building and was generally considered an eyesore on its surroundings . Mechanical shops were moved out of the original Rogers Building in the mid @-@ 1880s to accommodate other programs , and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building . 
 New programs were also launched under Walker 's tenure : Electrical Engineering in 1882 , Chemical Engineering in 1888 , Sanitary Engineering in 1889 , Geology in 1890 , Naval Architecture in 1893 . 
 = = = Reforms = = = 
 Although Walker continued Census @-@ related activities , he began to lecture on political economy as well as establishing a new general course of study ( Course IX ) emphasizing economics , history , law , English , and modern languages . Walker also set out to reform and expand the Institute 's organization by creating a smaller Executive Committee , apart from the fifty @-@ member Corporation , to handle regular administrative issues . Walker emphasized the importance of faculty governance by regularly attending their meetings and seeking their advice on major decisions . 
 Walker also sought to improve the state of student life and alumni relations by supporting the creation of a gymnasium , dormitories , and the Technology Club , which served to foster a stronger identity and loyalty among the largely commuter student body . He also won considerable praise from the student body by reducing the required time spent for recitation and preparation , limiting the faculty to examinations lasting no longer than three hours , expanding entrance examinations to other cities , starting a summer curriculum , and launching masters and doctoral graduate degree programs . These reforms were largely a response to Walker 's on @-@ going defense of the Institute and its curriculum from outside accusations of overwork , poor writing , inapplicable skills , and status as a " mere " trade school . Between 1881 and 1897 , enrollments quadrupled from 302 to 1 @,@ 198 students , annual degrees granted increased from 28 to 179 , faculty appointments quadrupled from 38 to 156 , and the endowment grew <unk> from $ 137 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @,@ 798 @,@ 000 ( $ 3 @,@ 046 @,@ 000 to $ 46 @,@ 367 @,@ 000 in 2009 dollars ) . 
 While MIT is a private institution , Walker 's extensive civic activities as President set the precedent for future presidents to use the post to fulfill civic and cultural obligations throughout Boston . He served as a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education ( 1882 – 1890 ) , Boston School Committee ( 1885 – 1888 ) , Boston Art Commission ( 1885 – 1897 ) , Boston Park Commission ( 1890 – 1896 ) , Massachusetts Historical Society ( 1883 – 1897 ) , and a trustee of the Boston Public Library in 1896 . Walker was committed to a variety of reforms in public and normal schools such as secular curricula , expanding the emphasis on arithmetic , reducing the emphasis on ineffectual home exercises , and increasing the pay and training of teachers .

 Walker married <unk> Evelyn Stoughton on August 16 , 1865 ( born October 11 , 1840 ) . They had five sons and two daughters together : Stoughton ( b . June 3 , 1866 ) , Lucy ( b . September 1 , 1867 ) , Francis ( b . 1870 – 1871 ) , Ambrose ( b . December 28 , 1870 ) , Eveline ( b . 1875 – 1876 ) , <unk> ( b . 1876 – 1877 ) , and Stuart ( b . 1878 – 1879 ) . Walker was an avid spectator and supporter of college football and baseball , and was a regular Yale enthusiast at the annual Harvard @-@ Yale football game , even during his MIT presidency . 
 Following a trip to a dedication in the " wilderness of Northern New York " in December 1896 , Walker returned exhausted and ill . He died on January 5 , 1897 as a result of apoplexy . His funeral service was conducted at Trinity Church , and Walker was buried at Walnut Grove cemetery in North Brookfield , Massachusetts . His grave can be found in Section 1 Lot 72 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Following Walker 's death , alumni and students began to raise funds to construct a monument to him and his fifteen years as leader of the university . Although the funds were easily raised , plans were delayed for over two decades as MIT made plans to move to a new campus on the western bank of the Charles River in Cambridge . The new Beaux @-@ Arts campus opened in 1916 , and featured a neo @-@ classical Walker Memorial building housing a gymnasium , students ' club and lounge , and a commons room . 
 Despite his prominence and leadership in the fields of economics , statistics , and political economy , Walker 's Course IX on General Studies was dissolved shortly after his death , and a seventy @-@ year debate followed over the appropriate role and scope of humanistic and social studies at MIT . Graduation requirements changed over the years , but have always included some number of courses in the humanities . Since 1975 , all undergraduate students are required to take eight classes distributed across the MIT School of Humanities , Arts , and Social Sciences before receiving their degrees . To address continuing concerns about poor communications skills , a Communication Requirement has been added for two of the classes taken in a designated major to be " communication @-@ intensive " , including " substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation " . 
 Beginning in 1947 , the American Economic Association recognized the lifetime achievement of an individual economist with a " Francis A. Walker Medal " . The quinquennial award was discontinued in 1982 after the creation of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences effectively made it superfluous . The medal was awarded to Wesley Clair Mitchell in 1947 , John Maurice Clark in 1952 , Frank Knight in 1957 , Jacob Viner in 1962 , Alvin Hansen in 1967 , Theodore Schultz in 1972 , and Simon Kuznets in 1977 .

 Manal al @-@ Sharif ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ) is a women 's rights activist from Saudi Arabia who helped start a women 's right to drive campaign in 2011 . A women 's rights activist who had previously filmed herself driving , Wajeha al @-@ Huwaider , filmed al @-@ Sharif driving a car as part of the campaign . The video was posted on YouTube and Facebook . Al @-@ Sharif was detained and released on 21 May and rearrested the following day . On 30 May , al @-@ Sharif was released on bail , on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested , not driving and not talking to the media . The New York Times and Associated Press associated the women 's driving campaign with the wider pattern of the Arab Spring and the long duration of al @-@ Sharif 's detention with Saudi authorities ' fear of protests . 
 Following her driving campaign , al @-@ Sharif remained an active critic of the Saudi government , tweeting on issues including imprisoned female foreign workers , the lack of elections for the Shura Council , and the murder of Lama al @-@ Ghamdi . Her work has been recognized by Foreign Policy , Time , and the Oslo Freedom Forum .

 Manal al @-@ Sharif graduated from King Abdulaziz University with a Bachelor of Science in computing and a Cisco Career Certification . Until May 2012 , she worked as an Internet Security Consultant for Saudi Aramco , the Saudi national oil company . She also wrote for Al Watan , a Saudi daily .

 In addition to her professional career , al @-@ Sharif has campaigned for women 's rights in Saudi Arabia for many years . According to the New York Times , al @-@ Sharif " has a reputation for pulling stunts to highlight the lack of rights for women " . Regarding the 2011 women driving campaign , Amnesty International stated that " Manal al @-@ Sharif is following in a long tradition of women activists around the world who have put themselves on the line to expose and challenge discriminatory laws and policies " . 
 = = = Women 's driving rights in Saudi Arabia = = = 
 As of 2013 , women in Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of movement and in practice are not allowed to drive motor vehicles . In 1990 , dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest , were imprisoned for one day , had their passports confiscated , and some of them lost their jobs . In September 2007 , the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women 's Rights in Saudi Arabia , co @-@ founded by Wajeha al @-@ Huwaider and <unk> al @-@ <unk> , gave a 1 @,@ 100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive . On International Women 's Day 2008 , Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube . Inspired by the Arab Spring , a woman from Jeddah , Najla Hariri , started driving in the second week of May 2011 , stating " Before in Saudi , you never heard about protests . [ But ] after what has happened in the Middle East , we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice , and this has had an impact on me . " 
 = = = 2011 women driving campaign = = = 
 In 2011 , a group of women including Manal al @-@ Sharif started a Facebook campaign named " Teach me how to drive so I can protect myself " or " <unk> " that says that women should be allowed to drive . The campaign calls for women to start driving from 17 June 2011 . By 21 May 2011 , about 12 @,@ 000 readers of the Facebook page had expressed their support . Al @-@ Sharif describes the action as acting within women 's rights , and " not protesting " . Wajeha al @-@ Huwaider was impressed by the campaign and decided to help . 
 In late May , Al @-@ Sharif drove her car in Khobar with al @-@ Huwaider filming . The video was posted to YouTube and Facebook . In the video , al @-@ Sharif stated , " This is a volunteer campaign to help the girls of this country [ learn to drive ] . At least for times of emergency , God forbid . What if whoever is driving them gets a heart attack ? " She was detained by the religious police ( <unk> ) on 21 May and released after six hours . By 23 May 2011 , about 600 @,@ 000 people had watched the video . 
 The YouTube video of al @-@ Sharif 's drive became inaccessible at its original location , the Facebook page for the campaign was deleted , and the Twitter account used by al @-@ Sharif was " copied and altered " . Supporters republished the original video and Facebook page and a summary of al @-@ Sharif 's five recommended rules for the 17 June campaign were published on a blog and by the New York Times . 
 On 22 May , al @-@ Sharif was detained again and the Director General of Traffic Administration , Major @-@ General Suleiman Al @-@ <unk> , was questioned by journalists regarding traffic regulations related to women driving . Al @-@ <unk> stated that the journalists should " put the question " to members of the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia . RTBF suggested that al @-@ Sharif had been sentenced to five days ' imprisonment . 
 The New York Times described al @-@ Sharif 's campaign as a " budding protest movement " that the Saudi government tried to " swiftly extinguish " . Associated Press said that Saudi authorities " cracked down harder than usual on al @-@ Sharif , after seeing her case become a rallying call for youths anxious for change " in the context of the Arab Spring . Both news organisations attributed the long duration of al @-@ Sharif 's detention to Saudi authorities ' fear of a wider protest movement in Saudi Arabia . Amnesty International declared Al @-@ Sharif to be a prisoner of conscience and called for her immediate and unconditional release . 
 The day after al @-@ Sharif 's arrest , another woman was detained for driving a car . She drove with two women passengers in Ar Rass and was detained by traffic police in the presence of the <unk> . She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again . In reaction to al @-@ Sharif 's arrest , several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days . On 26 May , authorities said that al @-@ Sharif would remain in detention until 5 June 2011 , according to Waleed Abu Al @-@ <unk> . Al @-@ Sharif was conditionally freed on 30 May . Her lawyer Adnan al @-@ Saleh said that she had been charged with " inciting women to drive " and " rallying public opinion " . The conditions of Al @-@ Sharif 's release include bail , returning for questioning if requested , not driving and not talking to the media . As possible reasons for al @-@ Sharif 's early release , The National cited al @-@ Sharif having written a letter to King Abdullah , 4 @,@ 500 Saudis signing an online petition to the King , and " an outpouring of indignation and disbelief by both Saudis and critics abroad that Ms al @-@ Sharif was jailed for something that is not a moral or criminal offence . " 
 Al @-@ Sharif filed an objection with the General Directorate of Traffic in Riyadh on 15 November 2011 because of officials rejecting her driver 's licence application . Samar Badawi filed a similar lawsuit on 4 February 2012 .

 Following her 30 May release from prison , al @-@ Sharif started a Twitter campaign called " Faraj " to release Saudi , Filipino and Indonesian women prisoners in the Dammam women 's prison who " are locked up just because they owe a small sum of money but cannot afford to pay the debt " . Al @-@ Sharif said that the women prisoners were mostly domestic workers who remained in prison after completing their prison terms , because they could not pay their debts and because their former Saudi employers did not help to release them or fund their flights to return to their countries of origin . She referred to 22 Indonesian women and named four women needing help and stated the amount of their debts . She called for donations to be made directly to the director of the Dammam women 's prison in order to reimburse the women 's debts and free them .

 On 23 January 2012 , al @-@ Sharif was mistakenly reported dead in a car crash in Jeddah . On 25 January , The Guardian confirmed that she was in fact alive , and that the actual victim was an " unnamed member of a desert community " who was not involved in the female driving campaign . 
 Following al @-@ Sharif 's arrests , she reported being increasingly marginalized by her employers at Aramco . She quit following a dispute over her trip to Norway to receive the Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent . 
 In December 2012 , al @-@ Sharif criticized an initiative by the Saudi government to inform husbands via SMS when their wives or dependents leave the country , in accordance with a law making men the legal guardians of their wives . " The small fact of the SMS story gives you the idea of the bigger problem with the whole guardianship system " , she wrote on Twitter . When King Abdullah appointed women to the advisory Shura Council for the first time in January 2013 , al @-@ Sharif criticized the reform as too small , noting that the Council was still not an elected body and could not pass legislation . In February , she worked to bring international attention to the case of five @-@ year @-@ old Lama al @-@ Ghamdi , whose father <unk> al @-@ Ghamdi fatally raped , beat , and burned her ; he served four months in jail and paid 200 @,@ 000 <unk> ( roughly US $ 50 @,@ 000 ) in blood money .

 = Samus Aran = 
 Samus Aran ( Japanese : <unk> ・ <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> Aran ) is the protagonist of the Metroid science fiction action @-@ adventure game series by Nintendo . She was introduced in the 1986 video game Metroid . 
 Samus Aran is an ex @-@ soldier of the Galactic Federation who turned into a Galactic bounty hunter , usually fitted with a powered exoskeleton with weapons that include directed @-@ energy weapons and missiles . Throughout the series , she executes missions given to her by the Galactic Federation while hunting the antagonistic Space Pirates and their leader Ridley along with the parasitic energy @-@ draining organisms called Metroids . 
 Samus has appeared in every Metroid video game and has also been featured in media outside of the series , including the comic book version of Captain N : The Game Master and the Super Smash Bros. series . She is well known as one of the earliest female protagonists in video game history and has remained a popular character over a quarter @-@ century after her first appearance . 
 = = Character = = 
 Super Metroid 's Player 's Guide describes Samus as an athletic woman who is 6 ft 3 in ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) tall and weighs 198 pounds ( 90 kg ) without her armor . She is mostly seen inside the Power Suit , a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters and can be enhanced by power @-@ ups collected during gameplay . Typically , one of her suit 's arms carries a cannon , which can be charged to shoot an extra @-@ powerful blast , a limited number of missiles , and various beams . Samus 's suit can collapse into a sphere , a mode called the Morph Ball , allowing her to roll through tight areas such as tunnels . The suit can scan objects to learn more about them , and has a grapple beam used to cross large distances , such as chasms . Since Metroid II : Return of Samus , Samus has been accompanied by her Gunship , which is used in the games to save progress and restore health and ammunition . ( While there are other rooms in the series containing devices that can be used to save progress , they may not necessarily provide all functions accessed inside the Gunship . ) Appearances of Samus outside the Power Suit occur mostly in cutscenes , such as ending screens showing Samus in more revealing clothing . Metroid : Zero Mission also introduced the Zero Suit , a form @-@ fitting jumpsuit that she dons below the Power Suit . 
 The Metroid e @-@ manga covers Samus 's origins . She was born and raised on the mining planet K @-@ 2L , and when she was a child , the planet was raided by Space Pirates led by Ridley in an attack that killed both her parents and destroyed the planet . The orphaned Samus was then found by a bird @-@ like alien race known as the Chozo , who brought her to their home planet , Zebes . Samus was infused with Chozo DNA to give her a strong resistance to foreign environments , then trained as a warrior and given one of the alien race 's artifacts , the Power Suit . She enlisted in the Galactic Federation Police , but left for disagreements with her commanding officer , Adam Malkovich . Samus then started working as a freelance bounty hunter , and is called on by the Galactic Federation to execute missions " because of her superior skills and sense of justice " . Most of her missions revolve around the galaxy whilst getting rid of unsavory elements like the enigmatic organism known as Metroids , who can drain life energy and are frequently used as biological weapons . 
 = = = Conception and development = = = 
 The style for the original Metroid game was designed to be a cross between the side @-@ scrolling gameplay of the Super Mario games and the exploration and puzzle @-@ solving aspects of The Legend of Zelda series with inspiration from science fiction . The game 's characters were conceived by Makoto Kano , while Hiroji Kiyotake designed the main protagonist Samus Aran . Samus is able to collapse into a ball to travel through tight areas . The ability , called the Maru Mari ( meaning " round ball " in Japanese ) in the original Metroid ( 1986 ) , and later the more popular title of Morph Ball in Super Metroid , was conceived by the developers because it required less effort to animate than " a cyborg crawling on all fours " , and the producer for Metroid , Gunpei Yokoi , took advantage of this shortcut . 
 The original game 's atmosphere was influenced by Ridley Scott 's film Alien . The series ' co @-@ creator Yoshio Sakamoto recalled , " We were partway through the development process when one of the staff members said ' Hey , wouldn 't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman ? ' " The developers voted on the concept , and it passed . The game 's instruction manual refers to Samus as if she were male to keep her true gender a secret until the end of the game . Sakamoto noted that during the course of the Metroid series , developers constantly try to express Samus 's femininity without turning her into a sex object . Samus 's image was based on actress Sigourney Weaver in her role as Ellen Ripley from Aliens , and actress Kim Basinger from 9 ½ Weeks and My Stepmother Is an Alien . Sakamoto and Kiyotake said that the character 's last name " Aran " was taken from Edson Arantes do Nascimento , the birth name of famous soccer player Pelé .

 In Metroid , the Galactic Federation sends Samus to track down the Space Pirates on their home planet of Zebes . Deep within their base , she battles Mother Brain , the organism that controls the base 's defenses , and she escapes just as the base self @-@ destructs . In Metroid II : Return of Samus , the Galactic Federation commissions Samus to exterminate all Metroid creatures on the planet SR388 . She travels deep into the planet 's caverns . After dispatching a Metroid Queen , Samus discovers a small Metroid hatchling , which imprints on her , thinking she is its mother . She spares its life and takes it back to her gunship . 
 In Super Metroid , just after giving the hatchling to a Federation research station , Samus tracks the hatchling ( stolen by Ridley ) to a newly rebuilt Space Pirate base on Zebes . She travels deep underground , eventually finding the now @-@ fully @-@ grown Metroid , then battling a newly rebuilt and more powerful Mother Brain . The Metroid hatchling sacrifices itself to save Samus , and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes as the entire planet is destroyed . In Metroid Fusion , Samus returns to SR388 , where a parasitic infection nearly kills her . Federation scientists surgically remove large sections of her corrupted Varia Suit and inject her with the Metroid hatchling 's DNA to save her . To prevent the parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it , Samus sets the station to crash into the planet . 
 Metroid : Other M , which takes place between Super Metroid and Fusion , provides more information about Samus 's backstory and her emotional connection to both the Metroid hatchling and her former commander , Adam Malkovich , as well as her relation to all four Mother Brain designs , namely Zebes ' Mother Brains , Aurora Unit 313 and MB . 
 In Metroid Prime , Samus travels to the planet Tallon IV , which contains a Chozo colony in ruins and a Space Pirate base . There she learns of Phazon , a mysterious mutagen that can alter the genetic material of any organism . Samus is eventually able to access the source of the planet 's Phazon contamination , a meteor impact crater , where she defeats the Phazon @-@ infused creature Metroid Prime . In Metroid Prime 2 : Echoes , Samus is sent to the planet Aether , a Phazon meteor @-@ ravaged planet split into light and dark dimensions . There she battles the Ing , creatures that are able to possess other organisms , and Dark Samus , an evil doppelgänger of herself formed from the remains of Metroid Prime . In Metroid Prime Hunters , Samus competes against six rival bounty hunters in a race to recover an alien ultimate weapon . In Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , Samus is infected by Phazon and is slowly corrupted by the mutagen while she works to prevent it from spreading to other planets . By the end of the game , she renders all Phazon inert by destroying its original source , the planet Phaaze , and destroys Dark Samus .

 Samus was featured in a series of comic books called Captain N : The Game Master , published by Valiant Comics in 1990 , based on the animated series of the same name , despite Samus never appearing in the cartoon version . In the comics , Samus is depicted as brash , money @-@ hungry , and fiercely independent . 1UP.com described Samus in the Captain N comics as " rambunctious , reckless , and gets into fighting contests with Lana over Kevin 's affections , which makes for some of the most entertaining situations in the series . " Comic book and manga adaptations of Metroid games were also developed . 
 Samus is a playable character in all four games in the Super Smash Bros. series of multiplayer fighting games , where she can use her array of weapons in combat against characters from other video games . Super Smash Bros. Brawl and the fourth Super Smash Bros. game also feature an alternate form of Samus called Zero Suit Samus , in which the heroine loses her Power Suit and has a different set of movements and attacks . She also stars in the Subspace Emissary fighting Ridley with Pikachu by her side . In the fourth Super Smash Bros. game , Samus in her power suit and her zero suit are listed as two separate characters , to avoid confusion with their move sets whereas in the previous game , Samus could access her zero suit by activating her final smash . Samus also receives a significant power upgrade with rocket powered boots which will work well for recovery . 
 Samus makes cameo appearances in the games Galactic Pinball ( 1995 ) , Super Mario RPG ( 1996 ) , Kirby Super Star ( 1996 ) , and Kirby 's Dream Land 3 ( 1997 ) , and also makes a non @-@ playable appearance in Dead or Alive : Dimensions by Metroid : Other M co @-@ developers Team Ninja . 
 Many various figures based on the character were produced by various manufacturers . First 4 Figures built 2 @,@ 500 Varia Suit Samus figures , selling all of them . Good Smile Company produced a <unk> and a statue of Samus based on the Other M Samus . Samus also launched as one of the twelve original Amiibo in November 2014 .

 Samus was one of the first major female protagonists in a video game . Although Toby <unk> ( " Kissy " ) from Namco 's Alien Sector ( <unk> ) predates her by one year as a female protagonist , 2013 's Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition declared Samus as " the first playable human female character in a mainstream videogame " , and as being " enduringly " popular , noting that sales of the Metroid series has exceeded 17 @.@ 44 million copies as of September 2012 . As a woman in a male @-@ dominated role , Samus has been widely considered a breakthrough for female characters in video games . 
 In 2009 , GameDaily called Samus the video game industry 's " first dominant female , a femme de force that didn 't rely on a man to save her , " also ranking her number one on a list of the top Nintendo characters of all time . In 2010 , James Hawkins of Joystick Division ranked her as number one top " badass lady " in video games , adding that she " made every other character on this list possible , " while UGO.com ranked her as 20th in a list of top heroes of all @-@ time . In 2011 , Nintendo Power listed Samus as their third favourite hero , citing her bravery in the face of dangerous situations , while UGO.com also included her on the list of video game characters who need their own movies . That same year , Empire ranked her as the 26th greatest video game character , adding , " whether you see her as a breakthrough for feminism or just another faceless sci @-@ fi warrior , 1986 's unexpected reveal that showed women could be more in gaming lore than eye candy for geeky boys was a refreshing and unforgettable moment . " In 2012 , GamesRadar ranked her as the <unk> " most memorable , influential , and badass " protagonist in video games , adding : " Whether she 's 2D or 3D , in a sidescroller or FPS , her strength and determination always shine through , allowing her the power to defeat floating aliens and space pirates alike . " In 2013 , Complex ranked her as the 11th " most badass " video game character of all time , as well as the number one greatest heroine in video game history , and the third greatest soldier in video games . 
 Samus ' reveal in the original Metroid , which UGO.com called the original " jaw @-@ dropping moment " in gaming , was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo 's history by GameDaily in 2008 . The Irish Times found it refreshing to learn that the series ' protagonist , who is " well disguised under the suit of heavy armour " , is female , but Rupert Goodwins of The Independent wrote that the " Transformer @-@ like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede ; it 's hardly a breakthrough for feminism . " According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty @-@ First Century : Literate Connections , Samus was perhaps the most <unk> female video @-@ game character ever , a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development , which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo 's most popular video game mascots . In 2002 , Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that " unlike most other female video game characters , Samus isn 't some husky @-@ voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal . Samus is tough , silent , heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high @-@ tech Power Armor . " That same year , however , an article in Toronto Star retorted that the " sexual politics " surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop , arguing that the original " big crazy shock to the gaming public " was " some seriously misspent energy " as she " is not a woman for the benefit of the sweaty / excited crowd , and neither is she a standard @-@ bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights . She is a supremely talented action figure , and in the closeups on her helmet you can kind of see that she wears mascara , but that is all . " UGO.com included Samus ' one @-@ piece bathing swimsuit on the list of the best alternate costumes and IGN chose " Dude ( Looks Like a Lady ) " by Aerosmith as Samus ' theme song because she " spends her time running around in a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later . " Featuring her in their 2004 list of " top ten forces of good " ( one section on their list of top 50 " retro " game characters ) , Retro Gamer opined she has remained " a distinct female character , not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers , which is more than can be said for some . " 
 Nevertheless , much of her media reception came from her sex appeal . GameTrailers named Samus number one on a 2006 list of the top ten women of gaming , and number three among top ten " gamer babes " in 2007 . GameDaily ranked Samus seventh on a list of the top " hottest game babes " , describing her as " a refreshing change of pace , a tough , no nonsense warrior that isn 't afraid to remove her famous orange and yellow power suit and let her hair down , especially to reveal her skin tight clothing . " She was also listed on GameDaily 's list of " hottest " blondes in video games , described as both one of Nintendo 's most famous protagonists as well as a " curvaceous , drop @-@ dead @-@ gorgeous woman , " and used to illustrate the " smart and sexy heroine " concept on their list of top video game archetypes . In 2008 , Spike placed Samus on the top of their list of " video game vixen " as " a foxy broad that conceals her curves inside a weapon of death and destruction , " while MSN India listed her as one of " the best @-@ looking game characters with perfect figures . " In 2009 , UGO.com ranked Samus as 11th on a list of the top " girls of gaming " and as the eighth " hottest sci @-@ fi girl " , also including her in the 2011 list of 50 video game " hotties " . Her Zero Suit was ranked by ScrewAttack as fourth on their 2010 list of the sexiest outfits in games on GameTrailers , while Sarah Warn of AfterEllen ranked Samus as the tenth " hottest " female video game character .

Thanh Niên ranked her as the tenth most sexy female character in 2015 , in particular for her Zero Suit . 
 Samus has been well received by the video game community . In 2001 , IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters . She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website 's users , the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie , especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates . Among their list of voted characters , IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that " could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage to live up to the source material . " Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs " Character Battle " contests , winning the " Character Battle V " in 2006 . In 2009 , GameSpot featured her in their poll " All Time Greatest Game Hero " , in which she lost to Mario in the semi @-@ finals . Paul O 'Connor , the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series , remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity . The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus 's past or future ; the only interaction that they have with the character is by being her through gameplay , while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art , adding , " Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change , " referring to the revelation that she is a woman . MMA and actress Ronda Rousey told GameSpot in a 2016 interview that she " always wanted to be Samus " if a live @-@ action Metroid film is made . 
 In his review of Super Smash Bros. , GameSpot 's Jeff Gerstmann called Samus one of the characters that made Nintendo " what it is today . " Samus was ranked fifth on GameDaily 's 2009 list of top characters in the Smash Bros. series , while IGN ranked her as the third @-@ best character for Super Smash Bros. Her controversial portrayal in Metroid : Other M received mixed reactions . Unlike other Metroid games , where Samus took full advantage of weapons and abilities available , she deactivated most of them until Commander Adam Malkovich authorized their use , despite obvious uses for them . G4 TV considered the portrayal of Samus as " sexist " , stating that as she " cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man " and that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals . The A.V. Club echoed the misgivings about Samus 's immaturity , petulant behavior , and misguided loyalty . According to GamePro , while the story and Samus ' monologues did not compel them , " it helped contextualize her entire existence " which developed the character to " an actual human being who 's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past . " 1UP.com 's Justin Hayward found the portrayal " lifeless and boring " and " nonsensical " . GamesRadar wrote that Other M painted Samus , widely considered a strong female lead character , as " an unsure , insecure woman who desperately wants the approval of her former [ male ] commanding officer . " Game Informer listed her 1st on their list of the top ten " dorks " of 2010 , citing her " lame backstory " in Other M. On the other hand , Bob " <unk> " Chipman from ScrewAttack applauded the elaboration on Samus 's character , arguing that her breakdown is an accurate depiction of posttraumatic stress disorder and that she is portrayed as a three @-@ dimensional character , a step up from the fans ' long @-@ standing misconceptions of Samus as " pathologically emotionless man @-@ hating ice queen , " while " supposedly enlightened gamers and game commentators " are making gender assumptions that are " all in [ their heads ] .

 = Morihei Ueshiba = 
 Morihei Ueshiba ( 植芝 <unk> , Ueshiba Morihei , December 14 , 1883 – April 26 , 1969 ) was a martial artist and founder of the Japanese martial art of Aikido . He is often referred to as " the founder " <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> / <unk> ) , " Great Teacher " . 
 The son of a landowner from Tanabe , Ueshiba studied a number of martial arts in his youth , and served in the Japanese Army during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . After being discharged in 1907 , he moved to Hokkaidō as the head of a pioneer settlement ; here he met and studied with Takeda Sokaku , the founder of Daitō @-@ ryū aiki @-@ jūjutsu . On leaving Hokkaido in 1919 , Ueshiba joined the Ōmoto @-@ kyō movement , a Shinto sect , in Ayabe , where he served as a martial arts instructor and opened his first dojo . He accompanied the head of the Ōmoto @-@ kyō group , Onisaburo Deguchi , on an expedition to Mongolia in 1924 , where they were captured by Chinese troops and returned to Japan . The following year , he experienced a great spiritual enlightenment , stating that , " a golden spirit sprang up from the ground , veiled my body , and changed my body into a golden one . " After this experience , his martial arts skill appeared to be greatly increased . 
 Ueshiba moved to Tokyo in 1926 , where he set up the Aikikai Hombu Dojo . In the aftermath of World War II the dojo was closed , but Ueshiba continued training at another dojo he had set up in Iwama . From the end of the war until the 1960s , he worked to promote aikido throughout Japan and abroad . He died from liver cancer in 1969 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Morihei Ueshiba was born in Tanabe , Wakayama Prefecture , Japan on December 14 , 1883 , the fourth child ( and only son ) born to <unk> Ueshiba and his wife Yuki . 
 The young Ueshiba was raised in a somewhat privileged setting . His father was a rich landowner who also traded in lumber and fishing and was politically active . Ueshiba was a rather weak , sickly child and bookish in his inclinations . At a young age his father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great @-@ grandfather <unk> , who was considered a very strong samurai in his era . The need for such strength was further emphasized when the young Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician . 
 At the age of six Ueshiba was sent to study at the <unk> Temple , but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education . However , his schoolmaster was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism , and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect , which Ueshiba found intriguing . He went to <unk> Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School , but left formal education in his early teens , enrolling instead at the a private abacus academy , the Yoshida Institute , to study accountancy . On graduating from the academy , he worked at a local tax office for a few months , but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo , funded by his father . Ueshiba Trading , the stationery business which he opened there was short @-@ lived ; unhappy with life in the capital , he returned to Tanabe less than a year later after suffering a bout of beri @-@ beri . Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa . 
 In 1903 , Ueshiba was called up for military service . He failed the initial physical examination , being shorter than the regulation 5 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 57 m ) . To overcome this , he stretched his spine by attaching heavy weights to his legs and suspending himself from tree branches ; when he re @-@ took the physical exam he had increased his height by the necessary half @-@ inch to pass . He was assigned to the Osaka Fourth Division , 37th Regiment , and was a corporal by the following year ; after serving on the front lines during the Russo @-@ Japanese War he was promoted to sergeant . He was discharged in 1907 , and again returned to his father 's farm in Tanabe . Here he befriended the writer and philosopher Minakata <unk> , becoming involved with Minakata 's opposition to the Meiji government 's Shrine Consolidation Policy . He and his wife had their first child , a daughter named <unk> , in 1911 . 
 Ueshiba studied several martial arts during his early life , and was renowned for his physical strength during his youth . His training in Gotō @-@ ha Yagyū @-@ ryu under Masakatsu Nakai was sporadic due to his military service , although he was granted a diploma in the art within a few years . In 1901 he received some instruction from Tozawa <unk> in Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū jujutsu and he studied judo with Kiyoichi Takagi in Tanabe in 1911 . 
 = = Hokkaidō = = 
 In 1912 , Ueshiba and his wife left Tanabe and moved to Japan 's northernmost island , Hokkaidō . At the time , Hokkaidō was still largely unsettled by the Japanese , being occupied primarily by the indigenous Ainu . Ueshiba was the leader of the Kishū Settlement Group , a collective of eighty @-@ five pioneers who intended to settle in the <unk> district and live as farmers . Poor soil conditions and bad weather led to crop failures during the first three years of the project , but the group still managed to cultivate mint and farm livestock . The burgeoning timber industry provided a boost to the settlement 's economy , but a fire in 1917 razed the entire village , leading to the departure of around twenty families . Ueshiba , elected to the village council that year , led the reconstruction efforts . In the summer of 1918 , Hatsu gave birth to their first son , Takemori . 
 In Hokkaidō , the young Ueshiba met Takeda Sokaku , the founder of Daitō @-@ ryū aiki @-@ jūjutsu at the <unk> Inn in <unk> , in March 1915 . Ueshiba was deeply impressed with Takeda 's martial art . He requested formal instruction and began studying Takeda 's style of jūjutsu in earnest , going so far as to construct a dojo at his home and inviting his new teacher to be a permanent house guest . He received a <unk> dairi certificate , or teaching license , for the system from Takeda in 1922 , when Takeda visited him in Ayabe . He also received a Yagyū <unk> @-@ ryū sword transmission scroll from Takeda . Ueshiba then became a representative of Daitō @-@ ryū , toured with Takeda as a teaching assistant and taught the system to others . 
 = = Onisaburo Deguchi and Ōmoto @-@ kyō = = 
 In November 1919 , Ueshiba learned that his father <unk> was ill , and was not expected to survive . Leaving most of his possessions to Sokaku , Ueshiba left <unk> with the apparent intention returning to Tanabe to visit his ailing parent . En route , however , he made a detour to Ayabe , near Kyoto , intending to visit Onisaburo Deguchi , the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto @-@ kyō religion in Ayabe . Having met Deguchi , Ueshiba stayed at the Ōmoto @-@ kyō headquarters for several days . On his return to Tanabe , he found that his father had died . Within a few months , he was back in Ayabe , having decided to become a full @-@ time student of Ōmoto @-@ kyō . In 1920 Deguchi asked Ueshiba to become the group 's martial arts instructor , and a dojo — the first of several that Ueshiba was to lead — was constructed on the centre 's grounds . Ueshiba also taught Takeda 's Daitō @-@ ryū in neighbouring Hyōgo Prefecture during this period . His second son , <unk> , was born in 1920 in Ayabe , but died from illness the same year , along with three @-@ year @-@ old Takemori . 
 In 1921 , in an event known as the First Ōmoto @-@ kyō Incident ( Ōmoto jiken ) , the Japanese authorities raided the compound , destroying the main buildings on the site and arresting Deguchi on charges of lèse @-@ majesté . Ueshiba 's dojo was undamaged , however , and over the following two years he worked closely with Deguchi to reconstruct the group 's centre , becoming heavily involved in farming work . His son Kisshomaru Ueshiba was born in the summer of 1921 . 
 Three years later , in 1924 , Onisaburo Deguchi led a small group of Ōmoto @-@ kyō disciples , including Ueshiba , on a journey to Mongolia at the invitation of retired naval captain <unk> Yano and his associates within the ultra @-@ nationalist Black Dragon Society . Deguchi 's intent was to establish a new religious kingdom in Mongolia , and to this end he had distributed propaganda suggesting that he was the reincarnation of Genghis Khan . Allied with the Mongolian bandit Lu <unk> , Deguchi 's group were arrested in <unk> by the Chinese authorities — fortunately for Ueshiba , whilst Lu and his men were executed by firing squad , the Japanese group were released into the custody of the Japanese consul . They were returned under guard to Japan , where Deguchi was imprisoned for breaking the terms of his bail . 
 After returning to Ayabe , Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training , regularly retreating by himself to the mountains or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls . As his prowess as a martial artist increased , his fame began to spread . He was challenged by many established martial artists , some of whom subsequently became his students after being defeated by him . In the autumn of 1925 he was asked to give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo , at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita ; one of the spectators was Yamamoto <unk> , who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art . After a couple of weeks , however , Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi ; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe . 
 Ōmoto @-@ kyō priests still oversee the Aiki @-@ jinja <unk> ceremony in Ueshiba 's honor every April 29 at the Aiki Shrine in Iwama . 
 = = Tokyo = = 
 In 1926 Takeshita invited Ueshiba to visit Tokyo again . Ueshiba relented and returned to the capital , but while residing there was stricken with a serious illness . Deguchi visited his ailing student and , concerned for his health , commanded Ueshiba to return to Ayabe . The appeal of returning increased after Ueshiba was questioned by the police following his meeting with Deguchi ; the authorities were keeping the Ōmoto @-@ kyō leader under close surveillance . Angered at the treatment he had received , Ueshiba went back to Ayabe again . Six months later , however , and this time with Deguchi 's blessing , he and his family moved permanently to Tokyo . Arriving in October 1927 , they set up home in the <unk> district . The building , however , was too small to house the growing number of aikido students , and so the <unk> moved to larger premises , first in Mita district , then in Takanawa , and finally to a purpose @-@ built hall in Shinjuku . This last location , originally named the <unk> <unk> , would eventually become the Aikikai Hombu Dojo . During its construction , Ueshiba rented a property nearby , where he was visited by Jigoro Kano , the founder of judo . 
 In 1932 , Ueshiba 's daughter <unk> was married to the swordsman Kiyoshi <unk> , who was adopted as Ueshiba 's heir under the name Morihiro Ueshiba . The marriage ended after a few years , and <unk> left the family in 1937 . 
 Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to Manchukuo ( Japanese occupied Manchuria ) where he was the principal martial arts instructor at <unk> University . 
 = = Iwama = = 
 From 1935 onwards , Ueshiba had been purchasing land in Iwama in Ibaraki Prefecture . In 1942 , having acquired around 17 acres ( 6 @.@ 9 ha ; 0 @.@ 027 sq mi ) of farmland there , he left Tokyo and moved to Iwama permanently , settling in a small farmer 's cottage . Here he founded the Aiki <unk> Dojo , also known as the Iwama dojo . During all this time he traveled extensively in Japan , particularly in the Kansai region teaching his aikido . Despite the prohibition on the teaching of martial arts after World War II , Ueshiba and his students continued to practice in secret at the Iwama dojo ; the Hombu dojo in Tokyo was in any case being used as a refugee centre for citizens displaced by the severe firebombing . 
 The prohibition ( on aikido , at least ) was lifted in 1948 with the creation of the Aiki Foundation , established by the Japanese Ministry of Education with permission from the Occupation forces . The Hombu dojo re @-@ opened the following year . After the war , however , Ueshiba delegated most of the work of running the Hombu dojo and the Aiki Federation to his son Kisshomaru , choosing to spend much of his time in prayer , meditation , calligraphy and farming . He still travelled extensively to promote aikido , however , even visiting Hawaii in 1961 . He also appeared in a television documentary on aikido : NTV 's The Master of Aikido , broadcast in January 1960 . 
 In his later years , he was regarded as very kind and gentle as a rule , but there are also stories of terrifying scoldings delivered to his students . For instance , he once thoroughly chastised students for practicing jō ( staff ) strikes on trees without first covering them in protective padding . 
 = = Death = = 
 In 1969 , Ueshiba became ill . He led his last training session on March 10 , and was subsequently taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver . He died suddenly on April 26 , 1969 . Two months later , his wife Hatsu also died . ( 植芝 <unk> ; Ueshiba Hatsu , née Itokawa Hatsu ; 1881 – 1969 ) 
 = = Development of aikido = = 
 Aikido — usually translated as the Way of Unifying Spirit or the Way of Spiritual Harmony — is a fighting system that focuses on throws , pins and joint locks together with some striking techniques . It is unusual among the martial arts for its heavy emphasis on protecting the opponent and on spiritual and social development . 
 Ueshiba developed aikido after experiencing three instances of spiritual awakening . The first happened in 1925 , after Ueshiba had defeated a naval officer 's bokken ( wooden katana ) attacks unarmed and without hurting the officer . Ueshiba then walked to his garden and had a spiritual awakening . 
 I felt the universe suddenly quake , and that a golden spirit sprang up from the ground , veiled my body , and changed my body into a golden one . At the same time my body became light . I was able to understand the whispering of the birds , and was clearly aware of the mind of God , the creator of the universe . 
 At that moment I was enlightened : the source of <unk> [ the martial way ] is God 's love – the spirit of loving protection for all beings ... 
 Budō is not the felling of an opponent by force ; nor is it a tool to lead the world to destruction with arms . True Budō is to accept the spirit of the universe , keep the peace of the world , correctly produce , protect and cultivate all beings in nature . 
 His second experience occurred in 1940 when engaged in the ritual purification process of misogi . 
 Around 2am as I was performing misogi , I suddenly forgot all the martial techniques I had ever learned . The techniques of my teachers appeared completely new . Now they were vehicles for the cultivation of life , knowledge , and virtue , not devices to throw people with . 
 His third experience was in 1942 during the worst fighting of World War II , Ueshiba had a vision of the " Great Spirit of Peace " . 
 The Way of the Warrior has been misunderstood . It is not a means to kill and destroy others . Those who seek to compete and better one another are making a terrible mistake . To smash , injure , or destroy is the worst thing a human being can do . The real Way of a Warrior is to prevent such slaughter – it is the Art of Peace , the power of love . 
 The technical curriculum of aikido was undoubtedly most greatly influenced by the teachings of Takeda Sokaku . The basic techniques of aikido seem to have their basis in teachings from various points in the Daitō @-@ ryū curriculum . In the earlier years of his teaching , from the 1920s to the mid @-@ 1930s , Ueshiba taught the Daitō @-@ ryū aiki @-@ jūjutsu system ; his early students ' documents bear the term aiki @-@ jūjutsu . Indeed , Ueshiba trained one of the future highest grade earners in Daitō @-@ ryū , Takuma Hisa , in the art before Takeda took charge of Hisa 's training . 
 The early form of training under Ueshiba was noticeably different from later forms of aikido . It had a larger curriculum , increased use of strikes to vital points ( atemi ) and a greater use of weapons . The schools of aikido developed by Ueshiba 's students from the pre @-@ war period tend to reflect the harder style of the early training . These students included Kenji Tomiki ( who founded the Shodokan Aikido sometimes called Tomiki @-@ ryū ) , Noriaki Inoue ( who founded Shin 'ei <unk> ) , Minoru Mochizuki ( who founded <unk> Budo ) , Gozo Shioda ( who founded Yoshinkan Aikido ) . Many of these styles are therefore considered " pre @-@ war styles " , although some of these teachers continued to train with Ueshiba in the years after World War II . 
 Later , as Ueshiba seemed to slowly grow away from Takeda , he began to change his art . These changes are reflected in the differing names with which he referred to his system , first as aiki @-@ jūjutsu , then Ueshiba @-@ ryū , Asahi @-@ ryū , and aiki <unk> . In 1942 , the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally came to be known as aikido . 
 As Ueshiba grew older , more skilled , and more spiritual in his outlook , his art also changed and became softer and more circular . Striking techniques became less important and the formal curriculum became simpler . In his own expression of the art there was a greater emphasis on what is referred to as <unk> @-@ nage , or " breath throws " which are soft and blending , utilizing the opponent 's movement in order to throw them . Ueshiba regularly practiced cold water misogi , as well as other spiritual and religious rites , and viewed his studies of aikido as part of this spiritual training . 
 = = Students = = 
 Over the years , Ueshiba trained a large number of students , many of whom have grown into great teachers in their own right . Some of them were <unk> , or live @-@ in students . There are roughly four generations of students . A partial list follows :

 Deuce ' n Domino was the name of a professional wrestling tag team consisting of Deuce Shade and Dice Domino , who were managed for the majority of their run by Cherry Pie and briefly by Maryse . The pair teamed together in World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) from 2006 through 2008 . Deuce and Domino first began teaming together alongside Domino 's storyline sister Cherry , in OVW , WWE 's developmental territory in Louisville , Kentucky . While working in OVW , Deuce ' n Domino , who at the time were known as " The <unk> " and later " The Untouchables " , won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions .

 Before forming a team , both Deuce Shade and Dice Domino competed in singles competition , occasionally against each other , in World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) ' s developmental territory , Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) . In January 2006 , Deuce and Domino formed a partnership with Domino 's storyline sister , Cherry Pie , as their manager . The trio adopted a 1950s greaser in @-@ ring persona , to become known as " The <unk> " . 
 During their time together they underwent an image change , including changing their name to " The Untouchables " and dropping Shade , Dice , and Pie from their respective names . The team would become OVW Southern Tag Team Champions after Deuce defeated The Miz on March 19 , 2006 in a singles match after Miz 's partner , Chris Cage , left the organization and forced The Miz to defend the title on his own . The team , however , lost the title the following month to Roadkill and Kasey James in a three @-@ way match , which also involved Kenny and Mikey of The Spirit Squad . 
 The group soon began a scripted rivalry with the team of CM Punk and Seth Skyfire , which saw The Untouchables winning the Southern Tag Team Title from them on August 2 , 2006 . The Untouchables later engaged in another rivalry with Shawn Spears and Cody Runnels . They also won the Deep South Wrestling ( DSW ) Tag Team Championship after making a surprise appearance at a DSW show on October 5 , 2006 . They lost the South Tag Team Championship on October 12 to The Major Brothers . In addition , the team lost the OVW Southern Tag Team Title to Spears and Runnels , prompting Cherry to leave The Untouchables to side with Spears and Runnels briefly before betraying them . The team won the Southern Tag Team Championship on another occasion , before losing them to Spears and Rhodes in a street fight , thus ending their feud .

 The team was called up to WWE 's SmackDown ! roster in January 2007 , with the team undergoing a name change to " Deuce ' n Domino " . Despite the name change , they retained their greaser personas , adding to their ring entrance an arrival in a 1950s era car . Deuce ' n Domino won their debut tag team match . 
 On the February 2 episode of SmackDown ! , the team defeated the then @-@ WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a non @-@ title match . Deuce ' n Domino faced London and Kendrick in a WWE Tag Team Championship match at February 's pay @-@ per @-@ view event , No Way Out , but lost when Kendrick pinned Deuce via roll @-@ up . On the April 20 episode of SmackDown ! , they defeated London and Kendrick for the WWE Tag Team Championship when London was , in storyline , injured after missing a moonsault to the outside . Kendrick was left to defend the title by himself , and was pinned after being hit with Deuce ' n Domino 's West Side Stomp finishing move . Three weeks later , London and Kendrick competed against William Regal and Dave Taylor . Deuce ' n Domino interfered , causing Regal and Taylor to be disqualified . This made both teams number one contenders leading to a triple threat tag team match the following week where Deuce ' n Domino retained the tag title . 
 At the July event , Vengeance : Night of Champions , after insulting former Tag Team Champions Tony Garea and Rick Martel , Deuce ' n Domino defeated Sgt. Slaughter and " Superfly " Jimmy Snuka to retain their title . During a tag team match with Cryme Tyme ( Shad Gaspard and JTG ) in late June , Domino suffered an injury , which was diagnosed as a broken nose and a possible broken orbital bone socket in his eye . The injury would keep him out of the ring for a month . 
 Deuce n ' Domino later engaged in a rivalry with Batista and Ric Flair . On the August 31 episode of SmackDown ! , the team lost their tag team championship to Matt Hardy and the reigning WWE United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter . During the last few months of 2007 , Deuce ' n Domino engaged in a short scripted rivalry with Hardy and MVP , Jimmy Wang Yang and Shannon Moore , Jesse and Festus , and Finlay and Hornswoggle . At the beginning of 2008 , the team suffered a series of losses . At WrestleMania XXIV in March , the team participated in a 24 @-@ man Interpromotional Battle Royal , in which the winner would face then ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero later that night . Deuce ' n Domino , however , did not win the match .

Deuce then threw his jacket over Domino , dissolving their partnership . The split was then further cemented when Deuce was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft . Following the draft , Domino was predominantly featured as an enhancement talent — a wrestler who consistently loses to make his opponents look stronger — on SmackDown weekly . In August 2008 , Domino and Cherry were released from their WWE contracts . The following year , Deuce was released from the WWE as well .

 = Moses Gill = 
 Moses Gill ( January 18 , 1734 – May 20 , 1800 ) was a Massachusetts politician who briefly served as the state 's Acting Governor . He is the state 's only acting governor to die in office . A successful businessman , he became one of the leading settlers of Princeton , Massachusetts , entering politics shortly before the American Revolutionary War . He served on the Massachusetts Provincial Congress 's executive committee until the state adopted its constitution in 1780 , after which he continued to serve on the state 's Governor 's Council . 
 Elected lieutenant governor in 1794 , he served in that office under Governors Samuel Adams and Increase Sumner until the latter died shortly after winning reelection in 1799 . Gill served an apparently undistinguished term as acting governor until his own death in 1800 , ten days before his successor , Caleb Strong , assumed office . Gill was a significant benefactor and founder of Leicester Academy , and supported the congregational church in Princeton , where the family had a large estate . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Moses Gill was born January 18 , 1734 to John and Elizabeth ( Abbot ) Gill in Charlestown , Massachusetts . He was one the younger sons in a long line of children which included John Gill , who would become well known in the colonies as printer of the Boston Gazette . Gill entered business as a local merchant in Boston . In 1759 he married Sarah Prince , daughter to pastor Thomas Prince of Boston 's Old South Church . Upon her father 's death the couple inherited Prince 's lands in western Worcester County , one of the largest tracts in what became the town of Princeton . In 1767 he retired from his business activities , and the couple divided their time between Boston and Princeton . Sarah died childless in 1771 . Gill remarried in 1772 to Rebecca Boylston , a scion of the influential Boylston family and sister of Harvard College benefactor Nicholas Boylston . They were also childless ; when his brother John died , Gill adopted one of his sons . The Gills were known to own several slaves . 
 = = Political career = = 
 In 1774 Gill entered politics , winning election to the provincial assembly . The assembly was dissolved by Governor Thomas Gage under the terms of the Massachusetts Government Act ( a punishment of Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party ) , but its members met shortly afterwards and reconstituted themselves as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress . Gill served on this body 's executive council , which functioned as the de facto executive of the state until its constitution was adopted in 1780 . When the American Revolutionary War broke in April 1775 , Gill became involved in the early military organization of the Siege of Boston , heading the provincial congress ' supply committee . He was also delegated , along with General Artemas Ward , to meet George Washington in Springfield and escort him to the army camps outside Boston . 
 Because of his prominence in Worcester County Gill was appointed to the county 's district court when it was reorganized after the revolution began . In this role he sat on the panel that heard the preliminary cases in 1781 involving Quock Walker , an African American seeking a declaration of his freedom . Gill 's panel decided in Walker 's favor , and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court eventually confirmed the judgments on appeal , declaring that slavery was incompatible with the state constitution . 
 He continued to serve in the General Court ( state legislature ) , winning election to the state senate annually from 1780 , and being chosen by that body to serve on the Governor 's Council . He stood for election to the United States House of Representatives in the 1789 election ( the first after the adoption of the United States Constitution ) but was defeated by Jonathan Grout . After the death of the immensely popular Governor John Hancock in 1793 , the state 's gubernatorial election of 1794 was a wide open race . Gill was one of several nominees for lieutenant governor , and received more votes than all nominees except the winning gubernatorial candidate , Samuel Adams . With no candidates for lieutenant governor receiving a majority , the General Court decided the election , choosing Gill . He thereafter won annual reelection to that post . In 1796 the aging Adams announced he would not run for reelection the following spring , and again the election was a wide open affair . The party system was still taking shape in the state , and the Federalists nominated Increase Sumner , while more populist factions that had previously supported Hancock and Adams nominated Gill and James Sullivan . Although Gill polled well in Boston and the eastern counties ( present @-@ day Maine ) , the Federalists won a decisive victory over the divided opposition . Since he was also nominated by one faction as lieutenant governor , Gill was again returned to that post . The principal issues in this and subsequent elections were over federal policy : specifically the national response to threats of war with Revolutionary France , and the consequent need for increased taxes to arm the nation . Gill 's politics are unclear : historian Anson Morse is of the opinion that his popularity was not sufficient to head the ticket of either the Federalists or the Democratic @-@ Republicans . Historian John Barry observes that Gill 's term as acting governor , even though it was for essentially a full year , was " too short to be particularly distinguished " . 
 Sumner easily won reelection in 1798 and 1799 , but was ill during the 1799 race , which he won by a landslide . Constitutional issues were raised because he was on his deathbed and it was uncertain that he could even take the oath of office . Sumner finally took the oath of office in early June , but died a few days later , at which point Gill became acting governor . Gill served out Sumner 's term , and was considered a candidate for the governorship as the 1800 election approached . The election primarily pitted Federalist Caleb Strong against Democratic @-@ Republican Elbridge Gerry , and was won by Strong . Gill was derided by his opponents as the preferred candidate of the wealthy , and Federalists were accused of promoting him as a candidate in order to divide the opposition . Gill died on May 20 , before Strong was informed of the victory , resulting in the only time in the state 's history when the offices of governor and lieutenant governor were both formally vacant . As a result , the Governor 's Council ruled the state for ten days . ( The council had governed several times during the colonial period under similar circumstances ; the state constitution was amended in 1918 to remove the council from the gubernatorial succession . ) 
 = = Charitable concerns and legacy = = 
 Gill was a member and major supporter of the Congregational Church in Princeton , and a founding trustee and benefactor of Leicester Academy . He was also for many years president of the Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Indians . Gill , Massachusetts is named in his honor . 
 Gill also made civic contributions to the town of Princeton . Land he donated became the town 's original center ( located about one @-@ half mile from the current town center ) . This land includes one the town 's earliest cemeteries , which is where Gill and other members of his family are interred . His estate , located near the town center , was reputed to be one of the largest and most magnificent of its time in Worcester County . His second wife 's nephew , Ward Nicholas Boylston , inherited the estate ; in addition to many other charitable works , Boylston was a major contributor to the establishment of Princeton 's present town center . 
 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina = 
 The meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina , an extremely destructive Category 5 hurricane , began on August 23 , 2005 when it originated as Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas . The next day , the tropical depression strengthened to a tropical storm , and was named Katrina ; it proceeded to make landfall on the southern tip of the U.S. state of Florida as a minimal hurricane . 
 In passing across Florida , Katrina did not attain any more strength but did manage to maintain hurricane status . After passing over Florida , the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed it to rapidly intensify to the sixth strongest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history . Afterward , Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Buras @-@ Triumph , Louisiana , and once more near the Mississippi / Louisiana border . Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes on August 31 , when it was absorbed by a cold front . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern Bahamas at 5 : 00 p.m. EDT ( 2100 UTC ) on August 23 , 2005 , partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten , which had dissipated due to the effects of a nearby upper tropospheric trough . While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic indicate that the old name / number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates , satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new , much more advanced system , which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve . Simultaneously , the trough in the upper troposphere weakened , causing the wind shear in the area to relax , thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop . In a later re @-@ analysis , it was determined that the low @-@ level circulation of Ten had completely detached and dissipated , with only the remnant mid @-@ level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave . As a result , the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met . 
 = = First landfall = = 
 As the atmospheric conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were favorable for tropical development , the system began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24 . A burst of convection allowed Katrina to become the fifth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25 , only two hours before it made landfall around 6 : 30 p.m. EST ( 2230 UTC ) between Hallandale Beach and Aventura , Florida . Katrina struck the peninsula with 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) winds , and had a well @-@ defined eye on NEXRAD weather radar , which remained intact throughout its passage over Florida . Parts of the Florida Keys experienced tropical storm winds throughout August 26 , with the Dry Tortugas briefly experiencing hurricane @-@ force winds . 
 = = Gulf of Mexico = = 
 The initial National Hurricane Center forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall , eventually to hit the Florida Panhandle approximately three to four days later . Katrina , however , continued a westerly and west @-@ southwesterly track , which eventually shifted the forecast track westward to New Orleans . 
 Immediately after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico , the low wind shear , good upper @-@ level outflow , and the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf Loop Current caused Katrina to intensify rapidly . On August 27 , the storm was upgraded to Category 3 intensity , becoming the third major hurricane of the season . An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification of maximum winds for about 18 hours , but almost doubled the radius of the storm . A second period of rapid intensification started by 7 : 00 p.m. CDT on August 27 , and by 12 : 40 a.m. CDT on August 28 , Katrina was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) . It became a Category 5 ( the first in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Allen 25 years prior ) storm by 7 : 00 a.m. CDT , twelve hours after the beginning of the second round of rapid intensification , and reached its peak intensity at 1 : 00 p.m. CDT with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) , gusts of 215 mph ( 344 km / h ) and a central pressure of 902 mbar ( 26 @.@ 64 inHg ) . The minimum pressure made Katrina , at the time , the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record ( Hurricanes Rita and Wilma would later surpass Katrina that same year ) . As the hurricane approached New Orleans , the Weather Forecast Office in Slidell , Louisiana issued two strongly worded warnings of the storm 's danger . 
 By the afternoon of August 28 , the storm was large enough that some areas of the Gulf Coast were already experiencing tropical storm @-@ force winds . The center of Katrina was about 180 statute miles ( 290 km ) from the mouth of the Mississippi River , but tropical storm @-@ force winds extended 230 mi ( 370 km ) from the center of the storm , and hurricane @-@ force winds extended about 105 miles ( 170 km ) away . Overnight on August 29 , and into the morning of the next day , Katrina quickly weakened ( in terms of maximum sustained winds ) as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle . The inner eyewall deteriorated before an outer eyewall had fully formed , playing an important role in the weakening . In 18 hours , the hurricane 's maximum sustained winds decreased from 170 mph ( 280 km / h ) to 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . However , storm surge remained high at landfall because large waves greater than 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) in height were generated beforehand ( with a buoy recording a 55 ft / 16 @.@ 7 m wave at sea ) , when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category 3 hurricane . 
 = = Second and third landfalls = = 
 Katrina made its second landfall at 6 : 10 a.m. CDT on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) near Buras @-@ Triumph , Louisiana . Because Katrina had just weakened from Category 4 and due to the shape of the coastline , sustained Category 4 winds likely existed on land while the eye was over water . At landfall , hurricane @-@ force winds extended 120 miles ( 190 km ) from the center , the storm 's pressure was 920 mbar ( 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) , and its forward speed was 15 mph ( 24 km / h ) . As it made its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline , most communities in Plaquemines , St. Bernard Parish , and Slidell in St. Tammany Parish were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall , which also grazed eastern New Orleans , causing in excess of $ 1 billion worth of damage to the city ( see Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans ) . 
 Original estimates indicated that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category 4 hurricane , with 135 mph ( 220 km / h ) winds ; however , as indicated above , the storm weakened just before landfall to Category 3 intensity . The reasons for this weakening are not completely known yet ; while the eye @-@ wall replacement cycle played a part , slightly increasing shear , dropping sea @-@ surface temperatures , dry air on the western semicircle of the storm and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone . This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico : all cyclones with minimum central pressures of 973 mbar ( 28 @.@ 73 inHg ) or less have weakened over the 12 hours before making landfall in the Gulf Coast of the United States . 
 A few hours later , after weakening slightly , Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana – Mississippi border with 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) sustained winds and 928 mbar ( 27 @.@ 37 inHg ) pressure , still at Category 3 intensity . Its minimum pressure at its second landfall was 920 mbar ( 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) , making Katrina the third strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States , behind Hurricane Camille 's 909 mbar ( 26 @.@ 85 inHg ) reading in 1969 , and the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane 's 892 mbar ( 26 @.@ 35 inHg ) record . 
 Because the storm was so large , highly destructive eye @-@ wall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record storm surges onshore , smashing the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast , including towns in Mississippi such as Waveland , Bay St. Louis , Pass Christian , Long Beach , Gulfport , Biloxi , Ocean Springs , Gautier and Pascagoula , and , in Alabama , Bayou La Batre . The surges peaked at 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) in Bay St. Louis , Mississippi , and at 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) as far away as Mobile , Alabama , which saw its highest storm surge since 1917 . Storm surge was particularly high due to the hydrology of the region , the hurricane 's extreme size , and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall . As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi , high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state . 
 = = Demise = = 
 Katrina maintained hurricane strength well into Mississippi , but weakened thereafter , losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles ( 240 km ) inland , near Meridian , Mississippi . It was downgraded to a tropical depression near Clarksville , Tennessee and broke in half . One half continued to race northward , affecting the Central United States along its path , and was last distinguishable in the eastern Great Lakes region on August 31 . On August 31 , Katrina was absorbed by a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical low , causing 1 @.@ 97 – 6 @.@ 69 inches ( 50 – 170 mm ) of rain in 12 hours , as well as gale @-@ force wind gusts from 31 to 61 mph ( 50 to 98 km / h ) in southeastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick . In the region of Saguenay and Côte @-@ Nord , rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads . The Côte @-@ Nord region was isolated from the rest of Quebec for at least 1 week . The other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the Appalachians , primarily leading to a significant tornado outbreak in the area from central Georgia to central Pennsylvania , killing two people and causing millions of dollars in additional damage . 
 At 11 : 00 p.m. EDT on August 31 , the center of the remnant low of what was Katrina had been completely absorbed by a frontal boundary in southeastern Canada , with no discernible circulation .
