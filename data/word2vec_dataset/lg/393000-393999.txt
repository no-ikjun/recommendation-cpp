 The French Revolution was integral to the expansion of French cuisine , because it effectively abolished guilds . This meant any one chef could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished . Marie @-@ Antoine Carême was born in 1784 , five years before the onset of the Revolution . He spent his younger years working at a <unk> until being discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand @-@ Périgord , who would later cook for the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte . Prior to his employment with Talleyrand , Carême had become known for his pièces <unk> , which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture . 
 More important to Carême 's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine . The basis for his style of cooking came from his sauces , which he named mother sauces . Often referred to as fond , meaning " foundations " , these base sauces , espagnole , velouté , and béchamel , are still known today . Each of these sauces would be made in large quantities in his kitchen , as they were then capable of forming the basis of multiple derivatives . Carême had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire . In his writings , soufflés appear for the first time . Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant , he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that had existed beforehand . Central to his codification of the cuisine were Le Maître d 'hôtel français ( 1822 ) , Le Cuisinier parisien ( 1828 ) and L 'Art de la cuisine française au dix @-@ <unk> siècle ( 1833 – 5 ) .

 Georges Auguste Escoffier is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of haute cuisine and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France . His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s – 1890s . The Savoy Hotel managed by César Ritz was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked , but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921 . He created a system of " parties " called the brigade system , which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations . 
 These five stations included the " garde manger " that prepared cold dishes ; the " <unk> " prepared starches and vegetables , the " rôtisseur " prepared roasts , grilled and fried dishes ; the " saucier " prepared sauces and soups ; and the " <unk> " prepared all pastry and desserts items . This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one 's own , now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish . An example used is " oeufs au plat Meyerbeer " , the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish , while in the new system , the eggs would be prepared by the <unk> , kidney grilled by the rôtisseur , truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants . 
 Escoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal . He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence , and then he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912 . This type of service embraced the service à la russe ( serving meals in separate courses on individual plates ) , which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s . Escoffier 's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903 , which established the fundamentals of French cookery . The book was a collaboration with <unk> Gilbert , E. <unk> , A. Suzanne , B. <unk> , Ch . Dietrich , A. Caillat and others . The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high @-@ profile chefs to this new style of cooking . 
 Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter <unk> , which are the essence of flavor taken from fish , meat and vegetables . This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish , rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past . Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême , Dubois and ideas from Taillevent 's <unk> , which had a modern version published in 1897 . A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine . 
 Expensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients , making the dishes much less humble . The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself , who invented many new dishes , such as <unk> Melba and crêpes Suzette . Escoffier updated Le Guide Culinaire four times during his lifetime , noting in the foreword to the book 's first edition that even with its 5 @,@ 000 recipes , the book should not be considered an " exhaustive " text , and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book , " it would no longer be so tomorrow , because progress marches on each day . "

 The 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine , especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the Colonial Wars Portugal was fighting in Africa . Many new dishes were introduced , as well as techniques . This period is also marked by the appearance of the " Nouvelle Cuisine . " 
 The term nouvelle cuisine has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness , lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine . In the 1740s , Menon first used the term , but the cooking of Vincent La Chapelle and François Marin was also considered modern . In the 1960s , Henri Gault and Christian Millau revived it to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse , Jean and Pierre <unk> , Michel <unk> , Roger <unk> and Raymond Oliver . These chefs were working toward rebelling against the " orthodoxy " of Escoffier 's cuisine . Some of the chefs were students of Fernand Point at the Pyramide in Vienne , and had left to open their own restaurants . Gault and Millau " discovered the formula " contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking . 
 The first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking . Second , the cooking times for most fish , seafood , game birds , veal , green vegetables and pâtés was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors . Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic . The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients . Fourth , large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus . Fifth , strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used . Sixth , they stopped using heavy sauces such as espagnole and béchamel thickened with flour based " roux " , in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs , quality butter , lemon juice , and vinegar . Seventh , they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes . Eighth , new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used ; Bocuse even used microwave ovens . Ninth , the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes . Tenth and finally , the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings . 
 Some have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation . By the mid @-@ 1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking , although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained .

At the end of summer , mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France . The hunting season begins in September and runs through February . Game of all kinds is eaten , often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt . Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring , and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities . 
 With the advent of deep @-@ freeze and the air @-@ conditioned <unk> , these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto , but they are still observed , in some cases due to legal restrictions .

 Le petit déjeuner ( breakfast ) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of <unk> ( slices ) of French bread with butter and honey or jam , sometimes brioche , along with café au lait ( also called " café crème " ) , or black coffee , or tea , more rarely hot chicory . Children often drink hot chocolate in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts . <unk> , pain aux raisins or pain au chocolat ( also named <unk> in the south of France ) are mostly included as a weekend treat . Breakfast of some kind is always served in cafés opening early in the day . 
 There also exist salty versions of the French breakfast . For example , " le petit déjeuner <unk> " or " petit déjeuner <unk> " with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or not by boiled ham , called " <unk> " , which you dip in a soft @-@ boiled egg , along drinking some fruit juice and hot drink . Another variation called " le petit déjeuner chasseur " , meant to be very hearty , is served with pâté and other charcuterie products . A more classy version , called " le petit déjeuner du <unk> " proposes also delicatessens such as gizzard , bacon , salmon , <unk> , or croque @-@ monsieur , with or without soft @-@ boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee / tea / chocolate along fruits or fruit juice . When the egg is cooked sunny @-@ side over the croque @-@ monsieur , it is called a croque @-@ madame . In Germinal and other novels , Émile Zola also reported the <unk> : two long bread slices stuffed with butter , cheese and or ham . It can be eaten as a standing / walking breakfast , or meant as a " second " one before the lunch . 
 In the movie " Bienvenue chez les Ch <unk> " , Philippe Abrams ( <unk> <unk> ) and Antoine Bailleul ( Dany Boon ) share together countless breakfasts consisting of <unk> de <unk> ( a rather strong cheese ) along with their hot chicory .

Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2 : 30 pm . Some restaurants close on Monday during lunch . 
 In large cities , a majority of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria , which normally serve complete meals as described above ; it is therefore not usual for students to bring their own lunch food . Where the company does not operate a cafeteria , it is common for white @-@ collar workers to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits . These can be used in most restaurants , supermarkets and <unk> ; however , workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time considerations . In smaller cities and towns , some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch , generating four rush hours during the day .

 = = = History = = = 
 The modern restaurant has its origins in French culture . Prior to the late 18th century , diners who wished to " dine out " would visit their local guild member 's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them . However , guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated them to . These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day @-@ to @-@ day but at set times . The guest would be offered the meal table d <unk> , which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes , sometimes none at all . 
 The first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered restorative <unk> , or restaurants – these words being the origin of the name " restaurant " . This step took place during the 1760s – 1770s . These locations were open at all times of the day , featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices . These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had " lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests . " 
 In 1782 Antoine <unk> , pastry chef to the future Louis XVIII , opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time – the Grande Taverne de Londres – in the arcades of the Palais @-@ Royal . Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France , in the period leading up to the French Revolution . It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior , and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds . This and the substantial discretionary income of the French Directory 's nouveau riche helped keep these new restaurants in business .

 Larger restaurants and hotels in France employ extensive staff and are commonly referred to as either the kitchen brigade for the kitchen staff or dining room brigade system for the dining room staff . This system was created by Georges Auguste Escoffier . This structured team system delegates responsibilities to different individuals that specialize in certain tasks . The following is a list of positions held both in the kitchen and dining rooms brigades in France :

 The initial language of this article was French . 
 = Lemur = 
 Lemurs ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) are a clade of strepsirrhine primates endemic to the island of Madagascar . The word " lemur " derives from the word lemures ( ghosts or spirits ) from Roman mythology and was first used to describe a slender loris due to its nocturnal habits and slow pace , but was later applied to the primates on Madagascar . As with other strepsirrhine primates , such as lorises , pottos , and galagos ( bush babies ) , lemurs share resemblance with basal primates . In this regard , lemurs are often confused with ancestral primates , when in actuality , lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes , but evolved independently . 
 Due to Madagascar 's highly seasonal climate , lemur evolution has produced a level of species diversity rivaling that of any other primate group . Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2 @,@ 000 years ago , there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla . Today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs , and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s ; however , lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used . Even the higher @-@ level taxonomy is disputed , with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes , while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines , placing all lemurs in superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea . 
 Ranging in weight from the 30 grams ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) mouse lemur to the 9 kilograms ( 20 lb ) indri , lemurs share many common , basal primate traits , such as divergent digits on their hands and feet and nails instead of claws ( in most species ) . However , their brain @-@ to @-@ body size ratio is smaller than that of anthropoid primates , and among many other traits they share with other strepsirrhine primates , they have a " wet nose " ( rhinarium ) . Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals . Many lemur adaptations are in response to Madagascar 's highly seasonal environment . Lemurs have relatively low basal metabolic rates and may exhibit seasonal breeding , dormancy ( such as hibernation or torpor ) , or female social dominance . Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves , while some are specialists . Although many share similar diets , different species of lemur share the same forests by differentiating niches . 
 Lemur research focused on taxonomy and specimen collection during the 18th and 19th centuries . Although field observations trickled in from early explorers , modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior did not begin in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s . Initially hindered by political instability and turmoil on Madagascar during the mid @-@ 1970s , field studies resumed in the 1980s and have greatly increased our understanding of these primates . Research facilities like the Duke Lemur Center have provided research opportunities under more controlled settings . Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution . However , many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting . Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests , illegal logging , widespread poverty , and political instability hinder and undermine conservation efforts . Because of these threats and their declining numbers , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) considers lemurs to be the world 's most endangered mammals , noting that — as of 2013 — up to 90 % of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25 years . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Carl Linnaeus , the founder of modern binomial nomenclature , gave lemurs their name as early as 1758 , when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae . He included three species under the genus Lemur : Lemur tardigradus ( the red slender loris , now known as Loris tardigradus ) , Lemur catta ( the ring @-@ tailed lemur ) , and Lemur volans ( the Philippine colugo , now known as Cynocephalus volans ) . 
 Although the term " lemur " was first intended for slender lorises , it was soon limited to the endemic Malagasy primates , which have been known as " lemurs " ever since . The name derives from the Latin term lemures , which refers to specters or ghosts that were exorcised during the Lemuria festival of ancient Rome . According to Linnaeus ' own explanation , the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris . Being familiar with the works of Virgil and Ovid and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme , Linnaeus adapted the term " lemur " for these nocturnal primates . However , Dunkel et al. noted in 2012 that it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost @-@ like appearance , reflective eyes , and ghostly cries of lemurs . It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that the some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors , but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India , according to Dunkel et al . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini . Like other strepsirrhine primates , such as lorises , pottos , and galagos , they share ancestral ( or plesiomorphic ) traits with early primates . In this regard , lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates ; however , lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes ( simians ) . Instead , they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar . All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene ( 56 to 34 mya ) or Paleocene ( 66 to 56 mya ) . Adapiforms , however , lack a specialized arrangement of teeth , known as a toothcomb , which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess . A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids ( loris @-@ like ) primates . This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups . Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs , the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids , a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies . The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65 mya according to molecular studies , although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55 mya for this divergence . However , the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene . 
 Once part of the supercontinent Gondwana , the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern Africa ( ~ 160 mya ) , Antarctica ( ~ 80 – 130 mya ) , and India ( ~ 80 – 90 mya ) . Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65 mya , they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel , a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560 km ( 350 mi ) . In 1915 , paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar ( including lemurs ) can only be accounted for by random rafting events , where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation , which get flushed out to sea from major rivers . This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years . In the 1940s , American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term " sweepstakes hypothesis " for such random events . Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar , but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island . In January 2010 , a report demonstrated that around 60 mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1 @,@ 650 km ( 1 @,@ 030 mi ) south of their present @-@ day positions , placing them in a different ocean gyre , producing currents that ran counter to what they are today . The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today , which would have pushed a raft along faster , shortening the trip to 30 days or less — short enough for a small mammal to survive easily . As the continental plates drifted northward , the currents gradually changed , and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed , effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa . Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors , the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups , such as squirrels . They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys , which evolved later . The intelligence , aggression , and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment . 
 = = = Distribution and diversity = = = 
 Lemurs have adapted to fill many open ecological niches since making their way to Madagascar . Their diversity in both behavior and morphology ( outward appearance ) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world . Ranging in size from the 30 g ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur , the world 's smallest primate , to the recently extinct 160 – 200 kg ( 350 – 440 lb ) Archaeoindris fontoynonti , lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion , varying levels of social complexity , and unique adaptations to the local climate . 
 Lemurs lack any shared traits that make them stand out from all other primates . Different types of lemurs have evolved unique combinations of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar 's harsh , seasonal climate . These traits can include seasonal fat storage , <unk> ( including torpor and hibernation ) , small group sizes , low encephalization ( relative brain size ) , <unk> ( activity both day and night ) , and strict breeding seasons . Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to have given rise to three other relatively common lemur traits : female social dominance , sexual monomorphism , and male – male competition for mates involving low levels of agonism , such as sperm competition . 
 Before the arrival of humans roughly 1500 to 2000 years ago , lemurs were found all across the island . However , early settlers quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture ( known locally as tavy ) , restricting lemurs to approximately 10 % of the island 's area , ~ 60 @,@ 000 km2 ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . Today , the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast , where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest . Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity , habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply , and their diversity has diminished , with the recent extinction of at least 17 species in eight genera , known collectively as the subfossil lemurs . Most of the approximately 100 species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered . Unless trends change , extinctions are likely to continue . 
 Until recently , giant lemurs existed on Madagascar . Now represented only by recent or subfossil remains , they were modern forms that were once part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation . Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives . All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant ( living ) forms , some weighing as much as 200 kg ( 440 lb ) , and are thought to have been active during the day . Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance , they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied . Large parts of Madagascar , which are now devoid of forests and lemurs , once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20 lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes . 
 = = = Taxonomic classification and phylogeny = = = 
 From a taxonomic standpoint , the term " lemur " originally referred to the genus Lemur , which currently contains only the ring @-@ tailed lemur . The term is now used in the colloquial sense in reference to all Malagasy primates . 
 Lemur taxonomy is controversial , and not all experts agree , particularly with the recent increase in the number of recognized species . According to Russell Mittermeier , the president of Conservation International ( CI ) , taxonomist Colin Groves , and others , there are nearly 100 recognized species or subspecies of extant ( or living ) lemur , divided into five families and 15 genera . Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs , an additional three families , eight genera , and 17 species can be included in the total . In contrast , other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation , instead preferring a total closer to 50 species . 
 The classification of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial , although the most experts agree on the same phylogenetic tree . In one taxonomy , infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies , Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids ( lorisids and galagos ) . Alternatively , the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder , Lorisiformes , separate from the lemurs . In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves , the aye @-@ aye was placed in its own infraorder , Chiromyiformes , while the rest of the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes . 
 Although it is generally agreed that the aye @-@ aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade , the relationship between the other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12 million @-@ year window between the Late Eocene ( 42 mya ) and into the Oligocene ( 30 mya ) . Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae , some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first , while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off . 
 Lemur taxonomy has changed significantly since the first taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . One of the greatest challenges has been the classification of the aye @-@ aye , which has been a topic of debate up until very recently . Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866 , early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye @-@ aye ( genus Daubentonia ) was a primate , rodent , or marsupial . However , the placement of the aye @-@ aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently . Based on its anatomy , researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid , a sister group to all strepsirrhines , and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates . Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes , and in 2008 , Russell Mittermeier , Colin Groves , and others ignored addressing higher @-@ level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families , including Daubentoniidae . 
 Relationships among lemur families have also proven to be problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved . To further complicate the issue , several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar , such as Bugtilemur , have been classified as lemurs . However , scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence , and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic . Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs ( Megaladapidae ) . Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition , they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies . 
 More taxonomic changes have occurred at the genus level , although these revisions have proven more conclusive , often supported by genetic and molecular analysis . The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring @-@ tailed lemur , ruffed lemurs , and brown lemurs due to a host of morphological differences . 
 Due to several taxonomic revisions by Russell Mittermeier , Colin Groves , and others , the number of recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008 . With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic research , as well as ongoing field studies , particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs , the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing . However , the rapid increase in the number of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers . Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used , conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection . Others favor a more thorough analysis . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 Lemurs vary greatly in size . They include the smallest primates in the world and , until recently , also included some of the largest . They currently range in size from about 30 g ( 1 @.@ 1 oz ) for Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur ( Microcebus <unk> ) up to 7 – 9 kg ( 15 – 20 lb ) for the indri ( Indri indri ) and diademed sifaka ( Propithecus diadema ) . When recently extinct species are considered , the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160 – 200 kg ( 350 – 440 lb ) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti . 
 Like all primates , lemurs have five divergent digits with nails ( in most cases ) on their hands and feet . Most lemurs possess a laterally compressed , elongated nail , called a toilet @-@ claw , on the second toe and use it for scratching and grooming . In addition to the toilet @-@ claw , lemurs share a variety of other traits with other strepsirrhine primates , which include a rhinarium ( or " wet nose " ) ; a fully functional vomeronasal organ , which detects pheromones ; a postorbital bar and the lack of postorbital closure ( a wall of thin bone behind the eye ) ; orbits ( bony sockets that enclose the eye ) that are not fully facing forward ; left and right mandible ( lower jaw ) bones that are not fully fused ; and a small brain @-@ to @-@ body mass ratio . 
 Additional traits shared with other prosimian primates ( strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers ) include a bicornuate ( two @-@ horned ) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation . Because their thumbs are only pseudo @-@ opposable , making their movement less independent of the other fingers , their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects . On their feet , they have a widely abducted hallux ( first toe ) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs . A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail , a trait found only in New World monkeys , particularly <unk> , among primates . Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell , a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates , but not with the visually oriented higher primates . This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner . 
 Lemurs are a diverse group of primates in terms of morphology and physiology . Some lemurs , such as the sportive lemurs and indriids , have longer hind limbs than forelimbs , making them excellent leapers . Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory , exhibiting enlarged salivary glands , a spacious stomach , and an elongated caecum ( lower gut ) that facilitates fermentation . The hairy @-@ eared dwarf lemur ( Allocebus <unk> ) reportedly has a very long tongue , allowing it to feed on nectar . Likewise , the red @-@ bellied lemur ( Eulemur rubriventer ) has a feathery brush @-@ shaped tongue , also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen . The aye @-@ aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates , making it stand out among the lemurs . Such traits include continuously growing , rodent @-@ like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds ; a highly mobile , filiform ( filament @-@ shaped ) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes ; large , bat @-@ like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees ; and use of self @-@ generated acoustical cues to forage . 
 Lemurs are unusual since they have great variability in their social structure , yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology . However , some species tend towards having larger females , and two species of true lemur ( genus Eulemur ) , the gray @-@ headed lemur ( E. <unk> ) and the red lemur ( E. rufus ) , exhibit size differences in canine teeth . True lemurs show sexual dichromatism ( sexual differences in fur coloration ) , but the difference between the genders varies from strikingly obvious , as in the blue @-@ eyed black lemur ( E. <unk> ) , to nearly imperceptible in the case of the common brown lemur ( E. fulvus ) . 
 Crypsis , or the inability of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species , has recently been discovered among lemurs , particularly within the sportive lemurs ( Lepilemur ) and mouse lemurs ( Microcebus ) . With sportive lemurs , subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences , but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations . In the case of mouse lemurs , the gray mouse lemur ( M. murinus ) , golden @-@ brown mouse lemur ( M. <unk> ) , and Goodman 's mouse lemur ( M. <unk> ) were considered the same species until recently , when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species . 
 = = = Dentition = = = 
 The lemur dentition is heterodont ( having multiple tooth morphologies ) and derives from an ancestral primate permanent dentition of 2 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 32 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 3 . Indriids , sportive lemurs , the aye @-@ aye , and the extinct sloth lemurs , monkey lemurs , and koala lemurs have reduced dentitions , having lost incisors , canines , or premolars . The ancestral deciduous dentition is 2 @.@ 1 @.@ 32 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 , but young indriids , aye @-@ <unk> , koala lemurs , sloth lemurs , and probably monkey lemurs have fewer deciduous teeth . 
 There are also noticeable differences in dental morphology and tooth topography between lemurs . Indri , for instance , have teeth that are perfectly adapted for shearing leaves and crushing seeds . In the toothcomb of most lemurs , the bottom incisors and canine teeth are procumbent ( face forward rather than up ) and finely spaced , thus providing a tool for either grooming or feeding . For instance , indri use their toothcomb not only for grooming , but also to pry out the large seeds from the tough <unk> of <unk> fruits , while fork @-@ marked lemurs use their relatively long toothcomb to cut through tree bark to induce the flow of tree sap . The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or " under @-@ tongue " , a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris . The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized , serrated points that rake between the front teeth . 
 Only the aye @-@ aye , the extinct giant aye @-@ aye , and the largest of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a functional strepsirrhine toothcomb . In the case of the aye @-@ aye , the morphology of the deciduous incisors , which are lost shortly after birth , indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb . These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open @-@ rooted , continually growing ( hypselodont ) incisors . 
 The toothcomb in lemurs normally consists of six teeth ( four incisors and two canines ) , although indriids , monkey lemurs , and some sloth lemurs only have a four @-@ tooth toothcomb due to the loss of either a canine or an incisor . Because the lower canine is either included in the toothcomb or lost , the lower dentition can be difficult to read , especially since the first premolar ( P2 ) is often shaped like a canine ( caniniform ) to fill the canine 's role . In folivorous ( leaf @-@ eating ) lemurs , except for indriids , the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent . Used together with the toothcomb on the mandible ( lower jaw ) , this complex is reminiscent of an ungulate browsing pad . 
 Lemurs are unusual among primates for their rapid dental development , particularly among the largest species . For example , indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption . By contrast , anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development . Lemurs are also <unk> precocious at birth , and have their full permanent dentition at weaning . 
 Lemurs generally have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates . This may result in extra wear and breakage to the anterior ( front ) teeth due to heavy use in grooming , feeding , and fighting . Little other dental health information is available for lemurs , except that wild ring @-@ tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit <unk> maxillary canines ( seen as open wounds on the muzzle ) and tooth decay , possibly due to the consumption of non @-@ native foods . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 The sense of smell , or olfaction , is highly important to lemurs and is frequently used in communication . Lemurs have long snouts ( compared to the short snouts of <unk> ) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells , although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since it is not the relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell , but the density of olfactory receptors . Instead , the long snouts may facilitate better chewing . 
 The wet nose , or rhinarium , is a trait shared with other strepsirrhines and many other mammals , but not with haplorrhine primates . Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell , it is actually a touch @-@ based sense organ that connects with a well @-@ developed vomeronasal organ ( VNO ) . Since pheromones are usually large , non @-@ volatile molecules , the rhinarium is used to touch a scent @-@ marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum ( the nasal mid @-@ line cleft ) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate . 
 To communicate with smell , which is useful at night , lemurs will scent mark with urine as well as scent glands located on the wrists , inside elbow , genital regions , or the neck . The scrotal skin of most male lemurs has scent glands . Ruffed lemurs ( genus Varecia ) and male sifakas have a gland at the base of their neck , while the greater bamboo lemur ( Prolemur simus ) and the ring @-@ tailed lemur have glands inside the upper arms near the axilla . Male ring @-@ tailed lemurs also have scent glands on the inside of their forearms , adjacent to a thorn @-@ like spur , which they use to gouge , and simultaneously , scent @-@ mark tree branches . They will also wipe their tails between their forearms and then engage in " stink fights " by waving their tail at their opponents . 
 Lemurs ( and strepsirrhines in general ) are considered to be less visually oriented than the higher primates , since they rely so heavily on their sense of smell and pheromone detection . The fovea on the retina ; which yields higher visual acuity , is not well @-@ developed . The postorbital septum ( or bony closure behind the eye ) in haplorrhine primates is thought to stabilize the eye slightly , allowing for the evolution of the fovea . With only a postorbital bar , lemurs have been unable to develop a fovea . Therefore , regardless of their activity pattern ( nocturnal , cathemeral , or diurnal ) , lemurs exhibit low visual acuity and high retinal summation . Lemurs can see a wider visual field , however , than anthropoid primates due to a slight difference in the angle between the eyes , as shown in the following table : 
 Although they lack a fovea , some diurnal lemurs have a cone @-@ rich , although less clustered , area centralis . This area centralis has a high rod @-@ to @-@ cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far , whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea . Once again , this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids . Furthermore , the rod @-@ to @-@ cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species . For instance , Verreaux 's sifaka ( Propithecus verreauxi ) and the indri ( Indri indri ) have only a few large cones scattered along their predominantly rod @-@ dominated retina . The eyes of the ring @-@ tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods . Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs , on the other hand , have retinas made up entirely of rod cells . 
 Since cone cells make color vision possible , the high prevalence of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest they have not evolved color vision . The most studied lemur , the ring @-@ tailed lemur , has been shown to have blue @-@ yellow vision , but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues . Due to polymorphism in opsin genes , which code for color receptivity , trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species , such as Coquerel 's sifaka ( Propithecus coquereli ) and the red ruffed lemur ( Varecia rubra ) . Most lemurs , therefore , are either <unk> or dichromats . 
 Most lemurs have retained the tapetum lucidum , a reflective layer of tissue in the eye , which is found in many vertebrates . This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates , and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs . The strepsirrhine <unk> tapetum is unique among mammals because it is made up of crystalline riboflavin , and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity . Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs , there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs , such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur , as well as the ruffed lemurs . Since the <unk> in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation , however , the exceptions are still debatable . 
 Lemurs also have a third eyelid known as a nictitating membrane , whereas most other primates have a lesser developed plica <unk> . The nictitating membrane keeps the cornea moist and clean by sweeping across the eye . 
 = = = Metabolism = = = 
 Lemurs have low basal metabolic rates ( <unk> ) , which helps them to conserve energy during the dry season , when water and food are scarce . They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20 % below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass . The red @-@ tailed sportive lemur ( Lepilemur <unk> ) , for instance , reportedly has one of the lowest metabolic rates among mammals . Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass . Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait , including sunning behaviors , hunched sitting , group huddling , and nest sharing , in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy . Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy . Before dry season , they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located at the base of the tail and hind legs , doubling their weight . At the end of the dry season , their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season . Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Lemur behavior is as variable as lemur morphology . Differences in diet , social systems , activity patterns , locomotion , communication , predator avoidance tactics , breeding systems , and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species apart from the rest . Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller , nocturnal lemurs from the larger , diurnal lemurs , there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Lemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity , although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects ( omnivory ) , while the larger species are more herbivorous , consuming mostly plant material . As with all primates , hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible , whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods . For instance , the ring @-@ tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore . Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur ( Mirza coquereli ) is mostly frugivorous , but will consume insect secretions during the dry season . 
 A common assumption in mammalogy is that small mammals cannot subsist entirely on plant material and must have a high @-@ calorie diet in order to survive . As a result , it was thought that the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein @-@ containing insects ( <unk> ) . Research has shown , however , that mouse lemurs , the smallest living primates , consume more fruit than insects , contradicting the popular hypothesis . 
 Plant material makes up the majority of most lemur diets . Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar ( 55 % ) are exploited by lemurs . Since lemurs are primarily arboreal , most of these exploited species are woody plants , including trees , shrubs , or lianas . Only the ring @-@ tailed lemur , the bamboo lemurs ( genus Hapalemur ) , and the black @-@ and @-@ white ruffed lemur ( Varecia variegata ) are known to consume herbs . While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity , these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs . One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers , fruits , and seeds — common food items in lemur diets . They also occur close to the ground , while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees . Lastly , ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds . Likewise , mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content . Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses , however , such as tannins and alkaloids . The golden bamboo lemur ( Hapalemur aureus ) , for instance , eats giant bamboo ( <unk> madagascariensis ) , which contains high levels of cyanide . This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis ; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown . At the Duke Lemur Center ( DLC ) in the United States , lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy ( <unk> radicans ) , yet have shown no ill effects . 
 Many of the larger lemur species consume leaves ( folivory ) , particularly the indriids . However , some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs ( genus Lepilemur ) and woolly lemurs ( genus Avahi ) also primarily eat leaves , making them the smallest primates that do so . The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter . Collectively , lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families . Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of the part of the leaf or shoot as well as its age . Often , young leaves are preferred over mature leaves . 
 Many lemurs that eat leaves tend to do so during times of fruit scarcity , sometimes suffering weight loss as a result . Most lemur species , including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids , predominantly eat fruit ( frugivory ) when available . Collectively , lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86 native plant families and 15 alien plant families . As with most tropical fruit eaters , the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from Ficus ( fig ) species . In many anthropoid primates , fruit is a primary source of vitamin C , but unlike anthropoid primates , lemurs ( and all strepsirrhines ) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically , captive lemur diets high in vitamin C @-@ rich fruits have been thought to cause <unk> , a type of iron overload disorder , since vitamin C increases iron absorption . Although lemurs in captivity have been shown to be prone to <unk> , the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet , husbandry protocols , and genetic stock . Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species . The ring @-@ tailed lemur , for instance , seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species . 
 Only eight species of lemur are known to be seed predators ( <unk> ) , but this may be under @-@ reported since most observations only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well . These lemurs include some indriids , such as the diademed sifaka ( Propithecus diadema ) , the golden @-@ crowned sifaka ( Propithecus tattersalli ) , the indri , and the aye @-@ aye . The aye @-@ aye , which specializes in structurally defended resources , can chew through <unk> seeds , which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open . At least 36 genera from 23 families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators . 
 Inflorescences ( clusters of flowers ) of at least 60 plant families are eaten by lemurs ranging in size from the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs . If the flowers are not exploited , sometimes the nectar is consumed ( <unk> ) along with the pollen ( <unk> ) . At least 24 native species from 17 plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption . 
 Bark and plant exudates such as tree sap are consumed by a few lemur species . The exploitation of exudates has been reported in 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar . Only the Masoala fork @-@ marked lemur ( Phaner furcifer ) and Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap . Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets , but at least four species eat it : the aye @-@ aye , the red @-@ tailed sportive lemur ( Lepilemur <unk> ) , the common brown lemur ( Eulemur fulvus ) , and Verreaux 's sifaka ( Propithecus verreauxi ) . Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding , except for the aye @-@ aye 's bark feeding on Afzelia <unk> ( genus Afzelia ) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast . 
 Soil consumption ( geophagy ) has also been reported and likely helps with digestion , provides minerals and salts , and helps absorb toxins . <unk> have been observed eating soil from termite mounds , possibly adding beneficial intestinal flora to aid the digestion of cellulose from their folivorous diet . 
 = = = Social systems = = = 
 Lemurs are social and live in groups that usually include fewer than 15 individuals . Observed social organization patterns include " solitary but social " , " fission @-@ fusion " , " pair bonds " , and " multi @-@ male group " . Nocturnal lemurs are mostly solitary but social , foraging alone at night but often nesting in groups during the day . The degree of socialization varies by species , gender , location , and season . In many nocturnal species , for instance , the females , along with their young , will share nests with other females and possibly one male , whose larger home range happens to overlap one or more female nesting groups . In sportive lemurs and fork @-@ marked lemurs , one or two females may share a home range , possibly with a male . In addition to sharing nests , they will also interact vocally or physically with their range @-@ mate while they forage at night . Diurnal lemurs exhibit many of the social systems seen in monkeys and apes , living in relatively permanent and cohesive social groups . Multi @-@ male groups are the most common , just as they are in most anthropoid primates . True lemurs utilize this social system , often living in groups of ten or less . Ruffed lemurs have been shown to live in fission @-@ fusion societies , and Indri forms pair bonds . 
 Some lemurs exhibit female philopatry , where females stay within their natal range and the males migrate upon reaching maturity , and in other species both sexes will migrate . In some cases , female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female @-@ bonded multi @-@ male groups , such as those of the ring @-@ tailed lemur , Milne @-@ Edwards ' sifaka ( Propithecus edwardsi ) , and the Verreaux 's sifaka . Their ancestors may have been more solitary , with females that lived in mother @-@ daughter pairs ( or dyads ) . Over time , these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother @-@ daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range . If this is true , then multi @-@ male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in catarrhine primates ( Old World monkeys and apes ) . 
 The presence of female social dominance sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals ; in most primate societies , males are dominant unless females band together to form coalitions that displace them . However , many Eulemur species are exceptions and the greater bamboo lemur ( Prolemur simus ) does not exhibit female dominance . When females are dominant within a group , the way they maintain dominance varies . Ring @-@ tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression . Male crowned lemurs ( Eulemur coronatus ) , on the other hand , will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them . Female aggression is often associated with , but not limited to , feeding . 
 There have been many hypotheses that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not , but no consensus has been reached after decades of research . The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the high costs of reproduction and the scarcity of resources available . Indeed , female dominance has been shown to be linked to increased maternal investment . However , when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates , other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs . In 2008 , a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory . It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity , the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose . Consequently , the female , with higher resource needs for pregnancy , lactation , and maternal care , was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males . This , however , assumed monomorphism between sexes . The following year , a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism , stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year , males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding : copulatory plugs , which block the female reproductive tract , preventing other males from successfully mating with her , and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism . 
 In general , levels of agonism ( or aggression ) tend to correlate with relative canine height . The ring @-@ tailed lemur has long , sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes , and it also exhibits high levels of agonism . The Indri , on the other hand , has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression . When neighboring groups of the same species defend their territories , the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense . In sifakas , these ritualized combats involve staring , growling , scent @-@ marking , and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree . The indri defends its home range with ritualized " singing " battles . 
 Like other primates , lemurs groom socially ( <unk> ) to ease tensions and solidify relationships . They groom in greeting , when waking up , when settling in for sleep , between mother and infant , in juvenile relations , and for sexual advances . Unlike anthropoid primates , who part the fur with the hands and pick out particles with the fingers or mouth , lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb . Despite the differences in technique , lemurs groom with the same frequency and for the same reasons as anthropoids . 
 = = = Activity patterns = = = 
 The biological rhythm can vary from nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs . <unk> is not seen in any other living strepsirrhine . <unk> , where an animal is active sporadically both day and night , occurs among some of the larger lemurs . Few if any other primates exhibit this sort of activity cycle , either regularly or irregularly under changing environmental conditions . The most heavily studied cathemeral lemurs are the true lemurs . Although the mongoose lemur ( E. mongoz ) is the best @-@ documented example , every species in the genus studied has shown some degree of cathemeral behavior , although night activity is often restricted by light availability and moon periodicity . This type of behavior was first documented in the 1960s in true lemur species as well as other Lemuridae species , such as ruffed lemurs and bamboo lemurs . Initially described as " crepuscular " ( active at dawn and dusk ) , anthropologist Ian Tattersall stimulated additional research and coined the new term " cathemeral " , although many non @-@ anthropologists prefer the terms " circadian " or " diel " . 
 In order to conserve energy and water in their highly seasonal environment , mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered . They are the only primates known to do so . They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season , when food and water are scarce , and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season . Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy , whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation . Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days , but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year , particularly on the west coast of Madagascar . 
 Dwarf lemurs are the only primates known to hibernate for extended periods . Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions , which have to awaken regularly for a few days , dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation ( May through September ) . Before and after this deep hibernation , there are two months ( April and October ) of transition , where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves . Unlike any other hibernating mammal , the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable . 
 Other lemurs that do not exhibit dormancy conserve energy by selecting <unk> microhabitats ( such as tree holes ) , sharing nests , and reducing exposed body surfaces , such as by hunched sitting and group huddling . Also , the ring @-@ tailed lemur , ruffed lemurs , and sifakas are commonly seen sunning , thus using solar radiation to warm their bodies instead of metabolic heat . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Locomotor behavior in lemurs , both living and extinct , is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids . Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping ( including <unk> behavior ) , seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs ; slow ( loris @-@ like ) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion , once exhibited by Mesopropithecus ; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion , seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs ; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion , seen in the ring @-@ tailed lemur ; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion , once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus ; and sloth @-@ like suspensory locomotion , once exhibited by many of the sloth lemurs , such as Palaeopropithecus . The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur ( Hapalemur <unk> ) has even been reported to be a good swimmer . Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs , the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal ( and occasionally terrestrial ) quadrupeds . 
 The jumping prowess of the indriids have been well documented and are popular among ecotourists visiting Madagascar . Using their long , powerful back legs , they catapult themselves into the air and land in an upright posture on a nearby tree , with both hands and feet tightly gripping the trunk . Indriids can leap up to 10 m ( 33 ft ) rapidly from tree trunk to tree trunk , an ability referred to as " <unk> leaping " . Verreaux 's sifaka ( Propithecus verreauxi ) manages to do this in the spiny forests of southern Madagascar . It is unknown how it avoids impaling its palms on the thorn @-@ covered trunks of large plants such as <unk> . When distances between trees are too great , sifakas will descend to the ground and cross distances more than 100 m ( 330 ft ) by standing upright and hopping sideways with the arms held to the side and waving up and down from chest to head height , presumably for balance . This is sometimes described as a " dance @-@ hop " . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Lemur communication can be transmitted through sound , sight , and smell ( olfaction ) . The ring @-@ tailed lemur , for instance , uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent @-@ marking and vocalizations . Visual signals are probably the least used by lemurs , since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions . Given their poor vision , whole @-@ body postures are probably more noticeable . However , the ring @-@ tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare , pulled back lips for submission , and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent @-@ marking . This species has also been observed using yawns as threats . Their ringed tails also communicate distance , warn off neighboring troops , and help locate troop members . <unk> are known to exhibit an open @-@ mouth play face as well as a submissive teeth @-@ baring grimace used in agonistic interactions . 
 Olfaction is particularly important to lemurs , except for the indri , which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain . Olfaction can communicate information about age , sex , reproductive status , as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory . It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other . Small , nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with urine , while the larger , diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy . The ring @-@ tailed lemur engages in " stink fights " by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists , and then flicking its tail at other male opponents . Some lemurs defecate in specific areas , otherwise known as latrine behavior . Although many animals exhibit this behavior , it is a rare trait among primates . Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling . 
 Compared to other mammals , primates in general are very vocal , and lemurs are no exception . Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires , including the ring @-@ tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs . Some of the most common calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls . Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species , but also alarm calls of other species and those of non @-@ predatory birds . The ring @-@ tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators . With mating calls , it has been shown that mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species , particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range . Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances . Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) away on a clear , calm day . The loudest lemur is the indri , whose calls can be heard up to 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40 hectares ( 0 @.@ 13 to 0 @.@ 15 sq mi ) home range . Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling , where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in . The song of the indri can last 45 seconds to more than 3 minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons . 
 Tactile communication ( touch ) is mostly used by lemurs in the form of grooming , although the ring @-@ tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep ( in an order determined by rank ) , reaches out and touches adjacent members , and cuffs other members . Reaching out and touching another individual in this species has been shown to be a submissive behavior , done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop . Allogrooming , however , appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals , a shared trait with other primate species . Unlike anthropoid primates , lemur grooming seems to be more intimate and mutual , often directly reciprocated . <unk> , on the other hand , use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions . The ring @-@ tailed lemur is known to be very tactile , spending between 5 and 11 % of its time grooming . 
 = = = Predator avoidance = = = 
 All lemurs experience some predation pressure . Common defenses against predation include the use of alarm calls and predator mobbing , mostly among diurnal lemurs . The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel , according to a study in kinematics . Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone . They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations , such as nests , tree holes , or dense vegetation , Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their <unk> and alternating between multiple sleeping locations . Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation . Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location , where the infant remains immobile in the absence of the parent . 
 Diurnal lemurs are visible during the day , so many live in groups , where the increased number of eyes and ears helps aid in predator detection . Diurnal lemurs use and respond to alarm calls , even those of other lemur species and non @-@ predatory birds . The ring @-@ tailed lemur has different calls and reactions to different classes of predators , such as predatory birds , mammals , or snakes . Some lemurs , such as the indri , use crypsis to camouflage themselves . They are often heard but difficult to see in the trees due to the dappled light , earning them the reputation of being " ghosts of the forest " . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Except for the aye @-@ aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur , lemurs are seasonal breeders with very short mating and birth seasons influenced by the highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment . Mating seasons usually last less than three weeks each year , with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus . These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods , rapid maturation , and low basal metabolic rates , as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females . This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations — both unusual traits among primates . In both the aye @-@ aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur , birth ( parturition ) occurs over a six @-@ month period . 
 Lemurs time their mating and birth seasons so that all weaning periods are synchronized to match the time of highest food availability . Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs . Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season , whereas larger lemurs , such as sifakas , must lactate for two months during the dry season . Infant survival in some species , such as Milne @-@ Edwards ' sifaka , has been shown to be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank , age , and health of the mother . The breeding season is also affected by geographical location . For example , mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the Southern Hemisphere , but from May through June in the captive settings in the Northern Hemisphere . 
 Scent factors heavily into lemur reproduction . Scent @-@ marking activity escalates during the mating season . Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus . Mating can be either monogamous or promiscuous for both males and females , and mating can include individuals from outside the group . Monogamous lemurs include the red @-@ bellied lemur ( Eulemur rubriventer ) and the mongoose lemur ( E. mongoz ) , although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond . Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species , although some exhibit scramble competition , sexual suppression of subordinates , or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting . In mouse lemurs , males utilize sperm plugs , developed enlarged testes during the mating season , and develop size dimorphism ( likely due to the enlarged testes ) . These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny , where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them . 
 The gestation period varies within lemurs , ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9 – 10 weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18 – 24 weeks in other lemurs . The smaller , nocturnal lemurs , such as mouse lemurs , giant mouse lemurs , and dwarf lemurs , usually give birth to more than one infant , whereas the larger , nocturnal lemurs , such as fork @-@ marked lemurs , sportive lemurs , and the aye @-@ aye usually have one offspring . Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring , but both average only two . Ruffed lemurs are the only large , diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring . All other lemurs have single births . Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal , and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring @-@ tailed lemur and some Eulemur . 
 After the offspring are born , lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging . When transported , the infants either cling to the mother 's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff . In some species , such as bamboo lemurs , infants are carried by mouth until they are able to cling to their mother 's fur . Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species ( e.g. mouse lemurs , sportive lemurs , and dwarf lemurs ) , bamboo lemurs , and ruffed lemurs . In the case of the ruffed lemurs , the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them , much like the smaller , nocturnal lemur species . Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them . Alloparenting ( multiple or group parenting ) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye @-@ aye . <unk> is also known to occur in several lemur groups . Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red @-@ bellied lemur , mongoose lemur , eastern lesser bamboo lemur , silky sifaka , fat @-@ tailed dwarf lemur , and ruffed lemurs . 
 Yet another trait that sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid primates is their long lifespan together with their high infant mortality . Many lemurs , including the ring @-@ tailed lemur , have adapted to a highly seasonal environment , which has affected their birthrate , maturation , and twinning rate ( r @-@ selection ) . This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash . In captivity , lemurs can live twice as long as they do in the wild , benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements , medical advancements , and improved understanding of their housing requirements . In 1960 , it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years . We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging ( senescence ) and still be capable of reproduction . 
 = = = Cognitive abilities and tool use = = = 
 Lemurs have traditionally been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates , with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning , guile , and deceptiveness . Many lemur species , such as sifakas and the ring @-@ tailed lemur , have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests . These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths ( rather than their hands ) and only take interest in objects when in captivity . Recent studies have shown that lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates , although they manipulate objects less often . Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild , although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring @-@ tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools . 
 A few lemurs have been noted to have relatively large brains . The extinct Hadropithecus was as large as a large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain , giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians . The aye @-@ aye also has a large brain @-@ to @-@ body ratio , which may indicate a higher level of intelligence . However , despite having a built @-@ in tool in the form of its thin , elongated middle finger , which it uses to fish for insect grubs , the aye @-@ aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools .

 See above : Diet , Metabolism , Activity patterns , and Locomotion 
 Madagascar not only contains two radically different climatic zones , the rainforests of the east and the dry regions of the west , but also swings from extended drought to cyclone @-@ generated floods . These climatic and geographical challenges , along with poor soils , low plant productivity , wide ranges of ecosystem complexity , and a lack of regularly fruiting trees ( such as fig trees ) have driven the evolution of lemurs ' immense morphological and behavioral diversity . Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes , not yearly averages . 
 Lemurs have either presently or formerly filled the ecological niches normally occupied by monkeys , squirrels , woodpeckers , and grazing ungulates . With the diversity of adaptations for specific ecological niches , habitat selections among lemur families and some genera are often very distinct , thus minimizing competition . In nocturnal lemurs from the more seasonal forests in the west , up to five species can coexist during the wet season due to high food abundance . However , to endure the extreme dry season , three of the five species utilize different dietary patterns and their underlying physiological traits to allow them to coexist : fork @-@ marked lemurs feed on tree gum , sportive lemurs feed on leaves , and giant mouse lemurs sometimes feed on insect secretions . The other two species , the gray mouse lemur and the fat @-@ tailed dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus medius ) , avoid competition through reduced activity . The gray mouse lemur uses bouts of torpor , while the fat @-@ tailed dwarf lemur hibernates completely . Similarly , on the east coast entire genera focus on specific food to avoid too much niche overlap . True lemurs and ruffed lemurs are frugivorous , indriids are folivorous , and bamboo lemurs specialize in bamboo and other grasses . Once again , seasonal dietary differences as well as subtle differences in substrate preferences , forest strata used , activity cycle , and social organization enable lemur species to coexist , although this time the species are more closely related and have similar niches . A classic example involves resource partitioning between three species of bamboo lemur that live in close proximity in small forested areas : the golden bamboo lemur , the greater bamboo lemur , and the eastern lesser bamboo lemur ( Hapalemur griseus ) . Each utilizes either different species of bamboo , different parts of the plant , or different layers in the forest . Nutrient and toxin content ( such as cyanide ) help regulate food selection , though seasonal food preferences are also known to play a role . 
 Dietary regimes of lemurs include folivory , frugivory , and omnivory , with some being highly adaptable while others specialize on foods such as plant exudates ( tree gum ) and bamboo . In some cases , lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life . When lemurs exploit nectar , they may act as pollinators as long as the functional parts of the flower are not damaged . In fact , several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur @-@ specific pollination traits , and studies indicate that some diurnal species , such as the red @-@ bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs , act as major pollinators . Two examples of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller 's palm ( Ravenala madagascariensis ) and a species of legume @-@ like liana , <unk> <unk> . Seed dispersal is another service lemurs provide . After passing through the lemur gut , tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster . Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate seed dispersal . Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest , frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists . 
 All lemurs , particularly the smaller species , are affected by predation and they are important prey items for predators . Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs , despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species . Other predators include native <unk> , such as the fossa , feral cats , domestic dogs , snakes , diurnal birds of prey , owls , and crocodiles . Extinct giant eagles , including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle ( <unk> <unk> ) , as well as the giant fossa ( Cryptoprocta spelea ) , previously also preyed on lemurs , perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring . The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator @-@ prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today . Today , predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs , usually 100 g ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) or less , while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey , such as the Madagascan harrier @-@ hawk ( Polyboroides radiatus ) and the Madagascar buzzard ( Buteo brachypterus ) . 
 = = Research = = 
 Similarities that lemurs share with anthropoid primates , such as diet and social organization , along with their own unique traits , have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar . Research often focuses on the link between ecology and social organization , but also on their behavior and <unk> ( the study of anatomy in relation to function ) . Studies of their life @-@ history traits , behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution , since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates . 
 Lemurs have been the focus of monographic series , action plans , field guides , and classic works in ethology . However , few species have been thoroughly studied to date , and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality . Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species . Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species . Long @-@ term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations . However , learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island . 
 Lemurs are mentioned in sailors ' voyage logs as far back as 1608 and in 1658 that at least seven lemur species were described in detail by the French merchant , Étienne de Flacourt , who may also have been the only westerner to see and chronicle the existence of a giant ( now extinct ) lemur , which he called the tretretretre . Around 1703 merchants and sailors began bringing lemurs back to Europe , at which time James <unk> , an apothecary in London , described and illustrated the mongoose lemur . Starting in 1751 , the London illustrator George Edwards began describing and illustrating some lemur species , of which a few were included in various editions of Systema Naturae by Carl Linnaeus . In the 1760s and 1770s , French naturalists Georges @-@ Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon and Louis @-@ Jean @-@ Marie Daubenton began describing the anatomy of several lemur species . The first traveling naturalist to comment on lemurs was Philibert <unk> in 1771 , although it was Pierre Sonnerat who recorded a greater variety of lemur species during his travels . 
 During the 19th century , there was an explosion of new lemur descriptions and names , which later took decades to sort out . During this time , professional collectors gathered specimens for museums , menageries , and cabinets . Some of the major collectors were Johann Maria Hildebrandt and Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major . From these collections , as well as increasing observations of lemurs in their natural habitats , museum systematists including Albert Günther and John Edward Gray continued to contribute new names for new lemur species . However , the most notable contributions from this century includes the work of Alfred Grandidier , a naturalist and explorer who devoted himself to the study of Madagascar 's natural history and local people . With the help of Alphonse Milne @-@ Edwards , most of the diurnal lemurs were illustrated at this time . However , lemur taxonomic nomenclature took its modern form in the 1920s and 1930s , being standardized by Ernst Schwarz in 1931 . 
 Although lemur taxonomy had developed , it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the in @-@ situ ( or on @-@ site ) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom . Jean @-@ Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter @-@ <unk> toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957 , surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction . In 1960 , the year of Madagascar 's independence , David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film . Under the guidance of John Buettner @-@ <unk> , who founded the Duke Lemur Center in 1966 , Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring @-@ tailed lemur and Verreaux 's sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve . The <unk> and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard , Robert Sussman , Ian Tattersall , and many others . Following the political turmoil of the mid @-@ 1970s and Madagascar 's revolution , field studies resumed in the 1980s , thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright . In the decades that followed , huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered . 
 Ex situ research ( or off @-@ site research ) is also popular among researchers looking to answer questions that are difficult to test in the field . For example , efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates . One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center ( DLC ) in Durham , North Carolina . It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar , which it maintains for non @-@ invasive research and captive breeding . Many important research projects have been carried out there , including studies of lemur vocalizations , basic locomotor research , the kinematics of bipedalism , the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning , and cognition studies involving a lemur 's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory . Other facilities , such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation , located near Myakka City , Florida , have also hosted research projects , such as one that looked at lemurs ' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Lemurs are threatened by a host of environmental problems , including deforestation , hunting for bushmeat , live capture for the exotic pet trade , and climate change . All species are listed by CITES on Appendix I , which prohibits trade of specimens or parts , except for scientific purposes . As of 2005 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) listed 16 % of all lemur species as critically endangered , 23 % as endangered , 25 % as vulnerable , 28 % as " data deficient " , and only 8 % as least concern . Over the next five years , at least 28 species were newly identified , none of which have had their conservation status assessed . Many are likely to be considered threatened since the new lemur species that have been described recently are typically confined to small regions . Given the rate of continued habitat destruction , undiscovered species could go extinct before being identified . Since the arrival of humans on the island approximately 2000 years ago , all endemic Malagasy vertebrates over 10 kg ( 22 lb ) have disappeared , including 17 species , 8 genera , and 3 families of lemurs . The IUCN Species Survival Commission ( IUCN / SSC ) , the International <unk> Society ( IPS ) , and Conservation International ( CI ) have included as many as five lemurs in their biennial " Top 25 Most Endangered Primates " . The 2008 – 2010 list includes the greater bamboo lemur , gray @-@ headed lemur ( Eulemur <unk> ) , blue @-@ eyed black lemur ( Eulemur <unk> ) , northern sportive lemur ( Lepilemur septentrionalis ) , and silky sifaka . In 2012 , an assessment by the Primate Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) concluded that 90 % of the then 103 described species of lemur should be listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List , making lemurs the most endangered group of mammals . The IUCN reiterated its concern in 2013 , noting that 90 % of all lemur species could be extinct within 20 to 25 years unless a $ 7 million USD 3 @-@ year conservation plan aimed at helping local communities can be implemented . 
 Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world , with a high population growth rate of 2 @.@ 5 % per year and nearly 70 % of the population living in poverty . The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources . These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts , even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN / SSC as a critical primate region for over 20 years . Due to its relatively small land area — 587 @,@ 045 km2 ( 226 @,@ 659 sq mi ) — compared to other high @-@ priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism , the country is considered one of the world 's most important biodiversity hotspots , with lemur conservation being a high priority . Despite the added emphasis for conservation , there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end . 
 = = = Threats in the wild = = = 
 The greatest concern facing lemur populations is habitat destruction and degradation . Deforestation takes the form of local subsistence use , such as slash and burn agriculture ( referred to as tavy in Malagasy ) , the creation of pasture for cattle through burning , and legal and illegal gathering of wood for firewood or charcoal production ; commercial mining ; and the illegal logging of precious hardwoods for foreign markets . After centuries of unsustainable use , as well as rapidly escalating forest destruction since 1950 , less than 60 @,@ 000 km2 ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) or 10 % of Madagascar 's land area remains forested . Only 17 @,@ 000 km2 ( 6 @,@ 600 sq mi ) or 3 % of the island 's land area is protected and due to dire economic conditions and political instability , most of the protected areas are ineffectively managed and defended . Some protected areas were set aside because they were naturally protected by their remote , isolated location , often on steep cliffs . Other areas , such as the dry forests and spiny forests of the west and south , receive little protection and are in serious danger of being destroyed . 
 Some species may be in risk of extinction even without complete deforestation , such as ruffed lemurs , which are very sensitive to habitat disturbance . If large fruit trees are removed , the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years . Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40 years due to long generation times , but in the long term , such populations may not be viable . Small , isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks ( epizootics ) . Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis , which is spread by feral cats , and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans . 
 Climate change and weather @-@ related natural disasters also threaten lemur survival . For the last 1000 years , western and highland regions have been growing significantly drier , but in the past few decades , severe drought has become much more frequent . There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation . The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests . As annual rainfall decreases , the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality , failure to fruit , and decreased production of new leaves , which folivorous lemurs prefer . Cyclones can defoliate an area , knock down canopy trees , and create landslides and flooding . This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring , requiring them to subsist on crisis foods , such as epiphytes . 
 Lemurs are hunted for food by the local Malagasy , either for local subsistence or to supply a luxury meat market in the larger cities . Most rural Malagasy do not understand what " endangered " means , nor do they know that hunting lemurs is illegal or that lemurs are found only in Madagascar . Many Malagasy have taboo , or fady , about hunting and eating lemurs , but this does not prevent hunting in many regions . Even though hunting has been a threat to lemur populations in the past , it has recently become a more serious threat as socioeconomic conditions deteriorate . Economic hardships have caused people to move around the country in search of employment , leading local traditions to break down . Drought and famine can also relax the fady that protect lemurs . Larger species , such as sifakas and ruffed lemurs , are common targets , but smaller species are also hunted or accidentally caught in snares intended for larger prey . Experienced , organized hunting parties using firearms , slings and blowguns can kill as many as eight to twenty lemurs in one trip . Organized hunting parties and lemur traps can be found in both non @-@ protected areas and remote corners of protected areas . National parks and other protected areas are not adequately protected by law enforcement agencies . Often , there are too few park rangers to cover a large area , and sometimes terrain within the park is too rugged to check regularly . 
 Although not as significant as deforestation and hunting , some lemurs , such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity , are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people . Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets , although they only survive for up to two months . Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export . 
 = = = Conservation efforts = = = 
 Lemurs have drawn much attention to Madagascar and its endangered species . In this capacity , they act as flagship species , the most notable of which is the ring @-@ tailed lemur , which is considered an icon of the country . The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive ecotourism , which especially helps local communities living in the vicinity of the national parks , since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees . In the case of Ranomafana National Park , job opportunities and other revenue from long @-@ term research can rival that of ecotourism . 
 Starting in 1927 , the Malagasy government has declared all lemurs as " protected " by establishing protected areas that are now classified under three categories : National Parks ( <unk> Nationaux ) , Strict Nature Reserves ( Réserves Naturelles <unk> ) , and Special Reserves ( Réserves <unk> ) . There are currently 18 national parks , 5 strict nature reserves , and 22 special reserves , as well as several other small private reserves , such as Berenty Reserve and Sainte Luce Private Reserve , both near Fort Dauphin . All protected areas , excluding the private reserves , comprise approximately 3 % of the land surface of Madagascar and are managed by Madagascar National Parks , formerly known as l 'Association Nationale pour la Gestion des Aires <unk> ( <unk> ) , as well as other non @-@ governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , including Conservation International ( CI ) , the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) , and the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) . Most lemur species are covered by this network of protected areas , and a few species can be found in multiple parks or reserves . 
 Conservation is also facilitated by the Madagascar Fauna Group ( MFG ) , an association of nearly 40 zoos and related organizations , including the Duke Lemur Center , the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust , and the Saint Louis Zoological Park . This international NGO supports Madagascar 's Parc Ivoloina , helps protect Betampona Reserve and other protected areas , and promotes field research , breeding programs , conservation planning , and education in zoos . One of their major projects involved the release of captive black @-@ and @-@ white ruffed lemurs , designed to help restock the dwindling population within Betampona Reserve . 
 Habitat corridors are needed for linking these protected areas so that small populations are not isolated . In September 2003 in Durban , South Africa , Madagascar 's former president Marc Ravalomanana promised to triple the size of the island 's protected areas in five years . This became known as the " Durban Vision " . In June 2007 , the World Heritage Committee included a sizable portion of Madagascar 's eastern rainforests as a new UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Debt relief may help Madagascar protect its biodiversity . With the political crisis in 2009 , illegal logging has proliferated and now threatens rainforests in the northeast , including its lemur inhabitants and the ecotourism that the local communities rely upon . 
 Captive lemur populations are maintained locally and outside of Madagascar in many zoos , although the diversity of species is limited . <unk> , for instance , do not survive well in captivity , so few facilities have them . The largest captive lemur population can be found at the Duke Lemur Center ( DLC ) , whose mission includes non @-@ invasive research , conservation ( e.g. captive breeding ) , and public education . Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation ( LCF ) , which also hosts lemur research . In Madagascar , Lemurs ' Park is a free @-@ range , private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive @-@ born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 In Malagasy culture lemurs , and animals in general , have souls ( <unk> ) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if killed in a cruel fashion . Because of this , lemurs , like many other elements of daily life , have been a source of taboos , known locally as fady , which can be based around stories with four basic principles . A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan . They may also believe that a lemur 's spirit may get revenge . Alternatively , the animal may appear as a benefactor . Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities , good or bad , onto human babies . In general , fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden , but can include events that bring bad luck . 
 One example of lemur fady told around 1970 comes from <unk> in the Fianarantsoa Province . According to the account , a man brought a lemur home in a trap , but alive . His children wanted to keep the lemur as a pet , but when the father told them it was not a domestic animal , the children asked to kill it . After the children tortured the lemur , it eventually died and was eaten . A short time later , all the children died of illness . As a result , the father declared that anyone who tortures lemurs for fun shall " be destroyed and have no descendants . " 
 Fady can not only help protect lemurs and their forests under stable socioeconomic situations , but they can also lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune , for instance , if it walks through town . In other ways , fady does not protect all lemurs equally . For example , although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo , other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead . Fady can vary from village to village within the same region . If people move to a new village or region , their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present , making them available for consumption . Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought . 
 The aye @-@ aye is almost universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar , though the tales vary from village to village and region to region . If people see an aye @-@ aye , they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road outside of town ( so others can carry the bad fortunes away ) or burn their village and move . The superstitions behind aye @-@ aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people , that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein , that they embody ancestral spirits , or that they warn of illness , death , or bad luck in the family . As of 1970 , the people of the Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye @-@ aye because they believed it had supernatural powers . Because of this , no one was allowed to mock , kill , or eat one . 
 There are also widespread fady about indri and sifakas . They are often protected from hunting and consumption because of their resemblance to humans and their ancestors , mostly due to their large size and upright or <unk> posture . The resemblance is even stronger for indri , which lack the long tail of most living lemurs . Known locally as babakoto ( " Ancestor of Man " ) , the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan . There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree , so they are seen as benefactors . Other lemur fady include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a woolly lemur , or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur , her baby will get its beautiful , round eyes . 
 Lemurs have also become popular in Western culture in recent years . The original 2005 animated film Madagascar was seen by an estimated 100 million people in theaters and 200 – 300 million people on DVD worldwide . Prior to this movie , <unk> , a Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) children 's television series from 1999 to 2001 , helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live Coquerel 's sifaka from the Duke Lemur Center as well as a puppet . A twenty @-@ episode series called Lemur Kingdom ( in the United States ) or Lemur Street ( in the United Kingdom and Canada ) aired in 2008 on Animal Planet . It combined the typical animal documentary with dramatic narration to tell the story of two groups of ring @-@ tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve .

 = Medieval Faire ( Canada 's Wonderland ) = 
 Originally themed around the Middle Ages , Medieval Faire is a section of Canada 's Wonderland , a theme park in Vaughan , Ontario , Canada . As such , early attractions created under Kings Entertainment Company were named after knights , Don Quixote , Vikings , dragons , bats , and beasts . Throughout the Paramount Parks era , the section 's new attractions lacked appropriate theming . The introduction of the Leviathan roller coaster to Medieval Faire in 2012 was the first major investment in the section since 2000 ; the park is now under ownership of Cedar Fair . The section includes four roller coasters ( The Bat , Dragon Fire , Leviathan , and Wild Beast ) and six other rides . 
 Over the years , atmosphere performers have disappeared from most sections of the park , including Medieval Faire . Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section , a proscenium theatre and a stunt and acrobatic space surrounded by water . Currently named Wonderland Theatre , the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues , ice shows , and now an acrobatic production , Cirque Ambiente . A structure within Arthur 's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and acrobatics show , which has changed now to have a more generic theme ; it is currently branded <unk> – X. 
 Food in the section was originally themed to the era , with a large indoor pub and rib stand . The food later took on a more traditional North American cuisine , like a buffet and subs . Private events are held in the Courtyard facility . 
 = = Theming = = 
 A 1979 planning document describes the section : " A trip into the Middle Ages is in store for those visiting this area of Canada 's Wonderland . Rides , restaurants , boutiques and the 1 @,@ 200 seat air @-@ conditioned Heritage Theatre where live shows are performed daily , await our guests in the Medieval Faire . " 
 The section is entered through a fortresses ' walls , over a castle moat . The front facade of Wonderland Theatre , previously Canterbury Theatre , was designed as a castle , and the other buildings were designed to fit the same time period . 
 Artist and inventor Bill Lishman created two sculptures for this section of the park , as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings . The most prominent is a dragon at the entrance to the Dragon Fire , which had originally been intended to hold a sign , but the park management decided they liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture . Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch , as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired , taking him and assistant Richard Van <unk> two months to complete . The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast , both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock , Ontario , for about $ 75 @,@ 000 . Signs by Lishman included Sherwood <unk> , Boo Boo 's <unk> , an ice cream cone , and for a popcorn counter . 
 Near to the First Aid building is the Medieval Faire washrooms . Initially themed in a medieval style , the thatched cottage was marked " Lords " and " Ladies " . Publicist Mike Filey told the press that many were confused by the doors , or even where washrooms were , and this was to be fixed for the second park season . In the opening year , an information and ticket booth was located in front of Arthur 's Baye ; tickets have since been phased out . Two designated smoking areas are in the section , one at the wall area next to the Prime Time Building , and the other by the Boar at the entrance to the Wild Beast . 
 = = Rides = = 
 This section of the park originally opened with five rides : Dragon Fyre , Wilde Beast , Viking 's Rage , Quixote 's Kettles , and Wilde Knight Mares . Steel roller coaster Dragon Fyre includes 4 inversions , and is now the only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counter @-@ clockwise turning corkscrews . Out and back wooden roller coaster Wilde Beast has 3000 feet of track , while Wilde Night Mares is a standing Enterprise ride featuring ten four @-@ seater gondolas rises 60 feet , tilting 90 degrees . Viking 's Rage , was the first of three pendulum rides the park operated ; unlike the now removed Jet Scream , the boat ride does not go upside down . Quixote 's Kettles features spinning kettles on a tilted platform . ( Two years before opening , Dragon Fire was simply called the Looping Corkscrew , and another ride was to be the Wildcat . ) 
 In May 1981 , Canada 's Wonderland Director of Rides and Ground Services Jim Wilson told the Toronto Star that The Wilde Beast ( along with two of the other original coasters at the park , Scooby 's <unk> Coaster , and the Mighty Canadian <unk> ) was wooden thanks to the apparent popularity of different styles of rides . " Experiments " found that steel coasters weren 't as popular or enjoyable to the public , " the sound and feel all contribute to the thrill of the ride . People just didn 't like steel roller coasters . " 
 Early promotion for the Dragon Fyre highlighted all the safety measures , from an indirect reference to <unk> force to x @-@ raying welds . The most popular attraction in Medieval Faire , lines for Dragon Fyre were about half @-@ hour at their peak in 1982 , considered at the time the longest of any attraction at the park . 
 Over the years , only four major attractions were added to Medieval Faire . Added in 1987 , The Bat was a backwards looping roller coaster , including one loop and two lifts . The park addition included a shop named the Belfry . Later additions were Speed City Raceway ( 1997 ) , Drop Zone ( 1997 ) , and Cliffhanger ( 2000 ) . 
 During the 1990s , almost all the rides were renamed : Dragon Fyre , Wilde Beast , Quixote 's Kettles , Wilde Night Mares , and Viking 's Rage became Dragon Fire , Wild Beast , <unk> , Nightmares , and The Rage . When the park was sold to Cedar Fair , Paramount @-@ specific ride names disappeared with Cliffhanger , Drop Zone becoming Riptide , Drop Tower , respectively . 
 In 2012 , the Leviathan joined the similarly named Behemoth at Canada 's Wonderland , stripping the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada . It was the first new ride in Medieval Faire in more than a decade . Leviathan is ranked as the seventh tallest , and the eighth fastest roller coaster in the world . It is Canada 's Wonderland 's 16th roller coaster . The addition came quickly after the launch of the 230 @-@ foot @-@ tall Behemoth roller coaster in 2008 , and the 301 @-@ foot @-@ tall swing ride WindSeeker in the 2011 season .

 There was initially a variety of street theatre present in the section : both a " town rustic " performing magic and " a wily wizard performing slight of hand " , a juggling jester , Robin Hood , and a singing Maid Marian who accompanied herself on the autoharp . Some outdoors performers existed in the section until at least 1987 . While Peanuts characters appear on International Street and in Planet Snoopy , and Halloween programming includes walk @-@ around characters , all regular season unlicensed atmosphere characters and entertainment have been removed from the park . 
 = = = Wonderland Theatre = = = 
 Established as the Canterbury Theatre , this castle @-@ fronted theatre spent a few years as the Paramount Theatre , and has gone from hosting Broadway @-@ style productions to ice shows , during the regular season , and adult @-@ targeted musicals during Halloween Haunt . 
 Early resources conflicted on the size of the theatre : most sources suggest 1100 seats , but a 1982 program suggested 1200 . The theatre is formatted as proscenium , and was considered ' ultra @-@ modern ' upon opening . 
 In the first season , Canterbury hosted Those Magnificent Movies ; " ... a salute to Hollywood " . The stage show lasted 45 minutes , with eight sets for eight segments , 20 singer @-@ dancers , and a crew of 18 . After an opening medley , a fantasy segment features " On the Good Ship Lollipop " , " Yellow Submarine " , " The Candy Man " , and " Be a Clown " . The next segment focused on the 1930s and 1940s , with " As Time Goes By " , " Cheek to Cheek " , and " I Got Rhythm " . A western segment includes a tribute to Oklahoma ! , while the sci @-@ fi segment features " Star Wars ( Main Theme ) " ( 1977 ) , John Williams ' " Superman Theme " from the 1978 Superman film , a segment from the Academy <unk> nominated score of Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) , and " Cantina Band " from Star Wars . The modern segment included " The Rose " , made famous by Bette Midler 's 1979 film of the same name , and Academy Award winning song " Fame " , from the 1980 film of the same name . The finale included " All I Need Is The Girl " from stage musical Gypsy : A Musical Fable and " Get Happy " , a 1930 song most associated with Judy Garland in Summer Stock ( 1950 ) . In all , there were 200 costumes . Entry to the show was a D ticket , or $ 1 @.@ 50 , and shows were performed by high school students . On some days , 1950s musical revue Rock Around The Clock would perform there , as opposed to Labatt 's International <unk> . 
 Later stage shows included Those Magnificent Movies , Fantasy , Superstars , Hot Ice , and School of Rock : Live in Concert . A cassette of recordings by the cast of Best of Broadway was released under the Taft Attractions label . At some point in the 1990s , a skating production was held at the theatre . 
 During Paramount ownership , the theatre was known as Paramount Theatre . Eventually , the Paramount Theatre stage was converted to an artificial ice surface , and renamed Wonderland Theatre . Two ice shows were presented , titled Endless Summer on Ice ( 2007 – 2009 ) and Snoopy Rocks ! on Ice ( 2010 – 2011 ) . The first production included Scooby @-@ Doo and outfits like s <unk> , while Snoopy , Charlie Brown , Lucy and Linus appeared in sequences of the latter . The show appeared at various other former Paramount Parks , and in each situation , the sequenced did vary between the Scooby @-@ anchored and Peanuts @-@ anchored productions . 
 Cirque Ambiente opened in Wonderland in 2012 ; located at Wonderland Theatre . The show is produced by Les Productions Haut @-@ Vol , who also produces the Wonder Mountain dive show and the shows in Arthur 's Baye . This isn 't the first " cirque " act at the park . Quebec 's Cirque du Tonnerre , featuring a contortionist from Cirque du Soleil , made an " exclusive Toronto appearance " at Wonderland in 1990 . 
 Of all the shows over the years , Wonderland estimates there have been 1300 performers . Jersey Boys choreographer Sergio Trujillo , television actor Matt Austin , and stage actress Erica Peck among them .

 A large pond in the Medieval Faire has always hosted free performances , the shows have remained largely similar over the years , alternating only in choreography from year – to – year , as opposed to premise . In planning documents , the water was originally called Medieval Lake . 
 Labatt 's initially presented the Arthur 's Baye show , " The Plight of the Land Locked Pirates " . Described in the Guidebook , the " melodramatic stunt spectacular " was set on a " privateer ship " called the Sea Sceptre . Reports in 1980 suggested that the lake would have " ancient – looking sailing ships . " The show would feature two sets of actors battling in a show of acrobatics and pyrotechnics . Billy , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old hero of the show ( played by a 20 – year – old <unk> ) , is kidnapped from the audience on shore and taken to the boat . Pirate Captain Evil Medieval and Billy 's mother , played by a teenaged boy , were the two other primary characters . The trapeze and trampoline show ends with the mother lowering the pirate flag and raising a heart flag . 
 In 2009 the show was re – titled simply as the Arthur 's Baye Dive Show , including trampoline and diving demonstrations , but no overarching plot . In 2011 , they were nominated for an IAAPA Brass Ring Award 2011 in the Live Entertainment category for Best Overall Production $ 50 @,@ 001 @-@ 100 @,@ 000 . In 2012 it was re – branded completely as <unk> – X. The show was produced by Les Productions Haut @-@ Vol from 2002 to 2010 . 
 = = Food = = 
 The largest facility in this area of the park is The Marketplace – International Buffet , originally called All 's Well Hall . In planning documents , it was simply called " Medieval Pub " . In the park 's opening season guidebook , the facility is listed as selling " bratwurst , sausages , beef and mushroom pie , smoked sausage , grilled <unk> , sauerkraut , mashed potatoes , soft pretzels , pastries , with beer , wine , coffee , tea , milk , and soft drinks . " The self – serve restaurant had table service on request , and seated 528 ; Ginza Gardens in Grande Exposition of 1890 was the only other restaurant in the park with table service . A review of the restaurant in The Toronto Star describes the facility as the park 's flagship eatery , but it received mixed reviews . " The $ 2 @.@ 50 beef and mushroom pie has a good crust and as much beef as potato . Tiny mushrooms , but big on flavor . " Conversely , 50 cent pretzels " are strictly for teething tots – too <unk> . " The Marketplace currently serves an all – you – can – eat buffet , self described as " upscale " , offering meats like roast beef and fried chicken , pasta , a salad bar , a desert station , varied international cuisine , and other options . Marketplace has served a Mortal Meal , along with the Backlot Cafe elsewhere in the park , during Halloween Haunt in recent seasons . 
 While largely out of site from the bay for which it is named , Arthur 's Baye Mill & Bakery shared a building with store called The Market Place . The retail is now The Fun Shoppe , with the generically named Medieval Funnel Cakes . There is a Coca @-@ Cola Freestyle location at the funnel cake store . 
 Other original outlets were : 
 Yee <unk> <unk> : <unk> ribs , smoked meat sandwich , and fries . Made by McCain , the fries were dubbed potato logs and Rubble <unk> elsewhere in the park . Also listed in the guidebook were garden salad , coleslaw , melon , fruit drinks , soft drinks , and coffee . 
 Arthur 's Baye Mill & Bakery : Solely serving funnel cakes , at 90 cents . Teens taken to the park told the Star that " they look worse than they taste . " 
 Yorkshire Yogurt : " Freshly @-@ made frozen yoghurt with a touch of vanilla " , available in a cone , or with fresh fruit in a cup . 
 French <unk> and <unk> : Battered and fried shrimp , a dozen served in a paper cone . " What a cruel fate for such healthy food , " suggested a Star food writer . 
 The introduction of Leviathan to the section in 2012 lead to an expansion of Thrill Burger 's front service counter and kitchen , to handle the expected increased volume of traffic to the section . Thrill Burger offers " our basic good quality burgers and fries " , along with chicken fingers and onion rings . The <unk> Icee station was remade into the " Leviathan Icee Yard " , featuring even larger drink containers than previously , emulating the size of the new ride . A truck positioned outside the Flight Deck roller coaster in Action Zone was rethemed and moved to Medieval Faire . Other current food locations include a Dairy Queen , a Subway , and Medieval Funnel Cakes which shares a space with Fun Shoppe . 
 Used for corporate catering and other large groups , Courtyard was originally known as King 's Courtyard , until at least 1998 . Public entry to the area is through a gate located between Wonderland Theatre and Riptide . Occasionally , other events are held at the Courtyard : in June 1998 , the section hosted Alligators Alive ! , an educational show about the Floridian animals .

 The area features a variety of games , including an arcade . The park 's First Aid and Security Building , now home only to the First Aid Centre , is located in the Medieval Faire section beside the games . Along with Hanna – Barbera Land , this section of the park was recreated at Australia 's Wonderland . 
 = Barry Voight = 
 Barry Voight ( born 1937 ) is an American volcanologist and engineer . He is also the brother of actor Jon Voight and songwriter Chip Taylor , and the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie . After attending a five @-@ year intensive dual @-@ degree program at the University of Notre Dame , Voight became a teaching assistant there while pursuing his Master 's degree . He studied at Cornell University and Columbia University , earning his Ph.D. in geology at the latter in 1965 . He worked as a professor of geology at several universities , including Pennsylvania State University , where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005 . Voight 's publication on avalanches and other mass movements attracted the attention of United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) employee Rocky Crandell , who asked him to look at an expanding bulge at Mount St. Helens in Washington . Voight foresaw the bulge 's failure , followed by the collapse of the mountain 's north flank as well as a powerful eruption . His predictions came true as St. Helens erupted in 1980 ; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the avalanche that marked the eruption . After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition , Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career , including Nevado del Ruiz , Mount Merapi , and Soufrière Hills . For his research , publications , and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer , Voight has been honored with several awards and citations as a lecturer .

 Voight pursued a 5 @-@ year intensive dual @-@ degree program at the University of Notre Dame , receiving undergraduate degrees in geology ( 1959 ) and in civil engineering ( 1960 ) . He also received his Master 's degree in civil engineering from Notre Dame in 1961 . Voight attributes his interest in science to his mentors at Notre Dame , professors Ray <unk> and Erhard Winkler . After spending one year studying at Cornell University , Voight transferred to Columbia University , where he graduated with a Ph.D. in geology in 1965 , studying under Fred Donath . While at Columbia , Voight was named a President 's Fellow .

 Voight began teaching in 1961 , serving as a teaching assistant ( TA ) at the University of Notre Dame while pursuing his master 's degree in civil engineering . From 1961 − 1963 , he also served as a TA at Cornell and Columbia . In 1964 , he joined the faculty at Pennsylvania State University ( Penn State ) as an assistant professor of geology , becoming a regular professor of geology and geotechnical engineering in 1978 . He remained at Penn State for more than four decades , retiring in June 2005 . While working at Penn State , Voight had a joint affiliation with the school 's Department of Mineral Engineering , teaching two courses , " Physical Geology for Engineers " and " Volcanology " . During his career , Voight also taught as a guest professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1972 . He was a visiting professor at the University of Toronto in 1973 and at the University of California , Santa Barbara in 1981 . As of 2009 , he remains an emeritus professor at Penn State .

 Voight began his career as a geologist in 1971 , working for the United States Bureau of Mines . In 1978 , he published the first volume of a publication on avalanches , titled <unk> and Avalanches . After the second volume was released in 1980 , the work became a benchmark in studying avalanches and other forms of mass movement . 
 Prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , Voight was contacted by Rocky Crandell , a United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) employee working at the mountain . Crandell sought Voight 's expertise in landslides , hoping Voight would opine on a growing bulge , 270 feet ( 82 m ) in length , which had emerged on the mountain 's north face . In his report to Crandell and his associates , Voight insisted that the bulge could fail and collapse the volcano 's entire north sector . He suggested they begin monitoring the rate of movement of the bulge , worried that the collapse could trigger an eruption . He also advised hiring a local surveyor to take measurements , offending several of the geologists . Shortly after , Voight left the mountain and returned to teaching classes at Penn State . Just before the eruption , he published a paper summarizing his predictions , depicting the failure of the bulge and the collapse of the mountain 's north side followed by a violent eruption , all of which came true . After a magnitude 5 @.@ 1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide at 8 : 32 a.m. , the volcano erupted , causing USD $ 1 @.@ 1 billion in damage and killing 57 people . After the eruption , Voight accepted a position as a consultant for the USGS . He led the investigation into the volcano debris avalanche which had occurred during the volcano 's eruption , guiding other volcanologists including Harry Glicken , who built upon Voight 's preliminary research to create his report " Rockslide @-@ Debris Avalanche of May 18 , 1980 , Mount St. Helens Volcano , Washington " ( 1996 ) . Voight 's work won him international renown , and he later cited his experiences there as " career @-@ changing " . Although Voight already had a growing interest in volcanology , the eruption at Mount St. Helens propelled him to switch careers and dedicate himself to the field . His work helped to reinvigorate widespread interest in landslides and other phenomena at volcanoes which potentially pose a threat to life . After Mount St. Helens , Voight began work analyzing the volcanic hazards from several other active volcanoes . 
 In 1985 , Voight responded to the Armero tragedy , where more than 23 @,@ 000 died from an eruption from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano , by blaming human error . He felt that while totally accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions were impossible , unpreparedness for the disaster and inaction in preventing it exacerbated the death toll . In January 1986 , Voight visited Nevado del Ruiz responding to concerns from the Colombian government that the northeastern section of the volcano might cave in , causing another eruption . He established a monitoring network of reflectors and used laser ranging to track how the distances to these reflectors changed over time . When one reflector indicated lots of movement and large cracks became visible from the air , Voight began contemplating evacuation , but waited . By March 1986 , he realized the widening cracks were caused by the creep ( gradual shifting ) of one of the volcano 's glaciers , rather than rocks . After leaving Ruiz , Voight compiled the 14 @-@ page report " Countdown to Catastrophe " ( 1988 ) , which analyzed how volcanic hazard management had failed at Armero .

 When Voight began research at Mount Merapi in Java , Indonesia in 1988 , it was hardly known by volcanologists . It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution 's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World , despite having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996 . Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano , and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring . In July 1989 , he obtained a USD $ 250 @,@ 000 grant from the National Science Foundation 's Division of Natural and <unk> Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi . After his funding ran out , he temporarily abandoned his research . An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people , including guests of a wedding ceremony . 23 people survived the eruption . Returning to Merapi the following year , Voight compared data from the dead and survivors including the extent of their burn areas , clothing worn , and lung damage . He concluded that protective , long @-@ sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity . 
 In April 1989 , Voight returned to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being contacted by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization . People in Pasto , located at the foot of the volcano , became alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras . While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz , land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain . With USGS geologist Dick Janda , Voight drew a hazard map which included several populated areas within the danger zone . Before Voight left Galeras , the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption , which Voight and his team failed to predict . Although Pasto was unaffected , six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed . After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption , Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred . He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano 's monitoring system functioned properly . 
 Voight 's fulfilled prediction that an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a lateral eruption , an eruption from the volcano 's flank rather than its summit , attracted the attention of the government of Montserrat . Worried about an expanding lava dome at the Soufrière Hills volcano in March 1996 , the island 's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption . Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse , but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of Plymouth in approximately three minutes . The city of Plymouth and a village on the mountain were evacuated , and within three years , pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites . Following these eruptions , Voight served as a member of the Risk Assessment Panel that advised Montserrat 's government , and co @-@ established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision <unk> @-@ geodetic Observatory ( <unk> ) with a team of scientists . Voight continued research at the island with Steven Sparks , a geoscientist at the University of Bristol , establishing SEA @-@ <unk> , an attempt to analyze Soufrière Hills utilizing seismic waves and explosions in the ocean . Amongst other findings , this effort detected a major fault trending north − west under Montserrat 's western side . 
 With his students , Voight has analyzed pyroclastic flows , volcanically @-@ induced seismicity , volcanic debris avalanches , and volcanic eruption prediction . Voight also served as a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams , tunnels , and nuclear power plants , helping plan engineering projects in France , India , Ireland , Somalia , Papua New Guinea , Canada , and Turkey , as well as the United States . Voight 's research interests in lava dome collapses , stratovolcanoes , monitoring of active volcanoes , and pyroclastic flows have taken him to Iceland , Columbia , Japan , the Kamchatka Peninsula , Indonesia , the West Indies , Italy , and Chile . Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts , Voight developed the widely used <unk> strain recovery ( ASR ) method for measuring stress on deep rock . With a team of geologists , he also derived the material failure forecast method ( <unk> ) , which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain 's surrounding seismic and deformation data . He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey 's Volcano Hazards Response Team , and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan , the Philippines , Indonesia , and Chile .

 Throughout his career , Voight has received multiple accolades and citations , for his research as a professor and for his professional work as a geologist and volcanologist . In 1984 , the Institution of Civil Engineers awarded him the George Stevenson Medal , recognizing one of his articles among " the best work published in [ their ] journals " . The same year , Voight earned an award for " significant original contribution to research in rock mechanics " from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics . For his help monitoring the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1985 , he was granted a key to Legazpi , Albay , which had been threatened by Mayon 's impending eruption . 1989 saw another major year of honors for Voight , as he was named a <unk> Research Scholar and again garnered an award from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics for his original findings . Voight has appeared as a distinguished lecturer several times , including at the University of Utah 's College of Mining Engineering ( 1990 ) , the University of California , Santa Barbara ( 1992 ) , and the Association of Environmental & Engineering Geologists ( 1992 ) . For his service as a professor at Penn State , Voight has been given two awards , specifically for his research . In 1991 , he gained a Faculty Scholar Medal for " Outstanding Achievement in the Physical Sciences and Engineering " . In 1990 , he received the Wilson Research Award from the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences for excellence in research . For " his research , teaching and consulting work " , the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America presented him with their 2010 Distinguished Practice Award . In 2013 he received the <unk> Medal of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth 's Interior . 
 Recalling a conference which he attended where Voight appeared , Bill McGuire , Emeritus Professor of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at University College London , describes Voight as " an illustrious expert on volcano instability and landslides " . Citing Voight for his Distinguished Practice Award , colleague Richard Gray names him among his " profession 's brightest and productive members " . When Voight published his prediction mechanism , USGS geologist Robert I. <unk> praised it for being " a significant refinement in the interpretation of monitoring data " .

 = Sarcosphaera = 
 Sarcosphaera is a fungal genus within the Pezizaceae family . It is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Sarcosphaera coronaria , commonly known as the pink crown , the violet crown @-@ cup , or the violet star cup . It is a whitish or grayish cup fungus , distinguished by the manner in which the cup splits into lobes from the top downward . It is commonly found in the mountains in coniferous woods under humus on the forest floor , and often appears after the snow melts in late spring and early summer . The fungus is widespread , and has been collected in Europe , Israel and the Asian part of Turkey , North Africa , and North America . In Europe , it is considered a threatened species in 14 countries . Although several taxa have been described as Sarcosphaera species since the introduction of the genus in 1869 , most lack modern descriptions , have been transferred to the related genus Peziza , or are considered synonymous with S. coronaria . 
 The fruit body , typically found partially buried in soil , is initially like a fleshy hollow ball , and may be mistaken for a puffball . Unlike the latter , it splits open from the top downwards to form a cup with five to ten pointed rays , reaching up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter . It is lavender @-@ brown on the inside surface , and whitish outside , but usually dingy from adhering soil . Characteristic microscopic features include asci that are amyloid ( so their tips stain blue at the tip with iodine ) , and smooth , blunt @-@ ended , ellipsoid spores with large oil droplets . Sarcosphaera coronaria — once thought to be a good edible — is not recommended for consumption , after several reports of poisonings causing stomach aches , and in one instance , death . The fruit bodies are known to bioaccumulate the toxic metalloid arsenic from the soil . 
 = = Taxonomy , classification , and phylogeny = = 
 The genus was first described by Bernhard <unk> in 1869 , to accommodate the species then known as Peziza <unk> . Sarcosphaera coronaria was originally named Peziza coronaria by the Dutch scientist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1778 , and underwent several name changes before being assigned its current name in 1908 by Joseph Schröter . The Greek genus name means " flesh ball " ; the Latin specific epithet , coronaria , refers to the crown @-@ like form of the open fruit body . The species is commonly known by various names , including the " crown fungus " , the " pink crown " , the " violet crown @-@ cup " , or the " violet star cup " . 
 Several taxa have been named as belonging to the genus Sarcosphaera over the years , but most lack modern descriptions and have not been reported since their original collections . For example , Sarcosphaera <unk> was renamed by Fred Jay Seaver in 1930 based on the basionym Peziza <unk> , originally described by Cooke in 1878 . Sarcosphaera gigantea was a species collected from Michigan , originally described as <unk> gigantea by Heinrich Rehm in 1905 , and considered distinct from S. coronaria on the basis of its smaller spore size . Sarcosphaera <unk> was described by Wilhem <unk> in 1943 . Other taxa have been reduced to synonymy with S. coronaria , or transferred to other genera . Sarcosphaera eximia ( originally Peziza eximia <unk> & <unk> . 1848 , and later transferred to Sarcosphaera by René Maire ) , Sarcosphaera crassa ( considered by Zdeněk Pouzar in a 1972 publication to be the correct name for S. coronaria ) and Sarcosphaera <unk> ( originally Peziza <unk> Gachet 1829 , transferred to Sarcosphaera by Nannfeldt ) are now considered synonyms of S. coronaria . Sarcosphaera ammophila ( originally Peziza ammophila <unk> & Mont . ) and Sarcosphaera <unk> ( originally Peziza <unk> Fr . 1849 ) have since been transferred back to Peziza . The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi ( 2008 ) considers Sarcosphaera to be monotypic , and Index Fungorum has only Sarcosphaera coronaria confirmed as valid . 
 In 1947 , Helen Gilkey described the genus <unk> based on a single collection made in Wallowa County , Oregon . The type species , C. montana , was thought to be a truffle ( formerly classified in the now @-@ defunct <unk> order ) because of its chambered fruit body and subterranean growth habit . It was later noted by mycologist James Trappe to strongly resemble Sarcosphaera . Thirty years later , Trappe revisited the original collection site in eastern Oregon and found fresh specimens that closely matched Gilkey 's original description . Some specimens , however , had opened up similar to Sarcosphaera , suggesting that the original specimens had " simply not emerged and often not opened due to habitat factors . " Microscopic examination of the preserved type material revealed the species to be Sarcosphaera coronaria ( then called S. crassa ) , and <unk> is now considered a generic synonym of Sarcosphaera . 
 Sarcosphaera is classified in the family Pezizaceae of the order Pezizales . Phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences suggests that Sarcosphaera forms a clade with the genera <unk> and <unk> , and that the three taxa are a sister group to <unk> and <unk> ( both in the family <unk> ) . Species in the families Pezizaceae and <unk> are distinct from other <unk> taxa in the positive iodine reaction of the ascus wall . In a more recent ( 2005 ) phylogenetic analysis combining the data derived from three genes ( the large subunit ribosomal rRNA ( LSU ) , RNA polymerase II ( <unk> ) , and beta @-@ tubulin ) , Sarcosphaera was shown to be closely related to the truffle genus <unk> , corroborating earlier results that used only the LSU rDNA sequences . 
 = = Description = = 
 Sarcosphaera is partly hypogeous ( fruiting underground ) and emerges from the ground as a whitish to cream @-@ colored hollow ball . Young specimens are covered entirely by an easily removed thin protective membrane . As it matures , it splits open to expose the inner spore @-@ bearing layer ( hymenium ) . The cup is up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter , roughly spherical initially but breaking up into a series of five to ten <unk> projections , which give the fruit body the shape of a crown . The outer surface of the cup is white , while the inner surface is lilac @-@ gray , although in age the color may fade to a brownish @-@ lavender color . The flesh is white , thick , and fragile . Some specimens may have a short , stubby stalk . 
 The spores are hyaline ( translucent ) , smooth , and ellipsoid with the ends truncate . They have dimensions of 11 @.@ 5 – 20 by 5 – 9 µm , and usually contain two large oil drops . The paraphyses ( sterile , filamentous cells interspersed among the asci , or spore @-@ producing cells ) are 5 – 8 µm wide at the tip , branched , septate ( with partitions that divide the cells into compartments ) , and constricted at the septa . The asci are cylindrical , and measure 300 – 360 by 10 – 13 µm ; the tips of the asci stain blue with Melzer 's reagent . The finely cylindrical paraphyses have slightly swollen tips and are forked at the base . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Immature , unopened fruit bodies can be mistaken for truffles , but are distinguished by their hollow interior . Mature specimens somewhat resemble the " earthstar scleroderma " ( Scleroderma <unk> ) , but this yellowish @-@ brown species does not have the purple coloration of Sarcosphaera coronaria . Peziza ammophila ( formerly classified in the genus Sarcosphaera ) has an exterior surface that is colored brown to dark brown , and when young it is cup @-@ shaped . <unk> <unk> also has a pinkish @-@ colored hymenium , but it is smaller and always cup @-@ shaped . <unk> <unk> is another cup fungus that superficially resembles S. coronaria in its form and subterranean growth habit ; however , the surface of its hymenium is cream @-@ colored with ochraceous tinges , and its outer surface is covered with brown hairs . <unk> <unk> may also be included as a potential lookalike to S. coronaria , as it is macroscopically indistinguishable from G. <unk> . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Sarcosphaera coronaria has no distinctive taste or odor , although one source says that as it gets older the odor becomes " reminiscent of rhubarb " . Although older literature describes it as a good edible species , modern literature does not recommended it for consumption . It gives some individuals gastrointestinal discomfort , reputedly similar to poisoning symptoms caused by morels . A number of poisonings attributed to this species have been reported from Europe , including one fatal poisoning in the Jura area in 1920 , following which a warning was issued not to eat it raw or in salads . Although the fruit bodies are edible after cooking , they are rarely collected by mushroom pickers , and have no commercial value . 
 The chemical composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed , and the dried fruit bodies determined to contain the following nutritional components : protein , 19 @.@ 46 % ; fat , 3 @.@ 65 % ; ash , 32 @.@ 51 % ; carbohydrates , 44 @.@ 38 % ( including 6 @.@ 71 % as non @-@ digestible cellulose ) . Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84 @.@ 4 % . The mushrooms are a good source of the element vanadium , shown in a 2007 study to be present at a concentration of 0 @.@ 142 mg / kg ( dry weight ) . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Historically , Sarcosphaera coronaria has been assumed to be saprobic , acquiring nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter . The fungus , however , is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza , and it is often locally abundant where it occurs , year after year in the same location , indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle . The results of a 2006 study of <unk> fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont , and more generally , that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought . 
 The fruit bodies are found singly , scattered , or clustered together in broad @-@ leaf woods favoring beech , less frequently with conifers . A preference for calcareous soils has been noted , but they will also grow on acidic bedrock . Because their initial development is subterranean , young fruit bodies are easy to overlook , as they as usually covered with dirt or forest duff . They are more common in mountainous locations , and occur most frequently in the spring , often near melting snow . The fungus is distributed in 23 European countries , North Africa , and North America , from British Columbia eastward to Michigan and New York , south to Veracruz , Mexico . It has also been collected from Israel and the Asian part of Turkey . In Europe , the fungus is red @-@ listed in 14 countries , and is considered a threatened species by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi . It is short @-@ listed for inclusion in the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi . Threats to the species include loss and degradation of habitats due to clearcutting and soil disturbance . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 The fruit bodies can bioaccumulate the toxic heavy metal arsenic from the soil in the form of the compound <unk> acid . Although less toxic than arsenic trioxide , it is still relatively dangerous . Concentrations over 1000 mg / kg ( dry weight ) are often reached . As reported in one 2004 publication , a mature specimen collected near the town of Český <unk> in the Czech Republic was found to have an arsenic content of 7090 mg / kg dry weight , the highest concentration ever reported in a mushroom . Typically , the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1 mg / kg . In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species ( collected from areas not known to be polluted ) , S. coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8 @.@ 8 mg / kg dry weight , while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0 @.@ 003 mg / kg ( in Sarcodon leucopus ) to 0 @.@ 54 mg / kg ( in Lactarius salmonicolor ) .

 = Eden Hazard = 
 Eden Michael Hazard ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 7 January 1991 ) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays for Chelsea and the Belgium national team . He primarily plays as an attacking midfielder and a winger . Hazard 's creativity , speed , and technical ability are widely acknowledged . He has been described as " a superb passer " and has earned critical acclaim for his playing style , which has led to the media , coaches , and players drawing comparisons to FIFA Ballon d 'Or winners Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo . Hazard is often ranked by coaches , colleagues , and commentators as one of the best players in the world . 
 Hazard is the son of former Belgian footballers and began his football career in Belgium playing for local clubs Royal Stade <unk> and Tubize . In 2005 , he moved to France joining first division club Lille . Hazard spent two years in the club 's academy and , at the age of 16 , made his professional debut in November 2007 . He went on to become an integral part of Lille under manager Rudi Garcia , racking up over 190 appearances . In his first full season as a starter , he won the National Union of Professional Footballers ( UNFP ) Young Player of the Year award becoming the first non @-@ French player to win the award . In the 2009 – 10 season , Hazard captured the award again becoming the first player to win the award twice . He was also named to the league 's Team of the Year . 
 In the 2010 – 11 season , he was a part of the Lille team that won the league and cup double and , as a result of his performances , was named the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year becoming the youngest player to win the award . Hazard was also given the Bravo Award by Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo for his performances during the 2010 – 11 season . In June 2012 , after spending over eight years at Lille , Hazard signed for English club Chelsea , where he went on to win the UEFA Europa League in his first season and the PFA Young Player of the Year in his second . In the 2014 – 15 season , he helped Chelsea win the League Cup and Premier League , earning him the FWA Footballer of the Year and the PFA Players ' Player of the Year awards . 
 Hazard is a Belgium international , having represented his nation at under @-@ 17 and under @-@ 19 level . Hazard made his senior international debut in November 2008 , aged 17 , in a friendly match against Luxembourg . Nearly three years after his debut , Hazard scored his first international goal against Kazakhstan in October 2011 . He has since earned 70 caps , and was a member of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter @-@ finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hazard was born in La Louvière and grew up in Braine @-@ le @-@ Comte . His mother , Carine , and father , Thierry , were both footballers . His father spent most of his career playing at semi @-@ professional level with La Louvière in the Belgian Second Division . He played mainly as a defensive midfielder . His mother played as a striker in the Belgian Women 's First Division and stopped playing when she was three months pregnant with Eden . After playing football , both parents became sports teachers . Thierry retired from his position in 2009 in order to devote more time to his children . 
 Hazard is the eldest of four children . He has three brothers , all of whom play football , including <unk> , who joined him at Chelsea in 2012 and had previously progressed through the youth ranks of Lille 's biggest rivals Lens . Hazard 's other younger brothers are <unk> and Ethan . On 15 July 2013 , <unk> joined White Star Bruxelles , but now plays for <unk> <unk> , while Ethan remains playing in the youth academy of Eden 's former club Tubize . 
 Hazard and his three brothers were raised in a comfortable environment with their parents ensuring they had whatever they needed to excel . The family lived " no more than three metres " from a football training ground and the brothers often ventured onto a training pitch through a small hole in order to hone and develop their skills .

 Hazard began his football career playing for hometown club Royal Stade <unk> at the age of four . During his time at the club , one of his youth coaches described him as a " gifted " player . He added : " He knew everything . I had nothing to teach him " . Hazard spent eight years at the club before moving to Tubize . While at Tubize , he was spotted by a Lille scout while playing in a local tournament with the club . The scout 's subsequent report on the player prompted club officials to meet with Hazard 's father and offer the young player an aspirant ( youth ) contract . 
 Hazard 's parents accepted the offer from Lille with hopes that the training facilities in France would be better . Hazard 's father later admitted that the decision to let Eden and , later <unk> , join clubs in the North of France was the best solution stating " They remained so close to home and , at the same time , they integrated at structures where they could grow , because in Belgium , unfortunately , it 's a little empty for the training of youth " . 
 = = = Lille = = = 
 Hazard joined Lille in 2005 and spent two years developing in the club 's local sports school , due to its youth academy in Luchin not being in operation at that time . On 28 May 2007 , he signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three year deal with Lille . At the start of the 2007 – 08 season , at the age of 16 , Hazard was promoted to the club 's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur , the fourth level of French football , though he still played with Lille 's under @-@ 18 team in its league and the Coupe Gambardella . Hazard made his amateur debut on 1 September 2007 in a league match against Racing Club de France appearing as a second @-@ half substitute in a 3 – 1 defeat . He made his first start a week later in the team 's 1 – 0 defeat to <unk> . 
 After spending the majority of October and the early part of November playing with the club 's under @-@ 18 team , on 14 November , due to several players being on international duty , Hazard was called up to the senior team by manager Claude Puel to participate in a friendly match against Belgian club Bruges on 16 November . He appeared as a substitute in the match and , as a result of his performance , was included in the 18 @-@ man squad to face Nancy in a league match on 24 November . Hazard , subsequently , made his professional debut in the match coming on as a substitute in the 78th minute . 
 Hazard returned to the club 's reserve team and spent December playing with the squad . Following the winter break , Hazard returned to the first team in January and made substitute appearances in three league matches against Metz , Sochaux , and Paris Saint @-@ Germain . Following the match against Paris Saint @-@ Germain , he was demoted back to amateur level where he played concurrently with the reserve team in the fourth division and the under @-@ 18 team in the Coupe Gambardella . On 17 May 2008 , he scored his first amateur goal in a 3 – 2 victory over Vitré . Hazard finished his amateur career with 11 appearances and one goal , helping the reserve team finished in fifth place , which was first among professional clubs ' reserve teams playing in the group . 
 = = = = 2008 – 09 season = = = = 
 For the 2008 – 09 season , Hazard was given the number 26 shirt after playing with the number 33 shirt in his debut season . He was also promoted to the senior team permanently by new manager Rudi Garcia . Early on , he made substitute appearances regularly making his season debut as a substitute on 14 September 2008 against Sochaux in a 1 – 1 draw . One of his substitute appearances proved beneficial against Auxerre on 20 September . With Lille trailing 2 – 1 in the waning minutes of the match , Hazard , after Lille took a corner kick , quickly scooped up a short clearance from Auxerre and took a right @-@ footed shot just outside the box . It beat the keeper and drew the score 2 – 2 in the 88th minute . With Lille 's confidence high , the club won the match 3 – 2 in injury time following a goal from Tulio de Melo . Hazard 's first career goal resulted in him becoming the youngest goalscorer in the club 's history . 
 Four days after scoring his first professional goal , Hazard made his first professional start in a 4 – 2 defeat on penalties to Montpellier in the Coupe de la Ligue . After featuring as a substitute in the team 's next five league matches , on 15 November , Hazard made his first professional league start against Saint @-@ Étienne . He capped the appearance by scoring the opening goal in the club 's 3 – 0 victory . His assured performances with the club resulted in Lille offering him a three year contract extension , which he agreed to on 18 November 2008 , tying him to the club until 2012 . 
 After featuring as a substitute in December , Hazard returned to the starting lineup in January . On 23 January , he scored the second goal in a 3 – 0 win over amateur club Dunkerque in Round of 32 of the Coupe de France . Two weeks later , he scored the match @-@ winning goal in a league match against Sochaux and , on 22 February , assisted on the winner against Monaco . In the Round of 16 of the Coupe de France , Hazard netted a goal in a 3 – 2 win over the competition 's defending champions Lyon . On 26 April , he scored the opening goal against Marseille , though Lille lost the match 2 – 1 . In the final ten league matches of the campaign , Hazard started eight and contributed to the team finishing in fifth place , which resulted in Lille qualifying for the newly created UEFA Europa League . After the season , he was named the National Union of Professional Footballers ( UNFP ) Young Player of the Year , becoming the first international player to achieve the honor . 
 = = = = 2009 – 10 season = = = = 
 Following the 2008 – 09 season , constant media speculation occurred in numerous countries regarding Hazard 's availability on the transfer market . Despite Lille chairman Michel Seydoux declaring the player off limits and Hazard stating that he wanted to remain at the club for at least another season , several clubs declared interest in the player . These included English clubs Arsenal and Manchester United , Italian club Internazionale , and Spanish clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid . French football legend Zinedine Zidane personally recommended the player to the latter club . 
 Hazard began the 2009 – 10 season on a positive note scoring in Lille 's first competitive match of the season . The goal , contributing to the team 's 2 – 0 victory , came against Serbian club FK <unk> in the first leg of the club 's third qualifying round match in the UEFA Europa League . On 27 August , he scored his second career European goal in the club 's second leg tie in the playoff round against Belgian club Genk . It was Lille 's final goal in the club 's 4 – 2 victory . The 6 – 3 aggregate scoreline assured the club progression to the Europa League group stage . 
 On 22 October , Hazard scored a goal in Lille 's important 3 – 0 victory over Italian club Genoa in the 84th minute after entering as a substitute 10 minutes prior . Upon receiving the ball on the left wing , Hazard proceeded to dash through the midfield dribbling past six Genoa defenders before finishing at the 18 @-@ yard box . A month later , Hazard was instrumental in Lille 's 5 – 1 thrashing of Czech club Slavia Prague as he was partly responsible for the opening goal — slicing through the defense and delivering a cross near post , which went off Slavia player Marek <unk> resulting in an own goal . 
 On 20 December , Hazard scored his first league goal of the season in the club 's 3 – 0 win over Le Mans . He also provided both the assists on the other two goals . On 30 January , Hazard scored the only goal in Lille 's win over Derby du Nord rivals Lens .

" Hazard 's former teammate and Lille captain Rio Mavuba described Hazard as " a great player , with an immense talent . He ’ s actually not that big , but he ’ s so fast . He ’ s also very difficult to dispossess and his finishing is top notch " . 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 Hazard 's pace coupled with his finishing and inability to be dispossessed easily led to his former coach Claude Puel dubbing him " little Messi " , in reference to the Barcelona star . Puel 's sentiments were later echoed by former Marseille manager and media personality Rolland <unk> who commented " At times it looks to me like Lionel Messi on the right @-@ hand side " . Hazard 's " flair and tricky " style of play has been described as being similar to Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo ; a comparison later repeated by former French international Christophe Dugarry . His vision , described as being the trait he has improved on the most , has allowed him to develop into an effective passer . 
 In Belgium , Hazard 's talent and similar ascension up the country 's football hierarchy has led to comparisons to former Belgian international Enzo Scifo . Both players share the same birthplace and Scifo himself spent time with Hazard while he was in Tubize admitting " Eden , you know , I 've coached in Tubize . During the week , I took care of the young people at least once , and he , in those days , I immediately saw he had a secure future " . 
 However , despite the positive opinions , Hazard has endured criticism from some . In 2010 , former Belgium national team manager Georges Leekens questioned Hazard 's work @-@ rate . Lille youth academy director Jean @-@ Michel Vandamme countered both managers ' criticism by arguing that Hazard simply possesses an intellectual honesty that is out of the ordinary and unexpected of today 's footballer declaring " He is a real competitor , not a cheat , nor a <unk> , because you don ’ t hear him complaining when he gets fouled " .

 = Jetpac Refuelled = 
 Jetpac Refuelled is a shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios . It was first released worldwide on the Xbox Live Arcade service on 28 March 2007 . The game is the fourth and final instalment of the Jetman series and a remake of Ultimate Play the Game 's 1983 ZX Spectrum game , Jetpac . The game follows Jetman as he attempts to rebuild his rocket in order to explore different planets , whilst simultaneously defending himself from hostile aliens . 
 Details of the game were first leaked in February 2007 , shortly before Rare officially announced development later that month . During development process Rare attempted to ensure that the game did not feel too similar to the original Jetpac , whilst keeping the core mechanics . The game received mostly favourable reviews upon release . Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay , however they criticised the overall repetitiveness of the game and its multiplayer mode . It was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is a remake of the original Jetpac with overhauled high @-@ definition graphics and 128 levels . It also features competitive gameplay over Xbox Live , leaderboards , and achievements . Similar to the first instalment , the player assumes control of Jetman and is presented in a horizontal wrap around which consists of six platforms on which Jetman can manoeuvre onto . Jetman has to first assemble his rocket , which spawns in separate parts that are scattered around a map , and then fills it with six fuel canisters before taking off to the next planet , where the procedure is repeated . In addition , Jetman has to defend himself from each planet 's hostile aliens , and collect valuable resources such as gold and platinum , which occasionally fall from the atmosphere , for bonus points . 
 Jetman 's only usable weapon in his laser . Weapon upgrades may also spawn around a map , which once picked up will give Jetman various upgrades to his weapon . Upgrades include as a wider fire spread , faster projectiles or higher damage . The player starts the game with three nuclear devices , which once used will eliminate all enemies from the screen . Jetman also has the ability to boost , which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed , although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted . 
 Jetpac Refuelled features a multiplayer mode that can be played either offline using a split screen or online via Xbox Live . In this mode , the player has to compete one @-@ on @-@ one in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does . Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast at close range . Lives are unlimited in multiplayer and the winner is determined by the highest score . A version of the original 1983 Jetpac is also included in the game .

 Details of a Jetpac remake were first leaked on a listing on the website of German rating board Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle on 6 February 2007 . Rare officially announced development of Jetpac Refuelled on 22 February 2007 . 
 In a retrospective interview , Rare designers Jens <unk> and Nick Burton took interest in the @-@ then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade and offered to develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare 's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo . Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360 , the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements . The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game . <unk> also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title , owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live . Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way <unk> shifted from graphics and game logic , stating that this was more difficult than it would have been for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo . 
 In a separate interview with Next @-@ Gen , Burton stated that during initial development of Jetpac Refuelled , senior management kept away entirely from the project . When Rare 's management allowed themselves to view the game , they offered the developers " a fresh eye and more frank criticism " . Further development took place before management were shown the game again in what was nicknamed a “ clean room ” test . Jetpac Refuelled , along with every title in the Jetman series , appeared in the retrospective August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Ultimate Play The Game and Rare titles , Rare Replay .

 The game was met with mostly favourable reviews upon release . Reviewers praised the updated graphics and addictive gameplay , however they criticised the overall repetitiveness of the game and its mediocre multiplayer mode . It received an aggregate score of 72 % from GameRankings based on 16 reviews , and an average score of 73 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on 17 reviews . Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised the visual makeover the new game , calling it " undoubtedly the best addition " to the series . Greg Stewart of GamesRadar labelled the updated graphics as " trippy " , preferring them over the " primitive " original . Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised the updated graphics as the best addition to the game , heralding them as " crisp , bright and colourful " and far superior to the original 1983 version . Jonathan Miller of IGN similarly thought the graphics were the strongest aspect of the game , praising the effects as " vibrant and colourful " whilst calling the ZX Spectrum version " nostalgically bad " . Miller also added that the updated visuals of the game made the experience feel " almost 10 times the game as the original " . 
 Reed criticised the repetitiveness of the game , stating that whilst 128 levels was good value for money , the gameplay was " merely a repeat " of what the player has already accomplished and that the multiplayer mode could prove " annoying very quickly " . Stewart also criticised the game 's repetitiveness and stated that he felt general gameplay was " shallow " , despite admitting it was addictive . Gerstmann similarly found the action repetitive and stated that there was " not enough variety " , especially in the multiplayer mode . However , Miller praised the gameplay as " fast , fun and addictive " , as he expected a game on the Xbox Live Arcade to be . Will Freeman of Video Gamer noted that the large number of levels caused the game to feel repetitive , but praised the overall addictiveness and fast pace of the game . 
 = M @-@ 121 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 121 is a state trunkline highway in West Michigan . The highway follows Chicago Drive , a local roadway , from Zeeland to Grandville . Chicago Drive itself runs past the M @-@ 121 segment on either side from Holland to Wyoming . The roadway passes through rural farmland on a route that runs parallel to Interstate 196 ( I @-@ 196 ) . M @-@ 121 forms the main street through the center of Hudsonville as it runs southwest – northeast . It forms a major street through the unincorporated community of Jenison before M @-@ 121 terminates at I @-@ 196 in Grandville . 
 The M @-@ 121 designation has been used twice before in the state . The first was for a former routing of US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) , and the second was for a connection between I @-@ 69 , I @-@ 75 / US 23 and the airport in the Flint area . Since 2007 , M @-@ 121 has been used for a portion of the former M @-@ 21 in Ottawa County , which was formerly designated as state @-@ maintained " Old M @-@ 21 " . Future plans will reconfigure a section of the current highway from four lanes divided to four lanes undivided . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Chicago Drive , largely signed as M @-@ 121 , is a combination state trunkline highway and municipal street running from 8th Street in Holland to the intersection of Grandville and Clyde Park avenues at the border of Grand Rapids and Wyoming , approximately 23 @.@ 5 miles ( 37 @.@ 8 km ) in length . Running eastward , Chicago Drive picks up the Business Loop I @-@ 196 designation east of US 31 . The highway has the typical mix of industry and commercial properties for the area . At 112th Avenue , it turns northeasterly to run through Zeeland . The roadway changes names when it turns due east again , where it is named Main Avenue and Main Place , comprising the only section of the route not designated Chicago Drive . 
 Starting at the corner of Main Street and Chicago Drive , M @-@ 121 runs northeasterly out of Zeeland on Chicago Drive roughly parallel to I @-@ 196 . A CSX railroad line also parallels the road to the northwest . The trunkline is a four @-@ lane divided highway bordered by farms . Passing the Hudsonville Fair Grounds , Chicago Drive enters Hudsonville as the main street downtown . The highway continues to the northeast out of town through suburban residential areas to Jenison , where once again Chicago Drive is bordered by commercial properties . Through this area , the roadway is divided , utilizing Michigan lefts . The M @-@ 121 designation ends at the interchange with I @-@ 196 just across the Kent County line in Grandville . 
 The corridor from I @-@ 196 to its end in Grand Rapids is lined with businesses and few houses . The intersection of Chicago Drive and Wilson Avenue is downtown Grandville . In Wyoming from north of M @-@ 11 ( 28th Street ) to Burlingame Avenue , Chicago Drive run through a mostly industrial area with few commercial properties . Northeast of about Byron Center Avenue , Chicago Drive carries Business Spur I @-@ 196 ( BS I @-@ 196 ) . At the corner with Grandville and Clyde Park avenues , Chicago Drive ends and BS I @-@ 196 continues . 
 M @-@ 121 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the lowest traffic levels along M @-@ 121 were the 10 @,@ 103 vehicles daily at the western terminus in Zeeland ; the highest counts were the 20 @,@ 140 vehicles per day at the eastern terminus . None of M @-@ 121 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 M @-@ 121 was also used as the designation along two other roadways . In 1933 , it was used for a former routing of US 2 in the Upper Peninsula . In 1935 , this route was redesignated as a portion of a new M @-@ 5 and the M @-@ 121 designation was transferred to Bristol Road in Flint . This Flint @-@ area trunkline provided access to Bishop International Airport from both of the I @-@ 69 and I @-@ 75 / US 23 freeways until it was retired in 2003 . At that time , Bristol Road was returned to local control .

 From 1919 to 1926 , the current highway known as M @-@ 121 was designated M @-@ 51 . Then until 1974 , the trunkline was part of M @-@ 21 ; that designation was removed when I @-@ 196 was completed between those Zeeland and Grandville , and much of the route became an unsigned state trunkline designated Old M @-@ 21 , although it is locally referred to by its given name , Chicago Drive .

The southern terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) and US 13 at the Oxford Circle in Philadelphia . The northern terminus is at PA 32 in the borough of New Hope , Bucks County , on the banks of the Delaware River . The route passes through the urban areas of Northeast Philadelphia as two @-@ lane undivided Oxford Avenue , serving the Lawncrest , Burholme , and Fox Chase neighborhoods . Upon entering Montgomery County , PA 232 becomes a two- to four lane road called Huntingdon Pike that passes through suburban areas , serving the communities of Rockledge , Huntingdon Valley , and Bryn Athyn . The route passes through more suburban development in Bucks County as Second Street Pike , running through Southampton and Richboro . In Wrightstown Township , PA 232 enters rural areas and becomes Windy Bush Road as it heads north to New Hope . 
 South of Penns Park , the road was originally known as the Fox Chase and Huntingdon Valley Turnpike or the Second Street Turnpike , a turnpike that connected farms in Bucks County to Philadelphia . In 1928 , PA 232 was designated between PA 532 in Northeast Philadelphia and PA 32 in New Hope , while PA 163 was designated onto current PA 232 between PA 73 in Philadelphia and PA 63 in Bethayres .

 PA 232 begins at Oxford Circle , where it intersects with Roosevelt Boulevard ( US 1 / US 13 ) and Cheltenham Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia . The Oxford Circle is a modified traffic circle that has direct access to the local lanes of the Roosevelt Boulevard , with the express lanes passing under it . Here the route continues north on Oxford Avenue , a two @-@ lane undivided surface road . The road passes through urban areas of businesses before turning northwest into areas of rowhomes . Upon reaching Har Nebo Cemetery , the route turns north through locations of homes and businesses and passes to the east of Naval Support Activity Philadelphia . 
 After passing the naval facility , Oxford Avenue continues northeast at the intersection with Robbins Street / Martins Mill Road . PA 232 runs north through the residential Lawncrest neighborhood and reaches an intersection with Cottman Avenue ( PA 73 ) in the Burholme neighborhood . From this junction , the route passes a mix of urban residential and commercial establishments as it comes to a bridge over CSX ’ s Trenton Subdivision at the <unk> Avenue intersection and continues into the Fox Chase neighborhood , crossing SEPTA ’ s Fox Chase Line near the Fox Chase train station .

Here , the road passes between the Hollywood neighborhood to the west and a shopping center to the east . Farther north , PA 232 runs through wooded residential areas as it comes to the Susquehanna Road intersection . The road turns northeast at this point and passes near more homes prior to running to the southeast of Holy Redeemer Hospital , at which point it widens into a divided highway . PA 232 crosses over the Pennypack Creek and the abandoned Fox Chase @-@ Newtown rail line as it enters Lower Moreland Township at the Moreland Road intersection . Here , the route passes over SEPTA ’ s West Trenton Line near the Bethayres Train Station and crosses Welsh Road / Philmont Avenue ( PA 63 ) in the community of Huntingdon Valley . 
 Past the PA 63 intersection , PA 232 narrows into a two @-@ lane undivided road and is lined with homes before passing a few businesses . The road continues into Bryn Athyn and runs through wooded residential areas before passing between the Bryn Athyn Cathedral to the west and Bryn Athyn College to the east . The route continues into less dense wooded residential development as it briefly forms the border between Lower Moreland Township to the west and Bryn Athyn to the east before fully entering Lower Moreland Township again .

 In colonial times , the current alignment of PA 232 was referred to as the Middle Road because it was roughly midway between Old York Road and Bustleton Pike . What is now PA 232 in Montgomery County was originally chartered in 1846 as the Fox Chase and Huntingdon Valley Turnpike . This road was a turnpike that connected the Fox Chase area and ran through eastern Montgomery County to County Line Road at the Bucks County border . Further south into Philadelphia , the road was known variously as Oxford Avenue , Oxford Pike , and Oxford Turnpike . The Fox Chase and Huntingdon Valley Turnpike was also known as the Second Street Turnpike . The Second Street Pike continued the Huntington Pike north from the border of Montgomery and Bucks counties to Wrightstown in Bucks County and served as a route for farmers into Philadelphia . 
 In 1928 , PA 232 was designated between PA 532 in Northeast Philadelphia and PA 32 in New Hope , following Welsh Road to PA 63 in Bethayres before turning north along its current alignment . The present @-@ day route from PA 63 south to PA 73 in Philadelphia was designated as PA 163 . PA 232 was rerouted to head south and replace PA 163 by 1940 .

 = Cunard Line = 
 Cunard Line is an Anglo @-@ American cruise line based at Carnival House at Southampton , England , operated by Carnival UK and owned by Carnival Corporation & plc . It has been a leading operator of passenger ships on the North Atlantic , celebrating 175 years of operation in 2015 . 
 In 1839 , Nova Scotian Samuel Cunard was awarded the first British trans @-@ Atlantic steamship mail contract , and the next year formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam @-@ Packet Company together with Robert Napier , the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder , to operate the line 's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool – Halifax – Boston route . For most of the next 30 years , Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage . However , in the 1870s Cunard fell behind its rivals , the White Star Line and the Inman Line . To meet this competition , in 1879 the firm was reorganized as Cunard Steamship Company , Ltd to raise capital . 
 In 1902 , White Star joined the American owned International Mercantile Marine Co. and the British Government provided Cunard with substantial loans and a subsidy to build two superliners needed to retain its competitive position . Mauretania held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929 . The sinking of her running mate Lusitania in 1915 was one of the causes of the United States ' entering the First World War . In the late 1920s , Cunard faced new competition when the Germans , Italians and French built large prestige liners . Cunard was forced to suspend construction on its own new <unk> because of the Great Depression . In 1934 , the British Government offered Cunard loans to finish Queen Mary and to build a second ship , Queen Elizabeth , on the condition that Cunard merged with the then ailing White Star line to form Cunard @-@ White Star Ltd . Cunard owned two @-@ thirds of the new company . Cunard purchased White Star 's share in 1947 ; the name reverted to the Cunard Line in 1950 . 
 Upon the end of World War II , Cunard regained its position as the largest Atlantic passenger line . By the mid @-@ 1950s , it operated 12 ships to the United States and Canada . After 1958 , trans @-@ Atlantic passenger ships became increasingly unprofitable because of the introduction of jet airliners . Cunard withdrew from its year round service in 1968 to concentrate on cruising and summer transatlantic voyages for vacationers . The Queens were replaced by Queen Elizabeth 2 ( QE2 ) , which was designed for the dual role . 
 In 1998 , Cunard was acquired by the Carnival Corporation , and accounted for 8 @.@ 7 % of that company 's revenue in 2012 . Five years later , QE2 was replaced on the <unk> runs by Queen Mary 2 ( QM2 ) . The line also operates Queen Victoria ( QV ) and Queen Elizabeth ( QE ) . At the moment , Cunard is the only shipping company to operate a scheduled passenger service between Europe and North America .

 The British Government started operating monthly mail brigs from Falmouth , Cornwall , to New York in 1756 . These ships carried few non @-@ governmental passengers and no cargo . In 1818 , the Black Ball Line opened a regularly scheduled New York – Liverpool service with clipper ships , beginning an era when American sailing packets dominated the North Atlantic saloon @-@ passenger trade that lasted until the introduction of steamships . A Committee of Parliament decided in 1836 that to become more competitive , the mail packets operated by the Post Office should be replaced by private shipping companies . The Admiralty assumed responsibility for managing the contracts . Famed Arctic explorer , Admiral Sir William Edward Parry was appointed as Comptroller of Steam Machinery and Packet Service in April 1837 . Nova Scotians led by their young Assembly Speaker , Joseph Howe lobbied for steam service to Halifax . On his arrival in London in May 1838 , Howe discussed the enterprise with fellow Nova Scotian Samuel Cunard ( 1787 – 1865 ) , a shipowner who was also visiting London on business . Cunard and Howe were associates and Howe also owed Cunard £ 300 . ( £ 24 @,@ 360 in 2015 ) , Cunard returned to Halifax to raise capital , and Howe continued to lobby the British government . The Rebellions of 1837 were ongoing and London realized that the proposed Halifax service was also important for the military . 
 That November , Parry released a tender for North Atlantic monthly mail service to Halifax beginning in April 1839 using steamships with 300 horsepower . The Great Western Steamship Company , which had opened its pioneer Bristol – New York service earlier that year , bid £ 45 @,@ 000 for a monthly Bristol – Halifax – New York service using three ships of 450 horsepower . While British American , the other pioneer transatlantic steamship company did not submit a tender , the St. George Steam Packet Company , owner of Sirius , bid £ 45 @,@ 000 for a monthly Cork @-@ Halifax service and £ 65 @,@ 000 for a monthly Cork – Halifax – New York service . The Admiralty rejected both tenders because neither bid offered to begin services early enough . 
 Cunard , who was back in Halifax , unfortunately did not know of the tender until after the deadline . He returned to London and started negotiations with Admiral Parry , who was Cunard 's good friend from when Parry was a young officer stationed in Halifax 20 years earlier . Cunard offered Parry a fortnightly service beginning in May 1840 . While Cunard did not then own a steamship , he had been an investor in an earlier steamship venture , Royal William , and owned coal mines in Nova Scotia . Cunard 's major backer was Robert Napier , who was the Royal Navy 's supplier of steam engines . He also had the strong backing of Nova Scotian political leaders at the time when London needed to rebuild support in British North America after the rebellion . 
 Over Great Western 's protests , in May 1839 Parry accepted Cunard 's tender of £ 55 @,@ 000 for a three @-@ ship Liverpool – Halifax service with an extension to Boston and a supplementary service to Montreal . The annual subsidy was later raised £ 81 @,@ 000 to add a fourth ship and departures from Liverpool were to be monthly during the winter and fortnightly for the rest of the year . Parliament investigated Great Western 's complaints , and upheld the Admiralty 's decision . Napier and Cunard recruited other investors including businessmen James Donaldson , Sir George Burns , and David MacIver . In May 1840 , just before the first ship was ready , they formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company with initial capital of £ 270 @,@ 000 , later increased to £ 300 @,@ 000 . ( £ 24 @,@ 428 @,@ 873 in 2015 ) , Cunard supplied £ 55 @,@ 000 . Burns supervised ship construction , McIver was responsible for day @-@ to @-@ day operations , and Cunard was the " first among equals ' in the management structure . When MacIver died in 1845 , his younger brother Charles assumed his responsibilities for the next 35 years . ( For more detail of the first investors in the Cunard Line and also the early life of Charles Maciver , see Liverpool Nautical Research Society 's Second Merseyside Maritime History , pp. 33 – 37 1991 . ) 
 In May 1840 the coastal paddle steamer Unicorn made the company 's first voyage to Halifax to begin the supplementary service to Montreal . Two months later the first of the four ocean @-@ going steamers of the Britannia Class , departed Liverpool . By coincidence , the steamer ’ s departure had patriotic significance on both sides of the Atlantic : she was named the Britannia , and sailed on July 4 . Even on her maiden voyage , however , her performance indicated that the new era she heralded would be much more beneficial for Britain than the US . At a time when the typical packet ship might take several weeks to cross the Atlantic , the Britannia reached Halifax in 12 days and 10 hours , averaging 8 @.@ 5 knots ( 15 @.@ 7 km / h ) , before proceeding to Boston . Such relatively brisk crossings quickly became the norm for the Cunard Line : during 1840 – 41 , mean Liverpool – Halifax times for the quartet were 13 days 6 hours to Halifax and 11 days 4 hours homeward . Two larger ships were quickly ordered , one to replace the Columbia , which sank at Seal Island , Nova Scotia in 1843 without loss of life . By 1845 , steamship lines led by Cunard carried more saloon passengers than the sailing packets . Three years later , the British Government increased the annual subsidy to £ 156 @,@ 000 so that Cunard could double its frequency . Four additional wooden paddlers were ordered and alternate sailings were direct to New York instead of the Halifax @-@ Boston route . The sailing packet lines were now reduced to the immigrant trade . 
 From the beginning Cunard 's ships used the line 's distinctive red funnel with two or three narrow black bands and black top . It appears that Robert Napier was responsible for this feature . His shipyard in Glasgow used this combination previously in 1830 on Thomas Assheton Smith 's private steam yacht " Menai " . The renovation of her model by Glasgow Museum of Transport revealed that she had vermilion funnels with black bands and black top . 
 Cunard 's reputation for safety was one of the significant factors in the firm 's early success . Both the first two transatlantic lines failed after major accidents . British and American collapsed after the President foundered in a gale and Great Western after Great Britain stranded because of a navigation error . Cunard 's orders to his masters were , " Your ship is loaded , take her ; speed is nothing , follow your own road , deliver her safe , bring her back safe – safety is all that is required . " In particular , Charles MacIver 's constant inspections were responsible for the firm 's safety discipline . 
 = = = New Competition : 1850 – 1879 = = = 
 In 1850 the American Collins Line and the British Inman Line started new Atlantic steamship services . The American Government supplied Collins with a large annual subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to Cunard 's best , as they demonstrated with three Blue Riband @-@ winning voyages between 1850 and 1854 . Meanwhile , Inman showed that iron @-@ hulled , screw propelled steamers of modest speed could be profitable without subsidy . Inman also became the first steamship line to carry steerage passengers . Both of the newcomers suffered major disasters in 1854 . The next year , Cunard put pressure on Collins by commissioning its first iron @-@ hulled <unk> , Persia . That pressure may well have been a factor in a second major disaster suffered by the Collins Line , the loss of its steamer Pacific . The Pacific sailed out of Liverpool just a few days before the Persia was due to depart on her maiden voyage , and was never seen again ; it was widely assumed at the time that the captain had pushed his ship to the limit in order to stay ahead of the new <unk> , and had likely collided with an iceberg during what was a particularly severe winter in the North Atlantic . A few months later the Persia inflicted a further blow to the Collins Line , regaining the Blue Riband with a Liverpool – New York voyage of 9 days 16 hours , averaging 13 @.@ 11 knots ( 24 @.@ 28 km / h ) . 
 During the Crimean War Cunard supplied 11 ships for war service . Every British North Atlantic route was suspended until 1856 except Cunard 's Liverpool @-@ Halifax @-@ Boston service . While Collins ' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war , it collapsed in 1858 after its subsidy for carrying mail across the Atlantic was reduced by the US Congress . Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of saloon passengers and in 1862 commissioned Scotia , the last paddle steamer to win the Blue Riband . Inman carried more passengers because of its success in the immigrant trade . To compete , in May 1863 Cunard started a secondary Liverpool @-@ New York service with iron @-@ hulled screw steamers that catered for steerage passengers . Beginning with China , the line also replaced the last three wooden paddlers on the New York mail service with iron screw steamers that only carried saloon passengers . 
 When Cunard died in 1865 , the equally conservative Charles MacIver assumed Cunard 's role . The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology . In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard 's premier unit , the Scotia . Cunard responded with its first high speed screw <unk> steamer , Russia which was followed by two larger editions . In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the Oceanic and her five sisters . The new White Star record @-@ breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines . White Star also set new standards for comfort by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins . Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard , but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals . Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman . 
 In 1867 responsibility for mail contracts was transferred back to the Post Office and opened for bid . Cunard , Inman and the German Norddeutscher Lloyd were each awarded one of the three weekly New York mail services . The fortnightly route to Halifax formerly held by Cunard went to Inman . Cunard continued to receive a £ 80 @,@ 000 subsidy ( equivalent to £ 6 @,@ 388 @,@ 398 in 2015 ) , while NDL and Inman were paid sea postage . Two years later the service was rebid and Cunard was awarded a seven @-@ year contract for two weekly New York mail services at £ 70 @,@ 000 per annum . Inman was awarded a seven @-@ year contract for the third weekly New York service at £ 35 @,@ 000 per year . 
 The Panic of 1873 started a five @-@ year shipping depression that strained the finances of all of the Atlantic competitors . In 1876 the mail contracts expired and the Post Office ended both Cunard 's and Inman 's subsidies . The new contracts were paid on the basis of weight , at a rate substantially higher than paid by the United States Post Office . Cunard 's weekly New York mail sailings were reduced to one and White Star was awarded the third mail sailing . Every Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday a liner from one of the three firms departed Liverpool with the mail for New York . 
 = = = Cunard Steamship Company Ltd : 1879 – 1934 = = = 
 To raise additional capital , in 1879 the privately held British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was reorganised as a public stock corporation , the Cunard Steamship Company , Ltd . Under Cunard 's new chairman , John Burns ( 1839 – 1900 ) , son of one of the firm 's original founders , Cunard commissioned four steel @-@ hulled express liners beginning with Servia of 1881 , the first passenger liner with electric lighting throughout . In 1884 , Cunard purchased the almost new Blue Riband winner Oregon from the Guion Line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard . That year , Cunard also commissioned the record @-@ breakers Umbria and Etruria capable of 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ) . Starting in 1887 , Cunard 's newly won leadership on the North Atlantic was threatened when Inman and then White Star responded with twin screw record @-@ breakers . In 1893 Cunard countered with two even faster Blue Riband winners , Campania and Lucania , capable of 21 @.@ 8 knots ( 40 @.@ 4 km / h ) . 
 No sooner had Cunard re @-@ established its supremacy than new rivals emerged . Beginning in the late 1860s several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers from Liverpool . In 1897 Kaiser Wilhelm der Große of Norddeutscher Lloyd raised the Blue Riband to 22 @.@ 3 knots ( 41 @.@ 3 km / h ) , and was followed by a succession of German record @-@ breakers . Rather than match the new German <unk> , White Star – a rival which Cunard line would merge with – commissioned four very profitable Celtic @-@ class liners of more moderate speed for its secondary Liverpool @-@ New York service . In 1902 White Star joined the well @-@ capitalized American combine , the International Mercantile Marine Co . ( IMM ) , which owned the American Line , including the old Inman Line , and other lines . IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg – America and Norddeutscher Lloyd . 
 This was the Dreadnought era and British prestige was at stake . The British Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £ 150 @,@ 000 plus a low interest loan of £ 2 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to £ 243 million in 2015 ) , to pay for the construction of the two superliners , the Blue Riband winners Lusitania and Mauretania , capable of 26 @.@ 0 knots ( 48 @.@ 2 km / h ) . In 1903 the firm started a Fiume – New York service with calls at Italian ports and Gibraltar . The next year Cunard commissioned two ships to compete directly with the Celtic @-@ class liners on the secondary Liverpool @-@ New York route . In 1911 Cunard entered the St Lawrence trade by purchasing the Thompson line , and absorbed the Royal line five years later . 
 Not to be outdone , both White Star and Hamburg – America each ordered a trio of superliners . The White Star Olympic @-@ class liners at 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ) and the Hapag Imperator @-@ class liners at 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ) were larger and more luxurious than the <unk> , but not as fast . Cunard also ordered a new ship , Aquitania , capable of 24 @.@ 0 knots ( 44 @.@ 4 km / h ) , to complete the Liverpool mail fleet . Events prevented the expected competition between the three sets of superliners . White Star 's Titanic sank on its maiden voyage , both White Star 's Britannic and Cunard 's Lusitania were war losses , and the three Hapag super @-@ liners were handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations . 
 In 1916 Cunard Line completed its European headquarters in Liverpool , moving in on 12 June of that year . The grand neo @-@ Classical Cunard Building was the third of Liverpool 's Three Graces . The headquarters were used by Cunard until the 1960s . 
 Due to First World War losses , Cunard began a post @-@ war rebuilding programme including eleven intermediate liners . It acquired the former Hapag Imperator ( renamed the Berengaria ) to replace the lost Lusitania as the running mate for Mauretania and Aquitania , and Southampton replaced Liverpool as the British destination for the three @-@ ship express service . By 1926 Cunard 's fleet was larger than before the war , and White Star was in decline , having been sold by IMM . 
 Despite the dramatic reduction in North Atlantic passengers caused by the shipping depression beginning in 1929 , the Germans , Italians and the French commissioned new " ships of state " prestige liners . The German Bremen took the Blue Riband at 27 @.@ 8 knots ( 51 @.@ 5 km / h ) in 1933 , the Italian Rex recorded 28 @.@ 9 knots ( 53 @.@ 5 km / h ) on a westbound voyage the same year , and the French Normandie crossed the Atlantic in just under four days at 30 @.@ 58 knots ( 56 @.@ 63 km / h ) in 1937 . In 1930 Cunard ordered an 80 @,@ 000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record @-@ breakers fast enough to fit into a two @-@ ship weekly Southampton @-@ New York service . Work on hull 534 was halted in 1931 because of the economic conditions . 
 = = = Cunard @-@ White Star Ltd : 1934 – 1949 = = = 
 In 1934 , both the Cunard Line and the White Star Line were experiencing financial difficulties . David Kirkwood , MP for Clydebank where the unfinished hull 534 had been sitting idle for two and a half years , made a passionate plea in the House of Commons for funding to finish the ship and restart the dormant British economy . The government offered Cunard a loan of £ 3 million to complete hull 534 and an additional £ 5 million to build a second ship , if Cunard merged with White Star . The merger was accomplished by forming a new company , Cunard White Star , Ltd with Cunard owning about two @-@ thirds of the capital . Due to the surplus tonnage of the new combined Cunard White Star fleet many of the older liners were sent to the scrapyard ; these included the ex @-@ Cunard liner Mauretania and the ex @-@ White Star liners Olympic and Homeric . In 1936 the ex @-@ White Star Majestic was sold when hull 534 , now named Queen Mary , replaced her in the express mail service . Queen Mary reached 30 @.@ 99 knots ( 57 @.@ 39 km / h ) on her 1938 Blue Riband voyage . Cunard @-@ White Star started construction on Queen Elizabeth , and a smaller ship , the second Mauretania , joined the fleet and could also be used on the Atlantic run when one of the Queens was in drydock . The ex @-@ Cunard liner Berengaria was sold for scrap in 1938 after a series of fires . 
 During the 1939 – 45 Second World War the Queens carried over two million servicemen and were credited by Churchill as helping to shorten the war by a year . All four of the large Cunard @-@ White Star express liners , the two Queens , Aquitania and Mauretania survived , but many of the secondary ships were lost . Both Lancastria and Laconia were sunk with heavy loss of life . 
 In 1947 Cunard purchased White Star 's interest , and by 1949 the company had dropped the White Star name and was renamed Cunard Line . Also in 1947 the company commissioned five freighters and two cargo liners . Caronia , was completed in 1949 as a permanent cruise liner and Aquitania was retired the next year . Cunard was in an especially good position to take advantage of the increase in North Atlantic travel during the 1950s and the Queens were a major generator of US currency for Great Britain . Cunard 's slogan , " Getting there is half the fun " , was specifically aimed at the tourist trade . Beginning in 1954 , Cunard took delivery of four new 22 @,@ 000 @-@ GRT intermediate liners for the Canadian route and the Liverpool @-@ New York route . The last White Star motor ship , Britannic of 1930 , remained in service until 1960 . 
 In 1960 a government @-@ appointed committee recommended the construction of project Q3 , a conventional 75 @,@ 000 GRT liner to replace Queen Mary . Under the plan , the government would lend Cunard the majority of the liner 's cost . However , some Cunard stockholders questioned the plan at the June 1961 board meeting because trans @-@ Atlantic flights were gaining in popularity . By 1963 the plan had been changed to a dual @-@ purpose 55 @,@ 000 GRT ship designed to cruise in the off @-@ season . Ultimately , this ship came into service in 1969 as the 70 @,@ 300 GRT Queen Elizabeth 2 . 
 Within ten years of the introduction of jet airliners in 1958 , most of the conventional Atlantic liners were gone . Mauretania was retired in 1965 , the Queen Mary and Caronia in 1967 , and the Queen Elizabeth in 1968 . Two of the new intermediate liners were sold by 1970 and the other two were converted to cruise ships . Cunard tried operating scheduled air services to North America , the Caribbean and South America by forming BOAC @-@ Cunard Ltd in 1962 with the British Overseas Airways Corporation ( BOAC ) , but this venture lasted only until 1966 . 
 = = = Trafalgar House years : 1971 – 1998 = = = 
 In 1971 , when the line was purchased by the conglomerate Trafalgar House , Cunard operated cargo and passenger ships , hotels and resorts . Its cargo fleet consisted of 42 ships in service , with 20 on order . The flagship of the passenger fleet was the two @-@ year @-@ old Queen Elizabeth 2 . The fleet also included the remaining two intermediate liners from the 1950s , plus two purpose @-@ built cruise ships on order . Trafalgar acquired two additional cruise ships and disposed of the intermediate liners and most of the cargo fleet . During the Falklands War , QE2 and Cunard Countess were chartered as troopships while Cunard 's container ship Atlantic Conveyor was sunk by an Exocet missile . 
 Cunard acquired the Norwegian America Line in 1983 , with two classic ocean liner / cruise ships . Also in 1983 , the Trafalgar attempted a hostile takeover of P & O , another large passenger and cargo shipping line , which was formed the same year as Cunard . P & O objected and forced the issue to the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission . In their filing , P & O was critical of Trafalgar 's management of Cunard and their failure to correct QE2 's mechanical problems . In 1984 , the Commission ruled in favour of the merger , but Trafalgar decided against proceeding . In 1988 , Cunard acquired Ellerman Lines and its small fleet of cargo vessels , organising the business as Cunard @-@ Ellerman , however , only a few years later , Cunard decided to abandon the cargo business and focus solely on cruise ships . Cunard 's cargo fleet was sold off between 1989 and 1991 , with a single container ship , the second Atlantic Conveyor , remaining under Cunard ownership until 1996 . In 1993 , Cunard entered into a 10 @-@ year agreement to handle marketing , sales and reservations for the Crown Cruise Line , and its three vessels joined the Cunard fleet under the Cunard Crown banner . In 1994 Cunard purchased the rights to the name of the Royal Viking Line and its Royal Viking Sun . The rest of Royal Viking Line 's fleet stayed with the line 's owner , Norwegian Cruise Line . 
 By the mid @-@ 1990s Cunard was ailing . The company was embarrassed in late 1994 when the QE2 experienced numerous defects during the first voyage of the season because of unfinished renovation work . Claims from passengers cost the company US $ 13 million . After Cunard reported a US $ 25 million loss in 1995 , Trafalgar assigned a new CEO to the line , who concluded that the company had management issues . In 1996 the Norwegian conglomerate Kværner acquired Trafalgar House , and attempted to sell Cunard . When there were no takers , Kværner made substantial investments to turn around the company 's tarnished reputation . 
 = = = Carnival : from 1998 = = = 
 In 1998 , the cruise line conglomerate Carnival Corporation acquired 68 % of Cunard for US $ 425 million . The next year Carnival acquired the remaining stock for US $ 205 million . Ultimately , Carnival sued Kværner claiming that the ships were in worse condition than represented and Kværner agreed to refund USD $ 50 million to Carnival . Each of Carnival 's cruise lines is designed to appeal to a different market , and Carnival was interested in rebuilding Cunard as a luxury brand trading on its British traditions . Under the slogan " Advancing Civilization Since 1840 , " Cunard 's advertising campaign sought to emphasise the elegance and mystique of ocean travel . Only the QE2 and Caronia continued under the Cunard brand and the company started Project Queen Mary to build a new ocean liner / cruise ship for the transatlantic route . 
 By 2001 Carnival was the largest cruise company , followed by Royal Caribbean and P & O Princess Cruises , which had recently separated from its parent P & O. When Royal Caribbean and P & O Princess agreed to merge , Carnival countered with a hostile takeover bid for P & O Princess . Carnival rejected the idea of selling Cunard to resolve antitrust issues with the acquisition . European and US regulators approved the merger without requiring Cunard 's sale . After the merger was completed , Carnival moved Cunard 's headquarters to the offices of Princess Cruises in Santa Clarita , California so that administrative , financial and technology services could be combined . 
 With the opening of Carnival House in Southampton in 2009 , executive control of Cunard Line was subsequently transferred from Carnival Corporation in the United States , to Carnival UK , the primary operating company of Carnival plc . As the UK @-@ listed holding company of the group , Carnival plc had executive control of all Carnival Group activities in the UK , with the headquarters of all UK @-@ based brands , including Cunard , in offices at Carnival House . 
 In 2004 the 36 @-@ year @-@ old QE2 was replaced on the North Atlantic by Queen Mary 2 . Caronia was sold and QE2 continued to cruise until she was retired in 2008 . In 2007 Cunard added a large cruise ship , Queen Victoria . She is not a sister for the QM2 , being ordered by Carnival as a Vista class cruise ship for the Holland America Line . To reinforce Cunard traditions , the QV has a small museum on board . Cunard commissioned a second Vista class cruise ship , Queen Elizabeth in 2010 . 
 In 2010 Cunard appointed its first female commander , Captain Inger Klein Olsen . 
 In 2011 all three Cunard ships in service changed vessel registry to Hamilton , Bermuda , the first time in the 171 @-@ year history of the company that it had no ships registered in the United Kingdom . The captains of ships registered in Bermuda , but not in the UK , can marry couples at sea ; weddings at sea are a lucrative market . 
 On 25 May 2015 , the three Cunard ocean liners - Queen Mary 2 , Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria - sailed up the Mersey into Liverpool to commemorate the 175th anniversary of Cunard . The ships performed manoeuvres , including 180 @-@ degree turns , as the Red Arrows performed a flypast . Just over a year later Queen Elizabeth returned to Liverpool under Captain Olsen to take part in the celebrations of the centenary of the Cunard Building on 2 June 2016 .

 = Action of 30 May 1798 = 
 The Action of 30 May 1798 was a minor naval engagement between a small British squadron and a small French squadron off the coast of Normandy , France during the French Revolutionary Wars . A British <unk> force , which had been conducting patrols in the region in the aftermath of the battle of St Marcou earlier in the month , encountered two French vessels attempting to sail unnoticed between Le Havre and Cherbourg . Closing with the French , the British commander Sir Francis Laforey sought to bring the French ships to battle as they attempted to turn back to Le Havre before the British squadron could attack . The French were unable to escape , and Laforey 's ship , the fifth rate HMS Hydra , engaged the French corvette Confiante , while two smaller British ships chased the Vésuve . 
 After a brief exchange of fire , their crews ran both French ships onshore close to the mouth of the River Dives , where several of the landing barges that had survived the attack on the British @-@ held Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf were sheltering . Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning . Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles . There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1798 the British Royal Navy had successfully contained the French Navy within its own harbours , employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars . The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel , where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting the movements of the French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast . This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein . To improve the Royal Navy 's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast , a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized , garrisoned , and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf in 1795 . 
 During the spring of 1798 , Muskein concentrated over 50 of the landing barges in Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue and on 6 May launched an attack on the Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf while a combination of wind and tide prevented the blockade squadron from intervening . The fortified islands were too well @-@ defended however and over 900 French soldiers died in the ensuing battle before the French abandoned the attack . The French subsequently dispersed the remaining landing barges to various ports on the Normandy coast . In response the Royal Navy increased its patrols in the region with the intention of intercepting the convoys and destroying the barges . French movements along the coast were not solely confined to landing barges : on 29 May 1798 two warships , the 20 or 24 @-@ gun Confiante under captain de vaisseau Etienne <unk> , and the 20 @-@ gun Vésuve under lieutenant de vaisseau Jean @-@ Baptiste @-@ Louis Lecolier , sailed from Le Havre , travelling westwards across the Baie de la Seine to Cherbourg , accompanied by a small , armed cutter .

 On the morning of 30 May , a British squadron sailing off La Havre spotted the French ships pulling to the west and gave chase , Captain Laforey leading in the 38 @-@ gun HMS Hydra , followed by the bomb vessel HMS Vesuvius , under Captain Robert Fitzgerald , and the 12 @-@ gun cutter HMS Trial , under Lieutenant Henry Garrett . Discovering the British in pursuit , Pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards the shore , tacking in front of Hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range . Laforey continued his approach , and a 06 : 00 successfully tacked Hydra into a position between Confiante and Vésuve , which had turned back towards the shore . Although the British frigate came under fire from both French ships , their attacks had little impact . Laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against Vésuve and rapidly forced the French corvette to turn inshore , pursued by Vesuvius and Trial . Laforey then set off in pursuit of Confiante , which was attempting to turn back towards Le Havre . The French cutter was unable to escape the British pursuit and its crew deliberately drove it ashore near the mouth of the Dives River . 
 At 06 : 30 , Hydra caught up with Pevrieux on the Confiante and began a heavy fire , which the French warship returned when possible . The exchange continued for 45 minutes until 07 : 15 , when Confiante , having suffered serious damage , drove aground on a sandbank near <unk> , a village a short distance to the west of the mouth of the Dives . As Confiante struck the sandbank , her mainmast collapsed , rending further manoeuvre under hostile fire impossible . Vésuve too drove ashore to avoid the British attack , Lieutenant Lecolier managing to beach his ship within the Dives estuary itself . As the rising tide brought the corvette off the beach , Lecolier made a brief attempt to escape westwards towards Caen , but Trial and Vesuvius were alert and drove Vésuve back to the shore . There the two small British vessels opened up a distant fire on the corvette , as did Hydra to the west against Confiante . At 09 : 30 , the falling tide forced the British ships to retreat off @-@ shore , Laforey gathering his vessels approximately 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of the beached French convoy . 
 = = = Attack by boats = = = 
 During the day , the French strengthened the positions of both battered ships , soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels . Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein 's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River . These troops were identified by Trial , which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate . With their evacuation covered from the shore , most of the crew were removed from Confiante , including all the wounded . The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening . Vésuve was in better condition and remained well protected . Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose . Due to the strong French military presence , Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable . 
 At 10 : 00 on the morning of 31 May , Laforey sent the boats from his squadron inshore to attack the grounded Confiante . Coming alongside the wreck at 12 : 45 , the British boarding party , under Lieutenants George <unk> and William J. Simonds , found no one alive on the ship , but counted a large number of French dead still on board . Removing the French colours and paperwork , the boarding party started fires in the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing , despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore . The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties . 
 As the British attack proceeded against Confiante , the crew of Vésuve succeeded in refloating her and soon had their ship anchored under the protection of gun batteries at Sallenelles . These defences were augmented by additional batteries set up by 200 soldiers under Captain Muskein , drawn from the barges that had been trapped in the town by the British blockade . By the time Confiante had been destroyed , the mouth of the Dives had been heavily fortified and even the arrival of the 38 @-@ gun frigate HMS Diamond under Captain Sir Richard Strachan on 1 June was insufficient to counterbalance French numerical superiority . Eventually Laforey was forced to retire from the blockade of Sallenelles , and while he was absent Vésuve managed to get underway and reach Le Havre without further incident . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 French casualties in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiante 's destruction , but based on <unk> 's report from the boarding party they were believed to be heavy . British losses were negligible , with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels . The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle ; in the French history Victories et <unk> , Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided . British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier , focusing much of the blame for the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux . The restriction of French movement along their own coastline had serious effects for the development of the French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain .

Prior to the dinner , Amir , who is on the partner track , becomes involved in a controversial case . Amir 's assimilated nephew , Abe ( born Hussein Malik ) , has concerns regarding the propriety of the arrest of a local imam who is imprisoned on charges that may be trumped @-@ up of financing terrorist @-@ supporting groups , leading him to question whether it is religious persecution . Emily encourages the reluctant Amir to appear in court in support of the imam , in an unofficial capacity that gets mentioned in The New York Times . The case becomes dinner conversation when he hosts Jory , a colleague from work , and her husband , Isaac , who is Emily 's Jewish art dealer . In all , the dinner table assembly includes an ex @-@ Muslim , an African @-@ American , a Jew and a WASP dining over the topic of religious faith . The conversation touches upon " Islamic and Judaic tradition , the Quran and the Talmud , racial profiling and September 11 and the Taliban and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Benjamin Netanyahu " as tensions mount .

 Charles Isherwood of The New York Times , who saw the Off @-@ Broadway production in 2012 , said it was " a continuously engaging , vitally engaged play " that " bristles with wit and intelligence " and " puts contemporary attitudes toward religion under a microscope , revealing how tenuous self @-@ image can be for people born into one way of being who have embraced another . " Isherwood selected the play as one of his year @-@ end Ten Best Plays of 2012 . David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter also selected it as among his Ten Best in New York Theater 2012 , writing that Akhtar " staked a claim as one of the boldest voices to appear on the playwriting scene in recent years with this stinging swipe at the fallacy of the post @-@ racial nation . " 
 Of the Chicago production at American Theater company , Chicago Tribune theatre critic Chris Jones praised the show as " intensely arresting . " Time Out Chicago 's Kris Vire called the play " a compact , stunning gut punch addressing the cultural affinities some of us are allowed to escape and those we aren 't . " However , Chicago Sun @-@ Times critic Hedy Weiss noted that the plays five characters were all " identity @-@ warped " , and the show was a " minefield ... that feels all too deliberately booby @-@ trapped by the playwright . " The play won the Jeff Award — honoring excellence in Chicago Theater — for Best New Play in Chicago 2012 . 
 Entertainment Weekly critic Thom Geier suggested that the ending was underdeveloped , but that the play was well @-@ executed : " Akhtar packs a lot into his scenes , in terms of both coincidence @-@ heavy personal drama and talky disquisitions on religion and politics , but he usually manages to pull back from the edge of too @-@ <unk> .

 National Public Radio describes the play thematically as one that " tackles Islamophobia and questions of Muslim @-@ American identity " . Isherwood noted : " As two couples exchange observations about faith and politics in the modern world , the intellectual thickets they find themselves in become increasingly tangled . " More specifically he said , it is a play " about thorny questions of identity and religion in the contemporary world , with an accent on the incendiary topic of how radical Islam and the terrorism it inspires have affected the public discourse . " Kapoor has " rejected his Muslim upbringing ( and even his surname ) to better assimilate into his law firm , but he still feels the occasional tug of Islam " . Geier wrote : " Disgraced offers an engaging snapshot of the challenge for upwardly mobile Islamic Americans in the post @-@ 9 / 11 age . " According to The Guardian ' s Stephen Moss , the play comes to a head as the protagonist " tries to come to terms with his multiple identity – American v Asian , Muslim v secularist , passive observer of injustice v activist " . Although Amir has an affinity for $ 600 shirts with obscenely high thread counts , his home dinner party is set in his apartment which is " spare and tasteful with subtle flourishes of the Orient " . 
 During interviews following the Pulitzer announcement , Akhtar said that the play 's title has both a literal and a metaphorical meaning . Literally , Amir plays out his disgrace in almost real time before the audience . Metaphorically , Akhtar says " There are ways that the colonial history of the West is still playing out in the Muslim world . The events that comprise that history — a disgrace of native peoples , as it were — is still very much a part of our contemporary moment . "

 = Ælfhelm of York = 
 Ælfhelm ( died 1006 ) was the ealdorman of Northumbria , in practice southern Northumbria ( the area around York ) , from about 994 until his death . An ealdorman ( or earl ) was a senior nobleman who governed a province — a shire or group of shires — on behalf of the king . Ælfhelm 's powerful and wealthy family came from Mercia , a territory and former kingdom incorporating most of central England , and he achieved his position despite being an outsider . Ælfhelm first appears in charters as dux ( " ealdorman " ) in about 994 . 
 Most of Ælfhelm 's subsequent historical appearances record him as a witness to charters , although one notable exception is the will of his brother , Wulfric Spot . According to a 12th @-@ century tradition , Ælfhelm was murdered and his sons blinded in 1006 , by Eadric Streona with the connivance of King ( Æthelred II ) . Ælfhelm 's daughter , Ælfgifu , married Cnut the Great , King of England between 1016 and 1035 , as a result of which Ælfhelm became the grandfather of future English king Harold Harefoot . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Ælfhelm was a Mercian , son of Wulfrun , a rich noblewoman who founded Burton Abbey . His father is unknown , but it is thought that he was of lower rank than Wulfrun as Wulfric Spot , Ælfhelm 's brother , is called " Wulfric son of Wulfrun " , suggesting that his status derived mainly from his mother . Wulfric Spot founded Burton Abbey , but little is known about Ælfhelm 's sister , Ælfthryth . 
 Wulfrun also founded the Minster of St Mary 's at Wolverhampton , a settlement which took her name ( " Wulfrun 's chief settlement " ) . Her earliest association is with Tamworth , when she is mentioned as the only hostage taken after Amlaíb mac Gofraid , Norse @-@ Gael King of Northumbria , captured that city in 940 . It is thought that her lands were mostly in Staffordshire , while most of Wulfric Spot 's lands were in Staffordshire , Derbyshire , and western Warwickshire . 
 = = Ealdorman of southern Northumbria = = 
 Ælfhelm begins witnessing charters as dux , i.e. ealdorman , in 994 . He was thought by historian Simon Keynes to have been the same as <unk> of Anglo @-@ Saxon England ( <unk> ) " Ælfhelm 15 " , who witnesses charters as minister , i.e. thegn , from 982 to 990 . Charter appearances earlier , during the reign of Edgar the Peaceable , are possible , but it is impossible to show definitively that earlier thegns with the name Ælfhelm are the same as the future ealdorman of southern Northumbria , the latter only being positively identifiable by his title , dux . 
 Ælfhelm 's apparent promotion in 994 is thought by some historians , for instance Richard Fletcher , to have been due to the Scandinavian attack on Northumbria in 993 . Under the year 993 , the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle relates that Vikings had invaded Northumbria and sacked Bamburgh , whereupon the southern English raised an army : 
 Bamburgh was sacked and much booty was captured there , and after that the army came to the mouth of the Humber and did great damage there , both in the Kingdom of Lindsey and in Northumbria . Then a very large English army was collected , and when they should have joined battle , the leaders Fræna , Godwine and Frythegyst , first started the flight . 
 Fletcher speculated that Ælfhelm 's predecessor Thored , who disappeared from the records at this time , was removed from office and replaced by Ælfhelm by King Æthelred II as a result of his failure against the Scandinavians . Another historian , William Kapelle , believed Thored was removed because of his Scandinavian descent , an argument based on the Worcester Chronicle 's claim , added to the text borrowed from the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , that Fræna , Godwine and Frythegyst fled because " they were Danish on their father 's side " . 
 = = Wulfric Spot 's will = = 
 Ælfhelm 's brother , Wulfric Spot , left a will written in Old English , which provides many of the details we know about Ælfhelm . For instance , it gives the names of his two sons , Wulfheah and Ufegeat . It dates to between 1002 and 1004 , and survives in a 12th @-@ century manuscript . 
 Wulfric granted the lands " between the Ribble and the Mersey , and in the Wirral " to Ælfhelm and his son Wulfheah , on condition that they each pay Burton Abbey 3 @,@ 000 shad at shad season . Wulfric left Ælfhelm Rolleston ( Staffordshire ) , <unk> ( Staffordshire ) , and Conisbrough ( Yorkshire ) , the last on condition that he gave Burton one third of the fish there . Wulfheah received <unk> ( Staffordshire ) , Marchington ( Staffordshire ) , and <unk> ( Derbyshire ) , while Ælfhelm 's other son Ufegeat was given Norton ( Derbyshire ) " in the hope that he may be a better friend and supporter of the monastery [ of Burton ] " . Ælfhelm is asked to protect Burton Abbey and the possessions of Wulfric 's daughter . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Little else is recorded about Ealdorman Ælfhelm 's career before his death . Notice of the latter , with the blinding of his two sons , comes in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , which related under the year 1006 : 
 In this year Archbishop Ælfric died and Bishop Ælfheah succeeded him to the archiepiscopal see . In the same year <unk> was deprived of all his property , and Wulfheah and Ufegeat were blinded and Ealdorman Ælfhelm killed . 
 The Worcester Chronicle , which for this period consists of entries taken from the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle supplemented with extra information , gives an expanded saga @-@ like version of this account , attributing Ælfhelm 's death to Eadric Streona : 
 The crafty and treacherous Eadric Streona , plotting to deceive the noble ealdorman Ælfhelm , prepared a great feast for him at Shrewsbury at which , when he came as a guest , Eadric greeted him as if he were an intimate friend . But on the third or fourth day of the feast , when an ambush had been prepared , he took him into the wood to hunt . When all were busy with the hunt , one Godwine <unk> ( which means the town dog ) a Shrewsbury butcher , whom Eadric had dazzled long before with great gifts and many promises so that he might perpetrate the crime , suddenly leapt out from the ambush , and <unk> slew the ealdorman Ælfhelm . After a short space of time his sons , Wulfheah and Ufegeat , were blinded , at King Æthelred ’ s command , at Cookham , where he himself was then staying . 
 This material in the Worcester Chronicle seems to have been part of a lost saga about Eadric Streona , not extant but used by various surviving 11th- and 12th @-@ century sources . Kapelle thought Ælfhelm 's murder , conducted without King Æthelred 's displeasure , was the result of suspect loyalty in the face of Scandinavian invasions . 
 The sources appear to indicate that Ælfhelm 's successor was Uhtred of Bamburgh , the first magnate in decades to govern northern and southern Northumbria together . The text known as De <unk> <unk> ( " On the siege of Durham " ) , relates that Uhtred took power after defeating a Scottish invasion . 
 As well as his two sons Ælfhelm left a daughter , Ælfgifu of Northampton , by a woman named Wulfrun ; Ælfgifu 's territorial appellation is taken as further evidence that Ælfhelm had territory in the eastern Danelaw . She is perhaps more famous than her father , because at some time between 1013 and 1016 she married Cnut , son of Sweyn Forkbeard , future King of the English . Her son was Harold Harefoot , King of the English . 
 = Max Born = 
 Max Born ( German : [ <unk> ̯ n ] ; 11 December 1882 – 5 January 1970 ) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics . He also made contributions to solid @-@ state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s . Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his " fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics , especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function " . 
 Born was born in 1882 in Breslau , then in Germany , now in Poland and known as Wrocław . He entered the University of Göttingen in 1904 , where he found the three renowned mathematicians , Felix Klein , David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski . He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the subject of " Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space " , winning the University 's Philosophy Faculty Prize . In 1905 , he began researching special relativity with Minkowski , and subsequently wrote his habilitation thesis on the Thomson model of the atom . A chance meeting with Fritz Haber in Berlin in 1918 led to discussion of the manner in which an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen , which is today known as the Born – Haber cycle . 
 In the First World War , after originally being placed as a radio operator , he was moved to research duties regarding sound ranging due to his specialist knowledge . In 1921 , Born returned to Göttingen , arranging another chair for his long @-@ time friend and colleague James Franck . Under Born , Göttingen became one of the world 's foremost centres for physics . In 1925 , Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics . The following year , he formulated the now @-@ standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ * ψ in the Schrödinger equation , for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954 . His influence extended far beyond his own research . Max Delbrück , Siegfried Flügge , Friedrich Hund , Pascual Jordan , Maria Goeppert @-@ Mayer , Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim , Robert Oppenheimer , and Victor Weisskopf all received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Göttingen , and his assistants included Enrico Fermi , Werner Heisenberg , Gerhard Herzberg , Friedrich Hund , Pascual Jordan , Wolfgang Pauli , Léon Rosenfeld , Edward Teller , and Eugene Wigner . 
 In January 1933 , the Nazi Party came to power in Germany , and Born , who was Jewish , was suspended . He emigrated to Britain , where he took a job at St John 's College , Cambridge , and wrote a popular science book , The Restless Universe , as well as Atomic Physics , which soon became a standard textbook . In October 1936 , he became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh , where , working with German @-@ born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs , he continued his research into physics . Max Born became a naturalised British subject on 31 August 1939 , one day before World War II broke out in Europe . He remained at Edinburgh until 1952 . He retired to Bad Pyrmont , in West Germany , and died in a hospital in Göttingen on 5 January 1970 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Max Born was born on 11 December 1882 in Breslau ( now Wrocław , Poland ) , which at the time of Born 's birth was part of the Prussian Province of Silesia in the German Empire , to a family of Jewish descent . He was one of two children born to Gustav Born , an anatomist and embryologist , who was a professor of embryology at the University of Breslau , and his wife Margarethe ( Gretchen ) née Kauffmann , from a Silesian family of industrialists . She died when Max was four years old , on 29 August 1886 . Max had a sister , Käthe , who was born in 1884 , and a half @-@ brother , Wolfgang , from his father 's second marriage , to Bertha <unk> . Wolfgang later became Professor of Art History at the City College of New York . 
 Initially educated at the König @-@ Wilhelm @-@ Gymnasium in Breslau , Born entered the University of Breslau in 1901 . The German university system allowed students to move easily from one university to another , so he spent summer semesters at Heidelberg University in 1902 and the University of Zurich in 1903 . Fellow students at Breslau , Otto Toeplitz and Ernst Hellinger , told Born about the University of Göttingen , and Born went there in April 1904 . At Göttingen he found three renowned mathematicians : David Hilbert , Felix Klein and Hermann Minkowski . Very soon after his arrival , Born formed close ties to the latter two men . From the first class he took with Hilbert , Hilbert identified Born as having exceptional abilities and selected him as the lecture scribe , whose function was to write up the class notes for the students ' mathematics reading room at the University of Göttingen . Being class scribe put Born into regular , invaluable contact with Hilbert , during which time Hilbert 's intellectual largesse benefited Born 's fertile mind . Hilbert became Born 's mentor after selecting him to be the first to hold the unpaid , semi @-@ official position of assistant . Born 's introduction to Minkowski came through Born 's stepmother , Bertha , as she knew Minkowski from dancing classes in Königsberg . The introduction netted Born invitations to the Minkowski household for Sunday dinners . In addition , while performing his duties as scribe and assistant , Born often saw Minkowski at Hilbert 's house . 
 Born 's relationship with Klein was more problematic . Born attended a seminar conducted by Klein and professors of applied mathematics , Carl Runge and Ludwig Prandtl , on the subject of elasticity . Although not particularly interested in the subject , Born was obliged to present a paper . Using Hilbert 's calculus of variations , he presented one in which , using a curved configuration of a wire with both ends fixed , he demonstrated would be the most stable . Klein was impressed , and invited Born to submit a thesis on the subject of " Stability of Elastica in a Plane and Space " – a subject near and dear to Klein – which Klein had arranged to be the subject for the prestigious annual Philosophy Faculty Prize offered by the University . Entries could also qualify as doctoral dissertations . Born responded by turning down the offer , as applied mathematics was not his preferred area of study . Klein was greatly offended . 
 Klein had the power to make or break academic careers , so Born felt compelled to atone by submitting an entry for the prize . Because Klein refused to supervise him , Born arranged for Carl Runge to be his supervisor . Woldemar Voigt and Karl Schwarzschild became his other examiners . Starting from his paper , Born developed the equations for the stability conditions . As he became more interested in the topic , he had an apparatus constructed that could test his predictions experimentally . On 13 June 1906 , the rector announced that Born had won the prize . A month later , he passed his oral examination and was awarded his PhD in mathematics magna cum laude . 
 On graduation , Born was obliged to perform his military service , which he had deferred while a student . He found himself drafted into the German army , and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons " Empress Alexandra of Russia " , which was stationed in Berlin . His service was brief , as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907 . He then travelled to England , where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College , Cambridge , and studied physics for six months at the Cavendish Laboratory under J.J. Thomson , George Searle and Joseph Larmor . After Born returned to Germany , the Army re @-@ inducted him , and he served with the elite 1st ( Silesian ) Life Cuirassiers " Great Elector " until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks ' service . He then returned to Breslau , where he worked under the supervision of Otto <unk> and Ernst Pringsheim , hoping to do his habilitation in physics . A minor accident involving Born 's black body experiment , a ruptured cooling water hose , and a flooded laboratory , led to <unk> telling him that he would never become a physicist . 
 In 1905 , Albert Einstein published his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity . Born was intrigued , and began researching the subject . He was devastated to discover that Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines , but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results , Minkowski asked him to return to Göttingen and do his habilitation there . Born accepted . Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four @-@ dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter 's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics . Born and Minkowski got along well , and their work made good progress , but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909 . The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral . 
 Born attempted to present their results at a meeting of the Göttingen Mathematics Society a few weeks later . He did not get far before he was publicly challenged by Klein and Max Abraham , who rejected relativity , and forced to terminate the lecture . However , Hilbert and Runge were interested in Born 's work , and after some discussion with Born they became convinced of the veracity of his results , and persuaded him to give the lecture again . This time he was not interrupted , and Voigt offered to sponsor Born 's habilitation thesis .
