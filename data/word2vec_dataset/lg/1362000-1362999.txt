 The Hot Rock is the follow @-@ up to Sleater @-@ Kinney 's highly acclaimed third album Dig Me Out , released in 1997 by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars . After the success of Dig Me Out and its predecessor Call the Doctor , several major record labels grew interested in the band and offered them recording contracts , but the band ultimately decided to remain on Kill Rock Stars . As singer and guitarist Corin Tucker recalls , " We want to project the image that we 're successful " . Co @-@ vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein added , " And we 're proud that we 've been able to do that from a tiny label [ ... ] We 've been able to do it non @-@ traditionally , and hopefully that 's inspiring and encouraging to people " . 
 For its fourth album , Sleater @-@ Kinney wanted to work with producer Roger Moutenot due to his textural work on Yo La Tengo 's critically acclaimed 1997 album I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One . This marked a change from regular producer John Goodmanson , who had recorded every previous Sleater @-@ Kinney album . As Tucker explained , " These songs warranted a different production , so we looked to other people " . The band wanted to expand their sound and challenge themselves in new ways , stating that it was important for them not to make the same record twice . According to Tucker , " We have to keep pushing in order to stay interested in making music together , we want to have longevity as a band " . Similarly , drummer Janet Weiss stated that they " wanted the record to sound different than Dig Me Out , to make each song have a real strong personality " . The album was written over the course of a year , which was the longest period the band had spent on making an album . It was recorded at Avast studio in Seattle , Washington in July 1998 .

 The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band 's sound , veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors . As Rolling Stone noted , Sleater @-@ Kinney " delved into more oblique sounds [ ... ] Brownstein 's abandoned power chords to slither in abstract patterns , backed by Weiss ' increasingly subtle and complex drumming [ and ] Tucker expanded her vocal range steering from bellow to fragile ululations " . Likewise , The Village Voice writer Sara Sherr considered The Hot Rock to be Sleater @-@ Kinney 's darkest album . Brownstein remarked that the album 's sound and lyrics were heavily influenced by the music of The Go @-@ Betweens . 
 Unlike previous Sleater @-@ Kinney albums , most of the lyrical themes on The Hot Rock are more intimate , exploring failed relationships and personal uncertainty . As Weiss recalled , the songs are " really honest , even if they 're sometimes unpleasant . The lyrics evoke so many emotions . Our analogies are visual and the metaphors are direct . Corin and Carrie are singing about things they care about " . The album features a notable amount of vocal and guitar interplay between Tucker and Brownstein , who interweave their voices and play off each other to create very atmospheric songs such as " The End of You " and " Burn Don 't Freeze " . Music critic Robert Christgau said that " even reading the booklet it 's hard to keep track of who 's saying what to whom about what , as if they 'd fallen in love with ( or to ) the <unk> ' ' Murder Mystery ' " . 
 The title track " Hot Rock " , named after the 1972 film of the same name , notes the similarities between relationships and jewelry heists . The song " Banned from the End of the World " deals with the Y2K crisis and an uncertain future , while " God Is a Number " alludes to the impact of technology in society . The single " Get Up " features lead guitar lines by Brownstein and staccato riffs by Tucker . For Tucker , the song reflects the album 's thematic structure : " It 's more metaphorical and spiritual [ ... ] It 's not about one concrete thing ; it 's about searching for meaning and maybe finding it an unexpected place " . The tracks " The Size of Our Love " and " <unk> Your Lines " feature violin lines by Seth Warren of Red Stars Theory . The Village Voice described the former song , a ballad about two lovers in trouble , as " the saddest of the sad " . The last song , " A Quarter to Three " , features slide guitar work by the album 's producer .

 The Hot Rock received positive reviews from music critics . AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that The Hot Rock " isn 't quite as immediately satisfying as its two brilliant predecessors , but it does reward those willing to spend time absorbing its nervy introspection and moodiness " . Huey also praised the band 's use of dynamic tempo changes within the album 's songs . Wendy Mitchell , writing for CMJ New Music Monthly , felt that the band " has matured into the musical equivalent of a twentysomething ; still holding on to the energy of its youth , but exploring new options " .

 Rob Sheffield , writing for Rolling Stone , opined that " the expansive new sound gives Sleater @-@ Kinney room to experiment with their Husker Du @-@ style storytelling . " Sheffield also felt that the band had grown as songwriters , citing the song " The Size of Our Love " as the highlight of the album : " No other band could have made this song hit home -- not even Sleater @-@ Kinney , until now .

 In a very positive review , Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the depth of the group 's interplay , commenting that " Tucker explores what her voice can do when it 's not in overdrive , stretching vowels like a religious supplicant or spewing prosody like Patti Smith . At the same time , Brownstein blossoms as a singer herself [ ... ] braiding lines with Tucker so artfully the result sounds like the voicings of a single restless mind " . He considered The Hot Rock as Sleater @-@ Kinney 's " most finely turned record " and that its music " never falters " . Peter <unk> of Out magazine credited the work of the producer for polishing the band 's sound without losing its intensity or muscle .

Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine could not imagine why Brown would want to share the song with Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes , stating " One alone would 've been enough to point up just how little personality he exudes on his own tracks , but putting both on ' Look at Me Now ' ironically renders him invisible .

 SMS Falke ( " His Majesty 's Ship Falke — Falcon " ) was an unprotected cruiser of the Bussard class , built for the Imperial German Navy . She was the second member of the class of six vessels . The cruiser was laid down in 1890 , launched in April 1891 , and commissioned into the fleet in September of that month . Designed for overseas service , she carried a main battery of eight 10 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and had a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 knots ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) . 
 Falke served abroad for the majority of her career , seeing duty in East Asia , the Central Pacific , and the Americas . She assisted in the suppression of a revolt in Samoa in 1893 , and was damaged in a later uprising there in 1899 . In 1901 , Falke was transferred to the American Station , and the following year she took part in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902 – 03 , during which she helped enforce an Anglo @-@ German blockade of the Venezuelan coast . In 1907 , Falke was recalled to Germany . She was stricken from the naval register in late 1912 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Falke was 82 @.@ 6 meters ( 271 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 5 m ( 41 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 45 m ( 14 @.@ 6 ft ) forward . She displaced 1 @,@ 868 t ( 1 @,@ 838 long tons ; 2 @,@ 059 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by four coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . These provided a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 kn ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) and a range of approximately 2 @,@ 990 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 540 km ; 3 @,@ 440 mi ) at 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with eight 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing guns in single pedestal mounts , supplied with 800 rounds of ammunition in total . They had a range of 10 @,@ 800 m ( 35 @,@ 400 ft ) . Two guns were placed side by side forward , two on each broadside in sponsons , and two side by side aft . The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon . She was also equipped with two 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes , both of which were mounted on the deck . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Falke was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Kiel in January 1890 under the contract name " D " . She was launched on 4 April 1891 ; at the ceremony , Prince Heinrich gave a speech and his wife , Princess Irene , christened the ship . Falke was commissioned on 14 September of that year for sea trials . While steaming off Bornholm , the ship ran aground but was pulled free by other vessels . She was temporarily decommissioned in Kiel on 31 October . Falke was recommissioned on 14 August 1892 in order to participate in the annual fleet training maneuvers that began that month and continued into September . She was assigned to the III Division , along with the coastal defense ship Siegfried . 
 = = = Deployment to West Africa = = = 
 Falke was transferred to Germany 's West African colonies in western Africa after the conclusion of the maneuvers , departing Kiel on 16 October to replace the gunboat Habicht . After arriving in western Africa , Falke went to Dahomey , where the Second Franco @-@ Dahomean War had recently broken out . In December , her captain unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the release of two German merchants who were being held by Dahomean soldiers . On 31 December , Falke returned to Duala , the main German port in Kamerun , where she joined the second warship stationed in the colony , the gunboat Hyäne . 
 The borders of German South @-@ West Africa had been settled via treaties with Portugal ( 1886 ) and Britain ( 1890 ) , but the coast line had not been surveyed in detail . Falke was tasked with locating a suitable port to connect to the capital at <unk> . She departed Luanda on 23 January 1893 and arrived in Cape Cross four days later . The ship surveyed the area thoroughly , and discovered a Portuguese <unk> . It had been placed there by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in the late 15th century . Falke 's crew removed it to protect it from further weathering and placed a wooden cross to mark the location . The ship 's crew received a period of rest from 14 to 16 March , after which time Falke steamed back to Kamerun , stopping in several ports along the way and arriving in Duala on 29 April . There , the stone monument was unloaded and later transported back to Berlin for preservation by the steamer Stettin , which departed Duala on 29 October . A granite copy , carried by the cruiser Sperber , was installed in its place in 1895 . 
 In the meantime , Falke had been sent to Liberia on 27 May in response to unrest in the country . She arrived in Monrovia on 9 June , and temporarily took Joseph James Cheeseman , the President of Liberia , aboard to protect him from the rebels . Falke wa back in Duala by 22 July . She was sent to Cape Town in South Africa for an overhaul that began on 30 November , but a rebellion among the Khoikhoi in German South @-@ West Africa forced a postponement of the work ; by 5 December the ship was in the colony to join the effort to suppress the rebels . Her presence proved to be unnecessary , and so she was sent back to Cape Town later in the month . After she arrived , the Admiralstab ( Admiralty Staff ) transferred Falke to the colony in German New Guinea . Falke departed on 23 December , arriving in Melbourne via Sydney . 
 = = = Deployment to the Pacific = = = 
 Upon arriving in Melbourne on 8 February 1894 , Falke met her sister ship Bussard and the gunboat Möwe . The three ships then departed for Apia in the Caroline Islands , arriving on 16 April , where they conducted gunnery training . Falke remained in Samoa until early October when she returned to Sydney for repair work ; at the time , Sydney possessed the only shipyard with the facilities necessary for major repairs , which meant that the Germans were dependent on the Australian port to keep their warships operational . A lengthy overhaul took place in Sydney from March to July 1895 . From 29 July to 10 November , Falke was again in Samoa . During this period , the ship surveyed the port at <unk> , north of the main island of Upolu . In mid @-@ November , the governor of the Marshall Islands requested the presence of Falke , and in late December she left the Marshalls for Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland , arriving in <unk> Harbor in January 1896 . There she met Möwe ; Falke 's tour of Germany 's Pacific colonies ended that month . 
 Another overhaul in Sydney followed from 4 February to 4 April . On 15 April , Falke dropped anchor once again in Apia . At the end of August , the ship steamed to Auckland , New Zealand , where she met Bussard and Möwe . The threat of rebellion in the Marshalls forced Falke to make another trip there in early November . Her cruise through the colonies ended with a stop in Sydney on 18 February 1897 . She departed for another visit to Auckland on 23 April . She also stopped in Tonga before continuing on to Apia , arriving on 16 May . The following month , three Germans , including Curt von Hagen , the governor of the colony , were murdered in Kaiser @-@ Wilhelmsland . Falke was sent to <unk> ( south of modern Madang ) on 24 June to apprehend the murderers ; she transported a police <unk> from the capital at Herbertshöhe to Ali Island and contributed a landing party from her crew . On 10 November Falke returned to Apia , but two days later she departed for Sydney via Auckland for repairs . A new crew had also arrived in Sydney from Germany . On 24 April 1898 , she departed Sydney for a tour of the colonies . After the conclusion of the cruise , Falke returned to Sydney , where her new commander , Korvettenkapitän ( Corvette Captain ) Victor Schönfelder had arrived ; he formally took control of the ship on 1 September . 
 On 1 October , Falke left Sydney for Apia before making visits to the New Hebrides , Fiji , and Tonga on the 15th . Four weeks later , Bussard departed the central Pacific , bound for Germany ; Falke was now alone in the region , despite the rising international tensions concerning a succession crisis in Samoa . In March 1899 , Falke was in the harbor at Apia . Unrest on the island , instigated by Mata 'afa Iosefo , prompted the American cruiser USS Philadelphia and the British sloop HMS Royalist and torpedo cruiser HMS Porpoise to shell the rebel positions . Their gunfire was poorly aimed , however , and several shells hit Falke . Schönfelder kept his crew from escalating the situation to prevent a more serious diplomatic crisis from developing . Eventually , the Second Samoan Civil War was resolved by splitting the islands into German and American colonies , while Britain received concessions elsewhere . By June , the fighting was over and the situation had calmed . 
 Falke 's sister ship Cormoran arrived at that time to relieve her . Falke then began the journey back to Germany on 1 July , stopping in Sydney , Batavia , Colombo , Mahé , and Lisbon . She reached Hamburg on 14 October . Her crew conducted a landing exercise to demonstrate how they had practiced it during their tour abroad . Kaiser Wilhelm II greeted Schönfelder and congratulated him for his skillful and levelheaded handling of the crisis in Samoa . On 27 October , Falke steamed to Danzig , where she was decommissioned on 3 November . The Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig conducted a lengthy overhaul and modernization . 
 = = = Deployment to the Americas = = = 
 On 2 October 1901 , Falke was recommissioned for another tour abroad , this time to the Americas . She was sent to reinforce the protected cruiser Vineta due to unrest in the Caribbean and South America . Three days later , she departed Neufahrwasser and crossed the Atlantic , arriving in Castries on Saint Lucia on 14 November . Falke visited several ports in the area before joining the training ships Moltke and Stein and the light cruiser Gazelle . Falke was then ordered to steam up the Amazon River ; she entered the Amazon via the Pará River on 7 March 1902 and reached Manaus by 23 March . There , she met several HAPAG and NDL steamers . Falke continued upriver , her voyage hampered by a lack of accurate maps and insufficiently knowledgeable river pilots . She finally reached San Ignacio in Peru on 17 April . By this point , the river was 114 m ( 374 ft ) above sea level and only 400 nmi ( 740 km ; 460 mi ) from the Pacific coast ; Falke had travelled around 5 @,@ 200 nmi ( 9 @,@ 600 km ; 6 @,@ 000 mi ) up the river ; a shortage of coal prevented her from proceeding further . On 30 April , she arrived back at the mouth of the river . 
 On 8 May , Falke arrived in Port of Spain in Trinidad before being ordered to the coast of Venezuela to safeguard German interests during a period of unrest there . While en route , she stopped in Fort @-@ de @-@ France , Martinique to pick up a load of food and medical supplies for the people living around Mont Pelee , which had recently erupted . She then proceeded to Carúpano in Venezuela to protect German nationals from expected fighting . She was based out of the port of Charlotte Amalie in the Virgin Islands . During this period , she made stops in Carúpano , La Guaira , and Puerto Cabello , along with a visit to Willemstad in Curaçao . On 30 September , she was sent to Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , Haiti , to protect German nationals there during a revolution in the country . At times , landing parties had to be sent ashore to protect the German consulate in Gonaïves . 
 By this time , the situation in Venezuela had worsened , necessitating foreign warships to remain of the coast to protect foreign nationals in the country . In December , Falke ran aground while leaving Willemstad ; the training ship Stosch pulled her free only with great difficulty . The ship was nevertheless not damaged in the accident . On 16 December , the East American Cruiser Division was formally established by the German Navy , led by the flagship Vineta . Falke was thereafter occupied with operations during the Venezuela Crisis of 1902 – 1903 . The Germans operated in concert with the British Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina ; they sought to compel the Venezuelan government to make reparations for grievances related to internal conflicts in the over the previous decade . The crisis began when a British merchant ship was boarded and its crew arrested by Venezuelan forces on 13 December ; in response , British forces bombarded the forts at Puerto Cabello , and enlisted the German squadron to assist them in punishing the Venezuelans . Falke and Gazelle were tasked with blockading the Venezuelan coast , in cooperation with the British squadron . 
 On 28 February 1903 , Falke went to the <unk> , where she stayed from 8 to 13 March . From October 1903 to November 1905 , Paul Behncke served as the ship 's commander . In January 1904 , the ship visited New Orleans with the rest of the American Squadron , which at that time included Vineta , Gazelle , and the gunboat Panther . She stopped in Newport News in the United States from 26 May to 16 June 1904 . She then cruised south to visit several Brazilian ports , starting on 17 July . On 23 September , she stopped in Buenos Aires , and four weeks later , continued south around Cape Horn via the Strait of Magellan . She continued as far north as Peru by the end of 1904 and stopped in several Argentinian and Chilean ports along the way , including Valparaiso on 20 December . In the meantime , the East American Cruiser Division was disbanded . Starting on 6 January 1905 , Falke resumed her voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas , stopping in Peru , Colombia , and several Central American countries . On 15 June she reached San Francisco , where she stayed for three weeks . On 10 July she resumed her cruise northward and visited harbors in Canada and southern Alaska . 
 On the return voyage , she steamed up the Columbia River and toured the Gulf of California . She spent Christmas and New Year 's Day in Mazatlán in Mexico and also stopped in Callao . While cruising off the coast of Chile in August , she was damaged by a severe storm . Repairs were effected in Talcahuano ; while she was being repaired , an earthquake struck Valparaiso . Once she was ready for sea , Falke carried food and medical supplies to the city between 28 August and 2 September . The ship returned to Chile to be present during the inauguration ceremony for President Pedro Montt on 18 September . She then returned to Talcahuano to complete her repairs . On 4 September , she departed and steamed down to Punta Arenas , where she stayed from 2 to 15 December . Falke then crossed back to the Atlantic and steamed up to Montevideo in January 1907 ; there , she received the order to return to Germany . 
 Falke departed Montevideo and crossed the Atlantic to Dakar , proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon . There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony . She arrived in Danzig on 15 April , after five and a half years abroad . The ship was decommissioned on 20 January , and an evaluation determined that she was not worth overhauling . She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig . 
 = King Arthur = 
 King Arthur was a legendary British leader who , according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries AD . The details of Arthur 's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention , and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians . The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources , including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur 's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . 
 Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the so @-@ called Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th @-@ century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) . In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work , Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore , sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld , Annwn . How much of Geoffrey 's Historia ( completed in 1138 ) was adapted from such earlier sources , rather than invented by Geoffrey himself , is unknown . 
 Although the themes , events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text , and there is no one canonical version , Geoffrey 's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories . Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain , Ireland , Iceland , Norway and Gaul . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey 's Historia , including Arthur 's father Uther Pendragon , the wizard Merlin , Arthur 's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur 's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon . The 12th @-@ century French writer Chrétien de Troyes , who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story , began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature . In these French stories , the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters , such as various Knights of the Round Table . Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century . In the 21st century , the legend lives on , not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre , film , television , comics and other media . 
 = = Debated historicity = = 
 The historical basis for the King Arthur legend has long been debated by scholars . One school of thought , citing entries in the Historia Brittonum ( History of the Britons ) and Annales Cambriae ( Welsh Annals ) , sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure , a Romano @-@ British leader who fought against the invading Anglo @-@ Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century . The Historia Brittonum , a 9th @-@ century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius , contains the first datable mention of King Arthur , listing twelve battles that Arthur fought . These culminate in the Battle of Badon , where he is said to have single @-@ handedly killed 960 men . Recent studies , however , question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum . 
 The other text that seems to support the case for Arthur 's historical existence is the 10th @-@ century Annales Cambriae , which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon . The Annales date this battle to 516 – 518 , and also mention the Battle of Camlann , in which Arthur and <unk> ( Mordred ) were both killed , dated to 537 – 539 . These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historia 's account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon . Problems have been identified , however , with using this source to support the Historia Brittonum 's account . The latest research shows that the Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales . Additionally , the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early . They were more likely added at some point in the 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals . The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum . 
 This lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub @-@ Roman Britain . In the view of historian Thomas Charles @-@ Edwards , " at this stage of the enquiry , one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [ but ... ] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him " . These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend ; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical . The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub @-@ Roman Britain and Ireland , The Age of Arthur ( 1973 ) . Even so , he found little to say about a historical Arthur . 
 Partly in reaction to such theories , another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all . Morris 's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that " no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian 's time " . Gildas ' 6th @-@ century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae ( On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain ) , written within living memory of Badon , mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur . Arthur is not mentioned in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820 . He is absent from Bede 's early @-@ 8th @-@ century Ecclesiastical History of the English People , another major early source for post @-@ Roman history that mentions Badon . The historian David Dumville has written : " I think we can dispose of him [ Arthur ] quite briefly . He owes his place in our history books to a ' no smoke without fire ' school of thought ... The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur ; we must reject him from our histories and , above all , from the titles of our books . " 
 Some scholars argue that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore — or even a half @-@ forgotten Celtic deity — who became credited with real deeds in the distant past . They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish Hengist and Horsa , who may be totemic horse @-@ gods that later became <unk> . Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th @-@ century Anglo @-@ Saxon conquest of eastern Britain . It is not even certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts . Neither the Historia nor the Annales calls him " rex " : the former calls him instead " dux <unk> " ( leader of battles ) and " miles " ( soldier ) . 
 Historical documents for the post @-@ Roman period are scarce , so a definitive answer to the question of Arthur 's historical existence is unlikely . Sites and places have been identified as " Arthurian " since the 12th century , but archaeology can confidently reveal names only through inscriptions found in secure contexts . The so @-@ called " Arthur stone " , discovered in 1998 among the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in securely dated 6th @-@ century contexts , created a brief stir but proved irrelevant . Other inscriptional evidence for Arthur , including the Glastonbury cross , is tainted with the suggestion of forgery . Although several historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur , no convincing evidence for these identifications has emerged . 
 = = Name = = 
 The origin of the Welsh name " Arthur " remains a matter of debate . Some suggest it is derived from the Roman nomen gentile ( family name ) <unk> , of obscure and contested etymology ( but possibly of <unk> or Etruscan origin ) . Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur 's name only appears as Arthur , or <unk> , in early Latin Arthurian texts , never as Artōrius ( though it should be noted that Classical Latin Artōrius became <unk> in some Vulgar Latin dialects ) . However , this may not say anything about the origin of the name Arthur , as Artōrius would regularly become Art ( h ) ur when borrowed into Welsh . 
 Another possibility is that it is derived from a Brittonic patronym * Arto @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ( the root of which , * <unk> @-@ <unk> " bear @-@ king " is to be found in the Old Irish personal name Art @-@ ri ) via a Latinized form Artōrius . Less likely is the commonly proposed derivation from Welsh <unk> " bear " + ( g ) wr " man " ( earlier * Arto @-@ <unk> in Brittonic ) ; there are phonological difficulties with this theory — notably that a Brittonic compound name * Arto @-@ <unk> should produce Old Welsh * <unk> and Middle / Modern Welsh * <unk> and not Arthur ( in Welsh poetry the name is always spelled Arthur and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in <unk> – never words ending in <unk> – which confirms that the second element cannot be [ g ] wr " man " ) . 
 An alternative theory , which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars , derives the name Arthur from Arcturus , the brightest star in the constellation Boötes , near Ursa Major or the Great Bear . Classical Latin Arcturus would also have become Art ( h ) ur when borrowed into Welsh , and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the " guardian of the bear " ( which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek ) and the " leader " of the other stars in Boötes . 
 A similar first name is Old Irish Artúr , which is believed to be derived directly from an early Old Welsh or Cumbric Artur . The earliest historically attested bearer of the name is a son or grandson of Áedán mac Gabráin ( d . AD 609 ) . 
 = = Medieval literary traditions = = 
 The creator of the familiar literary persona of Arthur was Geoffrey of Monmouth , with his pseudo @-@ historical Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) , written in the 1130s . The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey 's Historia ( known as pre @-@ Galfridian texts , from the Latin form of Geoffrey , <unk> ) and those written afterwards , which could not avoid his influence ( Galfridian , or post @-@ Galfridian , texts ) . 
 = = = Pre @-@ Galfridian traditions = = = 
 The earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources . There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre @-@ Galfridian tradition as a whole , rather than in a single text or text / story @-@ type . A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material . The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster @-@ hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats . Some of these are human threats , such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum , but the majority are supernatural , including giant cat @-@ monsters , destructive divine boars , dragons , <unk> , giants , and witches . The second is that the pre @-@ Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore ( particularly topographic or onomastic folklore ) and localised magical wonder @-@ tales , the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape . The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn . On the one hand , he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners . On the other , his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods , and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin . 
 One of the most famous Welsh poetic references to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death @-@ songs known as Y Gododdin ( The Gododdin ) , attributed to 6th @-@ century poet Aneirin . One stanza praises the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies , but says that despite this , " he was no Arthur " – that is , his feats cannot compare to the valour of Arthur . Y Gododdin is known only from a 13th @-@ century manuscript , so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation , but John Koch 's view that the passage dates from a 7th @-@ century or earlier version is regarded as unproven ; 9th- or 10th @-@ century dates are often proposed for it . Several poems attributed to Taliesin , a poet said to have lived in the 6th century , also refer to Arthur , although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries . They include " <unk> <unk> " ( " The Chair of the Prince " ) , which refers to " Arthur the Blessed " ; " <unk> Annwn " ( " The Spoils of Annwn " ) , which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld ; and " <unk> <unk> pen [ dragon ] " ( " The Elegy of Uther Pen [ dragon ] " ) , which refers to Arthur 's valour and is suggestive of a father @-@ son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre @-@ dates Geoffrey of Monmouth . 
 Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen , " Pa gur yv y <unk> ? " ( " What man is the gatekeeper ? " ) . This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter , in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men , notably Cei ( Kay ) and Bedwyr ( Bedivere ) . The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen ( c . 1100 ) , included in the modern Mabinogion collection , has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur 's men , though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place . The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen , daughter of <unk> Chief @-@ Giant , by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks , including the hunt for the great semi @-@ divine boar Twrch Trwyth . The 9th @-@ century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale , with the boar there named Troy ( n ) t . Finally , Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads , a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall . The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions , but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre @-@ existing Welsh traditions . Even in these , however , Arthur 's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole , with " Arthur 's Court " sometimes substituted for " The Island of Britain " in the formula " Three XXX of the Island of Britain " . While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king , by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become <unk> yr Ynys hon , " Chief of the Lords of this Island " , the overlord of Wales , Cornwall and the North . 
 In addition to these pre @-@ Galfridian Welsh poems and tales , Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae . In particular , Arthur features in a number of well @-@ known vitae ( " Lives " ) of post @-@ Roman saints , none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources ( the earliest probably dates from the 11th century ) . According to the Life of Saint Gildas , written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan , Arthur is said to have killed Gildas ' brother <unk> and to have rescued his wife <unk> from Glastonbury . In the Life of Saint Cadoc , written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan , the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur 's soldiers , and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as <unk> for his men . Cadoc delivers them as demanded , but when Arthur takes possession of the animals , they turn into bundles of ferns . Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of <unk> , Padarn , and <unk> , probably written around the 12th century . A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the <unk> Sancti <unk> , which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century ( although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century ) . Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury 's De <unk> Regum Anglorum and Herman 's De <unk> Sanctae Mariae <unk> , which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return , a theme that is often revisited in post @-@ Galfridian folklore . 
 = = = Geoffrey of Monmouth = = = 
 The first narrative account of Arthur 's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth 's Latin work Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ) , completed c . 1138 . This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th @-@ century Welsh king Cadwallader . Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post @-@ Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae . He incorporates Arthur 's father , Uther Pendragon , his magician advisor Merlin , and the story of Arthur 's conception , in which Uther , disguised as his enemy <unk> by Merlin 's magic , sleeps with <unk> 's wife <unk> at Tintagel , and she conceives Arthur . On Uther 's death , the fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles , similar to those in the Historia Brittonum , culminating in the Battle of Bath . He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland , Iceland and the Orkney Islands . After twelve years of peace , Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more , taking control of Norway , Denmark and Gaul . Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered , and Arthur 's victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome 's . Arthur and his warriors , including <unk> ( Kay ) , <unk> ( Bedivere ) and <unk> ( Gawain ) , defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but , as he prepares to march on Rome , Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus ( Mordred ) — whom he had left in charge of Britain — has married his wife <unk> ( Guinevere ) and seized the throne . Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river <unk> in Cornwall , but he is mortally wounded . He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds , never to be seen again . 
 How much of this narrative was Geoffrey 's own invention is open to debate . Certainly , Geoffrey seems to have made use of the list of Arthur 's twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th @-@ century Historia Brittonum , along with the battle of Camlann from the Annales Cambriae and the idea that Arthur was still alive . Arthur 's personal status as the king of all Britain would also seem to be borrowed from pre @-@ Galfridian tradition , being found in Culhwch and Olwen , the Triads , and the saints ' lives . Finally , Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur 's possessions , close family , and companions from the pre @-@ Galfridian Welsh tradition , including <unk> ( Cei ) , <unk> ( Bedwyr ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Uther ( <unk> ) and perhaps also <unk> ( <unk> ) , the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales . However , while names , key events , and titles may have been borrowed , <unk> Roberts has argued that " the Arthurian section is Geoffrey 's literary creation and it owes nothing to prior narrative . " So , for instance , the Welsh <unk> is made the villainous Modredus by Geoffrey , but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century . There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge this notion that the Historia Regum Britanniae is primarily Geoffrey 's own work , with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh 's late @-@ 12th @-@ century comment that Geoffrey " made up " his narrative , perhaps through an " inordinate love of lying " . Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view , believing that Geoffrey 's narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th @-@ century British king named <unk> , this figure being the original Arthur , although historians and <unk> have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions . 
 Whatever his sources may have been , the immense popularity of Geoffrey 's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied . Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey 's Latin work are known to have survived , and this does not include translations into other languages . Thus , for example , around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh @-@ language versions of the Historia , the earliest of which were created in the 13th century ; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey 's Historia , advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th @-@ century Lewis Morris , has long since been discounted in academic circles . As a result of this popularity , Geoffrey 's Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend . While it was by no means the only creative force behind Arthurian romance , many of its elements were borrowed and developed ( e.g. , Merlin and the final fate of Arthur ) , and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers ' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted . 
 = = = Romance traditions = = = 
 The popularity of Geoffrey 's Historia and its other derivative works ( such as Wace 's Roman de Brut ) is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries , particularly in France . It was not , however , the only Arthurian influence on the developing " Matter of Britain " . There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey 's work became widely known ( see for example , the Modena <unk> ) , and " Celtic " names and stories not found in Geoffrey 's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances . From the perspective of Arthur , perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself : much of this 12th @-@ century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere , Percival , Galahad , Gawain , and Tristan and Iseult . Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre @-@ Galfridian material and Geoffrey 's Historia itself , in the romances he is rapidly sidelined . His character also alters significantly . In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior , who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns , whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi <unk> , the " do @-@ nothing king " , whose " inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society " . Arthur 's role in these works is frequently that of a wise , dignified , even @-@ tempered , somewhat bland , and occasionally feeble monarch . So , he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot 's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu , whilst in Chrétien de Troyes 's Yvain , the Knight of the Lion , he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap . Nonetheless , as Norris J. Lacy has observed , whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances , " his prestige is never — or almost never — compromised by his personal weaknesses ... his authority and glory remain intact . " 
 Arthur and his retinue appear in some of the Lais of Marie de France , but it was the work of another French poet , Chrétien de Troyes , that had the greatest influence with regard to the development of Arthur 's character and legend . Chrétien wrote five Arthurian romances between c . 1170 and 1190 . Erec and Enide and <unk> are tales of courtly love with Arthur 's court as their backdrop , demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur , while Yvain , the Knight of the Lion , features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure , with Arthur very much on the sidelines and weakened . However , the most significant for the development of the Arthurian legend are Lancelot , the Knight of the Cart , which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur 's queen ( Guinevere ) , extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold , and Perceval , the Story of the Grail , which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role . Chrétien was thus " instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend " , and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid . Perceval , although unfinished , was particularly popular : four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century , with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron , a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance . Similarly , Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend , although the Lancelot of the prose Lancelot ( c . 1225 ) and later texts was a combination of Chrétien 's character and that of Ulrich von <unk> 's <unk> . Chrétien 's work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature , with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic , active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition . Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances , which are closely similar to those of Chrétien , albeit with some significant differences : Owain , or the Lady of the Fountain is related to Chrétien 's Yvain ; Geraint and Enid , to Erec and Enide ; and <unk> son of <unk> , to Perceval . 
 Up to c . 1210 , continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry ; after this date the tales began to be told in prose . The most significant of these 13th @-@ century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle ( also known as the Lancelot @-@ Grail Cycle ) , a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century . These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail , the Estoire de Merlin , the Lancelot <unk> ( or Prose Lancelot , which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own ) , the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu , which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend . The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend , partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin . It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister and established the role of Camelot , first mentioned in passing in Chrétien 's Lancelot , as Arthur 's primary court . This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post @-@ Vulgate Cycle ( c . 1230 – 40 ) , of which the Suite du Merlin is a part , which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot 's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur , and to focus more on the Grail quest . As such , Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances ; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu . During this period , Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies , a group of three pagan , three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry . The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de <unk> 's Voeux du Paon in 1312 , and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art . 
 The development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of the " Arthur of romance " culminated in Le Morte d 'Arthur , Thomas Malory 's retelling of the entire legend in a single work in English in the late 15th century . Malory based his book — originally titled The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table — on the various previous romance versions , in particular the Vulgate Cycle , and appears to have aimed at creating a comprehensive and authoritative collection of Arthurian stories . Perhaps as a result of this , and the fact that Le Morte D 'Arthur was one of the earliest printed books in England , published by William Caxton in 1485 , most later Arthurian works are derivative of Malory 's .

 The end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur . Although Malory 's English version of the great French romances was popular , there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances – established since Geoffrey of Monmouth 's time – and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain . So , for example , the 16th @-@ century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post @-@ Roman empire , found throughout the post @-@ Galfridian medieval ' chronicle tradition ' , to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians . Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthrall audiences , with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory 's Le Morte d 'Arthur for nearly 200 years . King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned , but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as a vehicle for allegories of 17th- and 18th @-@ century politics . Thus Richard Blackmore 's epics Prince Arthur ( 1695 ) and King Arthur ( 1697 ) feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II . Similarly , the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb , which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding ; although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain , the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character . 
 John Dryden 's masque King Arthur is still performed , largely thanks to Henry Purcell 's music , though seldom unabridged . 
 = = = Tennyson and the revival = = = 
 In the early 19th century , medievalism , Romanticism , and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances . A new code of ethics for 19th @-@ century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals embodied in the " Arthur of romance " . This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816 , when Malory 's Le Morte d 'Arthur was reprinted for the first time since 1634 . Initially , the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets , inspiring , for example , William Wordsworth to write " The Egyptian Maid " ( 1835 ) , an allegory of the Holy Grail . Pre @-@ eminent among these was Alfred Lord Tennyson , whose first Arthurian poem " The Lady of Shalott " was published in 1832 . Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works , following in the medieval romance tradition . Tennyson 's Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with Idylls of the King , however , which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur 's life for the Victorian era . It was first published in 1859 and sold 10 @,@ 000 copies within the first week . In the Idylls , Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed , through human weakness , to establish a perfect kingdom on earth . Tennyson 's works prompted a large number of imitators , generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself , and brought Malory 's tales to a wider audience . Indeed , the first modernisation of Malory 's great compilation of Arthur 's tales was published in 1862 , shortly after Idylls appeared , and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended . 
 This interest in the ' Arthur of romance ' and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th , and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre @-@ Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne @-@ Jones . Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb , which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur 's legend in the 18th century , was rewritten after the publication of Idylls . While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief , his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions . The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States , with such books as Sidney Lanier 's The Boy 's King Arthur ( 1880 ) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain 's satiric A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ( 1889 ) . Although the ' Arthur of romance ' was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works ( as he was in Burne @-@ Jones 's " The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon " , 1881 @-@ 1898 ) , on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalized or even missing entirely , with Wagner 's Arthurian operas providing a notable instance of the latter . Furthermore , the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated . By the end of the 19th century , it was confined mainly to Pre @-@ Raphaelite imitators , and it could not avoid being affected by the First World War , which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model . The romance tradition did , however , remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy , Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays , and T. S. Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth ( but not Arthur ) in his poem The Waste Land , which mentions the Fisher King . 
 = = = Modern legend = = = 
 In the latter half of the 20th century , the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued , through novels such as T. H. White 's The Once and Future King ( 1958 ) and Marion Zimmer Bradley 's The Mists of Avalon ( 1982 ) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant ( from 1937 onward ) . Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day , and the same is often the case with modern treatments too . Bradley 's tale , for example , takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend , in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials , and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy . The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well . T. H. White 's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot ( 1960 ) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone ( 1963 ) ; Camelot , with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur , was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967 . The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and , according to critics , successfully handled in Robert Bresson 's Lancelot du Lac ( 1974 ) , Eric Rohmer 's Perceval le Gallois ( 1978 ) and perhaps John Boorman 's fantasy film Excalibur ( 1981 ) ; it is also the main source of the material utilised in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail ( 1975 ) . 
 Re @-@ tellings and re @-@ imaginings of the romance tradition are not the only important aspect of the modern legend of King Arthur . Attempts to portray Arthur as a genuine historical figure of c . 500 , stripping away the " romance " , have also emerged . As Taylor and Brewer have noted , this return to the medieval " chronicle tradition " ' of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Historia Brittonum is a recent trend which became dominant in Arthurian literature in the years following the outbreak of the Second World War , when Arthur 's legendary resistance to Germanic invaders struck a chord in Britain . Clemence Dane 's series of radio plays , The <unk> ( 1942 ) , used a historical Arthur to embody the spirit of heroic resistance against desperate odds , and Robert Sherriff 's play The Long Sunset ( 1955 ) saw Arthur rallying Romano @-@ British resistance against the Germanic invaders . This trend towards placing Arthur in a historical setting is also apparent in historical and fantasy novels published during this period . In recent years the portrayal of Arthur as a real hero of the 5th century has also made its way into film versions of the Arthurian legend , most notably the TV series Arthur of the Britons ( 1972 – 73 ) , The Legend of King Arthur ( 1979 ) , and Camelot ( 2011 ) and the feature films King Arthur ( 2004 ) and The Last Legion ( 2007 ) . 
 Arthur has also been used as a model for modern @-@ day behaviour . In the 1930s , the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry . In the United States , hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups , such as the Knights of King Arthur , in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars . However , Arthur 's diffusion within contemporary culture goes beyond such obviously Arthurian endeavours , with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects , buildings , and places . As Norris J. Lacy has observed , " The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited , not surprisingly , to a few motifs and names , but there can be no doubt of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago is profoundly embedded in modern culture at every level .

 = Unicorn ( ship ) = 
 The Unicorn ( French : La Licorne ) is a fictional 17th @-@ century three @-@ masted armed Royal Navy vessel appearing in The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The ship plays a leading role in both The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham 's Treasure , published in 1943 and 1944 , respectively . The Unicorn also appears in the 2011 film adaptation The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn . 
 In the Tintin adventures , the Unicorn is the setting of a battle between pirates and sailors followed by a duel between Sir Francis Haddock ( an ancestor of Captain Haddock ) and the pirate Red Rackham . The Unicorn is scuttled and sinks , only to be discovered years later by Tintin and his friends in an attempt to locate Red Rackham 's treasure . 
 = = Creation = = 
 The Unicorn was inspired by Le Brillant , built in 1690 at Le Havre , France by the shipwright <unk> and then decorated by the designer Jean <unk> the Elder . In 1942 , Hergé had decided that his latest Tintin adventure , The Secret of the Unicorn ( 1943 ) , should depict images of his fictional Unicorn as detailed precision drawings . He used the services of his friend and local model ship maker Gérard Liger @-@ Belair , son of a former naval officer and who owned a shop in Brussels that specialised in model ships , to find an appropriate historical vessel that he could customize to meet his historical needs . Liger @-@ Belair 's research produced three possibilities : A British frigate , a Dutch merchant vessel , and a French battleship . As Hergé preferred the battleship , Liger @-@ Belair continued to research and discovered a historic document titled Architectura <unk> , which contained detailed drawings of French battleships . One in particular was from 1690 , in the navy of Louis XIV of France : a fourth rank battleship with 56 cannons : Le Brillant . Liger @-@ Belair soon completed a plan on a 1 : 100 scale followed by an extremely precise model . 
 Hergé consulted the archives at the National Museum of Natural History and the then recently published L 'Art et le Mer ( " Art and the Sea " ) by Alexandre <unk> . He also studied other vessels from the period , such as the Le Soleil Royal , La Couronne , La Royale and Le Reale de France to better understand 17th @-@ century ship design . It was from the Le Reale de France that he gained a basis for his design of the Unicorn 's jolly boat . He adopted the fictional ship 's unicorn figurehead from a British frigate which had been built in 1745 . When Liger @-@ Belair 's model was complete , Hergé realised it into the panels of his comics , regularly showing his renditions to Liger @-@ Belair to ensure he was depicting the vessel with no technical errors . In its finished appearance in the book , the Unicorn is a ship of the third rank , a vessel with three @-@ masts and 50 guns , more than 40 metres long and 11 metres wide . 
 After publication of The Secret of the Unicorn , Hergé 's Dutch publisher Carlsen Verlag gave him an antique model of a 17th @-@ century Danish ship called the <unk> ( Unicorn ) . Until that moment , Hergé had no idea that a ship with that name , complete with unicorn figurehead , had ever actually existed .

 The Secret of the Unicorn is partially set in 1676 . In the English translation , the Unicorn sails under the Union Jack during the reign of Charles II of England and is commanded by Sir Francis Haddock , an ancestor of Captain Haddock . In Hergé 's original French version , however , la Licorne flies the French flag for the French Navy under King Louis XIV and is commanded by Chevalier François de <unk> . No ship named the Unicorn was listed in the annals of either the Royal Navy or the French Navy . 
 Red Rackham 's Treasure ( 1944 ) tells of the adventure Tintin and his friends undertake to recover the lost treasure of the pirate Red Rackham , believed by Tintin to be aboard the shipwrecked Unicorn . Sir Francis had built three models of the Unicorn and had hidden a treasure map inside each one . The adventure , told across both books , leads Tintin to the Unicorn and to the lost treasure . 
 A 2011 feature film adaptation of both Tintin books retells the story of the Unicorn . The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson was released October – December 2011 . 
 = = = Plot role = = = 
 While sailing in the West Indies in 1676 , the Unicorn , commanded by Sir Francis Haddock , is seized and captured by a group of pirates led by Red Rackham . The pirates hoist a red pennant — no life would be spared . During the battle , Sir Francis is hit and loses consciousness . Later , the members of the Unicorn crew still alive are killed or thrown overboard . Sir Francis regains consciousness , finding himself tied to the mainmast . The pirate ship is damaged and sinking , so Red Rackham moves his treasure on board the Unicorn . The ship then sails to an uninhabited island . When anchored near the shore of the island , Sir Francis manages to free himself and goes below deck to the Unicorn 's gunpowder stores . Whilst there , he encounters Rackham for the final time , killing him in a sword fight . Before escaping in the ship 's jolly boat , he is able to set fire to the gunpowder by means of a slow @-@ burning fuse , causing the Unicorn ( with Rackham 's drunken crew and presumably Red Rackham 's treasure still aboard ) to explode and sink . 
 In the present day , Tintin , his dog Snowy , and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow coordinates that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn . Reaching the coordinates , they discover the island and , upon diving , they find the wreck of the Unicorn . Although they recover various artefacts from it , they do not find the treasure . Back in Belgium , Tintin realises that Sir Francis ' message referred , not to the location of the Unicorn , but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis ' former country home . Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home , Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe , presses a secret button he finds there , and discovers Red Rackham 's treasure hidden inside . 
 = Typhoon Dot ( 1989 ) = 
 Typhoon Dot , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Kuring , was one of several tropical cyclones to impact southern China and northern Vietnam during the 1989 Pacific typhoon season . Originating from a tropical disturbance near Palau on June 4 , Dot tracked west @-@ northwestward towards the Philippines . Crossing the country on June 6 , the system moved over the South China Sea and attained typhoon status . Late on June 8 , Dot reached its peak intensity with winds estimated at 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The system weakened slightly the next day before making landfall in Hainan Island . A weakened storm then entered the Gulf of Tonkin before striking northern Vietnam and dissipating on June 12 . 
 Throughout its course , Typhoon Dot produced heavy rains in the Philippines , China and Vietnam , resulting in significant damage and eight fatalities . The most severe impacts took place on Hainan Island where 1 @,@ 400 homes were destroyed and another 60 @,@ 000 were damaged . In Vietnam , Dot exacerbated flooding triggered in late May by Tropical Storm Cecil . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In early June 1989 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring a tropical disturbance that developed over the southern Philippine Sea . Over the following two days , convection associated with this system increased and became better organized . This development prompted the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on June 4 as the system moved just north of Palau . By this time , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression . Early on June 5 , the JTWC followed suit and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 05W , at which time the system was situated roughly 555 km ( 345 mi ) southwest of the island of Samar in the Philippines . Due to the cyclone 's proximity to the Philippines , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm , assigning it with the local name Kuring . Tracking generally towards the west @-@ northwest , the depression intensified into a Tropical Storm and was given the name Dot , 12 hours before making landfall in Samar on June 6 . 
 Crossing over the central Philippines and the Sibuyan Sea , Tropical Storm Dot grew in size and intensity . By June 7 , the storm entered the South China Sea and acquired a brief northerly component to its track . At the time , forecasters at the JTWC anticipated that Dot would interact with an approaching weather front and track north of Hainan Island . The front failed to materialize , however , and the storm resumed a west @-@ northwesterly track . Owing to low wind shear and warm waters , Dot attained typhoon status on June 8 . Following the development of an eye , the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category 3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale , with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . By the morning of June 9 , the JMA assessed Dot to have attained ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 955 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 2 inHg ) . 
 Gradual weakening occurred as Dot neared Hainan Island on June 9 . The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June 10 and weakened to a tropical storm . Later that day , the storm emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making its third and final landfall near Hai Phong , Vietnam . Once onshore , Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous terrain of northern Vietnam , and was last noted on June 12 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Tropical Storm Dot produced widespread rainfall in the Philippines , leading to several landslides . In Toledo City , the Carmen copper Concentrator had to temporarily shut down after a landslide disrupted the facility 's water supply . As a result , the Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation lost approximately 272 @,@ 000 kg ( 600 @,@ 000 lb ) of copper . 
 Across Hainan Island , the storm produced heavy rains and damaging winds that left eight cities without power or telephone service . Throughout Hainan , about 1 @,@ 400 homes were destroyed and 60 @,@ 000 more were damaged . Press reports indicated that two people died as a result of Typhoon Dot while another was listed as missing . Overall , damage in Hainan reached 170 million Renminbi ( $ 45 @.@ 1 million USD ) . Three rescue teams were deployed to the region to assist in recovery efforts . In nearby Guangxi Province , heavy rains caused additional flooding that destroyed 300 homes and injured eight people . However , these rains also helped alleviate drought conditions in the region . At Tai Mo Shan in Hong Kong , sustained winds from Dot reached 79 km / h ( 49 mph ) and gusts peaked at 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) . More than 55 @,@ 000 hectares ( 136 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops were flooded , the majority of which were rice fields . 
 Roughly two weeks after Tropical Storm Cecil devastated parts of Vietnam , Dot caused further flooding along the Red River Delta . Portions of Hanoi were inundated with up to 1 m ( 3 ft ) . Winds up to 116 km / h ( 72 mph ) reportedly affected coastal areas near where the typhoon moved ashore . Nearly 162 @,@ 000 hectares ( 400 @,@ 000 acres ) of rice fields were submerged by the storm . At least six fatalities were attributed to the storm in Vietnam , and many more were injured . 
 = Eugene V. Debs = 
 Eugene Victor " Gene " Debs ( November 5 , 1855 – October 20 , 1926 ) was an American union leader , one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW or the Wobblies ) , and five times the candidate of the Socialist Party of America for President of the United States . Through his presidential candidacies , as well as his work with labor movements , Debs eventually became one of the best @-@ known socialists living in the United States . 
 Early in his political career , Debs was a member of the Democratic Party . He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884 . After working with several smaller unions , including the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen , Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union ( ARU ) , one of the nation 's first industrial unions . After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894 , Debs signed many into the ARU . He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars , in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike , affecting most lines west of Detroit , and more than 250 @,@ 000 workers in 27 states . To keep the mail running , President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike . As a leader of the ARU , Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison . 
 In jail , Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the international socialist movement . Debs was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America ( 1897 ) , the Social Democratic Party of America ( 1898 ) , and the Socialist Party of America ( 1901 ) . 
 Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for President of the United States five times , including 1900 ( earning 0 @.@ 63 % of the popular vote ) , 1904 ( 2 @.@ 98 % ) , 1908 ( 2 @.@ 83 % ) , 1912 ( 5 @.@ 99 % ) , and 1920 ( 3 @.@ 41 % ) , the last time from a prison cell . He was also a candidate for United States Congress from his native Indiana in 1916 . 
 Debs was noted for his oratory , and his speech denouncing American participation in World War I led to his second arrest in 1918 . He was convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 and sentenced to a term of 10 years . President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence in December 1921 . Debs died in 1926 , not long after being admitted to a sanatorium due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison . He has since been cited as the inspiration for numerous politicians .

 Eugene Debs was born on November 5 , 1855 , in Terre Haute , Indiana , to Jean Daniel and Marguerite Mari ( <unk> ) Debs , who immigrated to the United States from Colmar , Alsace , France . His father , who came from a prosperous family , owned a textile mill and meat market . Debs was named after the French authors Eugene Sue and Victor Hugo . 
 Debs attended public school , dropping out of high school at age 14 . He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad ( 1905 – 17 ) cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day . He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops . In December 1871 , when a drunken locomotive fireman failed to report for work , Debs was pressed into service as a night fireman . He decided to remain a fireman on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis , earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years . 
 In July 1875 Debs left to work at a wholesale grocery house , where he remained for four years , while attending a local business school at night . 
 Debs had joined the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen ( BLF ) in February 1875 and became active in the organization . In 1877 he served as a delegate of the Terre Haute lodge to the organization 's national convention . Debs was elected associate editor of the BLF 's monthly organ , Firemen 's Magazine , in 1878 . Two years later , he was appointed Grand Secretary and Treasurer of the BLF and editor of the magazine in July 1880 . He worked as a BLF functionary until January 1893 and as the magazine 's editor until September 1894 . 
 At the same time he became a prominent figure in the community . He served two terms as Terre Haute 's city clerk from September 1879 to September 1883 . In the fall of 1884 he was elected to the Indiana General Assembly as a Democrat , serving for one term .

 = = Labor activism = = 
 The railroad brotherhoods were comparatively conservative organizations , focused on providing fellowship and services rather than on collective bargaining . Debs gradually became convinced of the need for a more unified and confrontational approach as railroads were powerful companies in the economy . One influence was his involvement in the Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888 , a defeat for labor that convinced Debs of the necessity of organizing along craft lines . 
 After stepping down as Brotherhood Grand Secretary in 1893 , Debs organized one of the first industrial unions in the United States , the American Railway Union ( ARU ) , for unskilled workers . The Union successfully struck the Great Northern Railway in April 1894 , winning most of its demands . 
 = = = Pullman Strike = = = 
 In 1894 Debs became involved in the Pullman Strike , which grew out of a compensation dispute started by the workers who constructed the train cars made by the Pullman Palace Car Company . The Pullman Company , citing falling revenue after the economic Panic of 1893 , had cut the wages of its employees by 28 % . The workers , many of whom were already members of the American Railway Union , appealed for support to the union at its convention in Chicago , Illinois . Debs tried to persuade the Union members who worked on the railways that the boycott was too risky , given the hostility of both the railways and the federal government , the weakness of the union , and the possibility that other unions would break the strike . The membership ignored his warnings and refused to handle Pullman cars or any other railroad cars attached to them , including cars containing U.S. Mail . After <unk> Board Director Martin J. Elliott extended the strike to St. Louis , doubling its size to 80 @,@ 000 workers , Debs relented and decided to take part in the strike , which was now endorsed by almost all members of the ARU in the immediate area of Chicago . On July 9 , 1894 , a New York Times editorial called Debs " a lawbreaker at large , an enemy of the human race . " Strikers fought by establishing boycotts of Pullman train cars , and with Debs ' eventual leadership , the strike came to be known as " Debs ' Rebellion " . 
 The U.S. federal government intervened , obtaining an injunction against the strike on the theory that the strikers had obstructed the U.S. Mail , carried on Pullman cars , by refusing to show up for work . President Grover Cleveland , who Debs had supported in all three of his presidential campaigns , sent the United States Army to enforce the injunction . The entrance of the Army was enough to break the strike . Overall , 30 strikers were killed in the strike , 13 of them in Chicago , and thousands were blacklisted . An estimated $ 80 million worth of property was damaged , and Debs was found guilty of contempt of court for violating the injunction and sent to federal prison . 
 Debs was represented by Clarence Darrow , later a leading American lawyer and civil libertarian , who had previously been a corporate lawyer for the railroad company . While it is commonly thought that Darrow " switched sides " to represent Debs , a myth repeated by Irving Stone 's biography , Clarence Darrow For the Defense , he had in fact resigned from the railroad earlier , after the death of his mentor , William Goudy . A Supreme Court case decision , In re Debs , later upheld the right of the federal government to issue the injunction . 
 = = Socialist leader = = 
 At the time of his arrest for mail obstruction , Debs was not yet a socialist . While serving his six @-@ month term in the jail at Woodstock , Illinois , Debs and his ARU comrades received a steady stream of letters , books , and pamphlets in the mail from socialists around the country . 
 Debs recalled several years later : 
 " ... I began to read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen , however organized , could be shattered and battered and splintered at a single stroke . The writings of Bellamy and Blatchford early appealed to me . The Cooperative Commonwealth of <unk> also impressed me , but the writings of Kautsky were so clear and conclusive that I readily grasped , not merely his argument , but also caught the spirit of his socialist utterance – and I thank him and all who helped me out of darkness into light . " 
 Additionally , Debs was visited in jail by Milwaukee socialist newspaper editor Victor L. Berger , who , in Debs ' words , " came to Woodstock , as if a providential instrument , and delivered the first impassioned message of Socialism I had ever heard . " In his 1926 obituary in Time , it was said that Berger left him a copy of Das Kapital and " prisoner Debs read it slowly , eagerly , ravenously . " Debs emerged from jail at the end of his sentence a changed man . He would spend the final three decades of his life proselytizing for the socialist cause . 
 After Debs and Martin Elliott were released from prison in 1895 , Debs started his Socialist political career . Debs persuaded the American Railway Union membership to join with the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth to found the Social Democracy of America . Debs , along with Elliott , were the first federal office candidates for the fledgling Socialist party , running ( unsuccessfully ) for US president and Congress in 1900 . Along with his running mate Job Harriman , Debs received 87 @,@ 945 votes – 0 @.@ 6 % of the popular vote – and no electoral votes . 
 Debs ' wife , Kate , was opposed to Debs ' socialism . The " tempestuous relationship with a wife who rejects the very values he holds most dear " was the basis of Irving Stone 's biographical novel Adversary in the House .

 One year later this group split and Debs went with the majority faction to found the Social Democratic Party of the United States , also called the Social Democratic Party . Debs was elected chairman of the Executive Board of the National Council , the board which governed the party . But though the party did not have a sole figure that governed its actions , Debs ' position as chairman and his notoriety gave him the status of party figurehead . He was the Socialist Party of America candidate for president in 1904 , 1908 , 1912 , and 1920 ( the final time from prison ) . 
 In his showing in the 1904 election , Debs received 402 @,@ 810 votes , which was 2 @.@ 98 % of the popular vote . Debs received no electoral votes , and , with vice presidential candidate Benjamin Hanford , ultimately finished third overall . In the 1908 election , Debs again ran on the same ticket as Benjamin Hanford . While receiving a slightly higher number of votes in the popular vote , 420 @,@ 852 , he received 2 @.@ 83 % of the popular vote . Again Debs received no electoral votes . Debs received 5 @.@ 99 % of the popular vote ( a total of 901 @,@ 551 votes ) in 1912 , while his total of 913 @,@ 693 votes in the 1920 campaign remains the all @-@ time high for a Socialist Party candidate . Running alongside Emil Seidel , Debs again received no electoral votes . 
 Although he received some success as a third @-@ party candidate , Debs was largely dismissive of the electoral process ; he distrusted the political bargains that Victor Berger and other " Sewer Socialists " had made in winning local offices . He put much more value on organizing workers into unions , favoring unions that brought together all workers in a given industry over those organized by the craft skills workers practiced . 
 = = = Founding the IWW = = = 
 After his work with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the American Railway Union , Debs ' next major work in organizing a labor union came during the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World ( IWW ) . On June 27 , 1905 , in Chicago , Illinois , Debs and other influential union leaders including Big Bill Haywood , leader of the Western Federation of Miners , and Daniel De León , leader of the Socialist Labor Party , held what Haywood called the " Continental Congress of the working class " . Haywood stated : " We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class ... " , and for Debs : " We are here to perform a task so great that it appeals to our best thought , our united energies , and will enlist our most loyal support ; a task in the presence of which weak men might falter and despair , but from which it is impossible to shrink without betraying the working class . " 
 = = = Socialists split with the IWW = = = 
 Although the IWW was built on the basis of uniting workers of industry , a rift began between the union and the Socialist Party . It started when the electoral wing of the Socialist Party , led by Victor Berger and Morris Hillquit , became irritated with speeches by Haywood . In December 1911 , Haywood told a Lower East Side audience at New York 's Cooper Union that parliamentary Socialists were " step @-@ at @-@ a @-@ time people whose every step is just a little shorter than the preceding step . " It was better , Haywood said , to " elect the superintendent of some branch of industry , than to elect some congressman to the United States Congress . " In response , Hillquit attacked the IWW as " purely anarchistic ... " 
 The Cooper Union speech was the beginning of a split between Bill Haywood and the Socialist Party , leading to the split between the factions of the IWW , one faction loyal to the Socialist Party , and the other to Haywood . The rift presented a problem for Debs , who was influential in both the IWW and the Socialist Party . The final straw between Haywood and the Socialist Party came during the Lawrence Textile Strike when , disgusted with the decision of the elected officials in Lawrence , Massachusetts , to send police who subsequently used their clubs on children , Haywood publicly declared that " I will not vote again " until such a circumstance was rectified . Haywood was purged from the National Executive Committee by passage of an amendment that focused on the direct action and sabotage tactics advocated by the IWW . Debs was probably the only person who could have saved Haywood 's seat . 
 In 1906 , when Haywood had been on trial for his life in Idaho , Debs had described him as " the Lincoln of Labor " and called for Haywood to run against Theodore Roosevelt for President of the United States , but times had changed and Debs , facing a split in the Party , chose to echo Hillquit 's words , accusing the IWW of representing anarchy . Debs thereafter stated that he had opposed the amendment , but that once it was adopted it should be obeyed . Debs remained friendly to Haywood and the IWW after the expulsion , despite their perceived differences over IWW tactics . 
 Prior to Haywood 's dismissal , the Socialist Party membership had reached an all @-@ time high of 135 @,@ 000 . One year later , four months after Haywood was recalled , the membership dropped to 80 @,@ 000 . The reformists in the Socialist Party attributed the decline to the departure of the " Haywood element " , and predicted that the party would recover . It did not ; in the election of 1912 many of the Socialists who had been elected to public office lost their seats . 
 = = = Leadership style = = = 
 Debs was noted by many to be a charismatic speaker who sometimes called on the vocabulary of Christianity and much of the oratorical style of evangelism – even though he was generally disdainful of organized religion . It has been said , that Debs was what every socialist and radical should be ; fierce in his convictions , but kind and compassionate in his personal relations . As Heywood Broun noted in his eulogy for Debs , quoting a fellow Socialist : " That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man . And that 's not the funniest part of it . As long as he 's around I believe it myself . " 
 Although sometimes called " King Debs " , Debs himself was not wholly comfortable with his standing as a leader . As he told an audience in Detroit in 1906 : 
 I am not a Labor Leader ; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else ; if you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness , you will stay right where you are . I would not lead you into the promised land if I could , because if I led you in , some one else would lead you out . You must use your heads as well as your hands , and get yourself out of your present condition . 
 = = = Political prisoner = = = 
 Debs ' speeches against the Wilson administration and the war earned the enmity of President Woodrow Wilson , who later called Debs a " traitor to his country . " On June 16 , 1918 , Debs made a speech in Canton , Ohio , urging resistance to the military draft of World War I. He was arrested on June 30 and charged with ten counts of sedition . 
 His trial defense called no witnesses , asking that Debs be allowed to address the court in his defense . That unusual request was granted , and Debs spoke for two hours . He was found guilty on September 12 . At his sentencing hearing on September 14 , he again addressed the court , and his speech has become a classic . Heywood Broun , a liberal journalist and not a Debs partisan , said it was " one of the most beautiful and moving passages in the English language . He was for that one afternoon touched with inspiration . If anyone told me that tongues of fire danced upon his shoulders as he spoke , I would believe it . " 
 Debs said in part : 
 Your honor , I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the form of our present government ; that I am opposed to the social system in which we live ; that I believe in the change of both but by perfectly peaceable and orderly means .... 
 I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and factories ; I am thinking of the women who , for a paltry wage , are compelled to work out their lives ; of the little children who , in this system , are robbed of their childhood , and in their early , tender years , are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon , and forced into the industrial dungeons , there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul .... 
 Your honor , I ask no mercy , I plead for no immunity . I realize that finally the right must prevail . I never more fully comprehended than now the great struggle between the powers of greed on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of freedom . I can see the dawn of a better day of humanity . The people are awakening . In due course of time they will come into their own . 
 When the mariner , sailing over tropic seas , looks for relief from his weary watch , he turns his eyes toward the Southern Cross , burning luridly above the tempest @-@ vexed ocean . As the midnight approaches the Southern Cross begins to bend , and the whirling worlds change their places , and with starry finger @-@ points the Almighty marks the passage of Time upon the dial of the universe ; and though no bell may beat the glad tidings , the look @-@ out knows that the midnight is passing – that relief and rest are close at hand . 
 Let the people take heart and hope everywhere , for the cross is bending , midnight is passing , and joy cometh with the morning . 
 Debs was sentenced on November 18 , 1918 , to ten years in prison . He was also disenfranchised for life . Debs presented what has been called his best @-@ remembered statement at his sentencing hearing : 
 Your Honor , years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings , and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth . I said then , and I say now , that while there is a lower class , I am in it , and while there is a criminal element , I am of it , and while there is a soul in prison , I am not free . 
 Debs appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court . In its ruling on Debs v. United States , the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism . While Debs had carefully worded his speeches in an attempt to comply with the Espionage Act , the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment . Among other things , the Court cited Debs ' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs ' case was essentially the same as that of Schenck v. United States , in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction . 
 Debs went to prison on April 13 , 1919 . In protest of his jailing , Charles <unk> led a parade of unionists , socialists , anarchists and communists to march on May 1 ( May Day ) 1919 , in Cleveland , Ohio . The event quickly broke into the violent May Day Riots of 1919 . 
 Debs ran for president in the 1920 election while in prison in Atlanta , Georgia , at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary . He received 919 @,@ 799 votes ( 3 @.@ 4 % ) , slightly less than he had won in 1912 , when he received 6 % , the highest number of votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. During his time in prison , Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system . They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book , Walls and Bars , with several added chapters . It was published posthumously . 
 In March 1919 , President Wilson asked Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer for his opinion on clemency , offering his own : " I doubt the wisdom and public effect of such an action . " Palmer generally favored releasing people convicted under the wartime security acts , but when he consulted with Debs ' prosecutors – even those with records as defenders of civil liberties – they assured him that Debs ' conviction was correct and his sentence appropriate . The President and his Attorney General both believed that public opinion opposed clemency and that releasing Debs could strengthen Wilson 's opponents in the debate over the ratification of the peace treaty . Palmer proposed clemency in August and October 1920 without success . 
 At one point , Wilson wrote : 
 " While the flower of American youth was pouring out its blood to vindicate the cause of civilization , this man , Debs , stood behind the lines sniping , attacking , and denouncing them .... This man was a traitor to his country and he will never be pardoned during my administration . " 
 In January 1921 , Palmer , citing Debs ' deteriorating health , proposed to Wilson that Debs receive a presidential pardon freeing him on February 12 , Lincoln 's birthday . Wilson returned the paperwork after writing " Denied " across it . 
 On December 23 , 1921 , President Harding commuted Debs ' sentence to time served , effective Christmas Day . He did not issue a pardon . A White House statement summarized the administration 's view of Debs ' case : 
 " There is no question of his guilt .... He was by no means as rabid and outspoken in his expressions as many others , and but for his prominence and the resulting far @-@ reaching effect of his words , very probably might not have received the sentence he did . He is an old man , not strong physically . He is a man of much personal charm and impressive personality , which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent . "

 When Debs was released from the Atlanta Penitentiary , the other prisoners sent him off with " a roar of cheers " and a crowd of 50 @,@ 000 greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music . En route home , Debs was warmly received at the White House by Harding , who greeted him by saying : " Well , I 've heard so damned much about you , Mr. Debs , that I am now glad to meet you personally . " 
 In 1924 , Debs was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the Finnish Socialist Karl H. <unk> on the grounds that " Debs started to work actively for peace during World War I , mainly because he considered the war to be in the interest of capitalism . " 
 He spent his remaining years trying to recover his health which was severely undermined by prison confinement . In late 1926 , he was admitted to <unk> Sanitarium in Elmhurst , Illinois . He died there of heart failure on October 20 , 1926 , at the age of 70 . His body was cremated and buried in Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute , Indiana .

 Eugene Debs helped motivate the American Left as a measure of political opposition to corporations and World War I. American socialists , communists , and anarchists honor his compassion for the labor movement and motivation to have the average working man build socialism without large state involvement . Several books have been written about his life as an inspirational American socialist . 
 On May 22 , 1962 , Debs ' home was purchased by the Eugene V. Debs Foundation for $ 9 @,@ 500 , which worked to preserve it as a Debs memorial was begun . In 1965 it was designated as an official historic site of the state of Indiana , and in 1966 it was designated as a National Historic Landmark of the United States . The preservation of the museum is monitored by the National Park Service . In 1990 , the U.S. Department of Labor named Debs a member of its Labor Hall of Fame . 
 While Debs did not leave a collection of papers to a university library , the pamphlet collection which he and his brother amassed is held by Indiana State University in Terre Haute . The scholar Bernard <unk> , author of a 1978 biography of Debs , has donated his biographical research materials to the Newberry Library in Chicago , where they are open to researchers . The original manuscript of Debs ' book Walls and Bars , with handwritten amendments , presumably by Debs , is held in the Thomas J. Morgan Papers in the Special Collections department of the University of Chicago Library . 
 The town of Debs , Minnesota , is named after Debs .

 John Dos Passos included Eugene Debs as a historical figure in his U.S.A. Trilogy . Debs is featured among other figures in the 42nd Parallel ( 1930 ) . His affiliation with the IWW prompted actions by such fictional characters in the novel as " Mac " .

 = Legal system of Saudi Arabia = 
 The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia , Islamic law derived from the Qu 'ran and the Sunnah ( the traditions ) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The sources of Sharia also include Islamic scholarly consensus developed after Muhammad 's death . Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia is influenced by the medieval ( Islamic Golden Age ) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence . Uniquely in the Muslim world , Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form . This , and the lack of judicial precedent , has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country 's laws . The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010 , but this is yet to be implemented . Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law . Nevertheless , Sharia remains the primary source of law , especially in areas such as criminal , family , commercial and contract law , and the Qu 'ran and the Sunnah are declared to be the country 's constitution . In the areas of land and energy law the extensive <unk> rights of the Saudi state ( in effect , the Saudi royal family ) constitute a significant feature . 
 The current Saudi court system was created by King Abdul Aziz , who founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932 , and was introduced to the country in stages between 1927 and 1960 . It comprises general and summary Sharia courts , with some administrative tribunals to deal with disputes on specific modern regulations . Trials in Saudi Arabia are bench trials . Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country 's first criminal procedure code , issued in 2001 , has been largely ignored . King Abdullah , in 2007 , introduced a number of significant judicial reforms , although they are yet to be fully implemented . 
 Criminal law punishments in Saudi Arabia include public beheading , hanging , stoning , amputation and lashing . Serious criminal offences include not only internationally recognized crimes such as murder , rape , theft and robbery , but also apostasy , adultery , witchcraft and sorcery . In addition to the regular police force , Saudi Arabia has a secret police , the Mabahith , and " religious police " , the Mutawa . The latter enforces Islamic social and moral norms . Western @-@ based human rights organizations , such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa , as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia . These include the number of executions , the range of offences which are subject to the death penalty , the lack of safeguards for the accused in the criminal justice system , the treatment of homosexuals , the use of torture , the lack of religious freedom , and the highly disadvantaged position of women . The Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House have also reported that " Saudi Arabia 's practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law . " 
 = = History = = 
 Sharia ( or Islamic law ) , the primary source of law in modern Saudi Arabia , was developed gradually by Muslim judges and scholars between the seventh and tenth centuries . From the time of the Abbasid caliphate in the 8th century , the developing Sharia was accepted as the basis of law in the towns of the Muslim world , including the Arabian peninsula , and upheld by local rulers , eclipsing urf ( or pre @-@ Islamic local customary law ) . In the rural areas , urf continued to be predominant for some time , and , for instance , was the main source of law among the bedouin of Nejd in central Arabia until the early 20th century . 
 By the 11th century , the Muslim world had developed four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence ( or fiqh ) , each with its own interpretations of Sharia : Hanbali , Maliki , Shafi and Hanafi . In Arabia , a preference for the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement , founded in the 18th century . Wahhabism , a strict form of Sunni Islam , was supported by the Saudi royal family ( the Al Saud ) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia . From the 18th century , the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia , the heartland of Wahhabi Islam . In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz , in the west of the peninsula , both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed . 
 Similarly , different court systems existed . In Nejd , there was a simple system of single judges for each of the major towns . The judge was appointed by the local governor , with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases . In the Hejaz , there was a more sophisticated system , with courts comprising panels of judges . In 1925 , Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932 . In 1927 , the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used . However , Nejd 's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment . 
 After becoming familiar with the Hejaz court system in the following decades , the religious establishment allowed its introduction to the rest of the country between 1957 and 1960 . Additionally , from the 1930s , Abdul Aziz created government tribunals or " committees " to adjudicate in areas covered by royal decrees such as commercial or labor law . The system of Sharia courts and government tribunals created by Abdul Aziz largely remained in place until the 2007 judiciary reforms ( see below ) . Until 1970 , the judiciary was the responsibility of the Grand Mufti , the country 's most senior religious authority . When the incumbent Grand Mufti died in 1969 , however , the then king , Faisal decided not to appoint a successor and took the opportunity to transfer responsibility to the newly established Ministry of Justice . 
 The Shia community of the Eastern province have a separate legal tradition . Although they follow Sharia , they apply the Shia <unk> school of jurisprudence to it . In 1913 , when Abdul Aziz conquered the area , he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases : one judge in Qatif , and one in Al @-@ Hasa . This remained the position , with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million , until 2005 when the number of judges was increased to seven . For all other areas of law , the Shia community are under the jurisdiction of the regular Sunni courts . 
 = = The courts and the judiciary = = 
 = = = Court structure = = = 
 The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges and lawyers form part of the ulema , the country 's religious leadership . There are also extra @-@ Sharia government tribunals which handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees and since 2008 , specialist courts , including the Board of Grievances and the Specialized Criminal Court . Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and As of 2007 , all courts and tribunals followed Sharia rules of evidence and procedure . 
 The Sharia courts have general jurisdiction over most civil and criminal cases . At present , there are two types of courts of first instance : general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases . Cases are adjudicated by single judges , except criminal cases if the potential sentence is death , amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges . There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters . Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with Sharia . 
 There are also non @-@ Sharia courts covering specialized areas of law , the most important of which is the Board of Grievances . This court was originally created to deal with complaints against the government , but As of 2010 also has jurisdiction over commercial and some criminal cases , such as bribery and forgery , and acts as a court of appeal for a number of non @-@ Sharia government tribunals . These administrative tribunals , referred to as " committees " , deal with specific issues regulated by royal decrees , such as labor and commercial law . 
 = = = Judges = = = 
 The judicial establishment , in the broadest sense , is composed of qadis , who give binding judgements in specific court cases , and <unk> and other members of the ulema , who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions ( fatwas ) . The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country ; his opinions are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary . The judiciary proper ( that is , the body of qadis ) is composed of about 700 judges , a relatively small number ( according to critics ) for a country of over 23 million . 
 <unk> generally have degrees in Sharia law from an Islamic university recognized by the Saudi government with , in many cases , a post @-@ graduate qualification from the Institute of Higher Judiciary in Riyadh . The training received from such Sharia law degrees is entirely religious in character and is based on the Qu 'ran and centuries old religious treatises with no reference to , for example , modern commercial issues . Although most judges have been educated and appointed under the current system , some of the older judges received the traditional qadi 's training of years of instruction by a religious mentor in a mosque . 
 The capabilities and reactionary nature of the judges have been criticized . The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges , who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia , have no knowledge , and are often contemptuous , of the modern world . Reported examples of judges ' attitudes include rulings banning such things as the children ’ s game Pokémon , telephones that play recorded music , and sending flowers to hospital patients . Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool . By one estimate , 80 % of the 600 + Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim , a province in the center of the country with less than 5 % of Saudi 's population , but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia . Senior judges will only allow like @-@ minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments . 
 = = = Reforms and developments 2008 – 2015 = = = 
 The Saudi system of justice has been criticized for being slow , arcane , lacking in some of the safeguards of justice and unable to deal with the modern world . In 2007 , King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system . The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but , once they are , will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances ' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system . New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general , criminal , personal status , commercial and labor courts . The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government 's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts . Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province . It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice . 
 In 2008 , the Specialized Criminal Court was created . The court tries suspected terrorists and human rights activists . On 26 June 2011 , the court started trials of 85 people suspected of being involved in Al @-@ Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the 2003 Riyadh compound bombings , and in September 2011 another 41 al @-@ Qaeda suspects appeared in the court . In the same year , the court held trial sessions of human rights activists , including Mohammed Saleh al @-@ <unk> , co @-@ founder of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association ( <unk> ) and Mubarak Zu 'air , a lawyer for long @-@ term prisoners , and a protestor , Khaled al @-@ <unk> , who spoke to BBC Arabic Television at a protest in Riyadh . The court convicted 16 of the human rights activists to sentences of 5 – 30 years on 22 November 2011 . 
 In 2009 , the King made a number of significant changes to the judiciary 's personnel at the most senior level by bringing in a younger generation . For example , as well as appointing a new Minister of Justice , a new chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council was appointed . The outgoing chairman was known to oppose the codification of Sharia . The king also appointed a new head of the Board of Grievances and Abdulrahman Al <unk> as the first chief justice of the new Supreme Court . As of January 2013 royal decree , the Supreme Judicial Council will be headed by the justice minister . The chief justice of the Supreme Court will also be a member .

 The religious police , ( mutawa is the name used for individual religious police , the " Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice " is the name of the police organization ) enforce Islamic codes of behavior .

Often accompanied by a police escort , the mutawa can order the detention and arrest of " violators " . Criticism of the mutawa by Saudis has grown since 2002 , when 15 schoolgirls died in a fire at their school in Mecca after the mutawa allegedly prevented male rescuers from entering because the girls were not veiled .

 = = = Constitutional law = = = 
 Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy , and has no legally binding written constitution . However , in 1992 , the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree . The Basic Law outlines the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific to be considered a constitution . It declares that the king must comply with Sharia ( that is , Islamic law ) and that the Quran and the Sunna ( the traditions of Muhammad ) are the country 's constitution . Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary , and this is carried out by the ulema , the Saudi religious establishment . 
 The Basic Law further states : 
 Monarchy is the system of rule in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Rulers of the country shall be from amongst the sons of the founder King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al @-@ Faisal Al @-@ Saud , and their descendants . The most upright among them shall receive allegiance according to Almighty God 's Book and His Messenger 's Sunna ( Traditions ) ... Government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia derives its authority from the Book of God and the Sunna of the Prophet ( <unk> ) , which are the ultimate sources of reference for this Law and the other laws of the State ... Governance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is based on justice , shura ( consultation ) and equality according to Islamic Sharia . 
 = = = Criminal law = = = 
 Saudi Arabia uses the bench trial system . Its courts observe few formalities . The country 's first criminal procedure code was introduced in 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law . Human Rights Watch , in a 2008 report , noted that judges were either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or were aware of it but routinely ignored the code . 
 Criminal law is governed by Sharia and comprises three categories : <unk> ( fixed Quranic punishments for specific crimes ) , Qisas ( eye @-@ for @-@ an @-@ eye retaliatory punishments ) , and Tazir , a general category . <unk> crimes are the most serious and include theft , robbery , blasphemy , apostasy , adultery , sodomy and fornication . Qisas crimes include murder or any crime involving bodily harm . Tazir represents most cases , many of which are defined by national regulations such as bribery , trafficking , and drug abuse . The most common punishment for a Tazir offence is lashing . 
 A conviction requires proof in one of three ways . The first is an uncoerced confession . Alternatively , the testimony of two male witnesses can convict ( four in the case of adultery ) , unless it is a <unk> crime , in which case a confession is also required . Women 's evidence normally carries half the weight of men in Sharia courts , however in criminal trials women 's testimony is not allowed at all . Testimony from non @-@ Muslims or Muslims whose doctrines are considered unacceptable ( for example , Shia ) may be discounted . Lastly , an affirmation or denial by oath can be required . Giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia 's , and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an admission of guilt resulting in conviction . 
 The Saudi courts impose a number of severe physical punishments . The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder , rape , armed robbery , repeated drug use , apostasy , adultery , witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword , stoning or firing squad , followed by crucifixion . The 345 reported executions between 2007 and 2010 were all carried out by public beheading . Two executions for " witchcraft and sorcery " were carried out in 2011 . There were no reports of stoning between 2007 and 2010 . Stoning has , however , occurred relatively recently and , for example , between 1981 and 1992 there were four cases of execution by stoning reported . 
 Although repeated theft can be punishable by amputation of the right hand and aggravated theft by the cross @-@ amputation of a hand and a foot , only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007 and 2010 . Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging , imprisonment or death . <unk> are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations . 
 Retaliatory punishments , or Qisas , are practised : for instance , an eye can be surgically removed at the insistence of a victim who lost his own eye . This occurred in a case reported in 2000 . Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya , or blood money , by the perpetrator . There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood @-@ money demands , for example a sum of $ 11 million was reported as being recently demanded . Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted . 
 = = = Family law = = = 
 Laws relating to marriage , divorce , children and inheritance are not codified and fall within the general jurisdiction of the Sharia courts . 
 Polygamy is permitted for men but is limited to four wives at any one time . There is evidence that its practice has increased , particularly among the educated Hejazi elite , as a result of oil wealth . The government has promoted polygamy as part of a return to " Islamic values " program . In 2001 , the Grand Mufti ( the highest religious authority ) issued a fatwa , or opinion , calling upon Saudi women to accept polygamy as part of the Islamic package and declaring that polygamy was necessary " to fight against ... the growing epidemic of spinsterhood " . There is no minimum age for marriage in Saudi Arabia and the Grand Mufti reportedly said in 2009 that girls of the age of 10 or 12 were marriageable . 
 Men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives ( <unk> ) without needing any legal justification . The divorce is effective immediately . The husband 's obligation is then to provide financial support for the divorced wife for a period of four months and ten days . A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her . In practice , it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce . The divorce rate is high , with 50 % of marriages being dissolved . In the event of divorce , fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9 . The right for men to marry up to four wives , combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause , can translate to unlimited polygamy . King Abdul Aziz , the founder of the country , reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women . However , his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards . 
 With regard to the law of inheritance , the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased 's estate must be left to the so @-@ called Quranic heirs . Generally , female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs . A Sunni Muslim can bequeath a maximum of a third of his property to non @-@ Quranic heirs . The residue is divided between agnatic heirs . 
 = = = Commercial and contract law = = = 
 Business and commerce are governed by Sharia , commercial jurisdiction rests with the Board of Grievances composed of Sharia @-@ trained judges , but " Special Tribunals " tasked with " finding ways to circumnavigate the more restrictive aspects of Shariah Law " have been established . 
 For foreign investors , uncertainties around the content of commercial law , because of the Sharia aspect , constitutes a disincentive to invest in Saudi Arabia . As it is governed by Sharia , contract law is not codified . Within the general limitations of Sharia , it allows considerable freedom for the parties to agree contract terms . However , contracts involving speculation or the payment of interest are prohibited and are not enforceable . If a contract is breached , Saudi courts will only award compensation for proven direct damage . Claims for loss of profit or opportunity will not be allowed as these would constitute speculation , which is not permitted under Sharia . 
 As of at least 2003 , the non @-@ sharia " Special Tribunals " or " Special Committees " hear " most commercial law cases " ranging from " breach of contract suits to trade mark infringement and labour disputes . " The Tribunals enforce nizam ( decrees ) issued by the King . Specific modern aspects of commercial law , for example , commercial paper and securities , intellectual property , and corporate law are governed by modern regulations , and specialist government tribunals deal with related disputes . The government recently revised its intellectual property laws to meet World Trade Organization standards , as part of its admission to the WTO in 2004 . Because of a lack of resources , when the new patent law went into effect in 2004 , the Saudi Patent office had only registered 90 patents since 1989 , with a back @-@ log of 9 @,@ 000 applications . It is believed the back @-@ log has now been reduced . 
 The Saudi government is also putting greater resources into combating unauthorized distribution of software , printed material , recordings and videos . However , illegally copied material is still widely available . Enforcement efforts have been supported by a fatwa , or religious ruling , that copyright infringement of software is forbidden under Islam . Saudi Arabia had been on the Special 301 Watchlist , the U.S. ' s running log of countries considered to inadequately regulate or enforce intellectual property rights , but was removed in 2010 . 
 Saudi law recognizes only corporate or partnership entities established under Sharia or the Saudi Company Law of 1982 . A contract with any other type of company will be void and the persons who made the contract in the company 's name will be personally liable for it . Under Sharia , corporations can take a number of forms , but the most common in Saudi Arabia is <unk> <unk> where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise . In addition , the Company Law ( which is based on Egyptian company law ) identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures , and limited liability partnerships . 
 = = = Labor law = = = 
 Employers have a number of obligations , including at least 21 days paid holiday after a year 's employment and will be 30 days after five years of continuous service . Terminated employees must receive an " end @-@ of @-@ service " payment of a half a months ' salary for each year employed going up to one month if employed for more than 5 years . 
 = = = Land law = = = 
 Most land in Saudi Arabia is owned by the government and only cultivated land and urban property are subject to individual ownership . All land titles must be registered , but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration . Real estate could only be owned by Saudi citizens until 2000 , when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in Saudi Arabia . Property investments by non @-@ Saudis of more than 30 million Saudi <unk> require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca . 
 Saudi Arabia has three categories of land : developed land ( amir ) , undeveloped land ( <unk> ) , and " protective zones " ( <unk> ) . Developed land comprises the built environment of towns and villages and agriculturally developed land , and can be bought , sold and inherited by individuals . The undeveloped land comprises rough grazing , pasture and wilderness . Rough grazing and pasture is owned in common and everyone has equal rights to its use . The wilderness is owned by the state and may be open to everyone unless specific restrictions are imposed . Harim land is a protective buffer between the owned land and the undeveloped land , and is defined , in the case of a town , as the area that can be reached and returned from in a day for the purposes of collecting fuel and pasturing livestock . 
 Saudi law utilizes the Waqf , which is a form of land ownership whereby a Muslim can transfer property to a foundation for long @-@ term religious or charitable purposes . The property cannot then be alienated or transferred . 
 = = = Energy law = = = 
 Saudi Arabia 's vast oil reserves are owned by the Saudi government , in effect the Saudi royal family . Article 14 of the Basic Law states : 
 All natural resources that God has deposited underground , above ground , in territorial waters or within the land and sea domains under the authority of the State , together with revenues of these resources , shall be the property of the State , as provided by the Law . The Law shall specify means for exploitation , protection and development of these resources in the best interest of the State , and its security and economy . 
 The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is responsible for general strategy in the oil and gas sectors and for monitoring the state @-@ owned oil company , Saudi Aramco . The oil , gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco , which has a near monopoly in these areas . It is the world 's biggest oil producer , the Middle East 's biggest company and is generally considered to be the most important energy company in the world . However , in 2003 , the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia 's vast reserves of natural gas , believed to represent 4 % of the world 's reserves . This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas . 
 Currently , the electricity industry is in the hands of the 75 % state @-@ owned Saudi Electric Company , but plans have been announced to privatize the industry . 
 = = Human rights and rule of law issues = = 
 Human rights issues and failings in the rule of law in Saudi Arabia have attracted strong criticism . These include criminal law punishments that are considered as cruel , as well as the position of women , religious discrimination , the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the Saudi <unk> . 
 Between 1996 and 2000 , Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN human rights conventions and , in 2004 , the government approved the establishment of the National Society for Human Rights ( <unk> ) , staffed by government employees , to monitor their implementation . To date , the activities of the <unk> have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence . Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN 's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948 . Now , only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration . In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record , the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country , and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order . 
 = = = Rule of law = = = 
 Because Sharia , as applied by Saudi courts , is uncodified and because judges are not bound by judicial precedent , the scope and content of the law is uncertain . A study published by the Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House has criticized a number of aspects of the administration of justice in Saudi Arabia and concluded that the country 's " practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law . " The study goes on to assert that qadis ( judges ) reach decisions without following due process and " only the bravest of lawyers ... challenge decisions of the qadis ; usually appeals to the king are based on mercy , not on justice or innocence . " It also claimed that members of the Saudi royal family are not forced to appear before Saudi courts . 
 As in many countries , those with influence may receive favorable treatment before the law . According to a former managing editor at Arab News , the ruling House of Saud is so unwilling " to let one of their own face the consequences of his criminal activity " that on the rare occasions that they are arrested for a crime , the perpetrating prince is pardoned ( Prince Fahd bin Naif , who was 19 , gunned down <unk> al @-@ Qadi in 2002 ) or released , and further media mention of the incident forbidden by the Ministry of Culture and Information ( four princes that participated in the disruption of a 2002 Eid al @-@ Fitr gathering on the corniche of Jeddah ) 
 On the other hand , blue collar foreign workers have sometimes been unable to collect salaries due even when the Saudi Labor Office has ruled in their favor , since employers can stall payment until the worker ' work permits have expired . 
 = = = Women 's rights = = = 
 The U.S. State department considers that “ discrimination against women is a significant problem ” in Saudi Arabia and that women have few political or social rights . After her 2008 visit , the UN special rapporteur on violence against women noted the lack of women 's autonomy and the absence of a law criminalizing violence against women . The World Economic Forum 2012 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 131st out of 135 countries for gender parity , ahead of Syria , Chad , Pakistan and Yemen . 
 Every adult woman has to have a close male relative as her " guardian " . As a result , Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different from being a minor , with little authority over their own lives . The guardian is entitled to make a number of critical decisions on a woman 's behalf . These include giving approval for the woman to travel , to hold some types of business licenses , to study at a university or college and to work if the type of business is not " deemed appropriate for a woman . " Even where a guardian ’ s approval is not legally required , some officials will still ask for it . Women also face discrimination in the courts , where the testimony of one man equals that of two women , and in family and inheritance law ( see above ) . 
 The religious police mutawa impose restrictions on women when in public . These restrictions include requiring women to sit in separate specially designated family sections in restaurants , to wear an <unk> ( a loose @-@ fitting , full @-@ length black cloak covering the entire body ) and to conceal their hair . Women also risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative . Although there is no written ban on women driving cars , a Saudi driving license is required by law and these are not issued to women . Thus , it is effectively illegal for women to drive , and the ban is enforced by the mutawa . In 2013 , Saudi Arabia registered its first female trainee lawyer , Arwa al @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Political freedom and freedom of speech = = = 
 No political parties or national elections are permitted in Saudi Arabia and according to The Economist 's 2010 Democracy Index , the Saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated . There is no legal protection of freedom of speech and Saudis are prohibited from publicly criticizing the government , Islam , or the royal family . The Saudi press is strictly censored and articles on Saudi dissidents are banned . Saudi censorship is considered among the most restrictive in the world and the country blocks broad swathes of the Internet . After protests occurred in early 2011 , the government banned all public demonstrations and marches . 
 = = = Criminal trials and punishment = = = 
 Western @-@ based organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have condemned both the Saudi criminal justice system and its severe punishments . However , most Saudis reportedly support the system and say that it maintains a low crime rate . 
 Human Rights Watch , in their 2008 report on Saudi Arabian criminal justice system , noted that the criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but , as mentioned above , had been ignored by judges in any case . Those arrested are often not informed of the crime of which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess . At trial , there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense . Most trials are held in secret , that is , without the public or press . The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts , such as beheading , stoning , amputation and lashing , and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized . 
 = = = Religious freedom = = = 
 In 2010 , the U.S. State Department stated that in Saudi Arabia " freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law and is severely restricted in practice " and that " government policies continued to place severe restrictions on religious freedom " . No faith other than Islam is permitted to be practised , although there are nearly a million Christians , nearly all foreign workers , in Saudi Arabia . There are no churches or other non @-@ Muslim houses of worship permitted in the country . Even private prayer services are forbidden in practice and the Saudi religious police reportedly regularly search the homes of Christians . Foreign workers must observe Ramadan and are not allowed to celebrate Christmas or Easter . Conversion by Muslims to another religion ( apostasy ) carries the death penalty , although there have been no confirmed reports of executions for apostasy in recent years . <unk> by non @-@ Muslims is illegal , and the last Christian priest was expelled from Saudi Arabia in 1985 . Compensation in court cases discriminates against non @-@ Muslims : once fault is determined , a Muslim receives all of the amount of compensation determined , a Jew or Christian half , and all others a sixteenth . 
 According to Human Rights Watch , the Shia minority face systematic discrimination from the Saudi government in education , the justice system and especially religious freedom . Restrictions are imposed on the public celebration of Shia festivals such as Ashura and on the Shia taking part in communal public worship . 
 In March 2014 , the Saudi interior ministry issued a royal decree branding all atheists as terrorists , which defines terrorism as " calling for atheist thought in any form , or calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based " . 
 = = = LGBT rights = = = 
 Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world where homosexual acts are not only illegal but punishable by execution . There have also been raids on " gay parties " and men have been arrested for " behaving like women " . The usual penalties inflicted have been limited to flogging and imprisonment . 
 = Battle of Millstone = 
 The Battle of Millstone , also known as the Battle of Van Nest 's Mill , was a skirmish that occurred near the mill of Abraham Van Nest in Weston , New Jersey ( near present @-@ day Manville , New Jersey ) on January 20 , 1777 , during the American Revolutionary War . A British foraging party was flanked and driven off by forces composed mostly of New Jersey militia , depriving the British of their wagons and supplies . 
 This action was one of a series of skirmishes known as the Forage War that persisted in northern New Jersey through the first few months of 1777 , and it demonstrated that militia companies were capable of putting up a significant fight . 
 = = Background = = 
 After George Washington 's successful movements around the army of Charles Cornwallis that culminated in the Battle of Princeton on January 3 , 1777 , Washington faced the dilemma of being caught between Cornwallis in Trenton , New Jersey and the rest of the British Army at New Brunswick , New Jersey . Rather than make an attempt on the British outpost at New Brunswick with his exhausted troops , Washington moved his army up the Millstone River valley toward Morristown , New Jersey , a place he knew could be strongly fortified and used as winter quarters . Cornwallis and the remaining British and Hessian troops in and around Trenton and Princeton withdrew to New Brunswick to regroup after the battle at Princeton . 
 On January 13 , a significant portion of the British army advanced from New Brunswick west to Somerset Court House ( present @-@ day Millstone , New Jersey ) , and remained there for about a week before retreating back to New Brunswick , destroying houses and plundering supplies . During this time , militia companies mustered to assist the Continental Army . These movements established the area west of New Brunswick up to the Millstone and Raritan rivers as a no man 's land between the two forces . Following the British retreat , Somerset Court House became one of several outposts garrisoned by Patriot militia companies , with support from the Continental Army . 
 = = Battle = = 
 A British foraging party of 500 men , led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Abercromby of the 37th Foot , left New Brunswick on January 20 , and headed west toward the Millstone River . They crossed over the river ( it is unclear exactly which bridge they used ) , leaving a rear guard of Hessians with some field artillery to cover the bridge , and eventually reached Van Nest 's mill at Weston , New Jersey ( near present @-@ day Manville , New Jersey ) , a few miles north of Somerset Court House , and near the point where the Millstone empties into the Raritan . There they seized supplies of all varieties , and prepared to return to New Brunswick . 
 Militia companies to the north were alerted to the British movement early in the day , and some marched for Bound Brook , New Jersey . When reports arrived of the activity at Van Nest 's mill , they marched for that place . In all about 400 New Jersey militia and 50 Pennsylvania militia formed under Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson to dispute the British action . While detailed accounts of their movements are sketchy , Dickinson apparently divided his forces , sending one force to meet the front of the British wagon train , while a second moved to flank them . Both of these forces forded one of the rivers , wading in icy water that was waist deep . One successfully surprised the British wagon train in the lane near the mill , before it reached the main road and the bridge toward New Brunswick ; their fire struck horses from the first wagon . This stopped the train , scattered the wagon drivers and drove the British to retreat precipitously toward the bridge , leaving their booty behind . 
 When the militiamen reached the bridge , the Hessian rear guard fired grape shot from its artillery to cover the retreat . After an exchange of fire across the river without apparent consequence , the British withdrew . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Dickinson wrote in a letter to Colonel John Nielson on January 23 , " I have the pleasure to inform you that on Monday last with about 450 men chiefly our militia I attacked a foraging party near V. Nest Mills consisting of 500 men with 2 field pieces , which we routed after an engagement of 20 minutes and brought off 107 horses , 49 wagons , 115 cattle , 70 sheep , 40 barrels of flour - 106 bags and many other things , 49 prisoners . " General Washington , who was not always happy with the performance of the militias , wrote , " Genl Dickinsons behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him , for tho ' his Troops were all raw , he lead them thro ' the River , middle deep , and gave the Enemy so severe a charge , that , <unk> ' supported by three field pieces , they gave way and left their Convoy " , and only reported the taking of nine prisoners . 
 Archibald Robertson , a British officer who was not part of the expedition , reported that " Lieutenant Colonel Abercromby with 500 men went on a foraging party towards Hillsborough . Part of this Corps was attacked by the Rebels , which occasion 'd such disorder Amongst the Waggon Drivers that 42 <unk> were left behind . " One British witness was " absolutely certain the attackers were not militia , they were sure that no militia would fight in that way . " 
 Casualty figures were extremely variable , but British casualties ( killed , wounded , or captured ) appear to have been in the low 30s according to press accounts ( contrary to Dickinson 's claim of 49 prisoners taken ) , while militia casualties were relatively small in number . 
 Skirmishing continued between American and British forces throughout the winter in a period that historian David Hackett Fischer dubbed the Forage War , since it revolved around the British need for forage for its horses . The American tactics , primarily driven by New Jersey militia commanders but supported by Washington and the Continentals , were so successful that even British foraging parties of 2 @,@ 000 men came under attack . 
 = Team of Rivals = 
 Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln is a 2005 book by Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin , published by Simon & Schuster . The book is a biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and some of the men who served with him in his cabinet from 1861 to 1865 . Three of his Cabinet members had previously run against Lincoln in the 1860 election : Attorney General Edward Bates , Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase and Secretary of State William H. Seward . The book focuses on Lincoln 's mostly successful attempts to reconcile conflicting personalities and political factions on the path to abolition and victory in the American Civil War . 
 Goodwin 's sixth book , Team of Rivals was well received by critics , and won the 2006 Lincoln Prize and the inaugural Book Prize for American History of the New @-@ York Historical Society . US President Barack Obama cited it as one of his favorite books and was said to have used it as a model for constructing his own cabinet . In 2012 , a Steven Spielberg film based on the book was released to critical acclaim .

 Team of Rivals is the sixth book by American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin . In 1995 , Goodwin was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History for her book No Ordinary Time : Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt : The Home Front in World War II , a similar study of personalities in the Roosevelt White House . 
 Goodwin spent ten years on the research and writing of Team of Rivals . She stated that she had been inspired to tell the stories of the four men ( Seward , Chase , Bates , and Lincoln ) together when realizing that the cabinet members had written extensive diaries and letters that might provide a " new angle " in Lincoln studies . 
 During Goodwin 's work on Team of Rivals , a plagiarism scandal erupted over unmarked quotations in Goodwin 's 1987 book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys . Goodwin stated that in dealing with the scandal , during which she had to apologize and make an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement to author Lynne McTaggart , she found Lincoln a consolation , particularly his philosophy " not to waste precious energies on recriminations about the past " . In a 2012 interview , Goodwin cited early 20th @-@ century muckraker Ida Tarbell on the pleasures of writing about Lincoln : " Somebody asked her , why do so many people write about Lincoln ? And she said , because he ’ s so companionable . And I think somehow that 's been true for me . " 
 = = Contents = = 
 The first chapter of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination on May 18 , 1860 , awaiting the results of the national convention by telegraph : New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward , widely considered the frontrunner ; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase , a favorite of the party 's more radical wing ; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates , preferred by more conservative elements of the party ; and Abraham Lincoln , a former U.S. Representative from Illinois . Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence : Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed , Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery , Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention , and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election . Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions , and proceeds to win the presidency . 
 Determined both to hold the party together and to recruit the ablest men for his cabinet , Lincoln then persuaded each of his former rivals to join his cabinet . Seward assumed the post of Secretary of State , Chase that of Secretary of the Treasury , and Bates that of United States Attorney General . The South <unk> following Lincoln 's election , and the country falls into the American Civil War . Goodwin describes in detail some cabinet decisions , such as the debate over provisioning Fort Sumter in South Carolina , the first state that had seceded ( in December 1860 ) , and the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation , which freed the slaves of secession states . She also traces the home life of the book 's main figures , including the marriage of Chase 's daughter and close companion Kate , First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln 's role in Washington , D.C. society , and the death of Lincoln 's son Willie . 
 During the war , Seward comes to respect and collaborate with Lincoln . Chase , on the other hand , schemes against Lincoln from within the cabinet , hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election . Lincoln nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort , and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful . Lincoln also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War ; like Seward , Stanton comes to respect and support Lincoln . While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet , Lincoln also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan , Henry Halleck , and George Meade . The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies . Lincoln oversees the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which abolishes slavery , and sees the war to its successful conclusion . He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court , believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens . 
 Team of Rivals closes with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14 , 1865 . Seward is also attacked by a knife @-@ wielding assailant , though he survives . An epilogue traces the later lives and deaths of Seward , Stanton , Bates , Chase , Mary Lincoln , and others .

 Team of Rivals was generally well received by critics . Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning Civil War historian James M. McPherson called it " an elegant , incisive study of Lincoln and leading members of his cabinet that will appeal to experts as well as to those whose knowledge of Lincoln is an amalgam of high school history and popular mythology " and stated that Goodwin addressed Lincoln 's gift for coalition @-@ building " better than any other writer " . Allen C. Guelzo wrote in The Washington Post that " this immense , finely boned book is no dull administrative or bureaucratic history ; rather , it is a story of personalities – a messianic drama , if you will – in which Lincoln must increase and the others must decrease . " In the Seattle Times , Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett praised the book 's " ambitious , multi @-@ strand structure " , concluding , " This monumental effort is a gift ; Goodwin 's work clarifies and preserves Lincoln 's legacy with rare skill . " Randy Dotinga of the Christian Science Monitor called Team of Rivals an " immense and immensely readable work " . Sanford D. <unk> of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Goodwin is " an engaging , insightful chronicler of Lincoln 's Civil War presidency , although she strays from time to time from her stated intention of keeping the lens focused on Lincoln and his 1860 rivals , who , in turn , were often feuding with others in Lincoln 's Cabinet . " 
 In 2006 , the book was awarded the Lincoln Prize , " awarded annually for the finest scholarly work in English on Abraham Lincoln , the American Civil War soldier , or a subject relating to their era " . On March 29 , 2006 , Goodwin was announced as the winner of the $ 50 @,@ 000 Book Prize for American History of the New @-@ York Historical Society . Team of Rivals was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize . 
 U.S. President Barack Obama named Team of Rivals as the one book he would want on a desert island . As a senator , he met with Goodwin in Washington to discuss the book . After his election in 2008 , Obama reached out to previous rivals including Hillary Rodham Clinton , who became his Secretary of State , drawing comparisons to Lincoln 's " Team of Rivals " approach .

 While consulting on a project for director Steven Spielberg in 1999 , Goodwin told Spielberg she was planning to write Team of Rivals , and Spielberg immediately told her he wanted the film rights . DreamWorks finalized the deal in 2001 , and Goodwin sent Spielberg the book a chapter by chapter as she composed it . Daniel Day @-@ Lewis agreed to play Abraham Lincoln after Liam Neeson , the original lead , withdrew from the project in 2010 . The screenplay was written by Tony Kushner , who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing ( Adapted Screenplay ) . A number of critics noted that the final film , which focused almost entirely on the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress , was based on only a few pages of Goodwin 's book , and that Kushner did substantial independent research composing the screenplay . 
 Filming began on October 17 , 2011 , and ended on December 19 , 2011 . Goodwin consulted with Kushner on various drafts of the screenplay and took Day @-@ Lewis on a tour of Lincoln 's home and law office in Springfield , Illinois . The film was released nationwide on November 16 , 2012 to commercial success and wide critical acclaim . Day @-@ Lewis won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance .

Following her career as a bassist for Hole and The Smashing Pumpkins , Auf der Maur recorded the album of the course of two years in various studios through the United States and Canada with producer Chris Goss . The songs featured on Auf der Maur were written over a ten @-@ year period , from 1992 to 2002 , throughout her time in Tinker , Hole and The Smashing Pumpkins . 
 Auf der Maur features a number of guest musicians and collaborators including former bandmates Eric Erlandson and James Iha , Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme , Mark Lanegan , Jeordie White and John Stanier . The album 's sound deviates significantly from Auf der Maur 's previous work and features a more experimental and progressive sound . 
 Upon its release , Auf der Maur received generally favourable reviews and was a moderate commercial success , selling 200 @,@ 000 copies worldwide . Following a successful tour through Europe and United Kingdom prior the album 's release , two of the album 's three singles — " Followed the Waves " and " Real a Lie " — charted in the UK Singles Chart . A subsequent tour of North America and another tour in the United Kingdom led the album to chart in both the United States ' Billboard 200 and the UK Album Chart at number 187 and number 31 , respectively .

 Following her departure from Hole in November 1999 , Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D 'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000 . Auf der Maur toured with the band for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina / The Machines of God ( 2000 ) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release . In May 2000 , The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career . In an interview with Jam ! , Auf der Maur said : " one of the reasons why I took 2001 off is I didn 't even know what I was going to do with music . Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life " and that her " relationship to music had become very army @-@ oriented . I was a soldier , a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music . I didn 't know if I was going to make my own record . " In late 2001 , Auf der Maur discovered " old demos " in her Montréal residence and " realized [ she ] had an entire album 's worth of material that had been sitting there for years . " Among the demos was " Real a Lie " , a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand , that was released as a single by the duo 's former band Tinker in 1994 . Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album " happened very naturally . "

 The album was recorded during 2001 , 2002 and 2003 at various studios throughout the United States and Canada , including Stagg Street Studios in Los Angeles , Stratosphere Sound in New York City , Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree , California , Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank , California , The Sound Factory in Hollywood , Sound City Studios and Kevin <unk> 's residence in Van Nuys , California , and French Kiss Studios in Montréal , Canada . Recording sessions began in October 2001 and initially she intended to record in Chicago , Illinois , but those plans were later abandoned . Although each session had individual engineers , Auf der Maur and Chris Goss were primary producers of the project . Auf der Maur also financed the recording sessions herself , as she was not signed to a record label at the time . She also self @-@ financed the sessions to " secure creative control " as she " wanted the foundation of it to be really pure . " Describing the recording process , Auf der Maur said : " The L.A. section of the record is the prettier , more ethereal stuff [ and ] the dark , rock stuff actually – – which is really my main route and the muscle of the record – – was recorded in Canada . And then in Chicago we 're recording some songs with James and Chris that are more mid @-@ dissonant pop – – mid @-@ tempo , mid @-@ volume . " 
 " Those two sides – the heavy and the feminine put together – is what does it for me . What moves me when I play bass is a guttural , kind of masculine , heavy , Viking thing . I picture fields and galloping horses . And then there 's the dream girl in me who writes in a diary and used to sing in a choir . But I would never want one without the other . Life is good and evil , man and woman . And I want to embrace both . " 
 Upon the completion of the recording sessions , Auf der Maur 's budget ran out . She did not have funds to mix the album but was signed to Capitol Records soon afterwards . 
 Various musicians collaborated during the recording of Auf der Maur . Former bandmates Eric Erlandson and James Iha performed guitar on " Would If I Could " and " Skin Receiver , " respectively , Mark Lanegan provided additional vocals to " Taste You , " and Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme played guitar on four songs and backing vocals on " Skin Receiver . " Speaking of the contributions , Auf der Maur said : " I am so lucky I have all these talented friends . It is not too hard to find musicians who are available to play . It just so happens the most generous people are also the best and were willing to play . " During the earlier stages of recording , a duet with Rufus Wainwright was also considered .

 Auf der Maur was released worldwide on February 2 , 2004 , May 4 in the United States and June 1 in Canada . Although the album was distributed internationally on Capitol , EMI managed distribution of the album in Canada . For initial promotion upon its American release , Auf der Maur appeared on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien on June 17 and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on July 6 . 
 Three singles from the album were lifted . The lead single , " Followed the Waves , " was released on February 16 , 2004 to accompany the worldwide release . It charted in both the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks in the United States and the UK Singles Chart , peaking at number 32 and number 35 , respectively . " Real a Lie " was released on May 3 to accompany the American release of the album , however , the song only charted in the United Kingdom , peaking at number 33 . The album 's final single , " Taste You " , was released on September 27 and peaked at number 51 in the United Kingdom . All three singles had accompanying music videos which were made available for download on Auf der Maur 's official web site in Windows Media Video , QuickTime and <unk> formats .

 Auf der Maur promoted the album with an almost @-@ constant tour across Europe , the United Kingdom and North America during 2004 . The seven @-@ leg tour commenced on January 30 , 2004 and concluded on December 4 . The 151 @-@ date tour included support from A Perfect Circle , <unk> , The Living Things , The Offspring , The Polyphonic Spree , The Von Bondies , Matthew Good and <unk> amongst others . During the tour , Auf der Maur performed at various summer festivals including Curiosa in the United States , Pukkelpop in Belgium , Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands , Reading Festival , Leeds Festival in the United Kingdom , and Independents Day Festival in Italy . During the entire tour , Auf der Maur published photography from the shows on her official web site . 
 Following the tour , Capitol Records was taken over by EMI . All of the material that had been recorded for Auf der Maur , including outtakes , demos and rehearsal recordings , were seized by EMI 's red tape . Following months of negotiations , Auf der Maur won the rights to the recordings and was subsequently dropped from Capitol / EMI in 2006 . Reflecting on the experience , Auf der Maur said there is " a gross feeling when you merge your heart with a corporate structure . " Auf der Maur took the experience into consideration when considering labels to release Auf der Maur 's follow @-@ up , Out of Our Minds ( 2010 ) , which was self @-@ released .

 Auf der Maur was generally well received by music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 62 , based on 19 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album three out of five stars , noting that the album had " a certain nostalgic appeal " and " it 's a little slicker and more polished " than her previous work but added that the album 's themes were " little embarrassing and juvenile . " Alternative Press awarded the album four out of five stars , adding that " the disc 's bread and butter is Auf Der Maur 's smoking riffs . " Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said that " though Auf Der Maur is never <unk> bad , there 's nothing the least bit distinctive about it " and called it " Billy Corgan @-@ inspired , arena @-@ scale , guitar @-@ driven introspective <unk> " in his three out of ten review . In his review for the BBC , Matt Wicks described the album as " excellent " and " like the Pumpkins in their prime " and compared Auf der Maur to other female contemporaries such as Shirley Manson and PJ Harvey . Blender gave a majorly positive review , awarding the album three out of five stars , but criticized Auf der Maur 's vocals , stating : " buffeted by big guitars , her thin , untrained voice occasionally sounds listless . " 
 Tom Edwards of Drowned in Sound noted that the " opening trio of tracks are the most convincing " and the album " still has all the hallmarks of the debut record [ ... ] it has the great songs that have been collected over years in the bedroom and on the road " in his seven out of ten review . Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C + grade with reviewer David Browne describing the album as " professional , commercial alt @-@ rock that takes flight intermittently " but " the monolithic sound also feels dated and drab " and summarised that Auf der Maur was " the perfect CD for 1995 , released too late . " Adam Sweeting of The Guardian described the album 's songs as " powerful and finely crafted " and " soared " , though adding that some were " multi @-@ layered " , and awarded the album three out of five stars . NME awarded the album eight out of ten and said that " the mix of <unk> personal lyrics " and " bruisingly heavy music just draws you in even further , while the crunchy production is so massive , so physical , the music fills every in of space it comes into contact with " and Q referred to the album as " a revelation , " awarding it four out of five stars .

 = Shades of Deep Purple = 
 Shades of Deep Purple is the debut studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple , released in July 1968 on Tetragrammaton in the United States and in September 1968 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom . The band , initially called Roundabout , was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis , who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project . The Mk . I line @-@ up of the band was completed by vocalist / frontman Rod Evans , along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice , in March 1968 . 
 After about two months of rehearsals , Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers , thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic . Stylistically the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock , two genres with an ever growing audience in the late 1960s . 
 The album was not well received in the UK , where it sold very little and did not chart . In the US , on the other hand , it was a success and the single " Hush " , an energetic rock track originally written by Joe South , became very popular at the time , reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart . The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 1970s . Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider Shades of Deep Purple an important piece in the history of Deep Purple .

 When Deep Purple 's first line @-@ up came together in 1967 , there was a moment of transition for the British music scene . Beat was still popular , especially in dance halls and outside the capital , but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock , progressive rock and psychedelic rock . New bands like The Moody Blues , Procol Harum , and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock , using complex and daring arrangements . At the same time , psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society , where bands like Pink Floyd , The Pretty Things , The Jimi Hendrix Experience , Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug @-@ induced rock music , in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA . Many well @-@ known acts , including The Beatles , The Rolling Stones and The Who , were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period . 
 During this time of great creativity for the British musical scene in the summer of 1967 , Chris Curtis , former drummer of the beat band The Searchers , contacted London businessman Tony Edwards to find financing for a new group he was putting together , to be called Roundabout . The name meant that the group would contain a revolving cast of non @-@ permanent members getting on and off the stage like a musical roundabout , with only Curtis as mainstay and singer . Impressed with the plan , Edwards agreed to finance and manage the venture with two business partners , Ron Hire and John Coletta , and the three of them founded Hire @-@ Edwards @-@ Coletta ( HEC ) Enterprises . 
 In September 1967 , the first successful Roundabout recruitment was Curtis ' flatmate , the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord ; he had most notably played with The <unk> , a band led by Art Wood , brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood , and featuring Keef Hartley . At that time , Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden , which included also bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little . Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement . They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore , whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star @-@ Club in Hamburg , Germany . Blackmore had been a member of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat , pop and rock acts , including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages , where he had met Little . Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg , where he was hanging out in local clubs . The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967 . Meanwhile , Curtis ' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development , forcing his financiers , HEC Enterprises , to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band . 
 Lord signed up as bassist his friend Simper , whose fame at the time came from his membership in the rock and roll group Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and for having survived the car crash in 1966 that killed Kidd . The line @-@ up of Roundabout was completed by drummer Bobby Woodman , recruited by Blackmore . Dave Curtiss , an acquaintance of Woodman , was at first considered as singer , but he left to fulfill previous commitments . According to Simper , Ian Gillan , the singer of the band Episode Six , was also contacted for an audition , but declined the offer . 
 = = Early development = = 
 Roundabout moved into <unk> Hall , a rented old farmhouse near the village of South Mimms , Hertfordshire in late February 1968 . There , while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment , they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker . Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions , but was not up to the standards the band required . They chose Rod Evans instead , who was already the singer of the club band The Maze . Evans brought along after the audition his 19 @-@ year @-@ old band mate Ian Paice , a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg . They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit . Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound . 
 The first rehearsals of what would be known as the Mk . I line @-@ up of Deep Purple involved mostly jamming and some work on the instrumentals " And the Address " and " Mandrake Root " , which Blackmore and Lord had written earlier that year . Mandrake Root was also the name of an earlier band that Blackmore had been trying to form in Germany , before being contacted by Roundabout 's management . After the two instrumentals , the first proper song to be arranged was " Help ! " , a Beatles cover that Chris Curtis wanted to include in an eventual album . Evans wrote some lyrics for " Mandrake Root " and reduced to one the number of instrumental tracks . Having arranged and rehearsed the first three songs , the musicians focused their attention on " I 'm So Glad " , a song by Skip James which had earlier been covered by Cream and The Maze . The next addition during rehearsals was " Hey Joe " , a song originally , but <unk> , written by Billy Roberts and mistakenly credited to Deep Purple on original releases of the album . The main inspiration for the new arrangement of the song was the 1966 hit version by American guitarist Jimi Hendrix , but the track length was stretched with the inclusion of classical @-@ influenced instrumental sections . The band also selected a pop rock song called " Hush " , written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal the previous year , which Blackmore had heard while in Germany . 
 = = Recording = = 
 With a possible set list shaping up during rehearsals , Blackmore convinced a friend of his , Derek Lawrence , to be the band 's producer . They had met years before , when both worked for producer Joe Meek and Lawrence ran an independent production company that recorded singles for release in the United States . Lawrence had many contacts in the US and was present at some of Roundabout 's sessions , remaining impressed . 
 Through Lawrence , HEC Enterprises contacted the new American record label Tetragrammaton Records , which was looking for a British band to work with . HEC arranged for the band to cut some demos for the American label in late March and early April at Trident Studios in London . They taped two of their previously developed songs , " Hush " and " Help ! " , as well as two new songs : " Love Help Me " had already been developed before Evans and Paice joined , while " Shadows " was quickly written and arranged by the band for those recording sessions . Lawrence also played the demo of " Help ! " to the British recording company EMI , which offered a deal for distribution in Europe with its sub @-@ label Parlophone . All the demos , with the exception of " Shadows " , were sent to Tetragrammaton for approval . 
 The recording of the demos was followed by a short promotional tour of eight dates in Denmark and Sweden through April and May , booked as Roundabout by a friend of Lord . The band name was changed at this time , after Blackmore suggested the title of his grandmother 's favourite song , " Deep Purple " by Peter DeRose . Deep Purple played their first gig at the Park School in the district of <unk> , <unk> , Denmark on 20 April 1968 and the live set comprised all the new songs and the cover of " Little Girl " , originally by John Mayall and Eric Clapton . When they returned to England , Tetragrammaton confirmed the decision to sign the band . This was a saving grace , because HEC had spent nearly all their budget for promotion and equipment . The band relocated to <unk> Manor , in Balcombe , West Sussex , because <unk> Hall was no longer available . 
 While the band was on tour , some studio time had been booked and on Saturday , 11 May 1968 , Deep Purple went into Pye Studios at ATV House in London . There , with Lawrence producing and Barry Ainsworth acting as engineer , they recorded the recently gigged material using a four @-@ track tape machine . It was custom in those years , especially for debut bands , to have small production budgets , which allowed very limited time in the recording studio . Under these conditions it was difficult to do many overdubs and the songs were recorded live in one or two takes . " And the Address " and " Hey Joe " were cut first , followed by " Hush " and " Help ! " later the first day . On Sunday , " Love Help Me " , " I 'm So Glad " ( with a classical music prelude entitled " Happiness " ) and " Mandrake Root " were recorded . Finally , on Monday , 13 May , " One More Rainy Day " was cut , completing the recording of the album . Sound effects extracted from a BBC album were added as transitions between songs during mixing , which was completed later the same day . 
 = = Release = = 
 The finished album was taken to Tetragrammaton 's representatives in London , who approved its release . After the final approval , the band members were dressed in fashionable costumes at the Mr. Fish Emporium , where they did a photo @-@ shoot . The resulting shots were shipped with the master tapes to America where Tetragrammaton began production and distribution of the album . The cover design by Les <unk> allegedly cost half million dollars . 
 The single " Hush " was released overseas in June 1968 and it turned out to be a huge success , garnering the band considerable attention and peaking at No. 4 on the US charts and at No. 2 on the Canadian charts . The label 's reluctance to release " Help ! " as the promotional single and instead go for " Hush " , proved ingenious . Widely distributed and hyped , the song was played on radios all over the US , particularly the West Coast , and the band 's fame grew considerably . The album was released in the United States in July 1968 and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Pop Chart . 
 " Hush " was released in the UK in late July , but it did not attract much interest . In August , an appearance on British TV at the David Frost Show to lip @-@ sync the song was shot with the roadie Mick Angus standing in for an unavailable Blackmore . However , their presence on TV did not help the sales of the single in the UK and made Parlophone postpone the release of the album . 
 The band recorded some radio sessions for the John Peel 's Top Gear radio show on BBC , but otherwise , England in general was not their priority . Those recordings recently resurfaced and are included in the compilation album BBC Sessions 1968 – 1970 . Shades of Deep Purple was finally released in the United Kingdom with much simpler cover art in September 1968 and went almost unnoticed there . Jon Lord , in an interview with the magazine Beat Instrumental , reflected on the scarce receptivity of England to his group and on how lucky the band was to be signed to an American label that gave Deep Purple " far greater freedom both financially and artistically " than they " could ever have got with a British company " , which " as a rule won 't spend any time or effort with you until you 're an established name " . 
 A monaural pressing of the album was released in the UK and Europe , which was simply a fold @-@ down of the stereo mix . 
 Shades of Deep Purple was reissued many times all over the world , often in a set with the two following albums recorded by the Mk . I line @-@ up . Besides the original issues , the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition released in 2000 by EMI , which contains as bonus tracks previously unreleased recordings from the first demos in April 1968 and from TV show appearances . All the songs were digitally remastered and restored by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London , cutting off the sound effects used as transitions in the original edition . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Deep Purple 's members were experienced musicians with different musical backgrounds : Lord had trained in classical music and had played in jazz and blues rock ensembles , Blackmore and Simper came from session work in pop rock , Paice and Evans from beat bands . However , no one was an accomplished songwriter . The only one with experience in musical composition was Lord , who treated the arrangements and wrote the bulk of the music for the first album , with some guitar riffs added by Blackmore . The album shows the potential of the band but does not focus on a distinct sound . Clearly identifiable on the album are the musical styles which were developing in the UK in that period and that influenced the young musicians in Deep Purple , a mix of psychedelic rock , progressive rock , pop rock and hard rock , the latter mostly evident in Blackmore 's guitar parts . 
 Traces of the heavy sound that would mark the production of Deep Purple 's " Mk . II " line @-@ up ( when Evans and Simper were replaced by Gillan and Roger Glover ) can already be heard in the opening instrumental " And the Address " and in " Mandrake Root " . The main riff of the latter is very similar to the one in the song " Foxy Lady " , a testimony of Blackmore 's admiration for Jimi Hendrix . The other original compositions , the ballad " One More Rainy Day " and " Love Help Me " , are pop rock songs that enhance the commercial appeal of the album , but are considered by critics less interesting than the cover songs . 
 The use of so many cover songs to fill up the album was a common feature at the time , because of the short time given to bands for songwriting and for the rushed schedules of production . The songs covered in the album were all treated with new arrangements to be considerably longer and sound more grandiose than the originals , in an attempt to emulate the American rock band Vanilla Fudge , which many Deep Purple members admired . " Hush " and " Help ! " are clear examples of the " Vanilla Fudge style of slowing a song down and <unk> it up " to get a more psychedelic sound . The sound of the band was also heavily influenced by classical music : " I 'm So Glad " is introduced by " Prelude : Happiness " , featuring an electric arrangement inspired by the first movement of Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov 's symphonic suite Scheherazade ; the cover of " Hey Joe " was arranged inserting parts taken from the Miller 's Dance , suite no . 2 , part 2 of El sombrero de tres <unk> ballet by Manuel de Falla , on a rhythm reminiscent of the Boléro by Maurice Ravel . 
 = = Touring = = 
 Deep Purple 's live shows were from the start very loud and hard rocking and their stage set included stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses . The dualism between Blackmore 's flamboyant guitar playing , which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch , and Lord 's rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage , but it would soon become an integral part of the band 's dynamics . 
 Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968 , opening for The Byrds , before The Gun and The Deviants . Their performance was badly received by the audience and by other attending musicians , including Mick Jagger . In spite of this , the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals , but were received coldly and ignored by the press . In an interview with Melody Maker , Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England was due to the low wages they were offered and to the fact that they had very few danceable numbers to attract audience . He stressed that " we make a point of warning promoters that we are not a dancing group . " 
 Waiting to start their first US tour and in need of new material to be offered on the American market and to beef up their live show , the band returned in studio with producer Derek Lawrence to record their second album , The Book of Taliesyn in August 1968 . The new album was recorded before the release of Shades of Deep Purple in the UK . 
 By October , Deep Purple set off to the States to start their US tour . The success of " Hush " was a giant boost in America and from their first gigs they received all the attention they had not been given in England . The first dates were at The Inglewood Forum on 18 and 19 October 1968 , supporting Cream in their farewell tour . A recording of those live performances was released in 2002 with the title Inglewood – Live in California . The band played at many different locations , including festivals , bars and even at the Playboy After Dark TV show , alongside Hugh Hefner and a bunch of dancing women . 
 The songs of this album were performed regularly by the Mk . I formation of Deep Purple , but only " Hush " , " Help ! " and " Hey Joe " found space for a limited time in the live shows of the Mk . II line @-@ up in 1969 . On the contrary , " Mandrake Root " , in an expanded and mainly instrumental version , was a staple in Mk . II live shows up until 1972 , and the instrumental sections of the song survived even longer , being annexed to live versions of the Machine Head recording " Space Truckin ' " . The opening chords of " And the Address " were used into the Mk . II era as an introduction to the song " Speed King " . " Hush " was re @-@ recorded in 1988 and is still an integral part of the live set of the current formation of the band . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Reception of the album and the band in their home country was generally negative . Despite being presented as a " polished commercial group " in their radio appearances , Deep Purple 's stage excesses and success in the US did not make a good impression on British audiences . The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple 's music as " a slow and pompous din , somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B @-@ 52 taking off on a bombing run . " They were also criticised for being too American and the " poor man 's Vanilla Fudge " . As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled , " they were so out of place that you really felt sorry for them . " 
 By contrast , in the US the band was often introduced as " the English Vanilla Fudge " and massive radio coverage of their songs granted success for both the album and tour . Ian Paice had this to say about success in the US versus the lack of it back home : 
 We have been given proper exposure over there . The Americans really know how to push records . 
 Decades later , modern critical reviews of the album are generally positive . Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers Shades of Deep Purple , despite some flaws , " a hell of an album " and praises the " infectious ( ... ) spirit of fun " of the disc , which has " much more of a ' 60s feel than we 're accustomed to hearing from this band " . Blogcritics contributor David Bowling states that Shades of Deep Purple " was a creative and very good debut album " , which combines " psychedelic music with hard rock and early progressive rock into a pleasant but disjointed whole . " PopMatters review of the three albums of the Mk . I line @-@ up considers them " both respectable and consistent " , although Evans ' voice is " perhaps more suited to heavy pop rather than heavy rock " . 
 In an Observer Music Monthly Greatest British Albums poll , keyboard player Rick Wakeman chose Shades of Deep Purple as his favourite British record of all time .

 = Dalj massacre = 
 The Dalj massacre was the killing of 56 or 57 Croats in Dalj , Croatia on 1 August 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence . In addition to civilian victims , the figure includes 20 Croatian policemen , 15 Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) troops and four civil defencemen who had been defending the police station and water supply building in the village . While some of the policemen and the ZNG troops died in combat , those who surrendered were killed after they became prisoners of war . They tried to fight off an attack by the Croatian Serb SAO Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Syrmia ( SAO SBWS ) Territorial Defence Forces , supported by the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) and the Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitaries . The SAO SBWS was declared an autonomous territory in eastern Croatia following the Battle of Borovo Selo just to the south of Dalj . 
 After the attack , the non @-@ Serb civilian population in the village and the surrounding area was persecuted . They were forced to flee their homes , as they would have been imprisoned , physically abused or killed if they did not . After the war , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) charged high @-@ ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials , including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić , with war crimes committed in Dalj . The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public opinion in support of Croatia . By the end of 1991 , Germany adopted support for diplomatic recognition of Croatia as its policy and duty .

 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions in the republic worsened . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to <unk> the possibility of resistance following the elections . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman 's policy of pursuing independence for Croatia . Milan Babić , a dentist from the southern town of Knin , was elected president . Knin 's police chief , Milan Martić , established paramilitary militias . The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina , a self @-@ declared state incorporating the Serb @-@ inhabited areas of Croatia . In March 1991 , the SAO Krajina authorities backed by the Serbian government started to consolidate control over Serb @-@ populated areas of Croatia . The move resulted in a bloodless skirmish in Pakrac and the first fatalities in the Plitvice Lakes incident . By early May , the conflict also escalated in the region of eastern Slavonia , culminating in the Battle of Borovo Selo , just to the south of the village of Dalj . On 25 – 26 June , Croatian Serbs in the eastern Slavonia established the SAO Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Syrmia ( SAO SBWS ) , declaring it an autonomous political entity . 
 In the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army and in an effort to bolster its defence , it doubled the number of police personnel to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police deployed in twelve battalions adopting military organisation . In addition there were 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police . The reserve police was set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons . By July , the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) was established , absorbing a part of the special police force reorganised into four professional brigades , and police reserve force of 40 @,@ 000 ZNG troops . The reserve units did not possess sufficient heavy or small arms to arm all of their personnel . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 The general area of the villages of Dalj , Erdut and Aljmaš was targeted by an artillery bombardment between 3 : 00 a.m. and 4 : 30 a.m. on 1 August 1991 . Croatian sources indicate that the artillery fire was coming from units assigned to the JNA 51st Mechanised Brigade deployed on the left bank of the Danube River , on the territory of Serbia , as well as the Croatian Serb TO . The JNA report on the events prepared for Croatian authorities denies that the JNA artillery took part in the bombardment , and indicates a somewhat later time of the initial fighting , placing it at 4 : 10 a.m. Witness testimony given at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) trial of Slobodan Milošević supports the timeline placing the initial combat at 3 : 00 a.m. 
 After the artillery fire ceased , the Croatian Serb TO , supported by the Serb Volunteer Guard ( SVG ) led by Željko Ražnatović , began an infantry assault of Dalj , organised in three groups , from its base in Borovo Selo . One of the groups attacked the police station in Dalj , the second assaulted ZNG positions around water supply building in the village , while the third group remained in reserve . The heaviest fighting took place around the Dalj police station defended by the Croatian police and ZNG personnel . At 6 : 20 a.m. , the Croatian police requested assistance from Osijek police administration and the JNA in terminating the TO attack , citing considerable casualties . The JNA decided to intervene and was ordered to Dalj at 6 : 50 a.m. The JNA reported receiving gunfire from the ZNG 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade in Erdut as it moved towards 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 miles ) of road between Bogojevo and Dalj and returning fire before proceeding to Dalj . Conversely , the ICTY witness of the event claimed the JNA fired against civilian homes in Erdut unprovoked . The JNA units reached the Dalj police station at 9 : 30 a.m. 
 JNA and Croatian sources disagree on events immediately following arrival of the JNA in Dalj . While the JNA claimed it requested a cessation of the fire only to be refused by the defenders of the police station , Croatian sources claim the JNA demanded the unconditional surrender of the police and the ZNG , and were refused by the Croatian force . Both versions agree that the combat resumed until approximately 10 a.m. , when three tank main gun rounds , fired by the JNA , hit the police station . While the JNA reported there were no Croatian policemen or ZNG troops captured alive , contradicting its own report stating that the Croatian force located outside the police station accepted cessation of hostilities , the Croatian sources claim that those who surrendered were killed after their capture . Overall , 39 were killed in the fighting for the police station in Dalj — 20 policemen , 15 ZNG troops and four civil defencemen . 
 The same day , several non @-@ Serb civilians were killed in Dalj . In a subsequent round of negotiations with Croatian authorities , the SAO SBWS representatives reported 56 or 57 Croats were killed in Dalj on 1 August . Twenty @-@ five bodies of the victims , including two civilians , were transferred to ZNG @-@ held Osijek . Post @-@ mortem examinations indicated some of the victims were beaten and then executed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Croat population felt intimidated and forced to leave Dalj , as the events of 1 August marked the beginning of a series of attacks against the Croat civilian population in ethnically mixed areas . The bulk of the refugees travelled to Aljmaš , and then were taken by boats and barges along the Drava River to Osijek . Persecution of the non @-@ Serb population of Dalj and other nearby villages started in the immediate aftermath of the attack . The persecution included beatings , arbitrary arrests and war rape . The TO units arrested a number of Croat civilians and imprisoned them in Dalj . On 21 September , eleven prisoners were killed by the TO personnel led by Ražnatović , and buried in a mass grave in the village of <unk> . A further 28 civilians held in Dalj detention facility were tortured and killed by the TO and Ražnatović on 4 October . The bodies of the victims were then dumped in the Danube River . At least 135 Croat and non @-@ Serb civilians were killed in this region by May 1992 . 
 After the JNA captured Vukovar , it transferred a large number of the inhabitants of the city to the detention facility in Dalj on 20 November . The transfer occurred on the basis of a request by Goran Hadžić , political leader of the SAO SBWS . Those suspected of involvement in the fighting were interrogated and tortured , and at least 35 were executed . 
 The SAO Krajina was renamed the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) on 19 December , and the SAO SBWS formally joined the RSK on 26 February 1992 . After the merger , Hadžić , who had been appointed president of the SAO SBWS on 25 September 1991 , assumed the role of the president of the RSK . The events of 1 August 1991 were extensively covered by German media at the time , leading to a public outcry over the massacre . Germany subsequently advocated quick recognition of Croatia , as a means to stop further violence . By late 1991 , Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its policy and duty , lobbying the European Economic Community ( EEC ) diplomats . On 19 December , the German government decided to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia as the first EEC member state to do so . 
 In 2013 , the Dalj police station was awarded the Order of Nikola Šubić Zrinski for heroism . A memorial to the 39 police officers , ZNG troops and civil defencemen killed in Dalj on 1 August 1991 was unveiled at the station on the 22nd anniversary of their death . On 26 November 2013 , a memorial to the killed civilians was completed in Dalj . 
 = = = War crimes charges by the ICTY = = = 
 Slobodan Milošević , President of Serbia in 1991 , and Hadžić were charged by the ICTY for war crimes , including ordering of the murder , extermination , deportation and torture of non @-@ Serbs in Dalj through the paramilitaries . Milošević died in 2006 , four years after his ICTY trial started , before a verdict was reached . As of December 2013 the trial of Hadžić is in progress at the ICTY since 2012 , and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 . 
 The ICTY also charged Jovica Stanišić , head of the State Security Service run by Serbia 's Ministry of Internal Affairs , and Franko Simatović , head of the Special Operations Unit of the State Security Service , with war crimes . The charges include complicity in the torture of a group of seven non @-@ Serb civilians , including two arrested in Dalj on 11 November 1991 . Five of those arrested were killed by the SVG paramilitaries in Erdut and buried in a mass grave in the village of <unk> . Stanišić and Simatović were charged with control and training of the SVG . The trial began in 2008 , and resulted in acquittal of the two by the ICTY trial chamber on 30 May 2013 . The ICTY prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the process is pending as of December 2013 . 
 In 2010 , the commanding officer of the JNA 51st Motorised Brigade , Enes <unk> , was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Dalj in August – December 1991 . <unk> is charged with the deaths of two policemen in the JNA attack on the Dalj police station , nine prisoners of war captured in Dalj , eleven captured in Vukovar , and 90 non @-@ Serb civilians . In May 2012 , Croatian authorities in Osijek started a trial of two Croatian Serbs charged with war crimes against Croatian civilians , including the gang rape of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old woman and forcing her parents and siblings to watch the rape . Both of them were convicted in September 2013 and sentenced to 12 years in prison . In 2013 , the Croatian Veterans ' Affairs Minister stated that Croatian authorities have filed 150 indictments for war crimes committed during the Dalj massacre and war crimes perpetrated in Dalj area during the war . 
 = Nablus = 
 Nablus ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> [ <unk> ] , Hebrew : <unk> <unk> , Biblical Shechem ISO 259 @-@ 3 <unk> , Greek : <unk> <unk> ) is a city in the northern West Bank , approximately 49 kilometers ( 30 mi ) north of Jerusalem , ( approximately 63 kilometers ( 39 mi ) by road ) , with a population of 126 @,@ 132 . Located in between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim , it is the capital of the Nablus Governorate and a Palestinian commercial and cultural center , containing the An @-@ Najah National University , one of the largest Palestinian institutions of higher learning , and the Palestinian stock @-@ exchange . 
 Founded by the Roman Emperor Vespasian in 72 CE as Flavia Neapolis , Nablus has been ruled by many empires over the course of its almost 2 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ long history . In the 5th and 6th centuries , conflict between the city 's Christian and Samaritan inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against Byzantine rule , before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community 's numbers in the city . In 636 , Neapolis , along with most of Palestine , came under the rule of the Islamic Arab Caliphate of Umar ibn al @-@ Khattab ; its name Arabicized to Nablus . In 1099 , the Crusaders took control of the city for less than a century , leaving its mixed Muslim , Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed . After Saladin 's Ayyubid forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187 , Islamic rule was reestablished , and continued under the Mamluk and Ottoman empires to follow . 
 Following its incorporation into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 , Nablus was designated capital of the Jabal Nablus ( " Mount Nablus " ) district . In 1657 , after a series of upheavals , a number of Arab clans from the northern and eastern Levant were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority , and loyalty from among these clans staved off challenges to the empire 's authority by rival regional leaders , like Zahir al @-@ Umar in the 18th century , and Muhammad Ali — who briefly ruled Nablus — in the 19th century . When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841 , Nablus prospered as a center of trade . 
 After the city was captured by British forces during World War I , Nablus was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922 . During the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , the city was captured and occupied by Transjordan , which subsequently annexed it unilaterally , until its occupation by Israel during the 1967 Six @-@ Day War . Today , the population is predominantly Muslim , with small Christian and Samaritan minorities . Since 1995 , the city has been governed by the Palestinian National Authority . In the Old City , there are a number of sites of archaeological significance , spanning the 1st to 15th centuries . Culturally , the city is known for its kanafeh , a popular sweet throughout the Middle East , and its soap industry . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Classical antiquity = = = 
 Flavia Neapolis ( " new city of the emperor Flavius " ) was founded in 72 CE by the Roman emperor Vespasian over an older Samaritan village , variously called <unk> ( " the passage " ) or <unk> . Located between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim , the new city lay 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) west of the Biblical city of Shechem which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the First Jewish @-@ Roman War . Holy places at the site of the city 's founding include Joseph 's Tomb and Jacob 's Well . Due to the city 's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs , Neapolis prospered , accumulating extensive territory , including the former Judean <unk> of <unk> . 
 Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow , the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists . In the 2nd century CE , Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7 @,@ 000 people . Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus , Artemis , Serapis , and <unk> . Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time . Justin Martyr who was born in the city c . 100 CE , came into contact with Platonism , but not with Christians there . The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198 – 9 CE . Having sided with Niger , who was defeated , the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus , who designated these to Sebastia instead . 
 In 244 CE , Philip the Arab transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named Julia Neapolis . It retained this status until the rule of <unk> Gallus in 251 CE . The Encyclopaedia Judaica speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century , with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE . It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE . The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE . As yet , there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis . 
 Conflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451 . By this time , Neapolis was within the Palaestina Prima province under the rule of the Byzantine Empire . The tension was a result of Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem , Juvenal , to his episcopal see . However , the conflict did not grow into civil strife . 
 As tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased , tensions between the Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically . In 484 , the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups , provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron 's sons and grandsons Eleazar , Ithamar and <unk> . Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis , killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop <unk> . <unk> then fled to Constantinople , requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks . As a result of the revolt , the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim . He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies , and confiscated their synagogue there . These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further . 
 Thus , the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor Anastasius I , reoccupying Mount Gerizim , which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa , Procopius . A third <unk> revolt which took place under the leadership of Julianus ben <unk> in 529 was perhaps the most violent . Neapolis ' bishop <unk> was murdered and the city 's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints . The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt , which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city . 
 = = = Early Islamic era = = = 
 Neapolis , along with most of Palestine , was conquered by the Muslims under Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid , a general of the Rashidun army of Umar ibn al @-@ Khattab , in 636 after the Battle of Yarmouk . The city 's name was retained in its Arabicized form , <unk> . The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of Islamic Arab rule under the Umayyad , Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties . Under Muslim rule , Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and Persians , Muslims , Samaritans , Christians and Jews . In the 10th century , the Arab geographer al @-@ Muqaddasi , described it as abundant of olive trees , with a large marketplace , a finely paved Great Mosque , houses built of stone , a stream running through the center of the city , and notable mills . He also noted that it was nicknamed " Little Damascus . " At the time , the linen produced in Nablus was well known throughout the Old World . 
 = = = Crusader period = = = 
 The city was captured by Crusaders in 1099 , under the command of Prince Tancred , and renamed Naples . Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem , they did not sack the city , presumably because of the large Christian population there . Nablus became part of the royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem . The Muslim , Eastern Orthodox Christian , and Samaritan populations remained in the city , and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city 's abundant resources . In 1120 , the Crusaders convened the Council of Nablus out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom . They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church . The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s . 
 During the second half of Crusader reign in Nablus , Muslim forces launched incursions to regain control of the city . In 1137 , Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus , killing many Christians and burning down the city 's churches . However , they were unsuccessful in retaking the city . Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161 , after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III . Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus , including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus , and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims . 
 = = = Ayyubid and Mamluk rule = = = 
 Crusader rule came to an end in 1187 , when the Ayyubids led by Saladin captured the city . According to a liturgical manuscript in Syriac , Latin Christians fled Nablus , but the original Eastern Orthodox Christian inhabitants remained . Syrian geographer Yaqut al @-@ Hamawi ( 1179 – 1229 ) , wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a " celebrated city in Filastin ( Palestine ) ... having wide lands and a fine district . " He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city . 
 After its recapture by the Muslims , the Great Mosque of Nablus , which had become a church under Crusader rule , was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids , who also built a mausoleum in the old city . In 1242 , the Great Mosque was burnt by the Templar Knights during a three @-@ day raid in which they killed 1 @,@ 000 people and took many women and children who were then sold in the slave markets of Acre . The Samaritan synagogue , built in 362 CE by the high priest <unk> and converted into a church by the Crusaders , was converted into al @-@ Khadra Mosque in 1244 ; and two other Crusader churches became the An @-@ Nasr Mosque and al @-@ <unk> Mosque during that century . 
 The Mamluk dynasty gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign , they built numerous mosques and schools . Under Mamluk rule , Nablus possessed running water , many Turkish bathes and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt , Syria , the Hejaz , several Mediterranean islands , and the Arabian Desert . The city 's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus . Ibn Battuta , the Arab explorer , visited Nablus in 1355 , and described it as a city " full of trees and streams and full of olives . " He noted that the city grew and exported carob jam to Cairo and Damascus . 
 = = = Ottoman era = = = 
 Nablus came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517 , along with the whole of Palestine . The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaqs ( " districts " ) : Safad , Jenin , Jerusalem , Gaza , Ajlun and Nablus , all of which were part of Ottoman Syria . These five sanjaqs were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus . <unk> Nablus was further subdivided into five nahiya ( subdistricts ) , in addition to the city itself . The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families . Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus , and its relations with the surrounding villages , such as <unk> and <unk> , were partially mediated by the rural @-@ based chiefs of the nahiya . During the 16th century , the population was predominantly Muslim , with Jewish , Samaritan and Christian minorities . 
 After decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East , the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab <unk> . In 1657 , they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland , as part of a broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time . In return for their services , the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus . The Ottomans , fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power , dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans . Contrary to its centralization purpose , the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus . The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area , namely the ulama and merchant families . Without abandoning their nominal military service , they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories , bathhouses , agricultural lands , grain mills and , olive and sesame oil presses . 
 The most influential military family were the Nimrs , who were originally local governors of Homs and Hama 's rural subdistricts . Other officer families included the <unk> , <unk> , Bayram , <unk> , <unk> , Mir 'i , Shafi , Sultan and Tamimi families , some of which remained in active service , while some left service for other pursuits . In the years following the 1657 campaign , two other families migrated to Nablus : the Jarrars from Balqa and the Tuqans from northern Syria or Transjordan . The Jarrars came to dominate the hinterland of Nablus , while the Tuqans and Nimrs competed for influence in the town . The former held the post of mutasallim ( tax collector , strongman ) of Nablus longer , though non @-@ consecutively , than any other family . The three families maintained their power until the mid @-@ 19th century . 
 In the mid @-@ 18th century , Zahir al @-@ Umar , the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine . In order to build up his army , he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant , including Jabal Nablus , which was a major producer of both crops . In 1771 , during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria , Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus , but did not succeed in taking the city . In 1773 , he tried again without success . Nevertheless , from a political perspective , the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre . Zahir 's successor , <unk> Pasha , maintained Acre 's dominance over Nablus . After his reign ended in 1804 , Nablus regained its autonomy , and the Tuqans , who represented a principal opposing force , rose to power . 
 = = = Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival = = = 
 In 1831 @-@ 32 Khedivate Egypt , then led by Muhammad Ali , conquered Palestine from the Ottomans . A policy of conscription and new taxation was instituted which led to a revolt organized by the a 'ayan ( notables ) of Nablus , Hebron and the Jerusalem @-@ Jaffa area . In May 1834 , Qasim al @-@ Ahmad — the chief of the Jamma 'in nahiya — rallied the rural sheikhs and fellahin ( peasants ) of Jabal Nablus and launched a revolt against Governor Ibrahim Pasha , in protest at conscription orders , among other new policies . The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem , the center of government authority in Palestine , aided by the Abu Ghosh clan , and they conquered the city on 31 May . However , they were later defeated by Ibrahim Pasha 's forces the next month . Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Jabal Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages . By the end of August , the countrywide revolt had been suppressed and Qasim was executed . 
 Egyptian rule in Palestine resulted in the destruction of Acre and thus , the political importance of Nablus was further elevated . The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840 – 41 . However , the Arraba @-@ based Abd al @-@ Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha , continued its political dominance in Jabal Nablus . 
 Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries , Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria . Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of Jerusalem and the coastal cities of Jaffa and Acre . Olive oil was the primary product of Nablus and fueled other related industries such as soap @-@ making and basket weaving . It was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant , topping the production of northern cities such as Damascus . Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of autonomy than other sanjaqs under Ottoman control , probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region , in which there were no " foreigners " who held any military or bureaucratic posts . Thus , Nablus remained outside the direct " supervision " of the Ottoman government , according to historian <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Twentieth century = = = 
 Between 19 September and 25 September 1918 , in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place , together with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo . Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire 's XX Corps and airforce attacked the Ottoman Empire 's Yildirim Army Group 's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus , and which the Eighth Army had attempted to retreat to , in vain . 
 The 1927 Jericho earthquake destroyed many of the Nablus ' historic buildings , including the An @-@ Nasr Mosque . Though they were subsequently rebuilt by Haj Amin al @-@ Husayni 's Supreme Muslim Council in the mid @-@ 1930s , their previous " picturesque " character was lost . During British rule , Nablus emerged as a site of local resistance and the Old City quarter of Qaryun was demolished by the British during the 1936 – 1939 Arab revolt in Palestine . Jewish immigration did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus , and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the United Nations General Assembly 's 1947 partition plan for Palestine . 
 During the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War , Nablus came under Jordanian control . Thousands of Palestinian refugees fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus , settling in refugee camps in and around the city . Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city 's resources . Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al @-@ Ma ' , Balata and Askar . During the Jordanian period , the adjacent villages of Rafidia , Balata al @-@ Balad , al @-@ <unk> and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality . The 1967 Six @-@ Day War ended in the Israeli capture of Nablus . Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s . The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back @-@ to @-@ the @-@ land movement to secure self @-@ sufficiency , and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production . 
 = = = Palestinian control = = = 
 Jurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on December 12 , 1995 , as a result of the Oslo Accords Interim Agreement on the West Bank . Nablus is surrounded by Israeli settlements and was site of regular clashes with the IDF during the First Intifada when the local prison was known for torture . In the 1990s , Nablus was a hub of Palestinian nationalist activity in the West Bank and when the Second Intifada began , arsonists of Jewish shrines in Nablus were applauded . After the Danish cartoons was published in 2006 , militias kidnapped two foreigners and threatened to kidnap more as a protest . In 2008 , Noa Meir , an Israeli military spokeswoman , said Nablus remains " capital of terror " of the West Bank . 
 From the start of the Second Intifada , Nablus became a flash @-@ point of clashes between the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) and Palestinians . The city has a tradition of political activism , as evinced by its nickname , <unk> al @-@ nar ( Fire Mountain ) , and , located between two mountains , was closed off at both ends of the valley by Israeli checkpoints . For several years , movements in and out of the city were highly restricted . The city and the refugee camps of Balata and Askar constituted the center of " <unk> " for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank . 
 According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , 522 residents of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps , including civilians , were killed and 3 @,@ 104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005 . In April 2002 , following the Passover massacre — an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya — Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield , a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin . At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged . 
 The operation also resulted in severe damage to the historic core of the city , with 64 heritage buildings being heavily damaged or destroyed . IDF forces reentered Nablus during Operation Determined Path in June 2002 , remaining inside the city until the end of September . Over those three months , there had been more than 70 days of full 24 @-@ hour curfews . According to Gush Shalom , IDF bulldozers damaged the al @-@ Khadra Mosque , the Great Mosque , the al @-@ <unk> Mosque and the Greek Orthodox Church in 2002 . Some 60 houses were destroyed , and parts of the stone @-@ paving in the old city were damaged . The al @-@ Shifa hammam was hit by three rockets from Apache helicopters . The eastern entrance of the Khan al @-@ <unk> ( old market ) and three soap factories were destroyed in F @-@ 16 bombings . The cost of the damage was estimated at $ 80 million US .

 Nablus lies in a strategic position at a junction between two ancient commercial roads ; one linking the Sharon coastal plain to the Jordan valley , the other linking Nablus to the Galilee in the north , and the biblical Judea to the south through the mountains . The city stands at an elevation of around 550 meters ( 1 @,@ 800 ft ) above sea level , in a narrow valley running roughly east @-@ west between two mountains : Mount Ebal , the northern mountain , is the taller peak at 940 meters ( 3 @,@ 080 ft ) , while Mount Gerizim , the southern mountain , is 881 meters ( 2 @,@ 890 ft ) high . 
 Nablus is located 42 kilometers ( 26 mi ) east of Tel Aviv , Israel , 110 kilometers ( 68 mi ) west of Amman , Jordan and 63 kilometers ( 39 mi ) north of Jerusalem . Nearby cities and towns include <unk> and <unk> to the south , Beit <unk> to the southeast , Tammun to the northeast , <unk> ash @-@ <unk> to the north and Kafr <unk> and Tell to the west .

 In the center of Nablus lies the old city , composed of six major quarters : Yasmina , Gharb , Qaryun , Aqaba , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods : al @-@ Arda and Tal al @-@ <unk> . The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs , Tuqans , and Abd al @-@ <unk> . The large fortress @-@ like compound of the Abd al @-@ Hadi Palace built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun . The Nimr Hall and the Tuqan Palace are located in the center of the old city . There are several mosques in the Old City : The Great Mosque of Nablus , An @-@ Nasr Mosque , al @-@ Tina Mosque , al @-@ Khadra Mosque , Hanbali Mosque , al @-@ <unk> Mosque , <unk> Mosque and others 
 There are six <unk> ( Turkish baths ) in the Old City , the most prominent of them being al @-@ Shifa and al @-@ Hana . Al @-@ Shifa <unk> was built by the Tuqans in 1624 . Al @-@ Hana in Yasmina , was the last <unk> built in the city in the 19th century . It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994 . Several leather tanneries , souks , pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets .

 In 891 AD , during the early centuries of Islamic rule , Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans , local Muslims and Christians . Arab geographer Al @-@ Dimashqi , recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty ( Muslim Dynasty based in Egypt ) , local Muslims , Samaritans , Orthodox Christians , Catholics and Jews populated the city . At the 1931 census , the population was counted as 16 @,@ 483 Muslims , 533 Christians , 6 Jews , 7 <unk> and 160 Samaritans . However , this census was taken after the 1929 Palestine riots which drove the Jews out of many majority @-@ Arab cities . 
 The majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim , but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well . Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam . Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – <unk> , Yaish , and <unk> among others . According to the historian Fayyad <unk> , large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it . 
 In 1967 , there were about 3 @,@ 500 Christians of various denominations in Nablus , but that figure dwindled to about 650 in 2008 . Of the Christian populace , there are seventy Orthodox Christian families , about thirty Catholic ( Roman Catholic & Eastern Melkite Catholic ) families and thirty Anglican families . Most Christians used to live in the suburb of Rafidia in the western part of the city . 
 There are seventeen Islamic monuments and eleven mosques in the Old City . Nine of the mosques were established before the 15th century . In addition to Muslim houses of worship , Nablus contains an Orthodox church dedicated Saint Justin Martyr , built in 1898 and the ancient Samaritan synagogue , which is still in use .

 Beginning in the early 16th century , trade networks connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to the south and east , as well as in the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus . Nablus also developed trade relations with Aleppo , Mosul , and Baghdad . 
 The Ottoman government ensured adequate safety and funding for the annual pilgrimage caravan ( <unk> al @-@ hajj ) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina . This policy benefited Nablus economically . Pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government . For a brief period in the early 17th century , the governor of Nablus , Farrukh Pasha , was appointed leader of the pilgrimage caravan ( amir al @-@ hajj ) , and he <unk> a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose . 
 In 1882 , there were 32 soap factories and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East . Nablus exported three @-@ fourths of its soap — the city 's most important commodity — to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula , and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza . From Egypt , and particularly from Cairo and Damietta , Nablus merchants imported mainly rice , sugar , and spices , as well as linen , cotton , and wool textiles . Cotton , soap , olive oil , and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus , whence silks , high @-@ quality textiles , copper , and a number luxury items , such as jewellery were imported . 
 With regard to the local economy , agriculture was the major component . Outside of the city limits , there were extensive fields of olive groves , fig and pomegranate orchards and grape vineyards that covered the area 's slopes . Crops , such as tomatoes , cucumbers , melons and <unk> were grown in the fields , vegetable gardens , and grain mills scattered across central Samaria . Nablus was also the largest producer of cotton in the Levant , producing over 225 @,@ 000 kg ( 496 @,@ 040 lb ) of the product by 1837 .

 Nablus has a bustling modern commercial center with restaurants , and a shopping mall . Traditional industries continue to operate in Nablus , such as the production of soap , olive oil , and handicrafts . Other industries include furniture production , tile production , stone quarrying , textile manufacturing and leather tanning . The city is also a regional trading center for live produce . Most of these industries are centered in the old city . 
 The Vegetable Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus factory that produces refined vegetable oils , especially olive oil , and vegetable butter from the factory is exported to Jordan . The al @-@ Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus . In 2000 , the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily ; however , production plummeted to 150 – 200 pieces daily in 2002 . Al @-@ Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel . There are eight restaurants in the city and four hotels — the largest being al @-@ Qasr and al @-@ Yasmeen . Nablus ' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions . Today , there are only two soap factories still operating in the city . 
 The Al @-@ <unk> ice @-@ cream company is the largest of six ice @-@ cream manufacturers in the Palestinian territories . The Nablus business developed from an ice @-@ factory set up by Mohammad <unk> in the town centre in 1950 . It produces 50 tons a day , and exports to Jordan and Iraq . Most of the ingredients are imported from Israel . 
 Before 2000 , 13 @.@ 4 % of Nablus ' residents worked in Israel , with the figure dropping to 4 @.@ 7 % in 2004 . The city 's manufacturing sector made up 15 @.@ 7 % of the economy in 2004 , a drop from 21 % in 2000 . Since 2000 , most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade . In the wake of the Intifada , unemployment rates rose from 14 @.@ 2 % in 1997 to 60 % in 2004 . According to an OCHA report in 2008 , one of the reasons for the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city , leading to the relocation of many businesses . 
 Since the removal of the Hawara roadblock , the <unk> has become a vibrant marketplace . Nablus is home to the Palestine Securities Exchange ( PSE ) and the al @-@ Quds Financial Index , housed in the al @-@ Qasr building in the Rafidia suburb of the city .

 Nablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics . Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk ( " market " ) , in late 19th century , there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city , from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos . Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee , both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ( " robe " ) . For daily wear , <unk> were often made of white cotton or linen , with a preference for winged sleeves .

 Nablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes , fostering the development of a culture of " high cuisine " , such as that of Damascus or Baghdad . The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant , the Arab world and the former provinces of the Ottoman Empire . 
 Kanafeh is the most famed Nabulsi sweet . Originating in Nablus during the 15th century , by 1575 , its recipe was exported throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time . Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey @-@ sweetened cheese in the center . The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios . Though it is now made throughout the Middle East , to the present day , kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame , partly due to its use of a white @-@ brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi . Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh . 
 Other sweets made in Nablus include baklawa , " <unk> " , <unk> and <unk> , a plain pastry made of butter , flour and sugar in an " S " -shape , or shaped as fingers or bracelets .

 Nabulsi soap or <unk> <unk> is a type of <unk> soap produced only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients : virgin olive oil , water , and a sodium compound . Since the 10th century , Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product , and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe . Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today , efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue .

Prior to the 1860s , in the summertime , the barilla would be placed in towering stacks , burned , and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks , and transported to Nablus from the area of modern @-@ day Jordan in large caravans . In the city , the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural alkaline soda powder called qilw . Today , qilw is still used in combination with lime .

 The city of Nablus is the muhfaza ( seat ) of the Nablus Governorate , and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members , including the mayor . 
 The two primary political parties in the municipal council are Hamas and Fatah .

 Yaish 's four @-@ year term legally expired in December 2009 . While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010 , they were canceled due to Fatah 's lack of agreement on list of candidates . Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists : one headed by former mayor Ghassan Shakaa and one headed by Amin <unk> . 
 In the October 2012 municipal elections , Hamas boycotted the polls , protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill . Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa , a former local Fatah leader , won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin <unk> and another independent candidate .

 In the early 20th century , Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway 's Afula station , itself a spur from the Hejaz railway . The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911 – 12 . During the beginning of the British Mandate , one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin . The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , and the route of the line bisected by the Green Line . 
 The main Beersheba – Nazareth road running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus , although thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted . The city was connected to Tulkarm , <unk> and Jenin by roads which are now blocked by the Israeli West Bank barrier . From 2000 until 2011 , Israel maintained checkpoints such as <unk> checkpoint which effectively cut off the city , severely curtailing social and economic travel . From January 2002 , buses , taxis , trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus . Since 2011 , there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the <unk> of some checkpoints . 
 The nearest airport is the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod , Israel , but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel , and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas , many residents must travel to Amman , Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport , which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border .

 = HMAS Melbourne ( R21 ) = 
 HMAS Melbourne ( R21 ) was a Majestic @-@ class light aircraft carrier of the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) . Operating from 1955 until 1982 , she was the third and final conventional aircraft carrier to serve in the RAN . Melbourne was the only British Commonwealth naval vessel to sink two friendly warships in peacetime collisions . 
 The ship was laid down for the Royal Navy as the lead ship of the Majestic class in April 1943 , and was launched as HMS Majestic ( <unk> ) in February 1945 . At the end of World War II , work on the ship was suspended until she was purchased by the RAN in 1947 . At the time of purchase , it was decided to incorporate new aircraft carrier technologies into the design , making Melbourne the third ship to be constructed with an angled flight deck . Delays in construction and integrating the enhancements meant that the carrier was not commissioned until 1955 . 
 Melbourne never fired a shot in anger during her career , having only peripheral , non @-@ combat roles in relation to the Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation and the Vietnam War . She was , however , involved in two major collisions with allied vessels . The first occurred on the evening of 10 February 1964 , in which Melbourne rammed and sank the RAN destroyer HMAS Voyager when the latter altered course across her bow . 82 of Voyager 's personnel were killed , and two Royal Commissions were held to investigate the incident . The second occurred in the early morning of 3 June 1969 , when Melbourne also rammed and sank the United States Navy ( USN ) destroyer USS Frank E. Evans in similar circumstances . 74 American personnel died , and a joint USN – RAN Board of Inquiry was held . These incidents , along with several minor collisions , shipboard accidents , and aircraft losses , led to the reputation that Melbourne was jinxed . 
 Melbourne was paid off from RAN service in 1982 . A proposal to convert her for use as a floating casino failed , and a 1984 sale was cancelled , before she was sold for scrap in 1985 and towed to China for breaking . The scrapping was delayed so Melbourne could be studied by the People 's Liberation Army Navy ( PLAN ) as part of a secret project to develop a Chinese aircraft carrier and used to train PLAN aviators in carrier flight operations . 
 = = Construction and acquisition = = 
 Melbourne was constructed by Vickers @-@ Armstrongs at their Naval Construction Yard in Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , England . The ship was laid down as HMS Majestic on 15 April 1943 , and was launched on 28 February 1945 by Lady Anderson , the wife of Sir John Anderson , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer . Following the end of World War II , the Admiralty ordered the suspension of many British shipbuilding projects , including the fitting out of Majestic and her five sister ships . Construction resumed in 1946 , and major modifications to the design were incorporated . 
 A review by the Australian Government 's Defence Committee held after World War II recommended that the post @-@ war forces of the RAN be structured around a Task Force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers . Initial plans were for three carriers , with two active and a third in reserve , although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947 : Majestic and sister ship HMS Terrible , for the combined cost of AU £ 2 @.@ 75 million , plus stores , fuel , and ammunition . As Terrible was the closer of the two ships to completion , she was finished without modification , and was commissioned into the RAN on 16 December 1948 as HMAS Sydney . Work progressed on Majestic at a slower rate , as she was upgraded with the latest technology and equipment . The Colossus @-@ class carrier HMS Vengeance was loaned to the RAN from 13 November 1952 until 12 August 1955 to cover Majestic 's absence . 
 Labour difficulties , late delivery of equipment , additional requirements for Australian operations , and the prioritisation of merchant shipping over naval construction delayed the completion of Majestic . Incorporation of the new systems and enhancements caused the cost of the RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AU £ 8 @.@ 3 million . Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955 . As the carrier neared completion , a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return Vengeance to the United Kingdom . 
 The completed carrier was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Majestic on 26 October 1955 . Two days later , the ship was renamed Melbourne by Lady White , the wife of Sir Thomas White , the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom , and recommissioned . 
 = = Design = = 
 As the lead ship of the Majestic @-@ class of light aircraft carriers , Melbourne was conceived as a modified version of the Colossus @-@ class carrier , incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability . <unk> and Colossus @-@ class carriers were almost identical in hull design and both were considered subclasses of the ' 1942 design ' light aircraft carrier program . These carriers were intended as ' disposable warships ' : to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service . 
 Melbourne had a standard displacement of 15 @,@ 740 long tons ( 17 @,@ 630 short tons ) , which increased to 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 22 @,@ 000 short tons ) at full load . At launch , the carrier was 213 @.@ 97 metres ( 702 @.@ 0 ft ) long overall , but this was increased by 2 @.@ 43 metres ( 8 @.@ 0 ft ) during a refit in 1969 . She had a beam of 24 @.@ 38 metres ( 80 @.@ 0 ft ) , and a draught of 7 @.@ 62 metres ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . Melbourne 's two propellers were driven by two Parsons single @-@ reduction geared turbine sets providing 40 @,@ 000 shp , which were powered by four Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . The carrier could achieve a top speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) , and a range of 12 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 22 @,@ 000 km ; 14 @,@ 000 mi ) at 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) or 6 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . The size of the ship 's company averaged 1 @,@ 350 officers and sailors , including 350 personnel from the embarked Fleet Air Arm squadrons . 
 = = = Modifications during construction = = = 
 Following the recommencement of construction , modifications were made to the ship , based on wartime experience and Britain 's post @-@ war carrier warfare technology and innovations . These included an angled flight deck , steam catapult and a mirror landing aid , making Melbourne the third aircraft carrier ( following HMS Ark Royal and USS Forrestal ) to be constructed with these features , instead of having them added later . 
 The main modifications centred around the need to operate jet aircraft , which were larger and heavier than those that the carrier was originally designed for . The flight deck was angled 5 @.@ 5 degrees left of the carrier 's centreline , to allow for the simultaneous launch and recovery of aircraft . Despite an increase to approximately one acre ( 4 @,@ 000 square metres , 4 @,@ 800 square yards ) in area , the deck was still significantly smaller than other Cold War era carriers ; S @-@ 2 Trackers , with their 22 @.@ 12 @-@ metre ( 72 ft 7 in ) wingspan , had less than a metre 's clearance for their starboard wingtip when landing , and pilots from other navies often refused to attempt landing . Water rationing was required in the early years of the carrier 's operation , as the ship 's fresh water supply was insufficient to freely provide for the steam catapult , propulsion turbines and crew . The flight deck , hangar deck and aircraft lifts were strengthened , and reinforced arrestor cables were installed . Flight direction radar was included , making Melbourne the only military airfield in the Australasian region at the time capable of operating aircraft at night and in poor weather . 
 = = = Refits = = = 
 Early in her career , Melbourne underwent a series of short annual refits , commencing in September and ending in January or February of the next year . As time passed , the refits increased in duration or replaced by major upgrades or overhauls . 
 Melbourne 's first major refit started in December 1967 and continued until February 1969 , during which she was upgraded to operate S @-@ 2 Tracker and A @-@ 4 Skyhawk aircraft . The modifications cost A $ 8 @.@ 5 million , and included an overhaul of the hull and machinery , strengthening of the flight deck , improvements to the catapult and arrestor cables , modification of the aviation fuel systems and flight control arrangements , and upgrades of the navigational aids and radar . Air conditioning systems and a liquid oxygen generation plant were also installed . Melbourne re @-@ entered service at the conclusion of the refits on 14 February , and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May . This was the largest project undertaken by Garden Island Dockyard to that date . 
 The next major refit was required in 1971 for the scheduled rebuilding of the catapult , which was only possible after components were sourced from HMCS Bonaventure and USS Coral Sea . The flight deck was again reinforced and strengthened , and attempts were made to increase the effectiveness of the air conditioning system installed in 1969 . Melbourne had been designed to operate in North Atlantic and Arctic climates , and the original ventilation systems were inappropriate for her primary operating climate , the tropics . The 1969 and 1971 refits did improve conditions , although there was little scope for upgrade , and the system was still inadequate : temperatures inside the ship continued to reach over 65 ° C ( 149 ° F ) , and on one occasion a hold reached 78 ° C ( 172 ° F ) . The refit took seven months to complete , and cost A $ 2 million . 
 More large @-@ scale refits occurred throughout the rest of the 1970s . Melbourne was back in dock from November 1972 until August 1973 , with further work done to her catapult . The next major refit ran from April 1975 to June 1976 , and was intended to increase the operational lifespan of the carrier to at least 1985 . The refit was lengthened by industrial action at the dockyard . Melbourne underwent another refit from late 1978 until August 1979 . A refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed in September until a decision regarding the new carrier was made , then cancelled in January 1982 , after the announcement that the RAN would be acquiring HMS Invincible . 
 = = Armament = = 
 Melbourne carried a defensive armament of anti @-@ aircraft guns and an air group comprising both attack and anti @-@ submarine aircraft . As the ship was never directly involved in a conflict , her weapons and embarked aircraft did not fire a shot in anger . 
 = = = Weapons and systems = = = 
 Melbourne 's initial armament included 25 40 mm Bofors anti @-@ aircraft guns : six twin and thirteen single mountings . The radar suite consisted of three Type 277Q height @-@ finding sets , a Type 293Q surface search set , and a Type 978 navigational set . Between entering service and 1959 , four of the single Bofors were removed . 
 During the 1967 – 1969 refit , thirteen Bofors were removed , leaving four twin and four single mountings . The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs : a LW @-@ 02 air search set and a SPN @-@ 35 landing aid radar . A TACAN aerial and electronic countermeasures pods were also installed during this refit . The four Bofors twin mountings were removed in 1980 . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 Melbourne carried three Fleet Air Arm squadrons . Initially , she had up to 22 planes and 2 helicopters embarked at any time . The number of aircraft gradually increased until 1972 , when the air group peaked at 27 aircraft . Approximately 350 Fleet Air Arm personnel were stationed aboard the carrier . 
 Initially , two types of fixed @-@ wing aircraft were operated from <unk> de Havilland Sea Venom <unk> fighter aircraft were flown by 805 Squadron RAN and 808 Squadron RAN , while Fairey Gannet anti @-@ submarine strike aircraft were operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 817 Squadron RAN . At the time of their arrival , the Sea Venoms were the only radar equipped and all @-@ weather combat aircraft in the Southern Hemisphere . At Melbourne 's commissioning , the standard air group consisted of eight Sea Venoms and two squadrons of eight Gannets , with two Bristol Sycamore search @-@ and @-@ rescue helicopters added shortly after the carrier entered service . 
 These aircraft were due to become obsolete in the late 1950s , and the RAN considered purchasing modern aircraft of French or Italian design , which were better suited to light carrier operations than equivalent British aircraft , or replace Melbourne with a larger carrier . Instead of pursuing either alternative , the Australian government announced in 1959 that Melbourne would be reconfigured during her 1963 refit to operate as a helicopter carrier . The fixed @-@ wing aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm were marked for replacement by 27 Westland Wessex anti @-@ submarine helicopters . A reduction of embarked plane numbers to four Sea Venoms and six Gannets , along with regular rotation and careful use of the aircraft , extended their service life until the mid @-@ 1960s , while the size of the air group was maintained by carrying up to ten Wessex helicopters . The decision to retire the fixed @-@ wing component of the Fleet Air Arm was rescinded in 1963 , and on 10 November 1964 , a AU £ 212 million increase in defence spending included the purchase of new aircraft for Melbourne . 
 The RAN planned to acquire 14 Grumman S @-@ 2E Tracker anti @-@ submarine aircraft , and modernise Melbourne to operate the aircraft . The acquisition of 18 Douglas A @-@ 4 Skyhawk fighter @-@ bombers was also suggested , but these were dropped from the initial plan . A separate proposal to order 10 A @-@ 4G Skyhawks , a variant of the Skyhawk designed specifically for the RAN and optimised for air defence , was approved in 1965 . Both aircraft types entered RAN service in 1968 , with the Trackers operated by 816 Squadron RAN and 851 Squadron RAN , and the Skyhawks by 805 Squadron RAN and 724 Squadron RAN . The aircraft did not fly from Melbourne until the conclusion of her refit in 1969 . In 1969 , the RAN purchased another ten A @-@ 4G Skyhawks , instead of the proposed seventh and eighth Oberon @-@ class submarines . Melbourne operated a standard air group of four Skyhawks , six Trackers , and ten Wessex helicopters until 1972 , when the <unk> were replaced with ten Westland Sea King anti @-@ submarine warfare helicopters and the number of Skyhawks doubled . Although replaced by the Sea King , up to three Wessex helicopters could be carried as search @-@ and @-@ rescue aircraft . 
 On 5 December 1976 , a fire at the Naval Air Station HMAS Albatross destroyed or heavily damaged 12 of the Fleet Air Arm 's 13 S @-@ 2E Trackers . The carrier was sent to the United States in 1977 to transport back 16 S @-@ 2G Tracker aircraft as replacements . 
 Over the course of her career , over thirty aircraft were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne . The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side , but some losses were due to catapult or arrestor cable failures . After Melbourne was decommissioned , the Fleet Air Arm ceased fixed @-@ wing combat aircraft operation in 1984 , with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier . 
 = = Role = = 
 Melbourne was the third and final conventional aircraft carrier to operate with the RAN . Following the first decommissioning of sister ship HMAS Sydney in 1958 , Melbourne became the only aircraft carrier in Australian service . Melbourne was unavailable to provide air cover for the RAN for up to four months in every year ; this time was required for refits , refuelling , personnel leave , and non @-@ carrier duties , such as the transportation of troops or aircraft . Although one of the largest ships to serve in the RAN , Melbourne was one of the smallest carriers to operate in the post @-@ World War II period . A decision was made in 1959 to restrict Melbourne 's role to helicopter operations only , but was reversed shortly before its planned 1963 implementation . 
 As well as an operational aircraft carrier , Melbourne was Flagship of the RAN , a role she received almost immediately following her 1956 arrival in Australia , and fulfilled until her decommissioning in 1982 . During her service , the carrier was deployed overseas on 35 occasions , visited over 22 countries , and was seen as the physical and psychological centrepiece of the RAN fleet . 
 As Melbourne was the only ship of her size ( both in dimensions and ship 's company ) in the RAN , the carrier underwent a regular rotation of commanding officers to give them experience . Commanding officers were changed on average every fifteen months , with few remaining on board for more than two years . The majority of Melbourne 's commanders later reached flag rank . The carrier was also called on to perform underway replenishments and command and control functions .

 Following a working @-@ up period in British waters , Melbourne departed Glasgow on 11 March 1956 on her maiden voyage to Australia via the Suez Canal . Aboard were the 64 aircraft of RAN squadrons 808 , 816 , and 817 , as well as the racing yacht Samuel Pepys ( named after the English naval administrator and diarist ) , which was a gift to the RAN Sailing Association from the Royal Navy . The ship visited Gibraltar , Naples , Malta , Port Said , Aden , and Colombo , before arriving in Fremantle on 24 April 1956 . Melbourne sailed east via the Great Australian Bight , meeting sister ship HMAS Sydney near Kangaroo Island a week later . After visiting Melbourne and Jervis Bay , where the aircraft were offloaded and sent to Naval Air Station HMAS Albatross , the carrier concluded her maiden voyage in Sydney on 10 May . The role of flagship was transferred from Sydney to Melbourne three days later . The carrier immediately underwent a two and a half @-@ month refit , allowing for the inspection of machinery and repair of defects detected during the maiden voyage . Melbourne spent from September to November in Southeast Asian waters , during which she participated in Exercise Albatross and received an official visit by Philippines president Ramon Magsaysay . On return to Australia in mid @-@ November , the carrier visited Melbourne for the 1956 Olympics , where 200 of Melbourne 's complement were provided to work as signallers , event marshals , carpenters , and medical workers . 
 In February 1957 , Melbourne was sent to the Royal Hobart Regatta . Following this , she travelled to New Zealand , where she participated in exercises with HMNZS Royalist and visited several New Zealand ports . The first of several annual three @-@ month deployments to Southeast Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April , with Melbourne returning to Darwin at the end of June . The carrier spent the rest of the year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public . During the visit to Port Adelaide , on 28 October 1957 , Melbourne was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV Straat Lanka — the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career . Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off Lord Howe Island , with ships from the RAN , Royal Navy , and Royal New Zealand Navy , before returning to Sydney on 13 December . 
 From February until July 1958 , Melbourne was deployed on a 25 @,@ 000 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 46 @,@ 000 km ; 29 @,@ 000 mi ) flag @-@ showing cruise . During this cruise the carrier participated in four inter @-@ fleet exercises and visited Singapore , Hong Kong , the Philippines , Japan , Pearl Harbor and Fiji . On return to Sydney , Melbourne entered a short refit , which concluded on 13 October and was immediately followed by a visit to Port Phillip , where the carrier was displayed to Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force officer cadets before the carrier returned to Sydney . At the start of 1959 , Melbourne spent four days in her namesake city , where she was used for the filming of On The Beach , based on Nevil Shute 's post @-@ apocalyptic novel of the same name . After filming concluded , the carrier participated in a demonstration exercise off the coast of Sydney before embarking on a Far East Strategic Reserve deployment from March until May . The rest of the year was spent visiting Australian and New Zealand ports . 
 The following year , 1960 , was a bad year for the carrier 's air group , with four Sea Venoms and two Gannets damaged in separate incidents aboard Melbourne . All four Sea Venom incidents occurred in March , with three attributed to aircrew error and one to brake failure . The year began with exercises en route to Adelaide , followed by a visit to the Royal Hobart Regatta . The carrier 's Strategic Reserve deployment ran from April to June , and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September . In the lead up to Melbourne 's 1961 deployment to the Strategic Reserve , the carrier visited Bombay , Karachi , and Trincomalee . It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters . Melbourne returned to Australia in June , and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN . In August , Melbourne was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox , in the Coral Sea . Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox , the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities . 
 In 1962 , Melbourne began the year 's activities at the Royal Hobart Regatta , before sailing to her Strategic Reserve deployment , by way of Adelaide and Fremantle . After Strategic Reserve duties were completed , the carrier visited Japan , Guam , and Manus Island before returning to Sydney in late July . In September , Melbourne reprised her role as the leader of Exercise Tuckerbox II . The 10,000th catapult launch from Melbourne occurred in late 1962 . The carrier 's annual refit began in Sydney on 1 October . At the beginning of 1963 , Melbourne again visited to the Royal Hobart Regatta , which was immediately followed by a deployment to the Strategic Reserve , including involvement in SEATO Exercise Sea Serpent . The 20,000th landing on Melbourne was performed in April by a Gannet , and in September , Melbourne participated in Exercise Carbine near Hervey Bay , Queensland . 
 = = = Voyager collision = = = 
 On 10 February 1964 , Melbourne was performing trials in Jervis Bay under the command of Captain John Robertson , following the annual refit . The Daring @-@ class destroyer HMAS Voyager was also present , undergoing her own trials following refit , under the command of Captain Duncan Stevens . The trials involved interactions between both ships , and when Melbourne performed night @-@ flying exercises that evening , Voyager acted as the carrier 's plane guard escort . This required Voyager to maintain a position 20 ° off Melbourne 's port quarter at a distance from the carrier of 1 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 800 m ) . 
 Early in the evening , Voyager had no difficulties maintaining her position during the manoeuvres both ships performed . Following a series of turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8 : 40 pm , Voyager ended up to starboard of Melbourne . At 8 : 52 pm , Voyager was ordered to resume the plane guard station . The procedure to accomplish this required Voyager to turn away from Melbourne in a large circle , cross behind the carrier , then take position off Melbourne 's port side . Instead , Voyager first turned to starboard , away from Melbourne , then turned to port without warning . It was initially assumed by Melbourne 's bridge crew that Voyager was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind Melbourne , but Voyager did not alter course again . At 8 : 55 pm , with Voyager approaching , Melbourne 's navigator ordered the carrier 's engines to half astern speed , with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern a few seconds later . At the same time , Stevens , having just become aware of the situation , gave the order " Full ahead both engines . Hard @-@ a starboard . " , before instructing the destroyer 's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent . Both ships ' measures were too late to avoid a collision ; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8 : 56 pm . 
 Melbourne struck Voyager just aft of the destroyer 's bridge , rolling the destroyer to starboard before cutting her in half . Voyager 's forward boiler exploded , briefly setting fire to the bow of the carrier before it was extinguished by seawater . The destroyer 's forward section sank quickly , under the weight of the two 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) gun turrets . The aft section did not begin sinking until half an hour after the collision , completely submerging just after midnight . Messages were immediately sent to the Fleet Headquarters in Sydney , although staff in Sydney initially underestimated the extent of the damage to Voyager . Melbourne launched her boats to recover survivors , and the carrier 's wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties . At 9 : 58 pm , Melbourne was informed that search @-@ and @-@ rescue boats from HMAS Creswell , helicopters from HMAS Albatross , and five Ton @-@ class minesweepers had been despatched to assist in the search . 
 Melbourne arrived in Sydney with the survivors on 14 February , and after spending time alongside at Garden Island , was moved to Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March , where repairs were undertaken ; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship 's internal structure were undertaken in drydock , while a 40 ton prefabricated bow was constructed . Once this was completed , Melbourne was removed while the new bow was put in place in the drydock ; Melbourne was then returned to the drydock where her new bow was fitted . The work was eventually completed on 27 April , with the shipyard receiving a commendation . 
 Of the 314 personnel aboard Voyager at the time of the collision , 14 officers , 67 sailors , and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed , including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team . A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964 , and found that while Voyager was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship 's location , Melbourne 's bridge crew was also at fault , for failing to alert Voyager and not taking measures to avoid the collision . Robertson was posted to the training base HMAS Watson — a move that he and the Australian media saw as tantamount to a demotion — but resigned instead . The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled , and following pressure from the public , media , and politicians , combined with revelations by Voyager 's former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command , a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967 . This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident . The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions . Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident . 
 = = = 1964 – 1969 = = = 
 Melbourne spent ten weeks at Cockatoo Island Dockyard , having her new bow fitted . Following the repairs , Melbourne was involved in Strategic Reserve deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964 . During this deployment , the carrier visited Subic Bay , where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S @-@ 2 Tracker anti @-@ submarine aircraft and A @-@ 4 Skyhawk attack fighters . The success of the trials , along with the discovery that Melbourne was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification , led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft . 
 From March 1965 until mid @-@ 1967 , Melbourne underwent a regular pattern of deployments to Southeast Asia , exercises , and flag @-@ showing visits to nations in the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Several of the Southeast Asian deployments were related to the Indonesia – Malaysia confrontation , and involved participation in show of force exercises off the coast of Malaysia . During 1965 and 1966 , Melbourne escorted sister ship HMAS Sydney , which had been recommissioned as a troop transport , for short periods during the latter 's first , third , and fourth transport voyages to Vietnam . Despite the carrier being the centrepiece of several plans to involve Australian forces in the Vietnam War , the escort runs were the extent of Melbourne 's participation in the conflict , and the carrier remained outside the Market Time area while Sydney and her other escorts proceeded to Vũng Tàu . As the carrier was optimised for anti @-@ submarine warfare , there was little need for her at the start of the war . Utilising the carrier was suggested again by RAN officials in March 1966 , when the United States Seventh Fleet was having difficulties maintaining anti @-@ submarine patrols around Yankee Station , but Melbourne could only remain on station for a single , ten @-@ day period , a third of the time that US carriers were operational for on rotating deployments . Seventh Fleet staff suggested in April 1967 that Melbourne deploy in the anti @-@ submarine role , but nothing came of these talks . Consideration was also given to using Melbourne as a floating helicopter base , but only ten Wessex helicopters could be provided , and modifications were required for them to operate as troop carriers . Both options were made more prohibitive by the need to supply at least two escorts for the carrier at a time when the RAN was having difficulty meeting deployment commitments with the available destroyers and destroyer escorts . 
 In September 1967 , Melbourne travelled to the United States to collect new aircraft : 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks . To operate the new aircraft , the carrier received a major refit on her return to Sydney , which began in December 1967 . In May 1967 , it was proposed that while Melbourne was out of service , A @-@ 4 Skyhawk pilots and maintenance personnel could be attached to a United States Marine Corps Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam . Australian aircraft were not to be provided , as the A @-@ 4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence , not the fighter @-@ bomber role performed by the Marines , and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam 's heavy anti @-@ aircraft defences . This deployment did not occur ; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and replacement parts in priority to the RAN , and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups with the program , while also disrupting Melbourne 's post @-@ refit reactivation . Melbourne re @-@ entered service at the conclusion of the refit on 14 February 1969 . She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May , then sailed for Subic Bay , Philippines , to participate in SEATO Exercise Sea Spirit . 
 = = = Frank E. Evans collision = = = 
 Melbourne 's commanding officer during the SEATO exercise was Captain John Phillip Stevenson . Rear Admiral John Crabb , the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet , was also embarked on the carrier . During Sea Spirit , Melbourne was assigned five escorts : US Ships Everett F. Larson , Frank E. Evans , and James E. Kyes , HMNZS Blackpool , and HMS Cleopatra . Stevenson held a dinner for the five escort captains at the start of the exercise , during which he recounted the events of the Melbourne – Voyager collision , emphasised the need for caution when operating near the carrier , and provided written instructions on how to avoid such a situation developing again . Additionally , during the lead up to the exercise , Admiral Crabb had strongly warned that all repositioning manoeuvres performed by the escorts had to commence with a turn away from Melbourne . Despite these warnings , a near @-@ miss occurred in the early hours of 31 May when Larson turned towards the carrier after being ordered to the plane guard station . Subsequent action narrowly prevented a collision . The escorts were again warned about the dangers of operating near the carrier and informed of Stevenson 's expectations , while the minimum distance between carrier and escorts was increased from 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 700 m ) . 
 On the night of 2 – 3 June , Melbourne and her escorts were involved in anti @-@ submarine training exercises in the South China Sea . In preparation for launching a Tracker , Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station , reminded the destroyer of Melbourne 's course , and instructed the carrier 's navigational lights to be brought to full brilliance . Evans had performed the manoeuvre four times over the course of the night . Evans was positioned on Melbourne 's port bow , but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard , towards the carrier . A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans ' bridge and Combat Information Centre , warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course , which Evans acknowledged . Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbourne 's bow , Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port , signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts . At approximately the same time , Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier . It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first , but each ship 's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship 's turn after they commenced their own . After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne , the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier 's path . Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3 : 15 am , cutting the destroyer in two . 
 Seventy @-@ four of the 273 personnel from Evans were killed in the collision , with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section , which sank within minutes . Melbourne deployed her boats , life rafts , and <unk> , before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans , where both ships ' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together . Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier , while the carrier 's boats and helicopters collected those farther out . All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed , although the search continued for fifteen more hours . After Evans ' stern was evacuated , it was cast off , while the carrier moved away to avoid damage . The stern did not sink , and was later recovered , stripped of parts , and sunk for target practice . 
 Following the collision , Melbourne travelled to Singapore for temporary repairs to her bow , arriving on 6 June . Melbourne departed Singapore on 27 June and arrived in Sydney on 9 July , where the carrier underwent almost identical repairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard as in 1964 ( primarily the installation of a new bow section ) . However , an industrial dispute amongst the shipyard workers meant that , although the work was completed in early September , the ship remained in the drydock until 11 October . 
 A Joint RAN @-@ USN Board of Inquiry was established to investigate the incident , and was in session over June and July 1969 . The Board found Evans partially at fault for the collision , but also faulted Melbourne for not taking evasive action sooner , even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead up to a collision , the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed . It was learned during the inquiry that Evans ' commanding officer was asleep in his quarters at the time of the incident , and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson ; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch , while the latter was at sea for the first time . Subsequent to the inquiry , the three USN officers and Stevenson were court @-@ martialled by their respective navies on charges of negligence , with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson ' <unk> Acquitted ' . Despite the findings , Stevenson 's next posting was as a minor flag officer 's chief of staff , seen by him as a demotion in all but name . In a repeat of the aftermath of the Voyager collision , Melbourne 's captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating . In December 2012 , Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the Minister for Defence , apologising for his treatment by the RAN and the government of the day .

 During the 1970s and early 1980s , replacing parts became an increasing problem . Components were failing due to wear and age , but the companies responsible for manufacturing the parts had gone out of business during the previous twenty years , sometimes immediately after World War II ended . The carrier 's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch . 
 In 1970 , Melbourne participated in three major inter @-@ navy exercises : Sea Rover with SEATO forces in the South China Sea , <unk> <unk> with British Commonwealth forces off Malaysia , and Swan Lake with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy off Western Australia . During this year , the carrier also visited Japan to participate in Expo ' 70 , and was hit by Manly ferry South <unk> while alongside at Garden Island , causing minor damage to both vessels . Melbourne was out of service for most of 1971 while she underwent refits , which concluded in early August . In mid @-@ 1971 , the Australian military 's Joint Planning Committee considered using Melbourne as a transport to help complete the withdrawal of the Australian Task Force from Vietnam before the end of 1971 . While the Army supported this proposal , the Navy successfully argued against its implementation , claiming that transporting troops and cargo would be misusing Australia 's only active aircraft carrier , and would prevent Melbourne from participating in several major multi @-@ national exercises . The refit concluded in late 1971 , with the carrier participating in the first RIMPAC exercise , RIMPAC 71 , before the end of the year . 
 Operations in 1972 commenced with a three @-@ month deployment to Southeast Asia . During this deployment , Melbourne led a fleet of 17 ships from the RAN , Royal Navy , Royal New Zealand Navy , US Navy , Philippine Navy , and Royal Thai Navy in Exercise Sea Hawk . This was followed by goodwill visits to numerous Southeast Asian ports , including Hong Kong , Jakarta , Manila , Singapore , and Surabaya , before Melbourne returned to Sydney at the end of April . The carrier spent May performing exercises off the New South Wales coast , during which she was called on to rescue three fisherman who had been stranded at sea for the previous two days . In August , Melbourne sailed for Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC 72 . At the conclusion of this exercise , Melbourne proceeded to Japan on a diplomatic visit , then sailed to the Philippines to exercise with SEATO ships . During this deployment , a fire ignited inside the ship 's main switchboard . The carrier returned to Australia on 27 November after 101 days at sea , and underwent a seven @-@ month refit . On 24 August 1973 , Melbourne returned to Hawaii to participate in RIMPAC 73 . She returned to Australia on 12 October , but sailed out ten days later to participate in Exercise <unk> off Malaysia , before reaching Sydney again in December .
