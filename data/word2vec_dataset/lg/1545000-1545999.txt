 A PICTURE ( or PIC ) clause is a string of characters , each of which represents a portion of the data item and what it may contain . Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory . For example , a 9 indicates a decimal digit , and an S indicates that the item is signed . Other picture characters ( called insertion and editing characters ) specify how an item should be formatted . For example , a series of + characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data ; the rightmost non @-@ numeric character will contain the item 's sign , while other character positions corresponding to a + to the left of this position will contain a space . Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character ; for example , 9 ( 7 ) is equivalent to <unk> . Picture specifications containing only digit ( 9 ) and sign ( S ) characters define purely numeric data items , while picture specifications containing alphabetic ( A ) or alphanumeric ( X ) characters define alphanumeric data items . The presence of other formatting characters define edited numeric or edited alphanumeric data items . 
 = = = = = USAGE clause = = = = = 
 The USAGE clause declares the format data is stored in . Depending on the data type , it can either complement or be used instead of a PICTURE clause . While it can be used to declare pointers and object references , it is mostly geared towards specifying numeric types . These numeric formats are : 
 Binary , where a minimum size is either specified by the PICTURE clause or by a USAGE clause such as <unk> @-@ LONG . 
 USAGE <unk> , where data may be stored in whatever format the implementation provides ; often equivalent to USAGE <unk> 
 USAGE DISPLAY , the default format , where data is stored as a string 
 Floating @-@ point , in either an implementation @-@ dependent format or according to IEEE 754 . 
 USAGE NATIONAL , where data is stored as a string using an extended character set 
 USAGE <unk> @-@ <unk> , where data is stored in the smallest possible decimal format ( typically packed binary @-@ coded decimal ) 
 = = = = Report writer = = = = 
 The report writer is a declarative facility for creating reports . The programmer need only specify the report layout and the data required to produce it , freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks , data formatting , and headings and footings . 
 Reports are associated with report files , which are files which may only be written to through report writer statements . 
 Each report is defined in the report section of the data division . A report is split into report groups which define the report 's headings , footings and details . Reports work around hierarchical control breaks . Control breaks occur when a key variable changes it value ; for example , when creating a report detailing customers ' orders , a control break could occur when the program reaches a different customer 's orders . Here is an example report description for a report which gives a salesperson 's sales and which warns of any invalid records : 
 The above report description describes the following layout : 
 Sales Report Page 1 
 Seller : Howard Bromberg 
 Sales on 10 / 12 / 2008 were $ 1000 @.@ 00 
 Sales on 12 / 12 / 2008 were $ 0 @.@ 00 
 Sales on 13 / 12 / 2008 were $ 31 @.@ 47 
 <unk> RECORD : Howard Bromberg <unk> 
 Seller : Howard Discount 
 ... 
 Sales Report Page 12 
 Sales on 08 / 05 / 2014 were $ 543 @.@ 98 
 <unk> RECORD : William Selden <unk> 
 Sales on 30 / 05 / 2014 were $ 0 @.@ 00 
 Four statements control the report writer : <unk> , which prepares the report writer for printing ; <unk> , which prints a report group ; <unk> , which suppresses the printing of a report group ; and <unk> , which terminates report processing . For the above sales report example , the procedure division might look like this : 
 = = = Procedure division = = = 
 = = = = Procedures = = = = 
 The sections and paragraphs in the procedure division ( collectively called procedures ) can be used as labels and as simple subroutines . Unlike in other divisions , paragraphs do not need to be in sections . Execution goes down through the procedures of a program until it is terminated . To use procedures as subroutines , the PERFORM verb is used . This transfers control to the specified range of procedures and returns only upon reaching the end . 
 Unusual control flow can trigger mines , which cause control in performed procedures to return at unexpected times to unexpected locations . Procedures can be reached in three ways : they can be called with PERFORM , jumped to from a GO TO or through execution " falling through " the bottom of an above paragraph . Combinations of these invoke undefined behavior , creating mines . Specifically , mines occur when execution of a range of procedures would cause control flow to go past the last statement of a range of procedures already being performed . 
 For example , in the code in the adjacent image , a mine is tripped at the end of update @-@ screen when the screen is invalid . When the screen is invalid , control jumps to the fix @-@ screen section , which , when done , performs update @-@ screen . This recursion triggers undefined behavior as there are now two overlapping ranges of procedures being performed . The mine is then triggered upon reaching the end of update @-@ screen and means control could return to one of two locations : 
 The first PERFORM statement 
 The PERFORM statement in fix @-@ screen , where it would then " fall @-@ through " into update @-@ screen and return to the first PERFORM statement upon reaching the end . 
 = = = = Statements = = = = 
 COBOL 2014 has 47 statements ( also called verbs ) , which can be grouped into the following broad categories : control flow , I / O , data manipulation and the report writer . The report writer statements are covered in the report writer section . 
 = = = = = Control flow = = = = = 
 COBOL 's conditional statements are IF and EVALUATE . EVALUATE is a switch @-@ like statement with the added capability of evaluating multiple values and conditions . This can be used to implement decision tables . For example , the following might be used to control a CNC lathe : 
 The PERFORM statement is used to define loops which are executed until a condition is true ( not while , unlike other languages ) . It is also used to call procedures or ranges of procedures ( see the procedures section for more details ) . <unk> and <unk> call subprograms and methods , respectively . The name of the <unk> / method is contained in a string which may be a literal or a data item . Parameters can be passed by reference , by content ( where a copy is passed by reference ) or by value ( but only if a prototype is available ) . <unk> unloads subprograms from memory . GO TO causes the program to jump to a specified procedure . 
 The <unk> statement is a return statement and the STOP statement stops the program . The EXIT statement has six different formats : it can be used as a return statement , a break statement , a continue statement , an end marker or to leave a procedure . 
 Exceptions are raised by a <unk> statement and caught with a handler , or declarative , defined in the <unk> portion of the procedure division . <unk> are sections beginning with a <unk> statement which specify the errors to handle . Exceptions can be names or objects . <unk> is used in a declarative to jump to the statement after the one that raised the exception or to a procedure outside the <unk> . Unlike other languages , uncaught exceptions may not terminate the program and the program can proceed unaffected . 
 = = = = = I / O = = = = = 
 File I / O is handled by the self @-@ describing OPEN , <unk> , READ , and <unk> statements along with a further three : <unk> , which updates a record ; START , which selects subsequent records to access by finding a record with a certain key ; and <unk> , which releases a lock on the last record accessed . 
 User interaction is done using <unk> and DISPLAY . 
 = = = = = Data manipulation = = = = = 
 The following verbs manipulate data : 
 <unk> , which sets data items to their default values . 
 MOVE , which assigns values to data items . 
 <unk> , which has 15 formats : it can modify indices , assign object references and alter table capacities , among other functions . 
 ADD , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which handle arithmetic ( with <unk> assigning the result of a formula to a variable ) . 
 <unk> and FREE , which handle dynamic memory . 
 VALIDATE , which validates and distributes data as specified in an item 's description in the data division . 
 <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> and split strings , respectively . 
 <unk> , which tallies or replaces instances of specified substrings within a string . 
 <unk> , which searches a table for the first entry satisfying a condition . 
 Files and tables are sorted using SORT and the <unk> verb merges and sorts files . The <unk> verb provides records to sort and RETURN retrieves sorted records in order . 
 = = = = Scope termination = = = = 
 Some statements , such as IF and READ , may themselves contain statements . Such statements may be terminated in two ways : by a period ( implicit termination ) , which terminates all <unk> statements contained , or by a scope terminator , which terminates the nearest matching open statement . 
 Nested statements terminated with a period are a common source of bugs . For example , examine the following code : 
 Here , the intent is to display y and z if condition x is true . However , z will be displayed whatever the value of x because the IF statement is terminated by an erroneous period after DISPLAY y . 
 Another bug is a result of the dangling else problem , when two IF statements can associate with an ELSE . 
 In the above fragment , the ELSE associates with the IF y statement instead of the IF x statement , causing a bug . Prior to the introduction of explicit scope <unk> , preventing it would require ELSE NEXT <unk> to be placed after the inner IF . 
 = = = = Self @-@ modifying code = = = = 
 The original ( 1959 ) COBOL specification supported the infamous <unk> X TO <unk> TO Y statement , for which many compilers generated self @-@ modifying code . X and Y are procedure labels , and the single GO TO statement in procedure X executed after such an <unk> statement means GO TO Y instead . Many compilers still support it , but it was deemed obsolete in the COBOL 1985 standard and deleted in 2002 . 
 = = = Hello , world = = = 
 A " Hello , world " program in COBOL : 
 = = = = HELLO , WORLD = = = = 
 When the – now famous – " Hello , World ! " program example in The C Programming Language was first published in 1978 a similar mainframe COBOL program sample would have been submitted through JCL , very likely using a punch card reader , and 80 column punch cards . The listing below , with an empty DATA <unk> , was tested using GNU / Linux and the System / 370 Hercules emulator running MVS <unk> The JCL , written in July 2015 , is derived from the Hercules tutorials and samples hosted by Jay Moseley . In keeping with COBOL programming of that era , HELLO , WORLD is displayed in all capital letters . 
 After submitting the JCL , the MVS console displayed : 
 Line 10 of the console listing above is highlighted for effect , the highlighting is not part of the actual console output . 
 The associated compiler listing generated over four pages of technical detail and job run information , for the single line of output from the 14 lines of COBOL . 
 = = Criticism and defense = = 
 = = = Lack of structure = = = 
 In the 1970s , programmers began moving away from unstructured spaghetti code to the structured programming paradigm . In his letter to an editor in 1975 entitled " How do we tell truths that might hurt ? " which was critical of several of COBOL 's contemporaries , computer scientist and Turing Award recipient Edsger Dijkstra remarked that " The use of COBOL cripples the mind ; its teaching should , therefore , be regarded as a criminal offense . " In his dissenting response to Dijkstra 's article and the above " offensive statement , " computer scientist Howard E. Tompkins defended structured COBOL : " COBOL programs with convoluted control flow indeed tend to ' cripple the mind ' , " but this was because " There are too many such business application programs written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well ... " 
 One cause of spaghetti code was the GO TO statement . Attempts to remove GO TOs from COBOL code , however , resulted in convoluted programs and reduced code quality . GO TOs were largely replaced by the PERFORM statement and procedures , which promoted modular programming and gave easy access to powerful looping facilities . However , PERFORM could only be used with procedures so loop bodies were not located where they were used , making programs harder to understand . 
 COBOL programs were infamous for being monolithic and lacking <unk> . COBOL code could only be modularized through procedures , which were found to be inadequate for large systems . It was impossible to restrict access to data , meaning a procedure could access and modify any data item . Furthermore , there was no way to pass parameters to a procedure , an omission Jean Sammet regarded as the committee 's biggest mistake . Another complication stemmed from the ability to PERFORM <unk> a specified sequence of procedures . This meant that control could jump to and return from any procedure , creating convoluted control flow and permitting a programmer to break the single @-@ entry single @-@ exit rule . 
 This situation improved as COBOL adopted more features . COBOL @-@ 74 added subprograms , giving programmers the ability to control the data each part of the program could access . COBOL @-@ 85 then added nested subprograms , allowing programmers to hide subprograms . Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object @-@ oriented programming , user @-@ defined functions and user @-@ defined data types were included . 
 Nevertheless , much important legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code , which has become <unk> . It can be too risky and costly to modify even a simple section of code , since it may be used from unknown places in unknown ways . 
 = = = Compatibility issues = = = 
 COBOL was intended to be a highly portable , " common " language . However , by 2001 , around 300 dialects had been created . One source of dialects was the standard itself : the 1974 standard was composed of one mandatory nucleus and eleven <unk> modules , each containing two or three levels of support . This permitted 104 @,@ 976 official variants . 
 COBOL @-@ 85 was not fully compatible with earlier versions , and its development was controversial . Joseph T. Brophy , the CIO of Travelers Insurance , spearheaded an effort to inform COBOL users of the heavy reprogramming costs of implementing the new standard . As a result , the ANSI COBOL Committee received more than 2 @,@ 200 letters from the public , mostly negative , requiring the committee to make changes . On the other hand , conversion to COBOL @-@ 85 was thought to increase productivity in future years , thus justifying the conversion costs . 
 = = = Verbose syntax = = = 
 COBOL syntax has often been criticized for its verbosity . Proponents say that this was intended to make the code self @-@ documenting , easing program maintenance . COBOL was also intended to be easy for programmers to learn and use , while still being readable to non @-@ technical staff such as managers . The desire for readability led to the use of English @-@ like syntax and structural elements , such as nouns , verbs , clauses , sentences , sections , and divisions . Yet by 1984 , maintainers of COBOL programs were struggling to deal with " incomprehensible " code and the main changes in COBOL @-@ 85 were there to help ease maintenance . 
 Jean Sammet , a short @-@ range committee member , noted that " little attempt was made to cater to the professional programmer , in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be very unhappy with COBOL " which she attributed to COBOL 's verbose syntax . 
 = = = Isolation from the computer science community = = = 
 The COBOL community has always been isolated from the computer science community . No academic computer scientists participated in the design of COBOL : all of those on the committee came from commerce or government . Computer scientists at the time were more interested in fields like numerical analysis , physics and system programming than the commercial file @-@ processing problems which COBOL development tackled . Jean Sammet attributed COBOL 's unpopularity to an initial " snob reaction " due to its inelegance , the lack of influential computer scientists participating in the design process and a disdain for business data processing . The COBOL specification used a unique " notation " , or <unk> , to define its syntax rather than the new Backus – <unk> form because few committee members had heard of it . This resulted in " severe " criticism . 
 Later , COBOL suffered from a shortage of material covering it ; it took until 1963 for introductory books to appear ( with Richard D. Irwin publishing a college textbook on COBOL in 1966 ) . By 1985 , there were twice as many books on Fortran and four times as many on BASIC as on COBOL in the Library of Congress . University professors taught more modern , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art languages and techniques instead of COBOL which was said to have a " trade school " nature . Donald Nelson , chair of the CODASYL COBOL committee , said in 1984 that " academics ... hate COBOL " and that computer science graduates " had ' hate COBOL ' drilled into them " . A 2013 poll by Micro Focus found that 20 % of university academics thought COBOL was outdated or dead and that 55 % believed their students thought COBOL was outdated or dead . The same poll also found that only 25 % of academics had COBOL programming on their curriculum even though 60 % thought they should teach it . In contrast , in 2003 , COBOL featured in 80 % of information systems curricula in the United States , the same proportion as C + + and Java . 
 = = = Concerns about the design process = = = 
 Doubts have been raised about the competence of the standards committee . Short @-@ term committee member Howard Bromberg said that there was " little control " over the development process and that it was " plagued by discontinuity of personnel and ... a lack of talent . " Jean Sammet and Jerome Garfunkel also noted that changes introduced in one revision of the standard would be reverted in the next , due as much to changes in who was in the standard committee as to objective evidence . 
 COBOL standards have repeatedly suffered from delays : COBOL @-@ 85 arrived five years later than hoped , COBOL 2002 was five years late , and COBOL 2014 was six years late . To combat delays , the standard committee allowed the creation of optional addenda which would add features more quickly than by waiting for the next standard revision . However , some committee members raised concerns about incompatibilities between implementations and frequent modifications of the standard . 
 = = = Influences on other languages = = = 
 COBOL 's data structures influenced subsequent programming languages . Its record and file structure influenced PL / I and Pascal , and the <unk> clause was a predecessor to Pascal 's variant records . Explicit file structure definitions preceded the development of database management systems and aggregated data was a significant advance over Fortran 's arrays . 
 COBOL 's <unk> facility , although considered " primitive " , influenced the development of include directives . 
 The focus on portability and standardization meant programs written in COBOL could be portable and facilitated the spread of the language to a wide variety of hardware platforms and operating systems . Additionally , the well @-@ defined division structure restricts the definition of external references to the Environment Division , which simplifies platform changes in particular . 
 = Imaginos = 
 Imaginos is the eleventh studio album by the American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult ( commonly shortened as BÖC ) . It was released in 1988 , and was their last recording with their original record label , CBS / Columbia Records . The album took nearly eight years to complete and was originally intended to be the first in a trilogy of solo albums by Blue Öyster Cult drummer and songwriter Albert Bouchard . Bouchard was fired in August 1981 , and CBS rejected the album in 1984 , but a re @-@ worked version was eventually published as a product of the band . Many musicians contributed to the project over this eight @-@ year span , including Joe Satriani and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger , but some band members were barely involved in the recording process . Thus , Imaginos is often considered more as a project of producer and lyricist Sandy Pearlman than as a true album of the band . 
 Imaginos weaves scripts and poems by Pearlman , dating from the second half of the 1960s , into a concept album and rock opera about an alien conspiracy that is brought to fruition during the late 19th and early 20th century through the actions of Imaginos , an agent of evil . The tale combines elements of gothic literature and science fiction and is strongly inspired by the work of H. P. Lovecraft . Subtitled " a bedtime story for the children of the damned " , it has an intricate storyline whose often @-@ obscure lyrics contain many historical references , and is still an object of speculation by fans and critics . It is often considered one of the heaviest albums released by Blue Öyster Cult , its music more akin to heavy metal than the melodic and commercial hard rock of their two previous works . The poor sales of those albums resulted in record label pressure on the band that led to their disbandment in 1986 ; a subsequent comeback featured only three members of the classic line @-@ up . 
 The album received some critical acclaim , but achieved no commercial success , and Columbia Records ended their contract with Blue Öyster Cult at the completion of the Imaginos Tour . Albert Bouchard , excluded from the recording progress of Imaginos after the initial rejection from Columbia Records , then took legal action against the band and the label to protect his rights as author and producer on the album . Blue Öyster Cult continued to perform and remained a live attraction , but ten years passed before they released an album of new songs . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Sandy Pearlman and The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos = = = 
 The concept and the character of Imaginos were originally created by the young Sandy Pearlman for a collection of poems and scripts called The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos ( sometimes reported as <unk> ) , written in the mid @-@ 1960s during his formative years as a student of anthropology and sociology at the universities of Stony Brook , Brandeis and New School . Pearlman combined cultural references learned in his studies with elements of gothic literature and science fiction , and created a secret history about the origin of the two world wars . Pearlman himself declared his predilection for the American weird fiction author " H. P. Lovecraft and other writers of that ilk " , as well as for books on modern warfare and conspiracies . 
 Established by 1967 as a critic for the seminal US music magazine Crawdaddy ! , Pearlman was also the mentor , manager and producer for the band Soft White Underbelly , which , after various changes of name , became Blue Öyster Cult , a term taken from the Imaginos script . The adapted and amended rhymes of Pearlman , along with his friend and colleague Richard Meltzer 's arcane writings , were used as lyrics for most of the band 's early songs ; musician and writer Lenny Kaye recalls in his introduction to the re @-@ mastered edition of their first album that " the band kept a folder full of Meltzer 's and Pearlman 's word associations in their rehearsal room , and would leaf through it , setting fragments to music " . Fragments of the Imaginos script are scattered out @-@ of @-@ context throughout the songs of the first four albums , where the original meanings are lost to listeners unaware of the larger picture . The resulting mystery feeds fan fascination for the music of Blue Öyster Cult , and is responsible for their reputation as " the world 's brainiest heavy metal band " . Much fan speculation centers around lyrics ' relationship to the Imaginos storyline , while Pearlman 's deliberate reticence and misleading in revealing his sources only augments the obscurity of the matter . During the band 's first period of activity , the theme of the alien conspiracy became more defined and predominant in the mind of its author , to the point that notes on the cover of their 1974 album Secret Treaties referred to the secret history conceived by Pearlman , while its songs " Astronomy " and " Subhuman " contained lyrics fully dedicated to the Imaginos plot . 
 The band sought to separate creatively from Pearlman in the late 1970s ; they avoided his lyrics and concepts and refused to record an album entirely dedicated to Imaginos , but eventually returned to his material for the lyrics of " Shadow of California " ( from The <unk> by Night of 1983 ) and " When the War Comes " ( from Club Ninja of 1985 ) . Pearlman and Albert Bouchard hoped to record such an album , and as far back as 1972 had begun to write songs directly inspired by the Imaginos ' story . Nonetheless , with the exception of the extracts used for song lyrics , the text of The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos remains to this day largely unknown and unpublished . 
 = = = Blue Öyster Cult in 1988 = = = 
 The commercial success of the single " ( Don 't Fear ) The Reaper " in 1976 , and a series of Platinum and Gold discs in the following years , placed pressure on the band as their label , Columbia Records , expected them to repeat these successes . Despite good sales of the album Fire of Unknown Origin and the single " Burnin ' for You " , in August 1981 the conflicts and the stress accumulated in more than ten years of cohabitation led to the firing of drummer Albert Bouchard , a founding member and an important contributor to the songwriting and sound of the group , allegedly for unstable behavior . The relationship between the former band mates remained tense in the following years . Old feuds resurfaced during a short reunion tour with the original line @-@ up in 1985 , with the result that no one in the band accepted Albert Bouchard back in Blue Öyster Cult . However , A. Bouchard still hoped to be reinstated in the band through his work done for Imaginos . 
 Albert Bouchard 's departure started a rotation of personnel in the formerly stable band roster , which left by 1986 only Eric Bloom and Donald ' Buck Dharma ' Roeser as original members . Allen Lanier left in 1985 during the recording sessions for Club Ninja , unsatisfied by the music and annoyed at the presence of Tommy Zvoncheck as his replacement , while Joe Bouchard quit soon after that album 's release to pursue different career opportunities , play other musical genres , and settle in his family life . The release of two expensive studio albums in 1983 and 1985 , which received generally bad critical response and sold poorly , ruined the relationship with their demanding record label and left the band with little support and very few ideas on how to go on with their careers . As a result , " in the summer of 1986 , the band semi @-@ officially broke up " , Bloom explained in an interview to the British music magazine Kerrang ! in 1988 . The final line @-@ up of 1986 included Bloom , Roeser , Tommy Zvoncheck on keyboards , Jon Rogers on bass and Jimmy Willcox on drums . 
 Pearlman 's and Steve Schenk 's managerial efforts were rewarded when Blue Öyster Cult were hired for some gigs in Greece in July 1987 . After a nine @-@ month layoff , the band returned to activity and Allen Lanier re @-@ joined . The European shows were a success , and the reformed line @-@ up of Bloom , Roeser , Lanier , Jon Rogers and drummer Ron Riddle worked very well together on stage . Blue Öyster Cult returned to the road in 1987 and 1988 with renewed enthusiasm , but without a new album to promote , until the release of Imaginos . 
 = = Concept and storyline = = 
 Imaginos was envisioned as a rock opera to be published as a trilogy of double albums , with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history , from the beginning of the 19th century to the end of the 20th . This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy , but with the songs arranged out of order , rendering the story harder to comprehend . Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section , the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader . However , thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard , and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release , it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent . 
 Although often referred to as a dream , the concept behind Imaginos is what Pearlman described as " an interpretation of history – an explanation for the onset of World War I , or a revelation of the occult origins of it " , which he crafted on elements of mythology , sociology , alchemy , science and occultism . This " combination of horror story and fairy tale " cites historical facts and characters , and is filled with literate references to ancient civilizations in a conspiracy theory of epic proportions , the subject of which is the manipulation of the course of human history . 
 Central to this story are Les Invisibles ( The Invisible Ones ) , a group of seven beings worshipped by the natives of Mexico and Haiti prior to the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century , identified by some fans as the Loa of the Voodoo religion . The nature of Les Invisibles is left unclear , though it is hinted that they may be extraterrestrials , or beings akin to the Great Old Ones in the works of H. P. Lovecraft . An interpretation of the lyrics of the song " Astronomy " by some fans suggests that the star Sirius is of particular astrological significance to Les Invisibles , with clues identifying it as their place of origin ; it is during the so @-@ called Dog Days of August , when Sirius is in conjunction with the Sun that their influence over mankind is at its apex . By subtly influencing the minds of men , the beings are said to be " playing with our history as if it 's a game " , affecting events in world history over the course of centuries . For the three centuries after European discovery of the New World , this game plays out as the desire for gold is used to transform Spain into the dominant power in Europe , only to be usurped by England in the 17th century and later , through technology , by other nations ( " Les Invisibles " ) . 
 The principal story begins in August 1804 , with the birth of a " modified child " called Imaginos , in the American state of New Hampshire . Because of the astrological significance of the place and time of his birth , Imaginos is of particular interest to Les Invisibles , who begin investing him with superhuman abilities while he is young . Unaware of his true destiny or nature , the young Imaginos finds out that he is apparently able to change his appearance at will and to see the future ( " Imaginos " ) . As the child becomes an adult he finds himself affected by wanderlust and , billing himself as an adventurer , sets out to explore Texas and the western frontier , arriving in New Orleans in 1829 . It is there that he has a vision imploring him to travel to Mexico in search of an artifact " lost , last and luminous , scored to sky yet never found " . Imaginos joins the crew of a ship traveling to the Yucatán Peninsula , but while passing through the Gulf of Mexico , the ship encounters a freak storm of which his visions failed to warn him ( " Del Rio 's Song " ) . The ship sinks with most of its crew , and Imaginos , half dead , washes ashore and is left for dead by the other survivors . As he lies dying " on a shore where oyster beds seem plush as down " , Imaginos is addressed by a symphony of voices who identify themselves as Les Invisibles . Imaginos ' true nature is revealed to him , and he is informed that the circumstances of his entire life have been manipulated to bring him to that specific moment in time . Having explained themselves to him , they offer him a choice – die as a human , or live as their servant ( " Blue Öyster Cult " ) . Imaginos accepts their offer , and is resurrected from the dead by the Blue Öyster Cult , the servants of Les Invisibles . He is inducted into the cult and given a new name - <unk> , " Eternal Light " . He realizes that his descent and the origin of his powers comes from the stars where his masters live and becomes aware of his role in the making of history ( " Astronomy " ) . 
 Imaginos / <unk> becomes from this point on an instrument of Les Invisibles ' manipulation of human history . For the next sixty @-@ three years , he insinuates himself into the world of European politics . He uses his ability to change identities to take the place of high @-@ ranking officials , whose offices he uses to bring about Les Invisibles ' will ( " I Am the One You Warned Me Of " ) , introducing new knowledge and technology to the unsuspecting world ( " The Siege and Investiture of Baron Von Frankenstein 's Castle at <unk> " ) . 
 By 1892 , Imaginos is living in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine @-@ year @-@ old granddaughter . Having by this time spent several decades studying mysticism and astrology , Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England 's rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee 's acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico , which serves as a bridge between Les Invisibles ' alien world and ours , and the means to spread their influence on Earth . Some fans see Les Invisibles ' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America , while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ( " In the Presence of Another World " ) . 
 This revelation in mind , Imaginos decides that the time has come to reattempt his aborted mission to Mexico . On August 1 , 1892 , he sets sail aboard a " charmed ship " which , despite " storms on land and storms at sea " , delivers him faithfully to Mexico . After several months exploring the jungles of Yucatán he finds an undiscovered Mayan pyramid . Following a long passage into the interior of the pyramid he discovers a chamber carved from solid jade , in which he finds the " Magna of Illusion " , a twin of Dee 's magic mirror . Stealing away with the artifact , he returns to Cornwall a year to the day of his departure , which coincides with the tenth birthday of his granddaughter . Imaginos gives the mirror to the young girl as a birthday present , and for the following 21 years it sits collecting dust in her attic , silently poisoning the minds of European leaders . In 1914 , " World War I breaks out . A disease with a long incubation " ( " Magna of Illusion " ) . 
 The two songs excluded from the final release introduced further elements to the plot . " Gil Blanco County " , a song with music written by Allen Lanier for Soft White Underbelly in the late 1960s and recorded in the unpublished Elektra album of the Stalk @-@ Forrest Group ( now available as St. Cecilia : The Elektra Recordings ) , has short and elusive lyrics apparently detailing the escape of Imaginos from Texas to Arizona . The other song , " The Girl That Love Made Blind " , is an Albert Bouchard composition which explains that Imaginos ' powers include the capacity of moving " in and through time " , assuming different identities in every moment of history .

 = = = Albert Bouchard 's solo album = = = 
 Albert Bouchard began writing music for Imaginos following the release of the band 's first album in 1972 . There were plans as early as 1975 to release a concept album dedicated to Pearlman 's scripts , but the material was not ready . All of the songs had been written by 1977 , with the participation of various band members , and at least four of them ( " Astronomy " , " In the Presence of Another World " , " I Am the One You Warned Me Of " , " Imaginos " ) were completed and demoed during the recording sessions for the album Spectres . Demos of the other tracks were recorded by A. Bouchard and remained in various stages of development during the following years , with the band uninterested in pursuing the Imaginos project that Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman had been insistently proposing . 
 After A. Bouchard 's 1981 dismissal from Blue Öyster Cult , he and Pearlman worked on the material , having secured an advance from Columbia Records on the strength of the demos partially sung by Eric Bloom . The initial concept of a trilogy of double albums , largely based on music written during the band 's many years of activity and on adapted and rewritten Pearlman lyrics linked by the Imaginos storyline , is reflected in the working titles : Act I : Imaginos , Act II : Germany Minus Zero and Counting ( also known as Bombs over Germany and Half @-@ Life Time ) , and Act III : The Mutant Reformation . These were intended as Albert Bouchard solo albums , a spin @-@ off of Blue Öyster Cult main discography , although some fan opinion holds that Columbia Records had intended all along that the recordings would result in a new Blue Öyster Cult album . 
 Bouchard and Pearlman set up the recording of the basic tracks for the first album of the trilogy in June 1982 , with sound engineers Corky Stasiak and Paul Mandl at Kingdom Sound Studios in Long Island , New York , and at The Boogie Hotel , a studio owned by the boogie rock band Foghat and located in a large Victorian mansion in Port Jefferson , New York . At the same time and in the same facilities , Blue Öyster Cult were recording the album The <unk> by Night with producer Bruce Fairbairn . A. Bouchard sang lead vocals and played guitar on all tracks , accompanied by : 
 Tommy <unk> ( Ian Hunter Band , Helen Wheels ) , guitars and arrangements , 
 Jack Rigg ( David Johansen Band ) and Phil Grande ( Peter Criss and Ellen Foley session musician ) , guitars , 
 Tommy Mandel ( Ian Hunter Band , Bryan Adams ) , keyboards , 
 Kenny Aaronson , bass , 
 <unk> Price ( Scandal ) , drums . 
 The guitar solos by The Doors ' Robby Krieger , who had played live with Blue Öyster Cult on Extraterrestrial Live , and guitar parts by Aldo Nova and the late Kevin Carlson , guitarist of the Aldo Nova Band , should also be ascribed to these recording sessions . According to Bouchard , Jeff <unk> , Corky Stasiak , Helen Wheels , Glen Bell , Peggy Atkins and Casper McCloud were among the uncredited background vocalists which participated to these sessions . 
 Allen Lanier , Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed instrumental parts and backing vocals to the tracks as guests . These remain Lanier 's and J. Bouchard 's only contributions to Imaginos . Columbia Records ' complaints about Albert Bouchard 's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try @-@ outs of singers , including Jon Rogers and Joey <unk> , whose performances on some songs were used for the final mix of the album in 1988 . The new recordings , overdubs by other uncredited musicians , and mixing lasted until 1984 . Musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck , who had already played with Clarence Clemons , Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate . 
 An almost @-@ finished product that comprised more than ninety minutes of music and whose thirteen tracks included re @-@ arranged versions of " Astronomy " and " Subhuman " ( retitled " Blue Öyster Cult " ) , " Gil Blanco County " , the ballad " The Girl That Love Made Blind " and a couple of chorales , was presented to Columbia Records executives in 1984 . They rejected the album and decided to shelve it , officially because of Albert Bouchard 's vocals and the lack of commercial perspectives . 
 = = = The Blue Öyster Cult album = = = 
 Despite the firm intention of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard to salvage the project , the recordings remained unfinished and untouched for more than two years due to lack of funding . While struggling with the long , complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult 's album Club Ninja , Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin , A & R director of the local punk label 415 Records , with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience . In 1986 , Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco 's Hyde Street Recording Studios , and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios . Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there , and Pearlman sub @-@ leased the studio to other producers . In September 1986 , when the poor sales of Club Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded , the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album . He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom , singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult . 
 With Imaginos again a work in progress at the end of 1986 , band manager Steve Schenk contacted Albert Bouchard to get the original recordings he still owned . Pearlman , with the help of engineers Paul Mandl and Steve Brown , spent his time cleaning up , re @-@ arranging and remixing the original recordings , using state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art technology and the collaborations of studio musicians . Virtuoso guitarist Joe Satriani financed the recording of his second album , Surfing with the Alien , through his work on Imaginos . Similarly , thrash metal guitarist Marc Biedermann , whose band Blind Illusion was recording at Hyde Street Studios , mixed the album The Sane Asylum at Pearlman 's studio in exchange for his collaboration . Biedermann declared in a 2008 interview that he " played more lead guitar on that album than Buck Dharma " . Roeser went to California in early 1987 to record his lead vocals and some guitar parts , while Tommy Zvoncheck , still a member of Blue Öyster Cult , re @-@ recorded most of the keyboards on the album . The last parts recorded were the lead vocals by Eric Bloom , who was in the studio in early 1988 . Donald Roeser later summed up his and Bloom 's late involvement in the making of the album by saying " Imaginos was our parting of the ways . That was something that Eric and I agreed to do , sort of , out of respect for Sandy and his effort that he made with Imaginos " . 
 The as @-@ imagined album and the as @-@ released album bear little relation to each other . The final version of Imaginos is almost forty minutes shorter than the first version of 1984 and has two fewer songs , but as Pearlman explained , " we ran out of money and couldn 't do the whole thing " . The rhythm section of the original recording was kept mostly intact , but many guitars and most of the keyboards and lead vocals were re @-@ recorded or remixed . The song order was scrambled out of the fixed chronology , possibly because of the label executives ' intervention to have a more commercially attractive product . The sleeve notes ' definition of the album as a " random access myth ( where ) everything happens all at once " , appears to many as a posthumous justification for the mixed @-@ up song order . Imaginos does not contain ballads or an immediately recognizable commercial single , and its music is often considered the heaviest produced by Blue Öyster Cult , the best attempt by the band to produce a heavy metal album . Critics and fans point to elements of progressive rock also present in the music , which create a dark and " ominous " atmosphere that fits the obscure content of the song lyrics .

 Artist Greg Scott , who had supplied the cover art for the Blue Öyster Cult albums Fire of Unknown Origin , Extraterrestrial Live and The Revolution by Night , worked with Sandy Pearlman for several months in 1984 to prepare paintings inspired by the Imaginos saga for the gatefold cover of the expected double album . " And none of that was ever seen , because it was shelved " , Scott remarked in an interview with Canadian journalist Martin Popoff . 
 The art direction for the 1988 release was instead put in the hands of CBS Records ' art director Arnold Levine and his staff . They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House , a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco , California , built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907 . The back cover is a maritime landscape , modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors . 
 The inner sleeve , besides the credits and Sandy Pearlman 's lengthy notes on the Imaginos story , sports a large black and white photo by landscape British photographer Simon Marsden of <unk> Castle in Argyllshire , Scotland . 
 The credits printed on the sleeve of the first release were largely incomplete and made no distinction between the recording sessions of 1982 @-@ 84 and those of 1987 @-@ 88 , apparently validating the false assumption that the original line @-@ up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for the making of the album . Aside from the list of band members , the credits reported only some session musicians and other members of the so @-@ called Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos , and omitted other personnel who had contributed to Imaginos . 
 = = Release = = 
 Imaginos was mastered at Precision Lacquer in Los Angeles by Stephen Marcussen and finally released as LP and CD on July 1988 , almost eight years after the work on it had begun and twenty @-@ three years after the concept of Imaginos was created . A limited edition of the album was also released in blue vinyl . 
 The first single extracted from the album was an edited version of " Astronomy " , which was released as a 7 " , as a 12 " and as a CD single . American author Stephen King recorded the spoken introduction to the radio edit of the song , a reading of the lines written on the back cover of the LP . The 12 " contains various mixes of " Astronomy " , including one sung by Albert Bouchard . The single received sufficient radio airplay to reach No. 12 in the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in September 1988 , but it did not enter the US singles chart . The CD single " In the Presence of Another World " was issued later only for promotional purposes , but received no attention from FM radio stations . 
 The album was largely neglected by the record label , which did little to no promotion in the US . Pearlman stated that " there was actually no intention on the part of Columbia Records at all to promote it . ( ... ) Basically the people wanted to work it and they were told not to work it " . Roeser commented later that he did not " think Sony ’ s ever really known how to sell us , from the beginning ( ... ) and Columbia never felt that they knew how to market us " . Imaginos fared better with CBS International , which distributed the album abroad and produced a music video for " Astronomy " in the UK , which aired in coincidence with the European tour dates of 1989 . The video clip does not feature members of the band , but begins with the spoken introduction by Stephen King and focuses on the storyline narrated in the album . 
 Albert Bouchard had been completely excluded from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons , but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co @-@ producer , and to be paid accordingly . After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult , he contacted the other band members in an attempt to organize a 1987 reunion tour , with the original line @-@ up , to promote Imaginos . His economic and membership requests were both rejected , due to resistances within the label and within the band , so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work . The lawsuit was settled out of court , but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased , eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga . 
 One of the final mixes of 1984 , titled Albert Bouchard 's Imaginos , surfaced on the Internet in 2003 as a free download . The album contains music recorded during the sessions from 1982 to 1984 and permits a comparison of arrangements , vocals and sound with the version published in 1988 . 
 Imaginos was re @-@ issued only once , through Sony BMG sub @-@ label American Beat Records in December 2007 . The 2007 reissue was remastered to adjust the volume levels and included a CD sleeve with corrected , but not complete , credits . A new remastered version of Imaginos is included in the The Columbia Albums Collection boxed set , issued by Sony / Legacy in November 2012 .

 Blue Öyster Cult interrupted their schedule of US shows only just before the album release in June 1988 , to familiarize the band members with the new material . The 1987 formation with Bloom , Roeser , Lanier , Rogers and Riddle remained the closest available to a full reunion , given J. Bouchard 's unwillingness to participate and the opposition to A. Bouchard . The Imaginos Tour began in the East Coast of the US in July , and continued on to most of the States . The set lists were based mainly on old material and included only two or three songs from Imaginos , usually " I Am the One You Warned Me Of " , " In the Presence of Another World " and the new version of " Astronomy " . Blue Öyster Cult visited Canada in January 1989 , France in February , the United Kingdom in March , and concluded their European tour in Germany in April . 
 During the following US tour , the new management of Columbia Records , which had been sold to Sony Music in 1988 , terminated Columbia 's almost 20 @-@ year relationship with Blue Öyster Cult because of their low sales . This left them without a recording contract for the next ten years . Eric Bloom stated that " in general , CBS was straight with us , when we had fans working inside the company " , but after " 3 @-@ 4 different Presidents of the company came and went " the commercial appeal of Blue Öyster Cult had disappeared for the new management . 
 A review of their performance at The Ritz in New York on January 6 , 1989 highlights the good shape and musicianship of the band , but remarks that the new songs were played with considerably less enthusiasm than the rest of the show . Although the band continued to tour regularly , the songs from Imaginos had already disappeared from their shows by the end of 1989 , never to be performed live again . 
 = = Critical and commercial reception = = 
 Imaginos received mixed reviews both from professional critics and fans . 
 David Fricke , in his review for the magazine Rolling Stone , considers Imaginos " the best black @-@ plastic blitz to bear the Cult 's trademark cross and claw since 1974 's Secret Treaties " , but remarks that the " lengthy gestation " of the album and the many musicians involved makes it " a bit of a cheat for Cult Purists " , and that is " only an illusionary re @-@ creation of the way BÖC used to be " . William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Imaginos is " the album that comes closest to defining Blue Öyster Cult " and their " creative swan song " , and " perhaps BÖC 's most consistent album , certainly its most uncompromising ( ... ) and also the closest thing to a real heavy @-@ metal statement from a band that never quite fit that description " . For Don Kaye of Kerrang ! , the album is " the best BÖC slab since ( ... ) <unk> Erectus and harks back in style and attitude towards the brilliance of masterpieces like Secret Treaties and Spectres " . A contrary evaluation comes from Blue Öyster Cult biographer Martin Popoff , who has " come to dismiss it as somewhat of a sell @-@ out " . Despite it being " the band 's heaviest , fulfilling many a fan ’ s wish for sustained metal " , Popoff finds " the whole thing perched on the edge of parody , too dressy and fantastical lyrically in a painfully self @-@ conscious way , ( ... ) a laborious exercise in expected weird " , ultimately " a baffling yet anticlimactic punctuation to the band ’ s perplexed career " . A reviewer from the Italian music criticism site Storia della Musica points out that the album is now a ' cult ' item for its rarity , its content and the scarce love shown by the band for this work . He writes that " it could have been the Tommy or The Dark Side of the Moon of BÖC " but , " despite the profound influences it evokes " , its " mutilated and sabotaged form " and the disinterest of the musicians involved makes Imaginos only a wasted opportunity . 
 The reviews posted by Blue Öyster Cult 's fans and by buyers of the album on the customer review site <unk> and on the online collaborative metadata database Rate Your Music are in general quite positive , praising Imaginos as a " creative masterpiece " , but underlining that the work is not a group effort but " the brain @-@ child of original drummer Albert Bouchard and longtime producer and lyricist Sandy Pearlman " . A professional Italian reviewer describes the Blue Öyster Cult name on the cover as " only a commercial decoy " for an Albert Bouchard solo album . 
 The album entered the Billboard 200 album chart on August 19 , 1988 , peaked at No. 122 , and exited the charts on October 8 . It sold about 50 @,@ 000 copies in the US , and was a commercial failure for Columbia Records and a financial failure for the band , which was forced through legal action to pay back the money used for both the recording of Albert Bouchard 's solo album and for the re @-@ recording of Imaginos .

 = Cambodian – Vietnamese War = 
 The Cambodian – Vietnamese War was an armed conflict between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea . The war began with isolated clashes along the land and maritime boundaries of Vietnam and Kampuchea between 1975 and 1977 , occasionally involving division @-@ sized military formations . On 25 December 1978 , Vietnam launched a full @-@ scale invasion of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the Khmer Rouge government from power . 
 During the Vietnam War , Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge communists had formed an alliance to fight U.S.-backed regimes in their respective countries . Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese , the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region . In order to preempt an attempt by the Vietnamese to dominate them , the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese @-@ trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975 . Then , in May 1975 , the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea , dominated by the Khmer Rouge , began waging a war against Vietnam , which was marked by an attack on the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc . In spite of the fighting that had occurred between the two countries , the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them . However , behind the scenes , Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism . As such , on 30 April 1977 , they launched another major military attack on Vietnam . Shocked by the Kampuchean assault , Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean Government to negotiate . In January 1978 , the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved . 
 Small @-@ scale fighting continued between the two countries throughout 1978 , as China tried to mediate peace talks between the two sides . However , neither country could reach an acceptable compromise at the negotiation table . By the end of 1978 , Vietnamese leaders decided to remove the Khmer Rouge @-@ dominated regime of Democratic Kampuchea , perceiving it as being pro @-@ Chinese and too hostile towards Vietnam . On 25 December 1978 , 150 @,@ 000 Vietnamese troops invaded Democratic Kampuchea and overran the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army in just two weeks . On 8 January 1979 , a pro @-@ Vietnamese People 's Republic of Kampuchea ( PRK ) was established in Phnom Penh , marking the beginning of a ten @-@ year Vietnamese occupation . During that period , the Khmer Rouge 's Democratic Kampuchea continued to be recognised by the United Nations as the legitimate government of Kampuchea , as several armed resistance groups were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation . Behind the scenes , Prime Minister Hun Sen of the PRK regime approached factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea ( CGDK ) to begin peace talks . Under heavy diplomatic and economic pressure from the international community , the Vietnamese Government implemented a series of economic and foreign policy reforms , which led to their withdrawal from Kampuchea in September 1989 . 
 At the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in 1990 , under the Australian @-@ sponsored Cambodian Peace Plan , representatives of the CGDK and the PRK agreed to a power @-@ sharing arrangement by forming a unity government known as the Supreme National Council ( SNC ) . The SNC 's role was to represent Cambodian sovereignty on the international stage , while the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) was tasked with supervising the country 's domestic policies until a Cambodian government was elected by the people through a peaceful , democratic process . Cambodia 's pathway to peace proved to be difficult , as Khmer Rouge leaders decided not to participate in the general elections , but instead they chose to disrupt the electoral process by launching military attacks on UN peacekeepers and killing ethnic Vietnamese migrants . In May 1993 , Sihanouk 's FUNCINPEC movement defeated the Cambodian People 's Party ( CPP ) , formerly the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party ( KPRP ) , to win the general elections . However , the CPP leadership refused to accept defeat and they announced that the eastern provinces of Cambodia , where most of the CPP 's votes were drawn from , would secede from Cambodia . To avoid such an outcome , Norodom Ranariddh , the leader of FUNCINPEC agreed to form a coalition government with the CPP . Shortly afterwards , the constitutional monarchy was restored and the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the newly formed Cambodian Government .

 Angkor , the seat of the Khmer Empire was subjected to Vietnamese influence as early as the 13th century . Vietnamese influence spread gradually and indirectly , and it was not until the early 19th century that Vietnam exercised direct control . In 1813 , <unk> Ong Chan gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam , and under his rule Cambodia became a protectorate . Following his death in 1834 , Vietnam colonised Cambodia ; it was governed under a Vietnamese administration and termed a Vietnamese ‘ province ’ . Throughout the 1830s , Vietnam attempted to erase Khmer culture , which had derived the basis of Cambodian society , dress and religion from India rather than China . The trend of Vietnamese dominance continued during French colonization , under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its southern cone ( which would later be Saigon , the Mekong Delta and Tây Ninh ) to the Vietnamese . The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia lost during the previous centuries . 
 = = = Rise of communism = = = 
 The communist movement in Cambodia and Vietnam began before World War II with the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party ( ICP ) , almost exclusively dominated by the Vietnamese , originally meant to fight French colonial rule in Indochina . In 1941 , Nguyen Ai Quoc ( commonly known by his alias Ho Chi Minh ) founded the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi , or the Viet Minh . When the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II , he initiated the first Indochinese war of independence against the French . During this time , Vietnamese forces made extensive use of Cambodian territory to transport weapons , supplies , and troops . This relationship lasted throughout the Vietnam War , when Vietnamese communists used Cambodia as a transport route and staging area for attacks on South Vietnam . In 1951 , Vietnam guided the establishment of a separate Cambodian communist party , the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party ( KPRP ) , which allied with a nationalist separatist Cambodian movement , the Khmer <unk> ( Free Khmers ) , in order to pursue independence . In accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords negotiating the end of the French domination , newly created communist North Vietnam pulled all of its Viet Minh soldiers and cadres out of Cambodia ; however , since the KPRP was staffed primarily by ethnic Vietnamese or Cambodians under its tutelage , approximately 5 @,@ 000 Communist cadres went with them . 
 The power vacuum the Vietnamese communists left in its wake in Cambodia was soon filled by the return of a young group of Cambodian communist revolutionaries , many of whom received their communist education in France . In 1960 , the KPRP changed its name to the Kampuchean Communist Party ( KCP ) , and the name was later adopted by the majority coalition that formed around Saloth Sar ( Pol Pot ) , Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan as the ‘ true ’ political institution memorialising the KCP . This clique became the genesis of the Khmer Rouge , and its doctrine was heavily influenced by the Maoist ideology .

 After overthrowing pro @-@ China Sihanouk , Cambodian leader Lon Nol , despite being anti @-@ Communist and ostensibly in the " pro @-@ American " camp , backed FULRO against all Vietnamese , both anti @-@ communist South Vietnam and the Communist Viet Cong .

 Vietnamese were slaughtered and dumped in the Mekong River at the hands of Lon Nol 's anti @-@ Communist forces . The Khmer Rouge later imitated Lon Nol 's actions . 
 = = = Democratic Kampuchea and the Khmer Rouge = = = 
 The Khmer Rouge government adopted the mysterious term Angkar , or " the organisation " and , until 1977 , the identities of its leaders remained confidential . The official head of state was Khieu Samphan , but the two men in control of the Party were Pol Pot and Ieng Sary . The ultimate objective of the Khmer Rouge was to erase the structure of the Cambodian state , which they viewed as feudal , capitalist , and serving the agendas of both the landholding elite and imperialists . In its place , they hoped to create a classless society based entirely on worker @-@ peasants . The radical ideologies and goals of the Khmer Rouge were alien concepts to the masses . In fact , the socialist revolution held very little popular appeal , which led Pol Pot and his cadres to use ultra @-@ nationalist sentiment , repressive and murderous rule and propaganda aimed at demonising the Vietnamese to maintain their tenuous control . 
 During the five years of the Khmer Rouge rebellion from 1970 to 1975 , the support of North Vietnam , in conjunction with China , was essential to its eventual triumph . However , even before the Vietnam War ended , the relationship between the Khmer Rouge — which was in the process of seizing power from a US @-@ backed regime headed by Lon Nol — and Vietnam was strained . Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974 , and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the ‘ friendship ’ between the Khmer Rouge and China . 
 = = Diplomacy and military action = = 
 = = = 1975 – 76 , from fighting to building friendly relations = = = 
 The conclusion of the Cambodian Civil War and the Fall of Saigon in April 1975 immediately brought a new conflict between Vietnam and Kampuchea . Although both the North Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge had previously fought side by side , the leaders of the newly created Democratic Kampuchea continued to view Vietnam with great suspicion , because they believed the Vietnamese Communists had never given up their dream of creating an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the leader . For that reason , the Kampuchean Government decided to remove all North Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchean territory shortly after their capture of Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 . In the first major clash between the two former allies , the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army invaded the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc on 1 May 1975 ( barely 24 hours after Saigon fell ) , which they claimed was part of Kampuchea ’ s territory . 
 Nine days later , on 10 May 1975 , the Kampuchean military continued its incursion by capturing <unk> Chu , where it executed 500 Vietnamese civilians . The Vietnamese military immediately responded to Kampuchean actions by launching a counter @-@ attack and removing Kampuchean forces from Phu Quoc and Tho Chu , and then invading the Kampuchean island of Koh Wai . In June 1975 , while on a visit to Hanoi , Kampuchean leader Pol Pot proposed that Vietnam and his country should sign a treaty of friendship and begin discussions on border disputes . However , those discussions never materialised , and the Kampucheans claimed that Vietnam turned down both offers . In August 1975 , Vietnam returned the island of Koh Wai to Kampuchea and formally recognised Kampuchean sovereignty over the island . 
 Following those incidents , both countries attempted to improve their diplomatic relations with a series of congratulatory messages and exchange visits . On 17 April 1976 , Vietnamese leaders sent a message to congratulate Khieu Samphan , Nuon Chea and Pol Pot on their " elections " as President , President of the People ’ s Representatives and Premier of Kampuchea , respectively . Furthermore , the Vietnamese even denounced the alleged " U.S. bombing " of Siem Reap in February 1976 , thereby reinforcing the Kampuchean ’ s fictitious claim over the incident . In response , in June 1976 , the Kampuchean leadership sent a message to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam , which had governed South Vietnam since the fall of Saigon , congratulating them on the seventh anniversary of their establishment . 
 In July 1976 , following the establishment of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam as a reunified country , Phnom Penh Radio broadcast a commentary which proclaimed the " militant solidarity and friendship between peoples of Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam grow constantly greener and sturdier " . However , during that same month , Premier Pol Pot publicly hinted at tensions between Vietnam and Kampuchea when he told a visiting Vietnamese media delegation that there were “ obstacles and difficulties ” in the relationship between the two countries . Nonetheless , on 21 September 1976 , the first air service connecting Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with Phnom Penh was established . Then in December 1976 , the Kampuchean Revolutionary Organisation sent greetings to the Vietnamese Communist Party during their Fourth Congress . 
 = = = 1977 , build @-@ up to war = = = 
 Towards the end of 1976 , while Vietnam and Kampuchea publicly appeared to be improving their relationships , the private suspicions of both countries ' leadership grew . From the Vietnamese perspective , they were the patron of genuine Marxist – Leninist revolutions in South East Asia , so it was vital for them to exercise control over the Kampucheans and the Laotians . Indeed , that was the reason North Vietnam supported the Khmer Rouge during their fight against the Lon Nol regime , in the hope that the Kampuchean communists would adopt a pro @-@ Vietnamese line upon their victory in the same way the Pathet Lao had done . However , their hopes were dashed as early as 1973 , because North Vietnamese military formations operating in Khmer Rouge @-@ occupied territories were occasionally subjected to armed attacks by their own allies . The Vietnamese position inside Kampuchea was further weakened after the end of the war , as there were no pro @-@ Vietnamese elements left within the Kampuchean Communist Party . 
 Thus , when the pro @-@ Chinese Pol Pot and his brother @-@ in @-@ law Ieng Sary resigned from their respective positions as Premier and Foreign Minister in September 1976 , Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng and General Secretary of the Communist Party Lê Duẩn were optimistic that Vietnam could exercise greater influence on the Kampucheans . In a private meeting with the Soviet ambassador to Vietnam on 16 November 1976 , Lê Duẩn dismissed both Ieng Sary and Pol Pot as " bad people " for their pro @-@ Chinese policies . Le Duan then asserted that Nuon Chea , who had ascended to the position of Premier of Democratic Kampuchea as Pol Pot 's replacement , was a person of pro @-@ Vietnamese orientation , so Vietnam could exercise its influence through him . However , the events which developed over the next few months would prove Lê Duẩn had been mistaken in his assessment of Nuon Chea . 
 Meanwhile , in Phnom Penh , the Kampuchean leadership had developed a seething fear and hatred of the Vietnamese leadership as a result of Vietnam ’ s historical dominance over their country . From the Kampuchean perspective , the Vietnamese strategy to dominate Indochina involved infiltrating the communist parties of Kampuchea and Laos with Vietnamese @-@ trained cadres . For that reason , when the first group of North Vietnamese @-@ trained Khmer Rouge personnel returned to the country , they were immediately purged from the KCP . During the months following the defeat of the Lon Nol regime , Pol Pot continued to purge the KCP and the Government of Democratic Kampuchea of those who he believed to be Soviet and Vietnamese agents . Then , in the context of the triumphalism , which prevailed over the Khmer Rouge leadership in a war that they claimed they had single @-@ handedly defeated the " American imperialist " , Democratic Kampuchea began to embark on a war against Vietnam . 
 As the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army made preparations for its war against Vietnam , state @-@ controlled media in Vietnam sent congratulatory messages to the Government of the Democratic Kampuchea on the second anniversary of its establishment , on 17 April 1977 . On 30 April 1977 , the second anniversary of the fall of Saigon , the Kampuchean reply came in the form of a military attack against the Vietnamese provinces of An Giang and Châu Đốc , killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians . The Vietnam People 's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and , on 7 June 1977 , Vietnam proposed high @-@ level talks to discuss outstanding issues . On 18 June 1977 , the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas , and create a demilitarised zone between the opposing forces . 
 Both sides ignored each other 's proposals , and the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army continued sending soldiers across the border to attack Vietnamese towns and villages . In September 1977 , Kampuchean artillery struck several Vietnamese villages along the border , and six villages in Đồng Tháp Province were overrun by Kampuchean infantry . Shortly afterwards , six divisions of the Kampuchea Revolutionary Army advanced about 10 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) into Tay Ninh Province , where they killed more than 1 @,@ 000 Vietnamese civilians . Angered by the scale of Kampuchean assaults , the Vietnam People ’ s Army ( VPA ) assembled eight divisions , estimated at around 60 @,@ 000 soldiers , to launch a retaliatory strike against Kampuchea . On 16 December 1977 , the VPA divisions , with support from elements of the Vietnam People 's Air Force , crossed the border along several axes with the objective of forcing the Kampuchean Government to negotiate . 
 On the battlefield , the Kampucheans quickly lost ground as their combat units were pushed back by the Vietnamese . By the end of December 1977 , Vietnam had won a clear military victory over Kampuchea , as Vietnamese formations marched through Svay Rieng Province and only stopped short of entering the provincial capital . Despite the ferocity of the Vietnamese retaliation , the Kampuchean Government remained defiant . On 31 December 1977 , Khieu <unk> declared that the Kampuchean Government would " temporarily " sever diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the Vietnamese military withdraw from the " sacred territory of Democratic Kampuchea " . On 6 January 1978 , VPA divisions were only 38 kilometers ( 24 mi ) from Phnom Penh , but the Vietnamese Government decided to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea because they had failed to achieve Vietnam ’ s political objective . During the withdrawal , the Vietnamese military also evacuated thousands of prisoners and civilian refugees , including future leader Hun Sen. 
 = = = 1978 , preparations for regime change = = = 
 Instead of being sobered by the Vietnamese show of force , the Kampuchean Government boasted that the Vietnamese withdrawal was a major victory for Democratic Kampuchea , comparing it to the “ defeat of U.S. imperialism ” on 17 April 1975 . The Kampucheans went on further to proclaim that " our 6 January victory over the <unk> , Vietnamese aggressor enemy has given all of us greater confidence in the forces of our people and nation , in our Kampuchean Communist Party and our Kampuchean Revolutionary Army , and in our Party ’ s line of people ’ s war " . The Kampuchean leadership claimed that one Kampuchean soldier was equal to 30 Vietnamese soldiers , so if Kampuchea could raise two million soldiers from a population of eight million , it could wipe out Vietnam ’ s population of 50 million and still have six million people left . In reality , Kampuchean leaders simply ignored the condition of the population in their own country and Vietnam ; the Vietnamese , though poor , were in good physical condition , while Kampuchea 's population was physically and mentally exhausted from years of hard labour , starvation and disease . 
 In addition to the disparity in population , there was also a great disparity between the fighting capabilities of the armed forces of the two countries . In 1977 , Vietnam was estimated to have 615 @,@ 000 soldiers and 900 tanks , supported by a 12 @,@ 000 @-@ member air force with 300 combat aircraft , including one squadron of light bombers . In comparison , Kampuchea had an army of 70 @,@ 000 , only a few heavy tanks , 200 armoured vehicles , and limited air capability . Despite facing such heavy odds , Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam ’ s border regions . In January 1978 , Kampuchean forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in Hà Tiên Province . On 27 January 1978 , Vietnam started calling on the Kampuchean military along the border regions to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime . 
 Against the backdrop of military clashes , between 9 January and 20 February 1978 , Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Phan Hien made several trips to Beijing to hold discussions with representatives of the Kampuchean Government , which ultimately proved to be fruitless . On 18 January 1978 , China attempted to mediate further negotiations between Kampuchea and Vietnam when Vice Premier Deng Yingchao travelled to Phnom Penh , where she was met with strong resistance by Kampuchean leaders . Meanwhile , Vietnamese government officials began conducting secret meetings with So <unk> , the Khmer Rouge leader in Kampuchea 's Eastern Military Zone , to plan a military uprising backed by Vietnam . During that same period , military setbacks experienced by the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army in the Eastern Military Zone prompted Pol Pot to label the region as a " nest of traitors " . 
 In order to purge the Eastern Military Zone of those he perceived to have been contaminated by the Vietnamese , Pol Pot ordered military units from the Southwest Zone to move into eastern Kampuchea and eliminate the " hidden traitors " . Unable to withstand an attack from the Kampuchea Government , So <unk> committed suicide while his deputy Heng Samrin defected to Vietnam . On 12 April 1978 , the Kampuchean Government declared they and Vietnam could negotiate again if the Vietnamese gave up their expansionist ambitions and recognised Kampuchea ’ s sovereignty . However , there was also a pre @-@ condition requiring Vietnam to meet several obligations through a seven @-@ month trial ceasefire . The Vietnamese Government immediately rejected the demand and , in response , two Kampuchean divisions penetrated up to 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) into Vietnamese territory , and massacred over 3 @,@ 000 Vietnamese civilians in the village of Ba <unk> in An Giang Province . 
 In June 1978 , the Vietnamese Air Force started bombing Kampuchean positions along the border regions , flying about 30 bombing sorties per day and inflicting heavy casualties on the Kampucheans . By that stage in the conflict , most surviving leaders of the Eastern Military Zone had escaped into Vietnam , where they assembled at various secret camps with the purpose of forming a Vietnamese @-@ backed " liberation army " to fight against the Khmer Rouge regime . Meanwhile , the Vietnamese Communist Party Politburo was meeting in Hanoi to discuss its strategy for Kampuchea . It concluded that the Khmer Rouge regime was a proxy of China , which had been trying to fill the power vacuum following the withdrawal of the United States . As such , China was identified as Vietnam ’ s main enemy , and its client regime in Phnom Penh had to be removed by conventional military force , because the Vietnamese adaptation of the Maoist " people 's war " doctrine had not been a success against the Khmer Rouge ’ s security apparatus . 
 To reflect the attitude of the country ’ s leaders , Vietnam 's state @-@ controlled media stepped up its propaganda war against the Khmer Rouge , with the official Nhân Dân newspaper regularly calling for international intervention to save the Kampuchean people from domestic terror initiated by the Khmer Rouge regime . Furthermore , instead of sending congratulatory messages like they had done in the previous years , the Vietnamese media changed their tone and began referring to the Kampuchean Government as the " Pol Pot @-@ Ieng Sary clique " as the Kampuchean military continued their campaign in Vietnam . By the end of June , the Vietnamese military assembled a multi @-@ division task force to launch another limited @-@ objective campaign against the Kampucheans . Again , the Vietnamese pushed the Kampuchean forces back into the provincial cities of <unk> and Prey Veng and then pulled out . However , as they had done before , the Kampuchean Army moved its artillery back towards the border and continued shelling Vietnamese villages as though nothing had happened . 
 During the second half of 1978 , Vietnamese leaders devoted much of their energy towards the military campaign against the Khmer Rouge regime , by seeking political support from the Soviet Union . In a briefing with Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials on 25 July 1978 , the Soviet chargé d 'affaires in Hanoi was told that the Kampuchean Government had deployed 14 of its 17 regular army divisions and 16 local regiments along the border with Vietnam . Then , in early September 1978 , Lê Duẩn informed the Soviet ambassador that Vietnam aimed to " solve fully this question of Kampuchea by the beginning of 1979 " . While Vietnam was laying the political foundation for the military campaign against Kampuchea , Soviet ships were reported to be unloading military hardware and ammunition in Cam Ranh Bay . In October 1978 , Vietnamese radio broadcast what they claimed were accounts of uprisings against the Khmer Rouge regime , urging members of the Kampuchean military either to overthrow the " Pol Pot @-@ Ieng Sary clique " or defect to Vietnam . 
 In a major turning point in the course of Soviet @-@ Vietnamese and Sino @-@ Vietnamese diplomatic relations , and ultimately the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea , a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed between Vietnam and the Soviet Union on 3 November 1978 , which guaranteed the former of vital Soviet military aid in the scenario that China intervened in the conflict . Later , in November 1978 , a command and control headquarters was established for the planned invasion of Kampuchea , with Senior General Lê Đức Anh taking full control of VPA units along the border areas . The Vietnamese government drafted 350 @,@ 000 men into the military to replace earlier losses and augment its units along the border . While the new recruits were completing training , ten divisions were deployed to the border regions of Long An , Đồng Tháp and Tây Ninh provinces . Vietnam also shifted three divisions based in Laos south towards the Laos @-@ Kampuchea border . On 13 December 1978 , the Chinese Government warned Vietnam that its patience was limited , and that Vietnam would be punished if it behaved in an " unbridled fashion " . 
 Nonetheless , the final piece of the Vietnamese strategy emerged when Vietnam announced the formation of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation ( KUFNS ) in the " liberation zones " of Kampuchea . Hanoi claimed that KUFNS was an independent Kampuchean communist movement , with members drawn from all walks of life . Heng Samrin , formerly a member of the Khmer Rouge and commander of the Kampuchean 4th Division , was the chairman of the KUFNS Central Committee . Previously , the KUFNS was known as the Provisional Revolutionary Government of Kampuchea ( <unk> ) , which consisted of 300 former Khmer Rouge cadres who defected to Vietnam . The <unk> regularly sent representatives abroad in search of support , before Vietnam abandoned the ‘ people ’ s war ’ concept in favour of a conventional military campaign . 
 Not to be outdone by the Vietnamese military build @-@ up , the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was busy strengthening its armed forces with Chinese support . In previous years , China had only provided the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army with a limited amount of arms and ammunition , but as relations with Vietnam worsened in 1978 , Beijing established additional supply routes through Kampuchea and increased the volume of military hardware which travelled down each route . On the eve of the Vietnamese invasion , Kampuchea had an estimated 73 @,@ 000 soldiers in the Eastern Military Zone bordering Vietnam . At that time , all branches of the Kampuchean armed forces were significantly strengthened by large quantities of Chinese @-@ made military equipment , which included fighter aircraft , patrol boats , heavy artillery , anti @-@ aircraft guns , trucks and tanks . Additionally , there were between 10 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 Chinese advisers in both military and civilian capacities , providing their support to the Khmer Rouge regime . 
 = = Invasion of Kampuchea = = 
 On 21 December 1978 , Kampuchea ’ s new @-@ found strength was tested when a Vietnamese offensive , consisting of two divisions , crossed the border and moved towards the town of Kratie , while other support divisions were deployed along local routes to cut off the logistical tail of Kampuchean units . Despite enjoying generous support from China , the Kampuchean military could not withstand the Vietnamese offensive and suffered heavy casualties . Finally , on 25 December 1978 , Vietnam launched a full @-@ scale invasion using 13 divisions , estimated at 150 @,@ 000 soldiers well @-@ supported by heavy artillery and air power . Initially , Kampuchea directly challenged Vietnam ’ s military might through conventional fighting methods , but this tactic resulted in the loss of half of the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army within two weeks . Heavy defeats on the battlefield prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country . On 7 January 1979 , the Vietnamese Army entered Phnom Penh along with members of the KUFNS . On the following day , a pro @-@ Vietnamese Kampuchean state , known as the People 's Republic of Kampuchea ( PRK ) , was established , with Heng Samrin as the Chief of State and Pen Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party . 
 The Khmer Rouge leadership , with much of its political and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion , was forced to take refuge in Thailand , where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government . Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees , the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in <unk> Province . Meanwhile , in Phnom Penh , the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country ’ s economic and social life , which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare . However , efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered by the lack of educated and qualified personnel , as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years . By the end of the year , the new regime ’ s attempts at nation @-@ building were further challenged by several anti @-@ Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country . 
 = = = Response from the international community = = = 
 Shortly after the fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979 , representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council , so Prince Norodom Sihanouk could present the deposed regime 's case . Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia , the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance . Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge , he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea ’ s sovereignty . As such , he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese @-@ installed regime . Subsequently , seven non @-@ aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea , which was endorsed by China , France , Norway , Portugal , the United States and the United Kingdom . However , the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia . Critics of Vietnamese actions held that they did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot 's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina . 
 Between 16 – 19 February 1979 Vietnam and the new Kampuchean regime held a summit meeting which concluded with the two countries signing the Treaty of Peace , Friendship and Cooperation . Article 2 of the treaty stated that the security of Vietnam and Kampuchea were interrelated ; thus they would help defend each other “ against schemes and acts of sabotage by the imperialist and international reactionary forces ” , thereby legitimising the presence of Vietnamese troops on Kampuchean soil . Soon afterwards , the Soviet Union , the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and India recognised the Vietnamese @-@ installed People ’ s Republic of Kampuchea . The Soviet Government praised the PRK 's " remarkable victory " and expressed its full support for the regime 's advance towards socialism . Furthermore , the Soviets harshly criticised the Khmer Rouge regime 's record of terror , which they implied had been imposed by China . 
 At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly , representatives of the People 's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country . The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council that it was the sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people . In response , the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three , despite the Khmer Rouge 's blood @-@ stained record while in power . Accordingly , representatives of Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly , with strong support from China . By January 1980 , 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People 's Republic of Kampuchea , yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea . At the same time , the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam ’ s use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime . 
 Thailand , which shared an 800 @-@ kilometer ( 500 @-@ mile ) border with Kampuchea and has historically feared Vietnam 's expansionism , demanded that Vietnam immediately remove its troops from Kampuchea so its people could elect a government free from foreign intervention . Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines and Singapore showed their support for Thailand 's position . Furthermore , ASEAN viewed Vietnam ’ s invasion and subsequent occupation of Kampuchea , which received strong Soviet support , as an intolerable threat to the region ’ s security and stability . That view was shared by China , which went as far as accusing Vietnam of forcing Kampuchea into an Indochinese federation to serve as an outpost of Soviet global hegemony . The United States , which never maintained any form of diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge ’ s Democratic Kampuchea , showed strong support for the membership of their former enemy in the UN General Assembly , and echoed ASEAN 's call for an immediate withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Kampuchea . 
 = = = China invades Vietnam = = = 
 On 17 February 1979 , China retaliated against Vietnam 's invasion of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino @-@ Vietnam border , and within ten days had reached the provincial capitals . Fighting bogged down due to the maze of tunnels the Chinese encountered ; nevertheless , the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and <unk> Sơn on 4 March , reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed , though not on good terms with its supply lines . However , the following day , China announced that it would not move deeper into Vietnam , apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by the well trained and experienced Vietnamese forces , supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War . Confident that the threat of invasion had been a success , the Chinese retreated , leaving a path of destruction spanning 500 kilometers ( 310 mi ) in their wake . Although Chinese total losses were estimated to be higher than those of the Vietnamese ( 12 – 50 @,@ 000 compared to the Vietnamese death toll of approximately 10 @,@ 000 ) , the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations , making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription , and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino @-@ Vietnamese border . 
 = = = Internal resistance to the new regime = = = 
 When the Khmer Rouge regime was removed from power in January 1979 , the Kampuchean people hoped that peace and liberty would return to their country . This was reinforced by the Constitution of the People ’ s Republic of Kampuchea , proclaimed in 1981 , which specifically stated that Kampuchea is an independent , peaceful state where power belongs to the people . However , there was a deep contrast between what was written within the Kampuchean constitution and reality , because the Kampuchean people began to despair at what they viewed as the Vietnamese occupation of their country , rather than a liberation that had freed them from the brutality of Democratic Kampuchea . That perception was reinforced by the presence of Vietnamese advisers who worked at every level of Heng Samrin 's Kampuchean Government . In 1986 , for example , there was one Vietnamese adviser for every Kampuchean cabinet minister and one adviser for each one of their three deputy ministers . Furthermore , it was reported that final decisions made by a Kampuchean minister had to receive final approval from the Vietnamese adviser , who usually dictated policies . Opposition to Vietnamese was further fomented by human rights abuses committed by the Vietnamese and their allies . To fulfill its K5 Plan , a construction project to strengthen the Cambodia @-@ Thai border , the PRK government <unk> 380 @,@ 000 people , with large numbers succumbing to malaria . 
 To resist the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea and the regime which they installed , the Khmer Rouge called on the Kampuchean people to unite and fight the Vietnamese . However , due to the brutality which they had experienced under the deposed regime , many Kampucheans believed that any political movement aimed at restoring national freedom must oppose both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese . In response to such preconditions , two non @-@ communist movements were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation . The first group , a right @-@ wing and pro @-@ Western organisation , was formed in October 1979 by former Prime Minister Son Sann and was called the Khmer People 's National Liberation Front ( KPNLF ) . The KPNLF operated from several refugee camps on the Thai @-@ Cambodian border , where it controlled thousands of civilians . At its peak , the armed branch of the KPNLF were estimated to have between 12 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 fighters , but a third of that number were lost through fighting and desertions during the Vietnamese dry season offensive of 1984 @-@ 85 . Nonetheless , the KPNLF continued to operate in small groups , harassing the Vietnamese and their Kampuchean allies using guerrilla tactics . 
 The other non @-@ communist organisation was the National United Front for an Independent , Peaceful , Neutral , and Cooperative Cambodia , formed by Sihanouk and known by its French acronym FUNCINPEC . The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the Khmer Rouge following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council . As the leader of FUNCINPEC , Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer Rouge representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea ’ s seat at the UN vacant on the basis that neither the Khmer Rouge nor the Vietnamese @-@ installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people . He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition of the Khmer Rouge , and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group . Despite the strength , effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC , both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity , leadership struggles , corruption and alleged abuses of human rights . 
 In the early days of the Vietnamese occupation , the Kampuchean resistance groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences . Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition , by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community . ASEAN , which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979 , urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood @-@ stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non @-@ communist movements . However , the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF , because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality . Nonetheless , early in 1981 , Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan , President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea , to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance . 
 In August 1981 , unity talks between the three organizations appeared to have collapsed as a result of conflicting interests . Sihanouk , who feared the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge , proposed that all resistance groups disarm themselves following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea . Meanwhile , Son Sann demanded that the KPNLF be the lead organization within the proposed alliance , and the leaders of the Khmer Rouge " most compromised " by the atrocities in Kampuchea be exiled to China . Against these preconditions , Khieu Samphan reminded his rivals that the autonomy of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea should not be undermined . On 22 November 1982 , Singapore , with the backing of ASEAN , proposed that three organizations form a coalition government with equal decision @-@ making powers within the alliance . Singapore ’ s proposal was welcomed by Sihanouk , who believed it was a fair deal for the non @-@ communist movements . 
 Khieu Samphan , on the other hand , rejected that idea , viewing it as an attempt by Sihanouk and Son Sann to isolate the Khmer Rouge . However , Sihanouk knew that Chinese support would not be made available to the FUNCINPEC unless he made some compromises and joined the Khmer Rouge on their terms . So , in February 1982 , Sihanouk met with Khieu Samphan in Beijing to work out their differences . In what he described as " another concession " , Khieu Samphan proposed forming a coalition government without integrating the other resistance groups into institutions associated with Democratic Kampuchea . However , he emphasized that all parties must defend the legal status of Democratic Kampuchea as the legitimate state representing Kampuchea on the world stage . In May 1982 , with the urging of Sihanouk , Son Sann decided to form a coalition government with the Khmer Rouge . 
 On 22 June 1982 , leaders of the three organizations formalized the formation of their coalition government by signing a Thai @-@ sponsored agreement which established the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea ( CGDK ) . Accordingly , the CGDK ’ s Inner Cabinet consisted of Sihanouk as the President of Democratic Kampuchea , Khieu Samphan as the Vice @-@ President in charge of foreign affairs and Son Sann as Prime Minister . Below the Inner Cabinet were six separate committees responsible for national defence , economy and finance , social affairs and public health , military affairs and the media . By 1987 , Democratic Kampuchea still held its membership at the UN General Assembly , even though it lacked four criteria of statehood : people , territory , government and supreme authority within the borders of a country . In spite of those limitations , forces of the three armed factions within the CGDK continued to fight the Vietnamese to achieve their objective of “ bring about the implementation of the International Conference on Cambodia and other relevant UN General Assembly resolutions ” .

 In 1978 , when Vietnamese leaders launched their invasion of Kampuchea to remove the Khmer Rouge regime , they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community . However , the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause . Instead of backing Vietnam , most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese use of force against Kampuchea , and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality . Thus , more than just a military problem , Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena . Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea , the Vietnamese Government , and the PRK regime which it installed , were placed on the periphery of the international community . 
 The international community ’ s political stance towards Kampuchea had a severe impact on the Vietnamese economy , which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts . The United States , which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam , convinced other countries of the United Nations to deprive Vietnam and the People ’ s Republic of Kampuchea of much @-@ needed funds by denying them membership to major international organisations such as the World Bank , the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund . In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending all economic aid to Vietnam , and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea , the Sino @-@ Soviet rivalry and the problem of the boat people . Sweden , which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West , also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as virtually every other country cancelled its aid . 
 In addition to external pressure , domestic policies implemented by the Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven to be largely ineffective in stimulating the country ’ s economic growth . By building on the Soviet model of central economic planning , Vietnam placed most emphasis on the development of heavy industries , while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated . Furthermore , attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos , as economic output were driven down by dislocation of the general population . In addition to those failed economic policies , Vietnam maintained the fifth largest armed forces in the world , with 1 @.@ 26 million regular soldiers under arms , 180 @,@ 000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984 . Consequently , the Vietnamese Government had to spend one @-@ third of its budget on the military and the campaign in Kampuchea , despite receiving $ 1 @.@ 2 billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union , thus further hampering Vietnam ’ s economic rebuilding efforts . 
 To avoid engaging in a debilitating conflict with various local armed resistance groups within the context of international pressure , Vietnam began withdrawing its military forces from Kampuchea as early as 1982 . But the withdrawal process lacked international verification , so foreign observers simply dismissed Vietnam ’ s movement of troops as mere rotations . In 1984 , in order to disengage from Kampuchea , Vietnam unveiled a five @-@ phase strategy known as the K5 Plan , which was authored by General Le Duc Anh , who had led the Vietnamese campaign in Kampuchea . The first phase required the Vietnamese military to capture the bases of armed groups in western Kampuchea and along the border with Thailand . The following phases included sealing off the border with Thailand , destroying local resistance groups , providing security for the population , and building @-@ up the Kampuchean People ’ s Revolutionary Armed Forces . Foreign observers believed that the Vietnamese Army completed the first phase of the K5 Plan during the dry season offensive of 1984 @-@ 85 , when the base camps of several anti @-@ Vietnamese resistance groups were overrun . Afterwards , the majority of ten Vietnamese divisions were assigned to operations on the frontiers , with the remainder staying in major provinces to protect the local population and to train the Kampuchean armed forces . 
 By 1985 , international isolation and economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely more and more on the Soviet Union for help . During the Chinese invasion in February 1979 , the Soviet Union provided $ 1 @.@ 4 billion worth of military aid to Vietnam , a figure that peaked at $ 1 @.@ 7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985 . Then , to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan ( 1981 – 1985 ) , the Soviet Union provided a sum of $ 5 @.@ 4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures ; economic aid ultimately reached $ 1 @.@ 8 billion annually . The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam ’ s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports . Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally , privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi 's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms . In 1986 , the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations ; for Vietnam , those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one @-@ third of its military aid . 
 To reengage with the international community , and to deal with the economic challenges brought by the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , Vietnamese leaders decided to embark on a series of reforms . At the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986 , newly appointed General Secretary of the VCP Nguyen Van Linh introduced a major reform known as Doi Moi , the Vietnamese term for " renovation " , in order to fix Vietnam ’ s economic problems . However , Vietnamese leaders concluded that Vietnam ’ s dire economic situation came as a result of the international isolation which followed its invasion of Kampuchea in 1978 , and that for Doi Moi to be successful it needed radical changes in defence and foreign policy . Subsequently , in June 1987 , the Vietnamese Politburo adopted a new defence strategy in Resolution No. 2 , calling for the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese soldiers from international duties , a reduction in the size of the army through a discharge of 600 @,@ 000 soldiers and the establishment of a set ratio for military expenditures . 
 Then , on 13 May 1988 , the Vietnamese Politburo adopted Resolution No.13 on foreign policy , which aimed to achieve diversification and <unk> of Vietnam 's foreign relations . Its main objectives were to end the embargoes imposed by UN members , integrate Vietnam with the regional and international community and ultimately attract foreign investment and development aid . As part of this change , Vietnam ceased to regard the United States as a long @-@ term foe and China as an imminent and dangerous enemy . In addition , official Vietnamese propaganda stopped labelling ASEAN as a " NATO @-@ type " organisation . To implement the new reforms , Vietnam , with support from the Soviet Union , started transferring several years ' worth of military equipment to the <unk> , which numbered more than 70 @,@ 000 soldiers . The Vietnamese Ministry of Defense ’ s International Relations Department then advised its Kampuchean counterparts to only use the available equipment to maintain their current level of operations , and not to engage in major operations which could exhaust those supplies . 
 In 1988 , Vietnam was estimated to have about 100 @,@ 000 troops in Kampuchea , but , sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach , the Vietnamese Government began withdrawing forces in earnest . Between April and July 1989 , 24 @,@ 000 Vietnamese soldiers returned home . Then , between 21 and 26 September 1989 , after suffering 15 @,@ 000 soldiers killed and another 30 @,@ 000 wounded during the 10 @-@ year occupation , Vietnam ’ s commitment to Kampuchea was officially over , when the remaining 26 @,@ 000 Vietnamese soldiers were pulled out . However , armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese @-@ installed PRK regime claimed that Vietnamese troops were still operating on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989 . For example , non @-@ communist groups engaging in land @-@ grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite Vietnamese Special Forces near Tamar <unk> along Route 69 . Then , in March 1991 , Vietnamese units were reported to have re @-@ entered Kampot Province to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive . Despite such claims , on 23 October 1991 , the Vietnamese Government signed the Paris Peace Agreement , which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea .

 On 14 January 1985 , Hun Sen was appointed Prime Minister of the People 's Republic of Kampuchea and began peace talks with the factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea . Between 2 – 4 December 1987 , Hun Sen met with Sihanouk at Fère @-@ en @-@ <unk> in France to discuss the future of Kampuchea . Further talks occurred between 20 – 21 January 1988 , and Hun Sen offered Sihanouk a position within the Kampuchean Government on the condition that he returned to Kampuchea straightaway . However , Sihanouk did not accept the offer , even as preparations were made in Phnom Penh to receive him . Despite that failure , Hun Sen ’ s Kampuchean Government was able to persuade Cheng Heng and In Tam , both ministers in Lon Nol ’ s regime , to return to Kampuchea . In the first major step towards restoring peace in Kampuchea , representatives of the CGDK and the PRK met for the first time at the First Jakarta Informal Meeting on 25 July 1988 . In that meeting , Sihanouk proposed a three @-@ stage plan , which called for a cease @-@ fire , a UN peacekeeping force to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the integration of all Kampuchean armed factions into a single army . 
 Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach urged all parties involved to separate Kampuchean problems into internal and external aspects . Therefore , to begin the process of restoring peace , the Vietnamese delegation proposed a two @-@ stage plan that began with internal discussions among the Kampuchean factions , followed by a roundtable discussion with all involved countries . The Vietnamese proposal won out at the meeting , but no agreements were reached . At the Second Jakarta Meeting , on 19 February 1989 , Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans forwarded the Cambodian Peace Plan to bring about a ceasefire , a peacekeeping force and the establishment of a national unity government to maintain Kampuchea ’ s sovereignty until elections were held . To facilitate a peace agreement on the eve of the Vietnamese withdrawal , between 29 – 30 April 1989 , Hun Sen convened a meeting of the National Assembly to adopt a new constitution , and the country was renamed the State of Cambodia to reflect the state of ambiguity of the country ’ s sovereignty . Furthermore , Buddhism was re @-@ established as the state religion , and citizens were guaranteed the right to hold private property . 
 In the meantime , however , peace talks between the warring factions continued , with the First Paris Peace Conference on Cambodia held in Paris in 1989 . On 26 February 1990 , following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops , the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting was held , at which the Supreme National Council was established to safeguard Cambodian sovereignty . Initially , the Supreme National Council was to have 12 members , with three seats allocated to each faction of the CGDK , and three to the pro @-@ Vietnam Kampuchean People ’ s Revolutionary Party . However , Hun Sen objected to the proposed arrangement , calling instead for each faction of the CGDK to be given two seats for a total of six , and the Kampuchean People ’ s Revolutionary Party to have six seats . In 1991 the Supreme National Council began representing Cambodia at the UN General Assembly . Then , in a bold move , Hun Sen renamed the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party to the Cambodian People 's Party in an effort to portray his party as a democratic institution and renounce its revolutionary struggle . 
 On 23 October 1991 , the Cambodian factions of the Supreme National Council , along with Vietnam and 15 member nations of the International Peace Conference on Cambodia , signed the Paris Peace Agreement . For the Cambodian people , two decades of continuous warfare and 13 years of civil war seemed to be over , although an atmosphere of uneasiness amongst the leaders of the Cambodian factions remained . In order to include the Khmer Rouge in the agreement , the major powers agreed to avoid using the word " genocide " to describe the actions of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea in the period between 1975 and 1979 . As a result , Hun Sen criticised the Paris Agreement as being far from perfect , as it failed to remind the Cambodian people of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge regime . Nonetheless , the Paris Agreement established the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) , in accordance with the UN Security Council ’ s Resolution 745 , and gave UNTAC a broad mandate to supervise main policies and administration works until a Cambodian government was democratically elected . 
 On 14 November 1991 , Sihanouk returned to Cambodia to participate in the elections , followed by Son Senn , a Khmer Rouge official , who arrived a few days later to set up the organisation 's electoral campaign office in Phnom Penh . On 27 November 1991 , Khieu Samphan also returned to Cambodia on a flight from Bangkok ; initially he had expected his arrival to be uneventful , but as soon as Khieu Samphan 's flight landed at Pochentong Airport , he was met by an angry crowd which shouted insults and abuses at him . As Khieu Samphan was driven into the city , another crowd lined the route towards his office and threw objects at his car . As soon as he arrived at his office , Khieu Samphan entered and immediately telephoned the Chinese Government to save him . Shortly afterwards , an angry mob forced its way into the building , chased Khieu Samphan up the second floor and tried to hang him from a ceiling fan . Eventually , Khieu Samphan was able to escape from the building by a ladder with his face bloodied , and was immediately taken to Pochentong Airport , where he flew out of Cambodia . Thus , with the departure of Khieu Samphan , the Khmer Rouge ’ s participation in the election seemed doubtful . 
 In March 1992 , the start of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22 @,@ 000 UN peacekeepers , which included troops from 22 countries , 6 @,@ 000 officials , 3 @,@ 500 police and 1 @,@ 700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers . The mission was led by Yasushi Akashi . In June 1992 , the Khmer Rouge formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea , and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections . Furthermore , the Khmer Rouge also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement . Then , to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections , the Khmer Rouge started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities , causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia . Towards the end of 1992 , Khmer Rouge forces advanced into Kampong Thom in order to gain a strategic foothold , before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there . In the months leading up to the elections , several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge @-@ held territory . 
 Despite ongoing threats from the Khmer Rouge during the elections , on 28 May 1993 , FUNCINPEC won 45 @.@ 47 percent of the vote , against 38 @.@ 23 percent for the Cambodian People ’ s Party . Though clearly defeated , Hun Sen refused to accept the results of the election , so his Defense Minister , Sin Song , announced the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia , which had supported the Cambodian People ’ s Party . Prince Norodom Ranariddh , leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk , agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People ’ s Party so the country would not break up . On 21 September 1993 , the Cambodian Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister , and he appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister . On 23 September 1993 , the constitutional monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state . In July 1994 , the Cambodian Government outlawed the Khmer Rouge for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement . Most significantly , the Cambodian Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea . By 1998 , the Khmer Rouge was completely dissolved .

 The military occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy . Since gaining independence in 1954 , the Vietnamese communist perspective on foreign policy had been dominated by the need to maintain a world order of two camps , communist and non @-@ communist . Indeed , the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union , Laos and the People ’ s Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with that view . However , the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed , as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime . In the years that followed , the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations . Furthermore , the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China , the United States and the member nations of ASEAN . 
 In light of the decline experienced by the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe , the Vietnamese Government began repairing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries as part of a greater effort to rejuvenate Vietnam 's shattered economy . Since its invasion in 1979 , China had placed sustained pressure on the northern borders of Vietnam , with the province of Ha Tuyen regularly shelled by Chinese artillery . In September 1985 , Chinese bombardment of Ha Tuyen reached a peak when 2 @,@ 000 rounds were fired . To reduce the state of hostility along the border region , and ultimately normalise relations with China , the Vietnamese Government dropped all hostile references to China at the 6th National Party Congress in December 1986 , and also adopted the Doi Moi policy . In August 1990 , as the Cambodian Peace Plan , authored by Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans , was being endorsed by the UN Security Council , both China and Vietnam moved towards accommodation . 
 Early in September 1990 , Vietnamese Prime Minister Đỗ Mười , General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh and former Prime Minister Pham Van Dong travelled to Chengdu , China , where they held a secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin . On 17 September 1990 , General Võ Nguyên Giáp also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance . Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam 's diplomatic relations with China , Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh . However , as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power @-@ sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990 , Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re @-@ establish formal diplomatic relations . In November 1991 , newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt travelled to Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart , Li Peng , and they issued an 11 @-@ point communiqué re @-@ establishing diplomatic ties between the two countries after 10 years without formal relations . 
 The end of the Cambodian conflict also brought an end the ASEAN @-@ imposed trade and aid embargo which had been in place since 1979 . In January 1990 , Thai Prime Minister <unk> Choonhavan publicly voiced his support for Vietnam , and the rest of Indochina , to gain admission into ASEAN . In the period between late 1991 and early 1992 , Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN . As a result , between 1991 and 1994 , investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam . Aside from the obvious economic benefits , ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam 's national security against foreign threats in the post @-@ Cold War era , when Soviet aid was no longer available . Thus , on 28 July 1995 , Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN , after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994 . Then , in August 1995 , the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status , after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a formal normalisation of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995 , thereby ending Vietnam ’ s isolation from the United States . 
 = Lana Del Rey ( EP ) = 
 Lana Del Rey is the second EP by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey . It was released on January 10 , 2012 in the United States and Canada through Interscope Records . After publishing two unsuccessful works , her first EP , Kill Kill ; and her first studio album , Lana Del Ray , the four @-@ track EP was released in anticipation of Del Rey 's major label debut Born to Die ( 2012 ) . The tracks are influenced by several genres , including indie pop , hip hop , and alternative music . The lyrics and melody were written primarily by Del Rey , Patrik Berger , and Justin Parker . Production of the album was led by Emile Haynie , who also co @-@ wrote " Blue Jeans " . 
 Contemporary critics gave mixed reviews of the EP . Music videos accompanied each single , which were produced by Del Rey herself and uploaded to YouTube . Although the video for " Video Games " that Del Rey filmed with her webcam was not intended as a single at the time , it garnered enough online buzz to be noticed by Stranger Records , opening the opportunity for Del Rey to sign a joint record deal with Interscope and Polydor , leading to the eventual publication of the EP and additional videos for " Blue Jeans " and " Born to Die " . 
 Selling over 24 @,@ 000 copies in the United States , the EP peaked at number twenty on the Billboard 200 , peaking at six on the Rock Albums chart and six on the Alternative Albums chart . All four songs were released as singles on Born to Die , with three charting internationally .

 Del Rey was born in New York City , New York in 1985 and was raised in Lake Placid , a quiet village outside of New York . At age fifteen , she was sent to boarding school in Connecticut , before moving to New York City at eighteen to study metaphysics at Fordham University . While attending the university , according to Del Rey , her musical experience began here , discovering the right acquaintances on her own . After her uncle taught her how to play guitar , she realized that she could probably write " a million " songs with only those six chords . She then began performing in clubs in New York City , using various stage names such as Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena . Recalling the experience , Del Rey said , " I was always singing , but didn 't plan on pursuing it seriously . When I got to New York City when I was 18 , I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn – I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene , but we were playing for each other at that point – and that was it " . 
 At age twenty , Del Rey signed a USD $ 10 @,@ 000 recording contract and moved to a trailer park in New Jersey . The album that she recorded was later shelved , catalyzing her to pivot her focus . Instead , she began work in community service , and for the next five years , worked at homeless outreach , drug , and alcohol rehabilitation centers . She was quoted in an interview as saying , " The only passionate people I met in New York , were social workers . " A few years later , Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records , an independent record label owned by David Kahne . With the label , she released the three @-@ track EP , Kill Kill , in October 2008 and a full @-@ length studio album Lana Del Ray in 2010 . After hearing Del Rey 's demo , Kahne contacted her ; she obliged , knowing his reputation as a producer and his wish to produce music other than pop . Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey : " I wanted a name I could shape the music towards . I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time , speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside . It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue " . 
 After uploading a few of her tracks to her YouTube channel , Del Rey was discovered and got signed by Stranger Records to release her debut single " Video Games " . She told The Observer that " Video Games " was never intended to be a single , but she enjoyed the video and uploaded on the internet . The song earned her a Q Award for " Next Big Thing " in October 2011 . Later that month , she signed a joint record deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album , Born to Die . Del Rey built anticipation to the album by doing a number of live appearances , such as promotional concerts at the Bowery Ballroom and at the Chateau Marmont , and with performances at television shows such as De <unk> <unk> Door , and Later ... with Jools Holland . To further promote the upcoming release of Born to Die , Interscope Records released the EP in the United States and Canada on January 10 , 2012 . The four tracks that appear on the EP ( " Video Games " , " Born to Die " , " Blue Jeans " , and " Off to the Races " ) were previously available for purchase as singles in international markets . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Del Rey stated the use of her lower vocals on the tracks claiming that " people weren 't taking me very seriously , so I lowered my voice , believing that it would help me stand out . Now I sing quite low ... well , for a female anyway . " The singer 's first singles , " Video Games " and " Born to Die " were described variously as " quasi @-@ cabaret balladry " , " woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul " , " pop " , and " indie pop " . 
 Her own description of her music is " Hollywood <unk> " . In her own words , Del Rey described most of her songs being like " a dark love story seen through hopeful eyes . " Tim Lee of musicOMH noted the songs are extremely similar , commenting that " her ( alleged ) agents clearly having stumbled upon a formula with which they can ( allegedly ) print money and ( allegedly ) further consign Lana 's secretive , ( allegedly ) real debut LP to the annals of history . You didn 't hear it from us , right ? " Del Rey has once described herself as a " gangsta Nancy Sinatra " , though she cites Britney Spears , Elvis Presley , and Kurt Cobain as her musical influences . 
 The third track , " Blue Jeans " , was influenced by hip hop and has a minimalist beat that recalls songs by Timbaland . Del Rey also raps in a few verses of the song such as " You ’ re so fresh to death and sick as cancer [ ... ] Love you more than those bitches before " . " Off to the Races " has been lyrically described as " a freak show of inappropriate co @-@ dependency " , with a chorus that recalls Sheryl Crow 's " down and out drunken loner persona " in her 1994 single " Leaving Las Vegas " . <unk> Elan of NME noted the track " almost falls under the weight of this persona . There 's none of ' Video Games ' ' measured , piano @-@ led reflection . Instead the psychosexual rumblings of the lyrics and the dual voices she uses off set the comparatively simple musical shades on display . "

 John Bush of Allmusic considered the singer a femme fatale " with a smoky voice , a languorous image , and a modeling contract " .

 = Watson ( computer ) = 
 Watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language , developed in IBM 's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci . Watson was named after IBM 's first CEO and industrialist Thomas J. Watson . The computer system was specifically developed to answer questions on the quiz show Jeopardy ! . In 2011 , Watson competed on Jeopardy ! against former winners Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings . Watson received the first place prize of $ 1 million . 
 Watson had access to 200 million pages of structured and unstructured content consuming four terabytes of disk storage including the full text of Wikipedia , but was not connected to the Internet during the game . For each clue , Watson 's three most probable responses were displayed on the television screen . Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the game 's signaling device , but had trouble in a few categories , notably those having short clues containing only a few words . 
 In February 2013 , IBM announced that Watson software system 's first commercial application would be for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in conjunction with health insurance company WellPoint . IBM Watson 's former business chief Manoj Saxena says that 90 % of nurses in the field who use Watson now follow its guidance . 
 = = Description = = 
 Watson is a question answering ( QA ) computing system that IBM built to apply advanced natural language processing , information retrieval , knowledge representation , automated reasoning , and machine learning technologies to the field of open domain question answering . 
 The key difference between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns a list of documents , ranked in order of relevance to the query ( often based on popularity and page ranking ) , while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language , seeks to understand it in much greater detail , and returns a precise answer to the question . 
 According to IBM , " more than 100 different techniques are used to analyze natural language , identify sources , find and generate hypotheses , find and score evidence , and merge and rank hypotheses . " 
 = = = Software = = = 
 Watson uses IBM 's DeepQA software and the Apache <unk> ( <unk> Information Management Architecture ) framework . The system was written in various languages , including Java , C + + , and Prolog , and runs on the <unk> Linux Enterprise Server 11 operating system using Apache <unk> framework to provide distributed computing . 
 = = = Hardware = = = 
 The system is workload @-@ optimized , integrating massively parallel POWER7 processors and built on IBM 's DeepQA technology , which it uses to generate hypotheses , gather massive evidence , and analyze data . Watson employs a cluster of ninety IBM Power 750 servers , each of which uses a 3 @.@ 5 GHz POWER7 eight core processor , with four threads per core . In total , the system has 2 @,@ 880 POWER7 processor threads and 16 terabytes of RAM . 
 According to John Rennie , Watson can process 500 gigabytes , the equivalent of a million books , per second . IBM 's master inventor and senior consultant Tony Pearson estimated Watson 's hardware cost at about three million dollars . Its <unk> performance stands at 80 <unk> , which is about half as fast as the cut @-@ off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list . According to Rennie , all content was stored in Watson 's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions . 
 = = = Data = = = 
 The sources of information for Watson include encyclopedias , dictionaries , <unk> , newswire articles , and literary works . Watson also used databases , taxonomies , and ontologies . Specifically , <unk> , WordNet , and <unk> were used . The IBM team provided Watson with millions of documents , including dictionaries , encyclopedias , and other reference material that it could use to build its knowledge . 
 = = Operation = = 
 Watson parses questions into different keywords and sentence fragments in order to find statistically related phrases . Watson 's main innovation was not in the creation of a new algorithm for this operation but rather its ability to quickly execute hundreds of proven language analysis algorithms simultaneously to find the correct answer . The more algorithms that find the same answer independently the more likely Watson is to be correct . Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions , it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense . 
 = = = Comparison with human players = = = 
 Watson 's basic working principle is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses . This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human Jeopardy ! players . Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues . As a result , human players usually generate responses faster than Watson , especially to short clues . Watson 's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response . Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response , and is immune to human players ' psychological tactics , such as jumping between categories on every clue . 
 In a sequence of 20 mock games of Jeopardy , human participants were able to use the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding . During that time , Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal . Part of the system used to win the Jeopardy ! contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the " ready " signal and then examined whether Watson 's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer . Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times , Watson 's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated ( instead of reacted to ) the ready signal . After signaling , Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in Jeopardy ! ' s question format . Watson 's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM text @-@ to @-@ speech program in 2004 . 
 The Jeopardy ! staff used different means to notify Watson and the human players when to buzz , which was critical in many rounds . The humans were notified by a light , which took them tenths of a second to perceive . Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the buzzer within about eight milliseconds . The humans tried to compensate for the perception delay by anticipating the light , but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson 's response time . Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal .

 Since Deep Blue 's victory over Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997 , IBM had been on the hunt for a new challenge . In 2004 , IBM Research manager Charles Lickel , over dinner with coworkers , noticed that the restaurant they were in had fallen silent . He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus : Ken Jennings , who was then in the middle of his successful 74 @-@ game run on Jeopardy ! . Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions , mid @-@ meal , to watch the phenomenon . Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM , Lickel passed the idea on , and in 2005 , IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up , pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy ! with an IBM system . Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess , eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer . In competitions managed by the United States government , Watson 's predecessor , a system named <unk> , was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35 % of clues and often required several minutes to respond . To compete successfully on Jeopardy ! , Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds , and at that time , the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve . 
 In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci , the senior manager of IBM 's Semantic Analysis and Integration department , Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy ! programs . While the best real @-@ life competitors buzzed in half the time and responded correctly to as many as 95 % of clues , Watson 's first pass could get only about 15 % correct . During 2007 , the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems . By 2008 , the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy ! champions . By February 2010 , Watson could beat human Jeopardy ! contestants on a regular basis . 
 Although the system is primarily an IBM effort , Watson 's development involved faculty and graduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Carnegie Mellon University , University of Massachusetts Amherst , the University of Southern California 's Information Sciences Institute , the University of Texas at Austin , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and the University of Trento , as well as students from New York Medical College .

 In 2008 , IBM representatives communicated with Jeopardy ! executive producer Harry Friedman about the possibility of having Watson compete against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter , two of the most successful contestants on the show , and the program 's producers agreed . Watson 's differences with human players had generated conflicts between IBM and Jeopardy ! staff during the planning of the competition . IBM repeatedly expressed concerns that the show 's writers would exploit Watson 's cognitive deficiencies when writing the clues , thereby turning the game into a Turing test . To alleviate that claim , a third party randomly picked the clues from previously written shows that were never broadcast . Jeopardy ! staff also showed concerns over Watson 's reaction time on the buzzer . Originally Watson signaled electronically , but show staff requested that it press a button physically , as the human contestants would . Even with a robotic " finger " pressing the buzzer , Watson remained faster than its human competitors . Ken Jennings noted , " If you 're trying to win on the show , the buzzer is all , " and that Watson " can knock out a microsecond @-@ precise buzz every single time with little or no variation . Human reflexes can 't compete with computer circuits in this regard . " Stephen Baker , a journalist who recorded Watson 's development in his book " Final Jeopardy " , reported that the conflict between IBM and Jeopardy ! became so serious in May 2010 that the competition was almost canceled . As part of the preparation , IBM constructed a mock set in a conference room at one of its technology sites to model the one used on Jeopardy ! . Human players , including former Jeopardy ! contestants , also participated in mock games against Watson with Todd Alan Crain of The Onion playing host . About 100 test matches were conducted with Watson winning 65 % of the games . 
 To provide a physical presence in the televised games , Watson was represented by an " avatar " of a globe , inspired by the IBM " smarter planet " symbol . Jennings described the computer 's avatar as a " glowing blue ball criss @-@ crossed by ' threads ' of thought — 42 threads , to be precise , " and stated that the number of thought threads in the avatar was an in @-@ joke referencing the significance of the number 42 in Douglas Adams ' Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . Joshua Davis , the artist who designed the avatar for the project , explained to Stephen Baker that there are 36 <unk> states that Watson was able to use throughout the game to show its confidence in responding to a clue correctly ; he had hoped to be able to find forty @-@ two , to add another level to the Hitchhiker 's Guide reference , but he was unable to pinpoint enough game states . 
 A practice match was recorded on January 13 , 2011 , and the official matches were recorded on January 14 , 2011 . All participants maintained secrecy about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February .

 In a practice match before the press on January 13 , 2011 , Watson won a 15 @-@ question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a score of $ 4 @,@ 400 to Jennings 's $ 3 @,@ 400 and Rutter 's $ 1 @,@ 200 , though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final $ 1 @,@ 000 question . None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue . 
 = = = = First match = = = = 
 The first round was broadcast February 14 , 2011 , and the second round , on February 15 , 2011 . The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter . Watson , represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice , responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category , a deliberate strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible . Watson 's guess at the Daily Double location was correct . At the end of the first round , Watson was tied with Rutter at $ 5 @,@ 000 ; Jennings had $ 2 @,@ 000 . 
 Watson 's performance was characterized by some quirks . In one instance , Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings . ( Jennings said " What are the ' 20s ? " in reference to the 1920s . Then Watson said " What is 1920s ? " ) Because Watson could not recognize other contestants ' responses , it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response . In another instance , Watson was initially given credit for a response of " What is leg ? " after Jennings incorrectly responded " What is : he only had one hand ? " to a clue about George <unk> ( The correct response was , " What is : he 's missing a leg ? " ) . Because Watson , unlike a human , could not have been responding to Jennings 's mistake , it was decided that this response was incorrect . The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek 's original acceptance of Watson 's response . Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles , with one bet at $ 6 @,@ 435 and another at $ 1 @,@ 246 . Gerald <unk> , one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson , explained that Watson 's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State <unk> . 
 Watson took a commanding lead in Double Jeopardy ! , correctly responding to both Daily Doubles . Watson responded to the second Daily Double correctly with a 32 % confidence score . 
 Although it wagered only $ 947 on the clue , Watson was the only contestant to miss the Final Jeopardy ! response in the category U.S. <unk> ( " Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero ; its second largest , for a World War II battle " ) . Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago , but Watson 's response was " What is Toronto ? ? ? ? ? " Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city : categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired , the phrase " U.S. city " didn 't appear in the question , there are cities named Toronto in the U.S. , and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team . Dr. Chris Welty , who also worked on Watson , suggested that it may not have been able to correctly parse the second part of the clue , " its second largest , for a World War II battle " ( which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon , and required context to understand that it was referring to a second @-@ largest airport ) . Eric Nyberg , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team , stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable . Although not displayed to the audience as with non @-@ Final Jeopardy ! questions , Watson 's second choice was Chicago . Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson 's confidence threshold , at 14 % and 11 % respectively . ( This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson 's response . ) 
 The game ended with Jennings with $ 4 @,@ 800 , Rutter with $ 10 @,@ 400 , and Watson with $ 35 @,@ 734 .

 During the introduction , Trebek ( a Canadian native ) joked that he had learned Toronto was a U.S. city , and Watson 's error in the first match prompted an IBM engineer to wear a Toronto Blue Jays jacket to the recording of the second match . 
 In the first round , Jennings was finally able to choose a Daily Double clue , while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue incorrectly for the first time in the Double Jeopardy ! Round . After the first round , Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson could respond . Nonetheless , the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of $ 77 @,@ 147 , besting Jennings who scored $ 24 @,@ 000 and Rutter who scored $ 21 @,@ 600 .

 The prizes for the competition were $ 1 million for first place ( Watson ) , $ 300 @,@ 000 for second place ( Jennings ) , and $ 200 @,@ 000 for third place ( Rutter ) . As promised , IBM donated 100 % of Watson 's winnings to charity , with 50 % of those winnings going to World Vision and 50 % going to World Community Grid . Similarly , Jennings and Rutter donated 50 % of their winnings to their respective charities . 
 In acknowledgment of IBM and Watson 's achievements , Jennings made an additional remark in his Final Jeopardy ! response : " I for one welcome our new computer overlords " , echoing a similar <unk> reference to the episode " Deep Space Homer " on The Simpsons , in which TV news presenter Kent Brockman speaks of welcoming " our new insect overlords " . Jennings later wrote an article for Slate , in which he stated " IBM has bragged to the media that Watson 's question @-@ answering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek . The company sees a future in which fields like medical diagnosis , business analytics , and tech support are automated by question @-@ answering software like Watson . Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly @-@ line robots , Brad and I were the first knowledge @-@ industry workers put out of work by the new generation of ' thinking ' machines .

 Philosopher John Searle argues that Watson — despite impressive capabilities — cannot actually think .

 On February 28 , 2011 , Watson played an untelevised exhibition match of Jeopardy ! against members of the United States House of Representatives . In the first round , Rush D. Holt , Jr . ( D @-@ NJ , a former Jeopardy ! contestant ) , who was challenging the computer with Bill Cassidy ( R @-@ LA ) , led with Watson in second place . However , combining the scores between all matches , the final score was $ 40 @,@ 300 for Watson and $ 30 @,@ 000 for the congressional players combined . 
 IBM 's Christopher Padilla said of the match , " The technology behind Watson represents a major advancement in computing . In the data @-@ intensive environment of government , this type of technology can help organizations make better decisions and improve how government helps its citizens . " 
 = = Current and future applications = = 
 According to IBM , " The goal is to have computers start to interact in natural human terms across a range of applications and processes , understanding the questions that humans ask and providing answers that humans can understand and justify . " It has been suggested by Robert C. Weber , IBM 's general counsel , that Watson may be used for legal research . The company also intends to use Watson in other information @-@ intensive fields , such as telecommunications , financial services , and government . 
 Watson is based on commercially available IBM Power 750 servers that have been marketed since February 2010 . IBM also intends to market the DeepQA software to large corporations , with a price in the millions of dollars , reflecting the $ 1 million needed to acquire a server that meets the minimum system requirement to operate Watson . IBM expects the price to decrease substantially within a decade as the technology improves . 
 Commentator Rick Merritt said that " there 's another really important reason why it is strategic for IBM to be seen very broadly by the American public as a company that can tackle tough computer problems . A big slice of [ IBM 's profit ] comes from selling to the U.S. government some of the biggest , most expensive systems in the world . " 
 In 2013 , it was reported that three companies were working with IBM to create apps embedded with Watson technology . Fluid is developing an app for retailers , one called " The North Face " , which is designed to provide advice to online shoppers . <unk> is developing an app designed to give people advice on ways to engage in activities to improve their health .

 In November , 2013 , IBM announced it would make Watson 's API available to software application providers , enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded with Watson 's capabilities . To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform , IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms , which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem . Thus far , roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM , with interest in creating applications that could use the Watson platform . 
 On January 30 , 2013 , it was announced that Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute would receive a successor version of Watson , which would be housed at the Institute 's technology park and be available to researchers and students . By summer 2013 , Rensselaer had become the first university to receive a Watson computer . 
 On February 6 , 2014 , it was reported that IBM plans to invest $ 100 million in a 10 @-@ year initiative to use Watson and other IBM technologies to help countries in Africa address development problems , beginning with healthcare and education .

 In healthcare , Watson 's natural language , hypothesis generation , and evidence @-@ based learning capabilities allow it to function as a clinical decision support system for use by medical professionals . To aid physicians in the treatment of their patients , once a physician has posed a query to the system describing symptoms and other related factors , Watson first parses the input to identify the most important pieces of information ; then mines patient data to find facts relevant to the patient 's medical and hereditary history ; then examines available data sources to form and test hypotheses ; and finally provides a list of individualized , confidence @-@ scored recommendations . The sources of data that Watson uses for analysis can include treatment guidelines , electronic medical record data , notes from physicians and nurses , research materials , clinical studies , journal articles , and patient information . Despite being developed and marketed as a " diagnosis and treatment advisor , " Watson has never been actually involved in the medical diagnosis process , only in assisting with identifying treatment options for patients who have already been diagnosed . 
 In February 2011 , it was announced that IBM would be partnering with Nuance Communications for a research project to develop a commercial product during the next 18 to 24 months , designed to exploit Watson 's clinical decision support capabilities . Physicians at Columbia University would help to identify critical issues in the practice of medicine where the system 's technology may be able to contribute , and physicians at the University of Maryland would work to identify the best way that a technology like Watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide the maximum assistance . 
 In September 2011 , IBM and WellPoint , a major American healthcare provider , announced a partnership to utilize Watson 's data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians . Then , in February 2013 , IBM and WellPoint gave Watson its first commercial application , for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan – Kettering Cancer Center .

 = Title TK = 
 Title TK is the third studio album by American alternative rock band the Breeders , released in May 2002 . From the album — whose name means " title to come " in journalistic shorthand — the Breeders released three singles : " Off You " , " Huffer " , and " Son of Three " . Title TK reached the top 100 in France , Germany , the United Kingdom , and Australia , and number 130 in the United States . 
 Following many changes in personnel after the release the album Last Splash , by 1996 singer and songwriter Kim Deal was the only remaining original member of the Breeders . The next year , she returned to the studio in an attempt to record a follow @-@ up album , but her behavior — including drug use and demanding expectations — alienated the many musicians and engineers with whom she worked . 
 In 1999 , joined by her sister Kelley , Deal began recording sessions with engineer Steve Albini in Chicago . Fear members Mando Lopez and Richard Presley , and musician Jose Medeles joined the line @-@ up . The group continued recording with Albini in 2001 . Title TK was complied from the output of these sessions and supplemented with two tracks recorded in Los Angeles with engineers Andrew Alekel and Mark Arnold . Of the twelve songs on the album , ten are credited solely to Kim Deal ; the other two were written by all five band members . 
 Commentary on the album has included discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds . Reviewers have described the lyrics on its songs as unconventional and dark , and noted the prominence of vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters . The reception of Title TK has been generally positive ; commentators have praised Albini 's contributions to the sound of the album and observed that the musical arrangements isolate the individual components , such as vocals , guitar , and drums . 
 = = Background and initial recording attempts = = 
 From the formation of the Breeders in 1989 until the mid @-@ 1990s , the composition of the group changed several times . By 1996 , vocalist and songwriter Kim Deal was the only original member . The line @-@ up who recorded the group 's debut album , Pod ( 1990 ) , included Tanya Donelly and Britt Walford ; they were replaced by Jim Macpherson and Deal 's sister Kelley by the time of the band 's 1993 album Last Splash . Kelley Deal and original member Josephine Wiggs left in 1995 . Kim Deal formed the Amps that year , but reformed the Breeders in 1996 — initially using the Amps ' line @-@ up of Deal , Macpherson , Luis Lerma , and Nate Farley . 
 Throughout 1997 , Deal attempted to record tracks for a forthcoming album . By this time , she had become difficult to work with , and had adopted overly demanding musical standards for her bandmates . Her behaviour , and the unpleasant atmosphere of the recording sessions , caused Macpherson and Farley to leave the group during this period . Several other musicians recruited throughout the year left for similar reasons . The 1997 sessions cost hundreds of thousands of dollars through the use of four New York studio locations , the expense of moving equipment between them , and hotel costs . 
 Three recording engineers also parted ways with Deal in 1997 . The first engineer she hired — Mark Freegard , who had helped to record Last Splash — has remarked that Deal was " totally lost " and that after seven weeks in the studio , there were no usable recordings . Two subsequent engineers , John Agnello and Bryce Goggin , had each worked with Deal in 1995 on parts of the Amps ' album Pacer . Agnello became increasingly frustrated with Deal 's drug use and the difficulty of retaining musicians ; when Deal disappeared for several days , he left the recording sessions . Goggin was put off by Deal 's " futile ... standards " ; when she was unsatisfied with a drumming performance ( by the percussionist of the Flaming Lips ) that Goggin thought was outstanding , he told her to master the drums herself . Deal followed his advice , and returned to her home in Ohio to practice the instrument . 
 = = Subsequent recording and coalescence of the group = = 
 Deal began recording again in 1999 , first in Austin , Texas , and then at Electrical Audio studio in Chicago with Steve Albini , with whom she had previously worked on Pod , Pacer , and the Pixies ' album Surfer Rosa . Although Deal performed most of the instrumental parts herself at these 1999 sessions , her sister had some involvement . They recorded " The She " , " Forced to Drive " , and " Too Alive " in Chicago ; Deal 's drum performance on the latter track was from the Texas session . 
 Deal was satisfied with the material recorded to this point , but realized she would not be able to tour without a band . She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000 . After a chance meeting with members of the group Fear , she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez , bassist Mando Lopez , and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting . Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians ; within three months , she moved to Los Angeles , where Fear was based . Jaimez , Lopez , and Presley joined the Breeders ; soon after , Kelley Deal rejoined the group . For much of the rest of the year , the ensemble wrote and practiced songs . Jaimez was involved in other musical projects , and decided that he did not have enough time for the Breeders ; he was replaced by Jose Medeles . 
 The five Breeders returned to Chicago in mid @-@ 2001 to continue recording with Albini . " Little Fury " , " London Song " , " Off You " , " Put on a Side " , " Full on Idle " , " T and T " , and " Huffer " were recorded during the 2001 session . At some point in 2000 to 2002 , the group also spent time at the Grandmaster Recording Ltd. studio in Los Angeles , resulting in " Son of Three " and " Sinister Foxx " ; the engineers at this session were Mark Arnold and Andrew Alekel . Kelley Deal has stated that " Little Fury " and " Sinister Foxx " started as " just ideas " by the sisters that turned into full collaborations by the group — all five musicians received songwriting credits on these tracks . Kim Deal is credited as sole songwriter on the remaining ten tracks , although other band members contributed musical ideas as well . Another song from the Title TK sessions , " Fire the Maid " , written and sung by Kelley Deal , was performed in concert in 2000 and 2001 , but was not included on the album . 
 Over the course of the Title TK sessions , Kim Deal adopted a philosophy she calls " All Wave " . This approach stipulates that only analog recording processes , and no computer manipulation , may be used . Deal has said that she likes " interesting mistakes " in song production , and that her beliefs about recording are " a reaction ... to everything sounding so straight and clean in most records today " . The album 's mastering was also done using analog processes , by Albini and Steve Rook , at Abbey Road Studios in London . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Multiple reviewers have noted the minimal instrumentation used on Title TK . Throughout the album , unpredictable musical ideas occur : one reviewer has commented that " keyboards buzz from out of nowhere , guitars hit bum notes intentionally , basslines amble up and down the scale , sometimes two at a time " ; another commentator has described the progression of the track " Put on a Side " as follows : " At 1 @.@ 28 there is a distorted chug . At 2 @.@ 29 a drum @-@ roll . Neither of these introduces anything , continues or reappears . They just pop up and then evaporate like accidental fireworks . " Opinion has varied on other aspects of the album ; some reviews observed differences in the speed and levity of the songs , while others commented on the unified feel of the album . 
 Reviewers have also commented on the unorthodox character of Title TK 's lyrics . Certain lyrics have been described as " poetry " — such as the lines " If I find the door / I am the son of Go " in " Son of Three " and " Round up holler girl / Ah I will sing / Title TK / If I don 't black out / Dumb made for fucking / And missing from the party / That boy spun out " in " Little Fury " — but also as " cryptic " and as " imagistic baffle " . While some critics have made reference to the dark tendencies of the lyrics , others have commented on the humor on the album . Themes reviewers have heard in the songs include road trips and absence . 
 The singing on Title TK has been noted for its prominent harmonies between the Deal sisters . Kim Deal 's vocals on the album have been described as rough but endearing . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 Title TK begins with " Little Fury " , named after a kind of pocketknife — sold at truck stops — on which the word " fury " is written . On this call and response track , the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline and prominent drums . Drowned in Sound 's J.R. Moores writes that " Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo , yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere . Is it a solo or a riff ? Whatever it is , it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs , exposing them as absurd , flamboyant , shallow fripperies . I 'm not part of that club , it says . " For PopMatters 's Matt Cibula , the repeated line " Hold what you 've got " is the Deals ' reminder to themselves to keep the Breeders intact henceforth . 
 On " London Song " , the guitar performance has a particular syncopation that Jim Abbot ( The Orlando Sentinel ) equates with Title TK 's " world @-@ weary attitude " and the sisters ' " tough lost years … that [ are ] obvious from Kim 's disconnected delivery on songs about hard times " . Contrastingly , NY Rock 's Jeanne Fury comments on the track 's upbeat , quirky energy . 
 In the album 's liner notes , critic Mia Clarke describes the slow ballad " Off You " as having a lackadaisical feel ; Pitchfork Media 's Will Bryant is struck by the song 's <unk> , and compares it to the Pink Floyd album The Wall . For Rolling Stone 's Arion Berger , " Off You " is " as direct and heartbreaking as an eighty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old blues recording , and Kim , her voice clear and full of hope , can 't help sounding like a young woman who 's lived ten awful lifetimes " . 
 " The She " , named after a night club that the Deals ' brother used to frequent , has been described as having a funky feel , with a start @-@ and @-@ stop rhythm of bass and drums . Bryant hears the track 's keyboard part as reminiscent of the group Stereolab , while Phares likens the entire song to Jefferson Airplane 's " White Rabbit " . Cibula mentions that the " creepy / cool … sound [ fits ] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar / strange lyrics : ' Sorrow blowin ’ through the vents / I ’ m over Houston / You ’ re over the night we met . ' " 
 On " Too Alive " , Kim Deal played all instruments , with vocals by both sisters . Moores notes the track 's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal 's guitar ; for Phares , the song possesses an immediacy as though the listener were there watching the performance in person . 
 Bryant identifies " Son of Three " as an example of " when the Breeders set out to rock " , noting " the chugging guitars and stomping drums " . For Title TK 's third single , the Breeders re @-@ recorded the composition in July 2002 ; this version is faster than the album track , and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year . The Guardian 's Betty Clarke asserts that the lyrics of both " Son of Three " and " The She " suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes . 
 Regarding the album 's next song , " Put on a Side " , more than one critic has commented on its distinctive bassline , and others have described the track 's cramped , repressive feel . Berger writes that Kim Deal 's " voice grinds sweetly , <unk> , sloppily inside your brain " , as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song : " Better I better I stayed up / Better mono , put on a side " . 
 An earlier version of " Full on a Idle " , Title TK 's eighth track , was released on the Amps ' Pacer in 1995 . In a 1997 interview , Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps ' compositions , partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded . Bryant believes both versions of " Full on Idle " sound almost the same , but The Village Voice 's Jessica Grose maintains that the Breeders ' rendition is noticeably slower . In Cibula 's view , this version contains elements of country music , cumbia , and ska . Betty Clarke cites the line " Obey your colorist , bleach it all away " as an example of Title TK 's amusing , off @-@ center lyrics . 
 On " Sinister Foxx " , Deal repeatedly sings " Has anybody seen the iguana ? " She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana : " Have you ever bought a bag of weed ? You walk in , and the pot dealer 's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer 's house , there 's no iguana . " Another line , " I 'm in beer class every Thursday night " , refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended , due to having been caught driving drunk . Phares describes the song as having a " sexy menace " , and Berger compares the drum part to gunshots and door @-@ knocking . 
 Moores identifies in " Forced to Drive " the " quiet @-@ LOUD @-@ quiet " dynamic for which Deal 's former band , the Pixies , are famous ; Berger expresses this same duality by contrasting the song 's " pop verses " with " the gloom of a twisty , malignant chorus " . For Abbot , this four @-@ chord chorus " approaches exuberance " in its mixture of catchy melody and grunge . 
 The penultimate track , " T and T " , is described by Bryant as an instrumental introduction leading into " Huffer " ; indeed , Kelley Deal has stated that these two songs share a thematic union : the latter is about the negative side of inhaling paint or other substances , while the former stands for " Toil and Trouble " — a further emphasizing of the hardships that inhaling chemicals can cause . " Huffer " is , according to Moores , a lively , poppy track ; critics have commented on its " da @-@ da @-@ da " and " ah @-@ ah " chorus .

 Title TK was released on May 20 – 21 , 2002 , on labels including 4AD ( United Kingdom ) , Elektra Records ( United States ) , V2 Records ( Belgium ) , Virgin Records ( France ) , and P @-@ Vine Records ( Japan ) . The phrase " Title TK " means " title to come " in journalistic shorthand . The album 's art design was done by Vaughan Oliver and Chris Bigg , with additional photography by Onie M. Montes ; Oliver , who had begun doing artwork for 4AD in 1980 , also designed Breeders ' releases including Pod and Last Splash . Three singles were released from Title TK : " Off You " , " Huffer " , and " Son of Three " ; " Off You " reached number 25 on the Canadian Digital Songs chart , and " Son of Three " number 72 on the UK Singles Chart . Title TK reached the top 100 in the United Kingdom , Australia , France , and Germany , and peaked at number 130 in the United States . 
 Critics have mostly responded positively to the album . The critical aggregator website Metacritic awards Title TK a score of 71 , indicating " generally favorable reviews " , based on the reviews of 19 critics . Betty Clarke singles out the " separation of sounds " on tracks such as " T and T " and " Off You " as the best aspect of the album , and writes that Title TK is " a welcome return to punky pop that knows how to flex some melodic muscle " . Berger , while emphasizing the pain and melancholy present in the songs , praises the record as " absolutely beautiful " . NME reviewer John Robinson hears the album as " tuneful ... and impressively empty sounding , the arrangements of the tunes showcasing skeletal guitar and drum patterns and Deal 's remarkable voice " . Cibula " really like [ s ] " Title TK , and opines that it sounds " buzzy and funny and swaggering in that special Albini uber @-@ geek sort of way " . Billboard critic Brian Garrity comments that Title TK " retains the offbeat charm that has always been at the center of the band 's appeal " . 
 More negatively , Melanie McFarland of The Seattle Times asserts that the Breeders " haven 't solidified [ their magic ] with Title TK " and that " all Breeders albums have mood swings , but this one has too many " . Spin magazine 's Steve Kandell characterizes the album as " a little unsure of itself " , and points to the Breeders ' re @-@ recording of Pacer 's " Full on Idle " as evidence that " the creative coffers weren 't exactly spilling over " for Deal .

 = Characters of Myst = 
 The Myst series of adventure computer games deal with the events following the player 's discovery of a mysterious book describing an island known as Myst . The book is no ordinary volume ; it is a linking book , which serves as a portal to the world it describes . The player is transported to Myst Island , and must unravel the world 's puzzles in order to return home . Myst was a commercial and critical success upon release , and spawned four sequels — Riven , Exile , Revelation and End of Ages — as well as several spinoffs and adaptations . 
 While the player , referred to as a Stranger , remains faceless and unnamed , Myst and its sequels introduce a variety of non @-@ player characters . The inhabitants of Myst include the explorer Atrus , a writer of many linking books , and his wife Catherine and their children . Other characters introduced in the series include Gehn , Atrus ' power @-@ hungry father ; Saavedro , a traumatized victim of Atrus ' sons ; and Esher , a member of an old civilization whose motives for helping the player are ambiguous . 
 The first Myst titles used pre @-@ rendered graphics , and digitally inserted footage of live actors into the backgrounds . For Myst V : End of Ages , a different approach was taken ; a special camera recorded actor 's faces and mapped the video onto digital models . The characters of Myst have been generally praised in each installment . Reviewers found that the live action characters increased immersion , while the digital body language and spoken conviction in End of Ages endeared the characters to the player . Dissenting reviewers considered Myst 's acting overly melodramatic and overwrought . 
 = = Development = = 
 When the first game in the franchise , Myst , was created , all the characters were created from footage of live actors . The actors were filmed on a bluescreen , then added to the pre @-@ rendered backgrounds via chroma key . Due to a limited amount of time and money , Myst 's creators , Rand and Robyn Miller , took on roles in the game themselves ; 
 The Ages of Myst were occasionally seen as lonely by players and reviewers . As a result , Cyan added more characters to the sequel , Riven . Villagers scurry away as the player approaches , and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from him or her . For the first time , Cyan directed the live action actors for Riven 's scenes ; the designers , including Richard Vander Wende , were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the finished product . Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation , even though he hated acting . 
 Later Myst titles improved on the integration of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games . Myst III : Exile 's developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras , which producer Dan Irish would look back on as a mistake ; without using high definition video cameras , the video did not look crisp at high resolutions . For the next game , Myst IV : Revelation , Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera and interact with the video while it is playing through the use of the <unk> game engine . 
 Myst V : End of Ages was developed so that players could freely navigate Ages rendered in realtime , which meant that the traditional digital insertion of characters into the setting would be infeasible . The models of End of Ages 's characters were instead computer @-@ generated . A special device was created that captured video of the actor 's faces while they spoke their lines , as Cyan did not want to lose the warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor . The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto the 3D characters . Motion capture was also used to ensure lifelike movement . Cyan staff were worried that the audio syncing for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game , but were happy with the end results . 
 The player character in Myst , Riven , Exile and Revelation is the " stranger " ; the character 's real name is never given and remains faceless at all times . Atrus addresses the player character as " my friend " in cutscenes . Cyan 's intent was for players to feel as though they were themselves there , stranded on a mysterious island with no choice but to explore . Thus , the games ' protagonist is an anonymous , gender @-@ neutral entity with no given history , and players are free to imagine themselves as the protagonist .

 = = = Atrus and Catherine = = = 
 Atrus is the main non @-@ player character in the Myst series , appearing in all five games of the main series ; he also narrates the opening of Uru : Ages Beyond Myst . He is a member of the ancient D 'ni civilization , though his only D 'ni inheritance is through his paternal grandfather . The D 'ni perfected a craft known as the Art , which allowed them to create portals to other worlds known as Ages by writing a descriptive " linking book " . After the fall of the D 'ni civilization , Atrus ' father , Gehn , teaches him the Art and Atrus creates many linking books , surpassing his father 's skill in writing . Atrus comes to understand his father 's power @-@ hungry nature ; as punishment for defying him , Gehn traps Atrus on K 'veer , an island off of the main D 'ni city , with a book leading to Gehn 's Age of Riven as the only escape . 
 On Riven Atrus meets Catherine , a local inhabitant and a student of Gehn . Together they trap Gehn on Riven . Atrus ' grandmother , Anna ( " Ti 'ana " ) , helps Catherine by writing the Age of Myst as an escape route while Atrus destroys every other linking book on Riven . The linking book to Myst is dropped into a starry expanse known as the Star Fissure , where it is presumed lost ( but later found by the Stranger , beginning the events of Myst ) . Catherine and Atrus start a family on Myst , raising their two sons , Sirrus and Achenar ; however , both boys grew greedy and sought to strand their parents , trapping Atrus on K 'veer ( an island in the cavern near the main D 'ni city ) , and luring Catherine to Riven , where she is captured by Gehn . The Stranger 's discovery of the Myst linking book saves Atrus from being trapped in K 'veer a second time , and Catherine from Gehn 's clutches . Moving to Tomahna , Atrus and Catherine have a third child , their daughter Yeesha , and attempt to resurrect the D 'ni by writing a new Age for the people called Releeshahn . By the events of End of Ages , Catherine has died ( likely from old age ) , and an elderly Atrus confines himself in Releeshahn to live out the rest of his life . Atrus is played by Rand Miller in all the Myst installments . Catherine is portrayed by Sheila Goold in Riven , with her voice dubbed by Rengin Altay , and Maria Galante in Exile . 
 = = = Sirrus and Achenar = = = 
 Sirrus and Achenar are the sons of Atrus and Catherine and are the eldest of their three children . They first appear in Myst , trapped in two different books . Each swears that he is innocent of plundering their father 's Ages , and that the other brother is to blame . In actuality , both brothers grew greedy , destroyed Atrus ' library , killed the inhabitants of the Ages , and attempted to strand their parents forever . They in turn are trapped in special prison books Atrus designed to imprison unwanted travelers . Once he is freed by the Stranger , Atrus burns Sirrus and Achenar 's books . 
 Revelation reveals that the brothers remained exiled on two different Ages for almost twenty years , where Atrus and Catherine hoped they would reform . In Revelation , Sirrus and Achenar escape their prisons , and Sirrus plans on swapping bodies with his sister Yeesha in order to learn the Art and kill his parents . Achenar , who has reformed during his imprisonment , instead works with the Stranger to save his sister . Sirrus is killed when the mind @-@ switch fails ; Achenar is fatally poisoned when he repairs the machinery to save his sister . In Myst , Sirrus was played by Robyn Miller , and Achenar by brother Rand ; in Revelation , the brothers are played by Brian Wrench and Guy Sprung , respectively . 
 = = = Yeesha = = = 
 Yeesha is the only daughter of Atrus and Catherine . She is briefly mentioned in the novel Myst : The Book of D 'ni , and is first seen as an infant in Exile . Yeesha is seen by her parents as a correction to the mistakes they made with their wayward sons . Her parents teach her D 'ni and the Art . In Revelation , her brother Sirrus attempts to use Yeesha in a plan to learn the Art and kill his parents , but Yeesha is freed by the Stranger and Achenar . 
 An adult Yeesha appears in Uru : Ages Beyond Myst and is one of two main characters in End of Ages , where she tries to persuade the player to help free an enslaved race known as the Bahro by unlocking a powerful Tablet . Over the course of her life , Yeesha takes on many roles , eventually assuming the aspect of a prophesized D 'ni savior @-@ figure known as " The Grower " . Baby Yeesha is played by Exile game producer Greg Uhler 's daughter . Juliette Gosselin plays a young Yeesha in Revelation and Rengin Altay voices the character as an adult in Uru and End of Ages . 
 = = = Gehn = = = 
 Gehn is the father of Atrus , and the antagonist of Riven . Gehn is born to Master Aitrus of the Guild of Surveyors ( for whom his son is named ) and his human wife , Anna ( or Ti 'ana , as she is known in D 'ni ) , shortly before the downfall of the D 'ni civilization . Believing that he creates worlds by writing linking books , Gehn considers himself a god and dedicates his life to rebuilding the fallen D 'ni empire . Realizing his madness , Atrus turns against his father ; with the help of Catherine , he traps Gehn on the Age of Riven , " a prison of my own creation " as Gehn later relates it , for nearly thirty years . 
 Gehn 's inability to grasp the fine aspects of the Art of Writing , leading him to copy or alter sentences from existing books rather than writing original passages , results in his Ages being unstable . Gehn tends to be unimaginative : besides having no talent for the Art , he merely numbers his Ages rather than naming them ( Riven is his " Fifth Age " , for instance ) , and as long as it will give him what he seeks , prefers to smash his way through D 'ni puzzle locks made with delicate materials rather than figure them out . 
 When Catherine is stranded on Riven , Atrus must send the Stranger to rescue her , as he is busy making changes to the Age to delay its collapse . The Stranger tricks Gehn into a special prison book created by Atrus , and Gehn 's oppressed subjects are evacuated from Riven before the Age of Riven closes forever . Gehn is portrayed by John Keston . 
 = = = Saavedro = = = 
 Saavedro is the antagonist of Exile . Depicted as a vengeful and broken man , Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan , one of the Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to other worlds . Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus ' sons , but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed . When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J 'nanin , he is assaulted and left for dead . Trapped on J 'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead , Saavedro 's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity . When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers , he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge . Once on Narayan , Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed . Cornered by the Stranger , Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book . In the game 's optimal ending , the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan , before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus . Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif , who accepted the role of Saavedro because he was a Myst fan . Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets , as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment . 
 = = = Esher = = = 
 Esher is a D 'ni who survived the downfall of his civilization , and the antagonist of End of Ages . Throughout the game he appears to the player , offering advice and background on different Ages . Esher warns the player not to trust Yeesha , suggesting she has tasked the player with unlocking a powerful Tablet in order to steal its power for herself . If the player gives Esher the tablet instead in one of the " bad " endings of the game , Esher proclaims that he wishes to use the Tablet to control a powerful race of creatures called Bahro for his own purposes , and strands the player on the Age of Myst . The best ending the player can choose results in Esher being handed over to the liberated Bahro to pay for his crimes . Esher is voiced by David Ogden Stiers , who received acclaim for his performance .

 The absence of character interaction in Myst and Riven was commented upon in reviews . Adventure Gamers called the lack of characters a bad element of the games . Conversely , Laura Miller of Salon called the isolation a distinctive and welcome touch . In comparison to contemporary games , the deep solitude allowed the player to focus on puzzles . " Games with implausible and annoying characters popping up at regular intervals are just too stressful , " said Miller . 
 From Exile onward , the characters of Myst were generally praised in each release . The live @-@ action characters in the pre @-@ rendered Myst titles were favorably received ; Greg Kasavin of Gamespot said that the series ' use of real actors and full @-@ motion video endeared the characters to the player , giving the games a distinctively personal touch . Fellow Gamespot reviewer Scott Osborne stated the actors delivered convincing performances , and were smoothly incorporated into the game 's scenes . The reviewers of G4tv , on the other hand , called the acting of the earlier installments overwrought and melodramatic . 
 The change from full motion video to computer generated characters in End of Ages was well received . Macworld stated that the change was initially jarring , but ultimately helped increase the realism of the game . IGN 's Juan Castro said that the characters felt more real than the full motion video actors of previous games ; one reason , the reviewer stated , was because the actors spoke their lines with real conviction . Gamezone credited each character 's individualized body language as contributing to their realism . Gamespot stated that Esher moved and acted like a real person , and that the voice of David Ogden Stiers brought " this interesting character to life " ; the reviewer did feel that the revelation of Esher and Yeesha 's motivations was a letdown , as the character 's true motivations were revealed " with all the unpleasant abruptness of turning on bright , fluorescent lights in a dark room . " Dissenting reviewers such as 1UP.com and G4tv considered the character 's monologues " hyper emotional " , although reviewer Karen Chu admitted the characters still presented a compelling morality play . 
 = Rude Boy ( Rihanna song ) =

 " Rude Boy " was produced by Rob Swire and StarGate who co @-@ wrote the song with Rihanna , Ester Dean , and Makeba Riddick . During an interview on the television show , Alan Carr : Chatty Man in February 2010 , Carr asked Rihanna about the song 's lyrics , with particular emphasis on the line " Come here Rude Boy , Boy , can you get it up ? / Come here Rude Boy , Boy , is you big enough ? " Rihanna explained : " When we wrote the song , it was kind of a freestyle ... I liked the West Indian influence that the music had , and , I just went in the booth , they were already jotting down some ideas and , that came to me , I just ran in there with the , one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that , ' Come here Rude Boy , is you big enough ' ? , it does sound so disgusting ! " She also explained the development of the song , and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction , but because of the song 's infectious beat , Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead . 
 In an interview with Us Weekly , Makeba Riddick , who assisted with the song 's vocal production , spoke about the inspiration for the song . Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song , and had been working with Stargate to develop it . Upon hearing it , Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed , and sent it to Riddick for completion . Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from : " I was listening to the words and me and [ Rihanna ] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere . By the time we were done of course , we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics – surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song . " Dean explained the development of " Rude Boy " in an interview with The Boom Box , and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna 's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song 's lyrics . Dean praised Rihanna 's ability to take risks with her music , saying " I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won 't say . Even if she says let 's go kiss some girls , who really cares ... that 's Rihanna . Music is about fantasy . This is what people want to do , but are afraid to do . "

 Los Angeles Times ' reviewer Ann Powers stated that the song has a " ragamuffin @-@ style " , and commented on the lyrics , " Even as she offers herself in no uncertain terms — ' I 'm gon ' let you be the captain tonight ' she sneers — she questions his prowess . ' Can you get it up ? Are you big enough ? ' she repeats in the singsong chorus , making it tough to imagine that any suitor could rise to this occasion . " Bill Lamb of About.com praised the song , and called it " the most instantly engaging song from the album Rated R " , and that " [ Rihanna ] projects a dominant female image that is exactly what was needed to move past the unfortunate Chris Brown chapter in her career " . However , Lamb added that the " icy feel is wearing thin . Rihanna sounds like she has taken a few steps back to distance herself from the whole song . There is a pleasing swagger , but we 're never quite engaged " . 
 Nick Levine of Digital Spy , commenting on the genre of the song and Rihanna 's musical direction and transition from her previous album Good Girl Gone Bad ( 2007 ) , wrote that the song " can be construed as a winning synthesis of her Island @-@ pop beginnings , the effortless hitmaking of the Good Girl Gone Bad era and the more menacing persona she 's unveiled post @-@ <unk> . On the other , it 's just a damn good tune . " Levine also wrote that " Rude Boy " is " the most instantly catchy moment " on Rated R. <unk> Malone of NME commented on the song 's demeanor in relation to Rated R as a whole , and wrote , " With only one other female songwriter here apart from Rihanna ( Ester Dean on ' Rude Boy ' ) it 's a startlingly masculine record – in sound and in attitude .

In 1849 , he was wounded by an arrow in his neck during a skirmish against Apaches in Las Vegas , New Mexico . He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on December 12 , 1851 . 
 In 1852 , he was assigned to Fort Adams , Newport , Rhode Island , and , while there , he married Mary Richmond Bishop of Providence , Rhode Island , on April 27 of that year . The marriage , which lasted until Burnside 's death , was childless . 
 In October 1853 , Burnside resigned his commission in the United States Army . Although maintaining a position in the state militia , he devoted his time and energy to the manufacture of the famous firearm that bears his name , the Burnside carbine . The Secretary of War under President James Buchanan , John B. Floyd , contracted with the Burnside Arms Company to equip a large portion of the Army , mostly cavalry , with his carbine and induced him to establish extensive factories for its manufacture . The Bristol Rifle Works were no sooner complete than another gunmaker allegedly bribed Floyd to break his $ 100 @,@ 000 contract with Burnside . Burnside ran as a Democrat for one of the Congressional seats in Rhode Island in 1858 and was defeated in a landslide . The burdens of the campaign and the destruction by fire of his factory contributed to his financial ruin , and he was forced to assign his firearm patents to others . He then went west in search of employment and became treasurer of the Illinois Central Railroad , where he worked for , and became friendly with , one of his future commanding officers , George B. McClellan .

 At the outbreak of the Civil War , Burnside was a brigadier general in the Rhode Island Militia . He raised a regiment , the 1st Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry Regiment , and was appointed its colonel on May 2 , 1861 . Two companies of this regiment were then armed with Burnside Carbines . Within a month , he ascended to brigade command in the Department of Northeast Virginia . He commanded the brigade without distinction at the First Battle of Bull Run in July , committing his troops piecemeal , and took over division command temporarily for wounded Brig. Gen. David Hunter . After his 90 @-@ day regiment was mustered out of service on August 2 , he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on August 6 , and was assigned to train provisional brigades in the nascent Army of the Potomac . 
 = = = North Carolina = = = 
 Burnside commanded the Coast Division , or North Carolina Expeditionary Force , three brigades assembled in Annapolis , Maryland , which formed the nucleus for his future IX Corps , and the Department of North Carolina from September 1861 until July 1862 . He conducted a successful amphibious campaign that closed over 80 % of the North Carolina sea coast to Confederate shipping for the remainder of the war . This included the Battle of Elizabeth City , fought on 10 February 1862 , on the <unk> River near Elizabeth City , North Carolina . The participants were vessels of the U.S. Navy 's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron , opposed by vessels of the Confederate Navy 's Mosquito Fleet ; the latter were supported by a shore @-@ based battery of four guns at Cobb 's Point ( now called Cobb Point ) , near the southeastern border of the town . The battle was a part of the campaign in North Carolina that was led by Burnside and known as the Burnside Expedition . The result was a Union victory , with Elizabeth City and its nearby waters in their possession , and the Confederate fleet captured , sunk , or dispersed . 
 In recognition of his successes at the battles of Roanoke Island and New Bern , the first significant Union victories in the Eastern Theater , he was promoted to major general of volunteers on March 18 , 1862 . In July , his forces were transported north to Newport News , Virginia , and became the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac . 
 Following Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan 's failure in the Peninsula Campaign , Burnside was offered command of the Army of the Potomac . Refusing this opportunity , because of his loyalty to McClellan and the fact that he understood his own lack of military experience , he detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign . Telegrams extremely critical of Pope 's abilities as a commander from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter that he received at this time and forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence would later play a significant role in Porter 's court @-@ martial , in which Burnside would appear as a star witness . 
 Burnside again declined command following Pope 's debacle at Second Bull Run . 
 = = = Antietam = = = 
 Burnside was given command of the " Right Wing " of the Army of the Potomac ( the I Corps and his own IX Corps ) at the start of the Maryland Campaign for the Battle of South Mountain , but McClellan separated the two corps at the Battle of Antietam , placing them on opposite ends of the Union battle line , returning Burnside to command of just the IX Corps . Implicitly refusing to give up his higher authority , Burnside treated first Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno ( killed at South Mountain ) and then Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox as the corps commander , funneling orders to the corps through them . This cumbersome arrangement contributed to his slowness in attacking and crossing what is now called " Burnside 's Bridge " on the southern flank of the Union line . 
 Burnside did not perform an adequate reconnaissance of the area , and instead of taking advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy , his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground . By noon , McClellan was losing patience . He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward . He ordered one aide , " Tell him if it costs 10 @,@ 000 men he must go now . " He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside , who reacted indignantly : " McClellan appears to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge ; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders . " Although the IX Corps eventually broke through , the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill 's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough . McClellan refused Burnside 's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate . 
 = = = Fredericksburg = = = 
 McClellan was removed after failing to pursue General Robert E. Lee 's retreat from Antietam , and Burnside was assigned to command the Army of the Potomac on November 7 , 1862 . He reluctantly obeyed this order , the third such in his brief career , in part because when he tried to refuse , the courier told him that the command would go instead to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker ( whom Burnside disliked ) . President Abraham Lincoln pressured Burnside to take aggressive action and on November 14 approved his plan to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia . This plan led to a humiliating and costly Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13 . His advance upon Fredericksburg was rapid , but planning in marshaling pontoon bridges for crossing the Rappahannock River and his own reluctance to deploy portions of his army across fording points later delayed the attack . This allowed Gen. Lee to concentrate along Marye 's Heights just west of town and easily repulse the Union attacks . Assaults south of town , which were supposed to be the main avenue of attack , were also mismanaged , and initial Union breakthroughs went unsupported . Upset by the failure of his plan and by the enormous casualties of his repeated , futile frontal assaults , Burnside declared that he would personally lead an assault of the IX corps . His corps commanders talked him out of it , but relations between the commander and his subordinates were strained . Accepting full blame , he offered to retire from the U.S. Army , but this was refused . Burnside 's detractors labeled him the " Butcher of Fredericksburg " . 
 In January 1863 , Burnside launched a second offensive against Lee , but it bogged down in winter rains before it accomplished anything and has been derisively called the Mud March . In its wake , he asked that several officers , who were openly insubordinate , be relieved of duty and court @-@ martialed ; he also offered to resign . Lincoln chose the latter option on January 26 and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker , one of the officers who had conspired against Burnside . 
 = = = East Tennessee = = = 
 Although Burnside offered to resign his commission altogether , Lincoln declined , stating that there could still be a place for him in the army . Thus , he was placed back at the head of the IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio , encompassing the states of Ohio , Indiana , Kentucky , and Illinois . Since this was a quiet area with little activity going on , the president reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into too much trouble there . However , antiwar sentiment was riding high in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South , and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery . Thoroughly disturbed by this trend , Burnside began issuing a series of orders forbidding " the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration " in his department , which finally climaxed with General Order No. 38 , which declared that " any person found guilty of treason will be tried by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines " . On May 1 , 1863 , Ohio Congressman Clement L. Vallandigham , a prominent opponent of the war , held a large public rally in Mount Vernon , Ohio in which he denounced President Lincoln as a " tyrant " who sought to abolish the Constitution and set up a dictatorship . Burnside had dispatched several agents to the rally who took down notes and brought back their " evidence " to the general , who then declared that it was sufficient grounds to arrest Vallandigham for treason . Despite the Congressman 's protests that he was the victim of simply expressing his opinions in public , a military court tried him and found him guilty of violating General Order No. 38 . He was thus sentenced to imprisonment for the duration of the war . Vallandigham was turned into a martyr by antiwar Democrats . Burnside next turned his attention to Illinois , where the Chicago Times newspaper had been printing antiwar editorials for months . The general dispatched a squadron of troops to the paper 's offices and ordered them to cease printing . 
 Lincoln had not been asked or informed about either Vallandigham 's arrest or the closure of the Chicago Times . Remembering the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines , Lincoln finally decided that this was a good idea , and so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands . Meanwhile , Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in both cases . The president then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House 's permission . Burnside also dealt with Confederate raiders such as John Hunt Morgan . 
 In the Knoxville Campaign , Burnside advanced to Knoxville , Tennessee , first bypassing the Confederate @-@ held Cumberland Gap . After occupying Knoxville unopposed , he sent troops back to the Cumberland Gap . Brig. Gen. John W. Frazer , the Confederate commander , refused to surrender in the face of two Union brigades and Burnside arrived with a third , forcing the surrender of Frazer and 2 @,@ 300 Confederates . After Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans was defeated at the Battle of Chickamauga , Burnside was pursued by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet , against whose troops he had battled at Marye 's Heights . Burnside skillfully outmaneuvered Longstreet at the Battle of Campbell 's Station and was able to reach his entrenchments and safety in Knoxville , where he was briefly besieged until the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Fort Sanders outside the city . Tying down Longstreet 's corps at Knoxville contributed to Gen. Braxton Bragg 's defeat by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Chattanooga . Troops under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman marched to Burnside 's aid , but the siege had already been lifted ; Longstreet withdrew , eventually returning to Virginia . 
 = = = Overland Campaign = = = 
 Burnside was ordered to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater , where , in Annapolis , Maryland , he built it up to a strength of over 21 @,@ 000 effectives . The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command , reporting initially to Grant ; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander , Maj. Gen. George G. Meade , who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg . This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna , when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade 's direct command . 
 Burnside fought at the battles of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House , where he did not perform in a distinguished manner , attacking piecemeal and appearing reluctant to commit his troops to the frontal assaults that characterized these battles . After North Anna and Cold Harbor , he took his place in the siege lines at Petersburg . 
 = = = The Crater = = = 
 As the two armies faced the stalemate of trench warfare at Petersburg in July 1864 , Burnside agreed to a plan suggested by a regiment of former coal miners in his corps , the 48th Pennsylvania : dig a mine under a fort named Elliot 's Salient in the Confederate entrenchments and ignite explosives there to achieve a surprise breakthrough . The fort was destroyed on July 30 in what is known as the Battle of the Crater . Because of interference from Meade , Burnside was ordered , only hours before the infantry attack , not to use his division of black troops , which had been specially trained for this mission . He was forced to use untrained white troops instead . He could not decide which division to choose as a replacement , so he had his three subordinate commanders draw lots . The division chosen by chance was that commanded by Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie , who failed to brief the men on what was expected of them and was reported during the battle to be drunk well behind the lines , providing no leadership . Ledlie 's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it , becoming trapped , and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim , resulting in high casualties . 
 Burnside was relieved of command on August 14 and sent on " extended leave " by Grant . Burnside was never recalled to duty during the remainder of the war . A court of inquiry later placed the blame for the Crater fiasco on Burnside and his subordinates . In December , Burnside met with President Lincoln and General Grant about his future . He was contemplating resignation , but Lincoln and Grant requested that he remain in the Army . At the end of the interview , Burnside wrote , " I was not informed of any duty upon which I am to be placed . " He finally resigned his commission on April 15 , 1865 , after Lee 's surrender at Appomattox . 
 The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside , and placed the blame for the Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for requiring the specially trained USCT ( United States Colored Troops ) men to be withdrawn . 
 = = Postbellum career = = 
 After his resignation , Burnside was employed in numerous railroad and industrial directorships , including the presidencies of the Cincinnati and Martinsville Railroad , the Indianapolis and Vincennes Railroad , the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad , and the Rhode Island Locomotive Works . 
 He was elected to three one @-@ year terms as Governor of Rhode Island , serving from May 29 , 1866 , to May 25 , 1869 . 
 Burnside was a Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States , a military society of Union officers and their descendants , and served as the Junior Vice Commander of the Massachusetts Commandery in 1869 . He was commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Grand Army of the Republic ( GAR ) veterans ' association from 1871 to 1872 , and also served as the Commander of the Department of Rhode Island of the GAR . At its inception in 1871 , the National Rifle Association chose him as its first president . 
 During a visit to Europe in 1870 , Burnside attempted to mediate between the French and the Germans in the Franco @-@ Prussian War . 
 In 1876 Burnside was elected as commander of the New England Battalion of the Centennial Legion , the title of a collection of 13 militia units from the original 13 states , which participated in the parade in Philadelphia on July 4 , 1876 , to mark the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence . 
 In 1874 Burnside was elected by the Rhode Island Senate as a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island , was re @-@ elected in 1880 , and served until his death in 1881 . During that time , Burnside , who had been a Democrat before the war , ran as a Republican , playing a prominent role in military affairs as well as serving as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1881 . 
 Burnside died suddenly of " neuralgia of the heart " ( <unk> pectoris ) at Bristol , Rhode Island , and is buried in Swan Point Cemetery , Providence , Rhode Island . An equestrian statue in his honor was erected in the late 19th century in Burnside Park in Providence . 
 = = Assessment and legacy = = 
 Personally , Burnside was always very popular , both in the army and in politics . He made friends easily , smiled a lot , and remembered everyone 's name . His professional military reputation , however , was less positive , and he was known for being obstinate , unimaginative , and unsuited , both intellectually and emotionally for high command . Grant stated that he was " unfitted " for the command of an army and that no one knew this better than Burnside himself . Knowing his capabilities , he twice refused command of the Army of the Potomac , accepting only the third time when the courier told him that otherwise the command would go to Joseph Hooker . Jeffry D. Wert described Burnside 's relief after Fredericksburg in a passage that sums up his military career : 
 He had been the most unfortunate commander of the Army , a general who had been cursed by succeeding its most popular leader and a man who believed he was unfit for the post . His tenure had been marked by bitter animosity among his subordinates and a fearful , if not needless , sacrifice of life . A firm patriot , he lacked the power of personality and will to direct recalcitrant generals . He had been willing to fight the enemy , but the terrible slope before Marye 's Heights stands as his legacy . 
 Bruce Catton summarized Burnside : 
 ... Burnside had repeatedly demonstrated that it had been a military tragedy to give him a rank higher than colonel . One reason might have been that , with all his deficiencies , Burnside never had any angles of his own to play ; he was a simple , honest , loyal soldier , doing his best even if that best was not very good , never scheming or conniving or backbiting . Also , he was modest ; in an army many of whose generals were insufferable prima donnas , Burnside never mistook himself for Napoleon . Physically he was impressive : tall , just a little stout , wearing what was probably the most artistic and awe @-@ inspiring set of whiskers in all that bewhiskered Army . He customarily wore a high , bell @-@ crowned felt hat with the brim turned down and a double @-@ breasted , knee @-@ length frock coat , belted at the waist — a costume which , unfortunately , is apt to strike the modern eye as being very much like that of a beefy city cop of the 1880s .

 = Jay Pritzker Pavilion = 
 Jay Pritzker Pavilion , also known as Pritzker Pavilion or Pritzker Music Pavilion , is a bandshell in Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . It is located on the south side of Randolph Street and east of the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District . The pavilion was named after Jay Pritzker , whose family is known for owning Hyatt Hotels . The building was designed by architect Frank Gehry , who accepted the design commission in April 1999 ; the pavilion was constructed between June 1999 and July 2004 , opening officially on July 16 , 2004 . 
 Pritzker Pavilion serves as the centerpiece for Millennium Park and is the new home of the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the Grant Park Music Festival , the nation 's only remaining free outdoor classical music series . It also hosts a wide range of music series and annual performing arts events . Performers ranging from mainstream rock bands to classical musicians and opera singers have appeared at the pavilion , which even hosts physical fitness activities such as yoga . All rehearsals at the pavilion are open to the public ; trained guides are available for the music festival rehearsals , which are well @-@ attended . 
 Millennium Park is part of the larger Grant Park . The pavilion , which has a capacity of 11 @,@ 000 , is Grant Park 's small event outdoor performing arts venue , and complements Petrillo Music Shell , the park 's older and larger bandshell . Pritzker Pavilion is built partially atop the Harris Theater for Music and Dance , the park 's indoor performing arts venue , with which it shares a loading dock and backstage facilities . Initially the pavilion 's lawn seats were free for all concerts , but this changed when Tori Amos performed the first rock concert there on August 31 , 2005 . 
 The construction of the pavilion created a legal controversy , given that there are historic limitations on the height of buildings in Grant Park . To avoid these legal restrictions , the city classifies the bandshell as a work of art rather than a building . With several design and assembly problems , the construction plans were revised over time , with features eliminated and others added as successful fundraising allowed the budget to grow . In the end , the performance venue was designed with a large fixed seating area , a Great Lawn , a trellis network to support the sound system and a signature Gehry stainless steel headdress . It features a sound system with an acoustic design that replicates an indoor concert hall sound experience . The pavilion and Millennium Park have received recognition by critics , particularly for their accessibility ; an accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion in 2005 described it as " one of the most accessible parks – not just in the United States but possibly the world " . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The Jay Pritzker Pavilion is a home for the Grant Park Music Festival , which began in 1935 in the original Petrillo Music Shell . Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west , Grant Park has been Chicago 's front yard since the mid @-@ 19th century . Its northwest corner , north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute , east of Michigan Avenue , south of Randolph Street , and west of Columbus Drive , had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 , when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park . In 2007 , Millennium Park trailed only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction . 
 When the city first determined that a new pavilion should be built , the commission was supposed to go to Skidmore , Owings and Merrill . The original pavilion design was much more modest than the structure that was eventually built , with a smaller shell structure and speakers affixed to poles interspersed throughout the seating area . However , two factors led to the cancellation of the original plans . First , the project 's scope changed as a result of additional funds raised by John H. Bryan , former CEO of the Sara Lee Corporation . The second factor was the intervention of the Pritzker family as potential donors . Unimpressed with the pavilion 's original design , Cindy Pritzker " mandated that Frank Gehry be involved in its re @-@ design " . Jay Pritzker , a prominent Chicago businessman , had died in January 1999 ; his family own several businesses , including Hyatt Hotels . Jay and Cindy Pritzker had founded the Pritzker Prize in architecture in 1979 , and the Pritzker family 's Hyatt Foundation continues to award it annually . Architect Frank Gehry had received the Pritzker Prize in 1989 . 
 In February 1999 , the city announced it was negotiating with Gehry to design a proscenium arch and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell in the new park , as well as a pedestrian bridge over Columbus Drive ( which became BP Pedestrian Bridge ) . The city sought donors to cover Gehry 's work , and the Chicago Tribune dubbed him " the hottest architect in the universe " for his acclaimed Guggenheim Museum Bilbao . The Tribune noted Gehry 's designs would not include such Mayor Richard M. Daley trademarks as wrought iron and seasonal flower boxes . 
 Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said " Frank [ Gehry ] is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture , " and noted that no other architect was being sought . Skidmore , Owings and Merrill architect Adrian Smith approached Gehry several times on behalf of the city , which originally asked him about doing just a facade , but Gehry was uninterested . A few months later the city asked him to get involved in Millennium Park ; Gehry felt he would prefer to design a building , but that he could not complete it in time for the Millennium , and that he would need a much larger budget than the city had envisioned . 
 The city wanted Gehry , the donors supported him , and he was interested in the project . The key component in the modern themes strategy was Gehry 's acceptance of the commission in April 1999 . That month , the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $ 15 million to fund Gehry 's bandshell and an additional nine donors committed a total of $ 10 million . The day of this announcement , after it became clear that Cindy Pritzker would fund the project , Gehry agreed to the design request . In November , when his designs for both the pavilion and bridge were unveiled , Gehry already had the basic design for the bandshell , but said the bridge 's design was very preliminary and not well @-@ conceived because funding for it was not committed . The BP Pedestrian Bridge is designed to serve as a buffer against street noise , helping the pavilion 's acoustics . 
 According to the Guggenheim Museum , the Jay Pritzker Pavilion " suggests musical qualities " , much like Gehry 's Experience Music Project in Seattle , Washington . The Pritzker Pavilion follows a series of open @-@ air projects by Gehry , such as the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia , Maryland , the Concord Performing Arts Center in Concord , California , and numerous renovations to the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood , California .

 Jay Pritzker Pavilion cost $ 60 million , a quarter of which came from the Pritzker family donation . It includes 4 @,@ 000 fixed seats and a 95 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 8 @,@ 800 m2 ) Great Lawn that can accommodate an additional 7 @,@ 000 people . The pavilion was built above and behind the Harris Theater , which has the benefit that Millennium Park 's indoor and outdoor performance venues share a loading dock , rehearsal rooms and other backstage facilities . 
 The bandshell 's brushed stainless steel headdress frames the 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) proscenium theatre ; the main stage can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members . The bandshell is connected to a trellis of interlocking crisscrossing steel pipes that support the innovative sound system , which mimics indoor concert hall acoustics . The pavilion has restrooms on both its east and west sides . It is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms ; the other is McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink . The majority of the park 's 123 toilet fixtures ( 78 for women , 45 for men ) are located in underground arcades to the east and west of the pavilion , with the ones on the east being heated for winter use . 
 Millennium Park is built on top of a large underground parking garage . Construction started before the park 's design was completed , and in January 2000 , 17 additional caissons had to be added to the partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry 's pavilion . In April the tops of all these caissons had to be rebuilt for changes in the pavilion 's foundation . 
 U.S. Equities Realty was responsible for negotiating contracts with Gehry and all contractors . Walsh Construction and its subcontractors were hired to execute three elements of Gehry 's design : the structural steel supporting the stainless steel ribbons , the ribbons themselves and the trellis and associated sound system . 
 The <unk> Steel Company of Minneapolis was the subcontractor for the structural steel . The pavilion 's concrete walls frame the orchestra shell space , which is 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide , 50 feet ( 15 m ) tall and has no support columns . The pavilion 's roof rests on a dozen north – south trusses supported by east – west truss girders . The south side of the orchestra shell space is enclosed by the glass doors of the proscenium , which are about 50 feet ( 15 m ) tall , 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide and function like aircraft hangar doors made of glass . They were the largest doors that Glass Solutions of Elmhurst , Illinois , ever produced ; the thickness of the glass was a design problem for the steel supports . 
 <unk> of Kansas City , Missouri , was the subcontractor for the pavilion 's ribbons , described as " stainless steel panels that appear to be peeling back from the central opening " . The proscenium 's metal ribbons are composed of 697 panels that range from 6 to 300 square feet ( 0 @.@ 56 – 27 @.@ 87 m2 ) and 1 @,@ 600 to 20 @,@ 000 pounds ( 730 – 9 @,@ 070 kg ) with a thickness of about 14 inches ( 36 cm ) . They are made from aluminum with a stainless steel outer layer that has a uniform shade across all panels . The structural steel for the ribbons had an abnormally low fit tolerance of 0 @.@ 125 inches ( 3 @.@ 2 mm ) , rather than the standard 1 to 2 inches ( 25 to 51 mm ) . The proscenium was inspired by Gehry 's 2001 flagship store for Issey Miyake in New York City , which has sculptured titanium that represents <unk> . During construction , about five cranes and 18 aerial lifts were on site . The apex of the center element is approximately 150 feet ( 46 m ) high , which was near the limits of basic construction equipment at the time . 
 Acme Structural of Springfield , Missouri , was the subcontractor for the trellis over the Great Lawn , which resulted from the distributed sound system 's requirement for speakers every 70 feet ( 21 m ) . One way to achieve this would have involved placing the speakers on pipes or columns , but the resulting forest of columns seemed discordant with the architecture . Gehry preferred the trellis although it cost about $ 3 million more than speakers arranged on posts would have . The trellis uses 22 criss @-@ crossing arches in a lattice pattern , and is noted for its parabolic grid . The arches use pipes varying in diameter from 12 – 20 inches ( 30 – 51 cm ) depending upon the load requirements . Arches longer than 300 feet ( 91 m ) have four or five different radii , where radius describes the extent of pipe curvature . The arch pipes connect to the structural steel of the pavilion structure without linking to the metal ribbons . The trellis is 600 by 300 feet ( 183 by 91 m ) . 
 The pavilion 's construction was aided by the French CATIA software program and internet conferencing . Early plans to incorporate a surrounding waterfall and stairway were abandoned . In the end , budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most straightforward form , such as exposed pipes and conduits , or rough concrete . 
 = = = Acoustics = = = 
 The Talaske Group of Oak Park , Illinois , was the subcontractor for Jay Pritzker Pavilion 's <unk> sound system , which " generates the reflected and reverberant energy that surrounds and envelops the listener in an indoor performance venue " . The system , which effectively produces an even quality of sound throughout the entire venue , has received critical acclaim for its technological adaptations , such as signal processing in a variety of indoor and outdoor venues . The Pritzker Pavilion is the first permanent outdoor installation of the <unk> system in the United States . The trellis has both acoustic and architectural functions ; it allows for the precise placement of speakers for sound optimization without visual obstructions , while simultaneously providing a unifying visual canopy . 
 The overall acoustic system is a distributed sound reinforcement system , which allows musicians on stage to hear each other clearly in a way that facilitates ensemble play . In addition , direct natural sound from the stage is reflected from architectural surfaces as well as being reinforced by two sound systems . The forward @-@ facing reinforcement speakers time the relaying of sound so as to make it seem to have arrived directly from the stage with proper clarity and volume levels . Distributed speakers allow for lower sound volumes than would be necessary with centralized speakers , which would disturb neighboring residences and business . 
 Instead of merely reinforcing the sound like a traditional public address system , the sound system on the trellis system seeks to replicate the acoustics of a concert hall , and create a clearly defined concert space . Noise from city disturbances is masked by sound arriving directly from lateral sources . Downward facing acoustic enhancement speakers simulate sound reflection similar to indoor concert hall wall and ceiling effects . While Chicago Tribune music critic John von Rhein felt the inaugural concert 's sound quality was " a work in progress " that varied with the listener 's location in the pavilion , critics Kevin Nance and Wayne Delacoma of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times said that even on the opening weekend it was clear that the <unk> , Talaske Group , and Gehry had solved many of the problems and mysteries of the outdoor presentation of classical music . John von Rhein subsequently noted in 2005 " the system has been fine @-@ tuned over the past two summers and now delivers a warm , even approximation of concert @-@ hall sound to listeners at even the farthest reaches of the lawn . James Palermo , artistic and general director of the Grant Park Music Festival felt that the musicians were able to interact more effectively with the new sound system because they were able to hear each other better .

 Protected by legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings , Grant Park has been " forever open , clear and free " since 1836 , which was a year before the city of Chicago was incorporated . In 1839 , United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett declared the land between Randolph Street and Madison Street east of Michigan Avenue " Public Ground forever to remain vacant of buildings . Aaron Montgomery Ward , who is known both as the inventor of mail order and the protector of Grant Park , twice sued the city of Chicago to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park and to keep it from building new ones . As a result , the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park . However , Crown Fountain and the 130 @-@ foot ( 40 m ) Pritzker Pavilion were exempt from the height restrictions because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures . According to The Economist , the pavilion is described as a work of art to dodge the protections established by Ward , who " rules over Grant Park from the grave " . 
 The naming of Jay Pritzker Pavilion was a cause for protests . The new pavilion was built as a replacement for Grant Park 's decades @-@ old Petrillo Music Shell , which had a long history of hosting free music events and was named after James C. Petrillo , a labor union leader who started free concerts in Grant Park . When the original bandshell was replaced and relocated a bit further north in Grant Park in 1978 , the new structure retained the Petrillo name . In the early 2000s decade , the Petrillo family said naming the new music shell in Millennium Park after Jay Pritzker ignored Petrillo 's legacy , and threatened legal action . As of 2009 , the Petrillo Music Shell was still in use , though Chicago Tribune arts critic Howard Reich described it as " dilapidated " and " dismal " . 
 Controversies during construction involved escalating costs and delays ; both the pavilion and park opened four years later than originally planned and cost millions of dollars more than expected . 
 Once the pavilion was built , the initial plan was that the lawn seating would be free for all events . An early brochure for the Grant Park Music Festival said " You never need a ticket to attend a concert ! The lawn and the general seating section are always admission free . " However , when parking revenue fell short of estimates during the first year , the city charged $ 10 for lawn seating at the August 31 , 2005 , concert by Tori Amos . Amos , a classically trained musician who chose only piano and organ accompaniment for her concert , earned positive reviews as the inaugural rock and roll performer in a venue that regularly hosts classical music . The city justified the charge by contending that since the Pavilion is an open @-@ air venue , there were many places in Millennium Park , such as the Cloud Gate , Crown Fountain and Lurie Gardens , where one could have enjoyed the sounds or the atmosphere of the park without having to pay . 
 In addition to charging for lawn seating , the event promoters prohibited concertgoers from bringing beverages , including bottled water , to the lawn ; drinks instead had to be purchased onsite . The city later stated that confiscation of unopened beverage bottles was a mistake and that " Bottled water is always allowed at the free concerts we host at the park , and will be allowed at any future events as well . " An estimated 300 attendees set up blankets beyond the trellis system , where they could enjoy their own beverages while listening to the concert . The official Chicago policy is that alcohol is permitted throughout Jay Pritzker Pavilion during public performances , but cans and glass bottles are not permitted on the Great Lawn . During the concert , the Gehry @-@ designed BP Pedestrian Bridge that connects Millennium Park with Daley Bicentennial Plaza was closed until 7 : 00 a.m. the next day .

 Jay Pritzker Pavilion competes with <unk> Park as a Chicago area outdoor music venue . The pavilion hosts free music events such as Chicago Gospel Music Festival from spring to fall . In June , July and August , the Grammy @-@ nominated Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus performs free classical concerts at the Grant Park Music Festival . The festival , a Chicago tradition since 1931 , remains the nation 's only free , outdoor classical music series . Although the Music Festival shares pavilion space with several other program series and annual performances , its concerts most Wednesday , Friday and Saturday evenings throughout the heart of the summer are the core of the pavilion 's offerings . Travel guide Frommer 's lists the park , pavilion , and these free concerts as some of the best free things to do in Chicago . In summer the pavilion also hosts a series of jazz concerts , and the Great Lawn hosts yoga and pilates workouts on Saturday mornings . 
 The Pritzker Prize presentation ceremony , which moves to an architecturally significant location each year , was held in the Pritzker Pavilion in April 2005 . Among the annual performers at the pavilion are Steppenwolf Theatre , Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ( CSO ) . At the end of the Grant Park Music Festival season in August , the Festival 's Grant Park Orchestra and Carlos Kalmar presented Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning composer John Adams ' On the Transmigration of Souls , which was written at the request of the New York Philharmonic to honor the victims of the September 11 attacks . On Sunday September 11 , 2005 , United States Senator Barack Obama ( who was later elected President of the United States ) served as guest narrator for a 9 / 11 tribute concert by the CSO . The focal work of the concert was Aaron Copland 's " Lincoln Portrait " and the concert was led by former CSO resident conductor William <unk> . 
 Although it was built as a replacement for Grant Park 's outdoor concert facilities , larger annual events such as the Chicago Blues and Chicago Jazz Festivals and Taste of Chicago are too large for Jay Pritzker Pavilion and continue to be held in and around Petrillo Music Shell . The pavilion has hosted smaller festivals , such as the Chicago Gospel Music Festival , since 2005 . Public opinion has been in favor of moving some of the smaller Blues and Jazz festival events to the pavilion , with its better , more modern acoustics . By 2009 , as the city grappled with a budget deficit , it considered realigning parts of the larger festivals and made definite plans to move some of the smaller ones to the more modern venue . 
 On July 18 , 2007 , the Grant Park Music Festival partnered with the Metro Chicago to produce a free Wednesday @-@ night show celebrating Metro 's 25th anniversary and featuring indie band The Decemberists with the Grant Park Orchestra . The show featured new orchestral arrangements of The Decemberists ' songs by Sean O 'Loughlin , who also conducted in lieu of Kalmar . While the concert was free , the front seating sections were reserved for season membership holders ; fans of the band got the remaining seats or sat on the lawn . This led Decemberists ' frontman Colin Meloy to encourage the crowd to breach the barriers between the seats and Great Lawn to get closer to the stage for the band 's encore performance , which was without the orchestra . Estimated attendance was 11 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 , the largest for any free concert at the pavilion to date . 
 Other events include a concert by Wilco on September 12 , 2007 , the " Poland for Chicago " show with Polish President Lech Kaczyński on September 25 , 2007 , and a global warming awareness festival which culminated in a performance entitled Arctic at the pavilion in November 2007 . Most events at the pavilion remain free ; the only public event at the pavilion in the summer of 2008 that charged admission was a concert by Rogue Wave and Death Cab for Cutie on June 3 . The pavilion has hosted several one @-@ day events that were noted in international publications , including the United States debut of A Throw of Dice , a 1929 Indian silent movie about two kings with a common love interest , on July 30 , 2008 . At the debut , Nitin Sawhney and the Grant Park Orchestra accompanied the movie with a live performance . Oprah Winfrey filmed the September 8 , 2008 , season @-@ opening Oprah Winfrey Show on September 3 , 2008 , at the pavilion with more than 150 Olympic medalists , including Michael Phelps , Nastia Liukin , Dara Torres , Kobe Bryant , Misty May @-@ Treanor and Kerri Walsh , in an effort to rally support for the Chicago 2016 Olympic bid . 
 Concerts performed by the Grant Park Orchestra and directed by Kalmar were part of a June 19 , 2009 , citywide Burnham Plan centennial celebration that included the unveiling of the Burnham Pavilion elsewhere in the park . The concert featured the world premiere of Michael Torke 's work for symphony and chorus entitled Plans , paired with Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No. 3 . Also , the pavilion serves as host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival . During the festival there is a month of free dance instructions behind the glass doors of the pavilion stage and free skating instruction at the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink . 
 Among the highlights of the 2010 calendar is the screening of the BBC 's nature documentary Planet Earth Live on July 21 , with live Grant Park Symphony Orchestra accompaniment featuring the score by five @-@ time Academy Award @-@ nominated composer George Fenton , who serves as conductor . 
 Among the artists who performed with the festival at the pavilion in the 2000s decade are sopranos Karina Gauvin and Erin Wall , tenor Vittorio Grigolo , pianist Stephen Hough , violinists Rachel Barton Pine , James Ehnes , Roby Lakatos , Christian <unk> , and Pinchas Zukerman , and vocalists Otis Clay , Mariza , and Maria del Mar Bonet . All rehearsals at the pavilion are open to the public and well @-@ attended . The festival is represented by a staff of trained guides , called docents , that field questions and provide educational talks during the rehearsals . 
 Besides these public functions , the pavilion is available , as is the entire park , as a venue for private events year @-@ round . The stage 's glass and steel doors enable it to provide indoor space protected from the elements when necessary . In addition , the pavilion has a Choral Rehearsal Room that can be rented .

 Critics have said that Jay Pritzker Pavilion is the highlight of Millennium Park . Fodor 's travel guide described it as the park 's " showstopper " and " stunning " , praising its stainless steel and sound system , as well as the variety of events it hosts . Time called the pavilion " dynamic " and recommended it as one of two must @-@ see attractions in the park , while one New York Times writer found herself standing " agog " at what appeared to her to be a " celestial gateway to another universe " and a frame for the sky . Lonely Planet travel guide called the pavilion the anchor of the park , and the 2004 Year in Review issue of Time described it as the park 's crown jewel . USA Today described the bandshell as a landmark and the centerpiece of Millennium Park . Another critic described the pavilion as the " most spectacular structure to go up in early @-@ twenty @-@ first @-@ century Chicago " . 
 According to the Financial Times , the bandshell 's acoustics are unparalleled compared to any contemporary outdoor venue . Critics say that musicians have lauded the onstage acoustics . Another Financial Times critic noted that Gehry revisited some of his past design motifs , such as his use of stainless steel , and explored new ones such as the trellis and sound system . This sentiment was echoed by others . During the opening concert von Rhein noted that the sound is not of uniform quality throughout the venue and opined that the optimal sonics are toward the back of the seated area and front of the lawn . However , he subsequently noted in 2005 " the system has been fine @-@ tuned over the past two summers and now delivers a warm , even approximation of concert @-@ hall sound to listeners at even the farthest reaches of the lawn . 
 Despite the praise it has received , the pavilion has its blemishes : the supporting north side of the structure along Randolph Street has attracted criticism for not being pleasing to the eye , and some observers found the exposed supporting proscenium braces offensive . Critic Fred Bernstein of The New York Times felt that the smooth rounded trellis and sharp @-@ edged bandshell were geometrically discordant . A review in the Chicago Tribune criticized the " ugly concrete structure " surrounding the mixing console in the midst of the fixed seats as the pavilion 's " biggest design miscalculation " , and called for it be moved . Although modern practice is to locate the sound console in with the audience , Gehry said at a symposium after the park 's opening that he wanted " to scrap the big box of a sound booth that sprang up like a weed in the center of the pavilion 's seating " . The director of Millennium Park was honored for his contribution to creating " one of the most accessible parks – not just in the United States but possibly the world " in a 2005 accessibility award ceremony held at the pavilion . The pavilion 's stage is reached by gently sloped ramps instead of stairs , as part of the park 's overall accessibility design . The decision to save money and not slope the Great Lawn as much as originally planned was not universally popular . However , Gehry said that the actual slope of the lawn was more accommodating to people with disabilities and better able to accommodate activities than the original plan .

 Didsbury / <unk> / is a suburban area of Manchester , England . It lies on the north bank of the River Mersey , 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) south of Manchester city centre . The population at the 2011 census was 26 @,@ 788 . 
 Historically a part of Lancashire , there are records of Didsbury existing as a small hamlet as early as the 13th century . Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington , a feudal estate that covered a large part of what is now the south of Manchester . Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence . In 1745 Charles Edward Stuart crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby , and again in the subsequent retreat . 
 Didsbury was largely rural until the mid @-@ 19th century , when it underwent development and urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution . It became part of Manchester in 1904 . 
 The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was formed in Didsbury in 1889 .

 Didsbury derives its name from the Anglo @-@ Saxon <unk> 's burg , probably referring to a man known as <unk> whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking a place where the river Mersey could be forded . In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as <unk> , <unk> , Didsbury , or <unk> . 
 = = = Parish Church = = = 
 A charter granted in about 1260 shows that a corn @-@ grinding mill was operating in Didsbury , along the River Mersey , but the earliest reference to Didsbury is in a document dating from 1235 , recording a grant of land for the building of a chapel . The church was named St James Church in 1855 . It underwent major refurbishment in 1620 and again in the 19th century , although most of the stonework visible today dates from the 17th century . A parsonage was built next to one of the two public houses that flanked the nearby village green , Ye Olde Cock Inn , so @-@ called because of the cockfighting that used to take place there . The parsonage soon gained a reputation for being haunted ; servants refused to sleep on the premises , and it was abandoned in 1850 . Local alderman Fletcher Moss bought the house in 1865 , and lived in it for more than 40 years . In 1902 , he installed wrought iron gates at the entrance to the parsonage 's garden , which , because of the building 's reputation , became known locally as " the gates to Hell " . The parsonage became a museum , now closed , but the gardens are still open to the public . The area around St James Church has the highest concentration of listed buildings in Manchester , outside the city centre .

 Didsbury was one of the few places between Stretford and Stockport where the River Mersey could be forded , which made it significant for troop movements during the English Civil War , in which Manchester was on the Parliamentarian side . The Royalist commander , Prince Rupert , stationed himself at Didsbury Ees , to the south of Barlow Moor . It is also likely that Bonnie Prince Charlie crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745 , in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby , and again in his subsequent retreat . 
 = = = Immigration from Europe = = = 
 Jewish immigrants started to arrive in Manchester from the late 18th century , initially settling mainly in the suburbs to the north of the city . From the 1890s onwards , many of them moved to what were seen as the more " sophisticated " suburbs in the south , such as Withington and Didsbury . The influx of Jewish immigrants led to West Didsbury being nicknamed " <unk> " and Palatine Road , a main road through West Didsbury , " Palestine Road " .

 During the Victorian expansion of Manchester , Didsbury developed as a prosperous settlement ; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury Village and Parrs Wood to the east and Withington to the north , but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices . The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury , with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central . The line closed in 1967 , although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s . The station clock and water fountain have survived , dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor , Dr. J. Milson Rhodes . 
 On 28 April 1910 , French pilot Louis Paulhan landed his Farman biplane in <unk> Fields , <unk> Fold Farm , on the borders of Withington , Burnage and Didsbury , at the end of the first flight from London to Manchester in under 24 hours , with one short overnight stop at Lichfield . Arriving at 5 : 30 am , Paulhan beat the British contender , Claude Grahame @-@ White , winning a £ 10 @,@ 000 prize offered by the Daily Mail . This was the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city . Two special trains were chartered to the newly built but unopened Burnage Station to take spectators to the landing , many of whom had stood throughout the night . Paulhan 's progress was followed throughout by a special train carrying his wife , Henri Farman and his mechanics . Afterwards his train took the party to a civic reception given by the Lord Mayor of Manchester in the Town Hall . A house in Paulhan Road , constructed in the 1930s near the site of his landing , is marked by a blue plaque to commemorate his achievement .

 In the early 13th century , Didsbury lay within the manor of Withington , a feudal estate that also included the townships of Withington , Chorlton @-@ cum @-@ Hardy , Moss Side , Rusholme , Burnage , Denton and Haughton , ruled by the Hathersage , Longford and Tatton families , and within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire . Didsbury remained within the manor of Withington for several centuries . 
 By 1764 , Didsbury was described as a township in its own right . It became a civil parish in 1866 , and in 1876 was incorporated into the Withington Urban Sanitary District , superseded in 1894 by the creation of Withington Urban District . Withington Urban District was a subdivision of the administrative county of Lancashire , created as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1894 . In 1904 , Withington Urban District was amalgamated into the city and county borough of Manchester , and so Didsbury was absorbed into Manchester , although it remained a civil parish until 1910 . Following the Local Government Act 1972 , Manchester became a metropolitan borough of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester .

 Didsbury is in the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Withington , and is represented by Jeff Smith MP , a member of the Labour Party . 
 Until 2004 , most of the area formed the Didsbury ward of Manchester City Council with a section of West Didsbury contained within the Barlow Moor ward . However , boundary changes in 2004 resulted in Didsbury being split mainly between the two new wards of Didsbury East and Didsbury West while a small section of West Didsbury was incorporated into the new ward of Chorlton Park . Didsbury East is represented by Labour councillors James Wilson , Bridie Adams and Andrew Simcock . Didsbury West is represented by Labour <unk> Josie <unk> and David Ellison and Liberal Democrat John Leech . All wards within Manchester elect in thirds on a four yearly cycle .

 The River Mersey forms Didsbury 's southern and southwestern boundaries and certain stretches of the river also demarcate the boundaries of the City of Manchester . The area is generally considered to be roughly enclosed by Princess Parkway to the west , Kingsway to the east and the Ball Brook , just north of Lapwing Lane / Fog Lane to the north . This northern boundary is marked by a boundary stone in the front garden wall of a house on the west side of Wilmslow Road . A " country trail " passes from West Didsbury to East , named the Trans Pennine Trail ( National Cycle Route 62 ) . It was sited along a disused railway track , as part of a nationwide initiative to promote cycling . 
 Didsbury 's built environment has developed around the areas of East Didsbury , West Didsbury , and Didsbury Village , which separates the two . The Albert Park conservation area , covering much of West Didsbury , places planning restrictions on development , alterations to buildings , and pruning of trees . The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river 's flood plain , and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall . The last major flooding was in the late 1960s . In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped to speed up the passage of floodwater . Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden also acts as an emergency flood basin , storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river .

 Between 1956 and 1969 , the old Capitol Theatre at the junction of Parrs Wood Road and School Lane served as the northern studios of ITV station ABC Weekend Television . Early episodes of The Avengers and programmes such as Opportunity Knocks were made in the studios . ABC ceased to use the site in 1968 when it lost its ITV franchise , on its merger with fellow ITV company Rediffusion . The site was then used briefly by Yorkshire Television until its own facilities in Leeds were ready . In 1971 , the studios were acquired by Manchester Polytechnic , who used it for cinema , television studies and theatre . The building was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for a residential development , but the name lives on in the form of a new theatre space in the heart of the <unk> campus in the All Saints area along Oxford Road , just to the south of Manchester city centre .

 Didsbury is close to junction 5 of Manchester 's ring road , the M60 motorway . Manchester Airport , the busiest airport in the UK outside London , is about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 5 km ) to the south . 
 Didsbury is served by several bus routes into Manchester city centre , The Trafford Centre , Northenden , and other destinations . Wilmslow Road provides Didsbury with a regular bus service due to the strong demand for travel by students along the corridor . The service is cheap and passengers rarely have to wait more than a couple of minutes . According to some analysts , Wilmslow Road is the busiest bus corridor in Europe . 
 East Didsbury and Burnage are the nearest railway stations , on the line between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport . Between 1880 and 1967 the area had been served by two other railway stations , Didsbury station and West Didsbury station , both on the South Manchester lines into Manchester Central station . The entire line was shut in 1967 following the Beeching Axe .

 These extension plans were rejected by the government in 2004 , due to escalating costs . New plans were drawn up in 2007 , with at least some of the money required for the construction of the line planned to come from the proposed Manchester Congestion Charge , which was overwhelmingly rejected by public vote in 2008 . 
 In May 2009 , AGMA agreed to the provision of additional funding that secured the construction of Metrolink to the area . This included additional stops at Withington , Burton Road , West Didsbury , Didsbury Village and East Didsbury .
