 Dom Afonso ( 23 February 1845 – 11 June 1847 ) was the Prince Imperial and heir apparent to the throne of the Empire of Brazil . Born in Rio de Janeiro , he was the eldest child of Emperor Dom Pedro II and Dona Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies , and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza . 
 Afonso died from epilepsy at the age of two , devastating the emperor . The following year , Pedro and Teresa Cristina had another son , Pedro Afonso , but he too died in infancy . After the loss of his second son , doubts grew in Pedro II 's mind that the imperial system could be viable . He still had an heir in his daughter Isabel , but he was unconvinced that a female would prove to be a suitable successor . He showed less concern about the effects his policies had on the monarchy , provided his daughter Isabel with no training for her role as potential empress , and failed to cultivate her acceptance within the country 's political class . Pedro II 's lack of interest in protecting the imperial system ultimately led to its downfall . 
 = = Infancy and early death = = 
 = = = Birth = = = 
 Afonso was born at 13 : 35 on 23 February 1845 in the Palace of São Cristóvão , in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . He was named after his ancestor Afonso , Duke of Braganza , son of King João I of Portugal and founder of the House of Braganza ( Portuguese : Bragança ) . His full name was Afonso Pedro de Alcântara Cristiano Leopoldo Filipe Eugênio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga . Through his father , Emperor Pedro II , he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza ( Portuguese : Bragança ) and was referred to using the honorific " Dom " ( Lord ) from birth . Afonso was the grandson of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil and nephew of Queen Maria II of Portugal . Through his mother , Teresa Cristina , he was a grandson of Francis I and nephew to Ferdinand II , who ruled as kings of the Two Sicilies in turn . 
 The U.S. minister in Brazil reported that his birth was heralded " by rockets and artillery , and was followed by a grand <unk> day at court ... and by illuminations and displays of various sorts and public <unk> " . As was customary within the House of Braganza , Afonso 's birth was a formal event attended by the imperial court . Pedro II immediately presented the newborn baby to the throng gathered in the palace , announcing " Gentlemen , it is a prince whom God ... " — here he was overcome with emotion and was unable to continue . The birth of a much needed male heir — thus regarded by contemporaries — was met with joy throughout the empire . Luís Alves de Lima e Silva ( then Baron and later Duke of Caxias ) wrote to his father : " No one was happier than I with the news [ of the prince 's birth ] " . 
 The birth of an heir produced changes in Pedro II 's character . Previously isolated and shy , he became more outgoing and confident as monarch . His strained relationship with his wife , the product of a disappointed arranged marriage , also improved , and with children came shared domestic interests that developed into an affectionate friendship . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Afonso was healthy , and as the eldest son of Pedro II , was heir to the throne and styled " Prince Imperial " . The young prince resembled his father , particularly in his face , hair and eyes . Because of his gender and position as heir apparent , he became the center of attention , particularly for Pedro II . A letter written by Pedro II to his elder sister Maria II a few months after the birth of his second child — a daughter named Isabel — displayed his happiness : " No news here save the good state of health of myself , of the empress , and of the little ones , who are becoming increasingly cute , principally little Afonso , who is already walking and who says many words , still half incomprehensible , the which increases their charm . " 
 On 11 June 1847 , the young prince was playing in the library of the palace when he experienced a series of strong convulsions and died , not quite two and a half years old . His death revealed that Afonso suffered from epilepsy , as did his father . The grief of Pedro II and his wife was enormous . It was feared that the shock might affect Teresa Cristina 's health , as she was pregnant at the time with her third child . She later gave birth without complications on 13 July to a girl , who was christened Leopoldina . The devastated emperor wrote a letter to his stepmother , the Empress Amélia , dated 11 July 1847 , telling her of Afonso 's death : " With the most piercing grief I tell you that my little Afonso , your godson , unfortunately died of convulsions , which he suffered during five hours on the 4th of last month ; and a few days ago little Isabel was put at risk by a strong attack of convulsions that greatly frightened me . " 
 A grand state funeral — not seen since the death of Pedro II 's sister Paula in 1833 — was held for the Prince Imperial at 7 p.m. three days after his death . He was buried in the Convento da Ajuda ( Convent of Aid ) in Rio de Janeiro . When the convent was demolished in 1911 his remains were moved to the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio ( Convent of Saint Anthony ) in Rio de Janeiro , where other members of the Brazilian House of Braganza ( including his younger brother Pedro , his uncle João and his aunt Paula ) are also located . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 The prince 's early death ( and the later demise of his younger brother ) had an enormous impact on Pedro II : on a personal level , on his future conduct as monarch , and on the empire . In his eyes , the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system . Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel , in the male @-@ dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil . He was fond and respectful of the women in his life , but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch . He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne , nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class . 
 Pedro II began his rule as a figurehead who held together a realm on the verge of disintegration . He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises . By the time of Afonso 's death , the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity , development and tranquility . Even as the emperor 's political successes and policies began to bear fruit , the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants . The emperor turned away from personal and family ties , and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered modernization and social advancement . The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer mattered to him , and in 1889 , he was deposed in a coup , marking the end of the Empire of Brazil .

 Juha Harri " Junnu " Vainio , also known as Juha " Watt " Vainio ( 10 May 1938 in Kotka , Finland – 29 October 1990 , Gryon , Switzerland ) was a Finnish lyricist , singer , composer and teacher . With the lyrics or music to over 2 @,@ 400 songs to his name , Vainio is as one of Finland 's most prolific lyricists along with <unk> <unk> , Reino <unk> and Vexi Salmi . Vainio enjoyed a short professional career as a teacher at <unk> Primary School . 
 Vainio began writing songs in the early 1960s and continued until his death . Apart from his home town Kotka , he lived for several years in Helsinki and Espoo . In his last years Vainio lived in Gryon , Switzerland , where he died of a heart attack in October 1990 . He is buried in the family grave in Helsinki . 
 He was given the nickname " Watt " on account of a song on his first solo record , the 1964 Paras <unk> ( " The Best <unk> Band " ) . Never used by itself , the nickname was always part of " Juha Watt Vainio " . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Family and childhood = = = 
 Juha Harri Vainio was born on May 10 , 1938 , in Kotka , the first child of Tauno and Kaarina Vainio . He spent much of his early childhood in <unk> , <unk> his two siblings were Marja ( born 1944 ) and Markku ( born 1946 ) . 
 Vainio 's grandfather , Emil <unk> ( born 1881 ) , changed his name to Vainio soon after the turn of the century . Vainio 's family on his father 's side boasted many athletes whilst Kaarina Vainio had some athletic background . After becoming engaged to Kaarina in 1937 , Tauno Vainio worked in <unk> as a regional head of the White Guard , and was known as a man of principle . Kaarina Vainio had a middle school education , and Tauno Vainio had graduated as a trade technician . 
 As a child , Juha Vainio loved singing and the family 's neighbours often asked him to come over and perform . When the Winter War started in 1939 , Juha was too young to understand events . After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force , Juha moved with his mother to Metsola , Kotka . As an adult , the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air @-@ raid sirens and people 's anxiety . He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war , but on the other hand admitted that the war left him with emotional scars . His song <unk> <unk> ( " Some Kind of War Veteran " ) , on the album Sellaista elämä on ( " That 's How Life Is " ) , echoes these sentiments . Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed , Juha and his mother had to often evacuate . Sometimes they went to stay at her mother 's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen , a cousin of his mother . The two had an age difference of six years . The only brother of Kaarina Vainio , Mauno , was killed in the war . 
 In 1945 , the <unk> moved into a detached house in Metsola where they lived until 1950 before moving again to <unk> , in the centre of Kotka . Juha Vainio recalled that the most beautiful years of his childhood were spent in Metsola . It was there that he met <unk> <unk> , four years his senior and who later featured in Vainio 's song <unk> <unk> ( " <unk> Bachelors " ) . Vainio often spent time in the harbour of Kotka with his friends . He was fond of the sea throughout his life . 
 As a child Juha Vainio was diagnosed with congenital heart disease , causing his lips to turn blue , and the onset of rapid breathlessness . He underwent a heart operation in early 1949 at the same time as his mother suffered an attack of tuberculosis from which she later recovered . Juha was at first kept in the adults ' ward due to the serious nature of the operation , but later transferred to the children 's ward to recover . He soon went home and began to get better . 
 = = = School = = = 
 Juha Vainio 's education did not start well . Frustrated with school he was once absent for three weeks without permission . After primary school he attended a gymnasium in Kotka . At the same time his family moved from Metsola to <unk> . During his school years , Vainio 's best friend was Risto " Tiso " Warjus , two years his senior . They both sang in the Kotka Gymnasium choir . <unk> 's music teacher at the gymnasium , Arvo Vainio , was nicknamed " Junnu " on account of his big nose resembling that of a comic book character of the same name . Later on the name was given to Juha Vainio because he had the same surname as the teacher . 
 When he was fifteen , Vainio felt sure he would become a writer . As a young man he read a book about poetics , and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them . It became apparent in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer . However , teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing ; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column @-@ like text he had written , because the teacher felt that it could not be graded as an essay . Although essays were his strong point , school was uninteresting for Juha . He considered quitting school , but the principal persuaded him to change his mind . He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus . In the end , the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports . 
 Around 1957 Vainio 's family moved from the centre of Kotka to near the harbour . After a few years they moved again , this time to a neighbourhood near <unk> . From childhood , Juha Vainio practiced sport even though before surgery he had suffered from heart problems . He liked football and basketball , which were very popular in Kotka and also practiced high jump together with Tiso Warjus . After his heart operation , Juha 's physical condition deteriorated , but doing sport helped him improve it . 
 = = = First contact with music = = = 
 Juha Vainio became interested in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid @-@ 1950s . The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant <unk> where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio 's mother , Olli Miettinen played . Although Vainio was under @-@ 21 and classed as a minor , he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano . Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless . He started drinking more and more , often asking his friends for a drink . 
 In late 1956 Vainio lived next door to one of his musician friends , Heikki <unk> , who was three years his senior . Vainio also became acquainted with drummer Erkki <unk> . The friends had different tastes in music with Olli Miettinen and Reijo " Rempo " Tani listening to jazz , while Vainio liked schlager music . Vainio later named and described many of his friends in his song lyrics . 
 Vainio was called up in 1957 for service in the Finnish army . He was 19 years old and in the penultimate grade of gymnasium . However , he did not want to start his military service right after the matriculation exams , because he wanted to find a profession first . The next spring , the last year of gymnasium , he decided to go to Paris for the holidays with his friend Pekka . Vainio was supposed to pass his matriculation exams in the spring of 1959 , but he failed the Swedish exam and had to wait until the autumn to pass it . 
 = = = Fatherhood , teaching and military service = = = 
 In <unk> , Juha Vainio met his future wife Taina Kaukonen . When Taina became pregnant in early 1960 , Juha 's parents scolded the young father . As a result the couple married in the summer of 1960 and a son Ilkka followed in October of the same year . Juha and Taina had three more children : Sami in 1961 , Kalle in 1963 and Kati in 1967 . At first the young couple lived at Juha 's parents ' , but moved to Helsinki when Juha started his studies there . He studied at the <unk> <unk> ( School of Social Sciences , which later became the University of Tampere ) and later the <unk> ( School of Vocational Teacher Education ) where he graduated as a school teacher . 
 Juha Vainio taught higher classes at <unk> Primary School where the pupils informally called him " Junnu " . His teaching methods were relaxed , such as making the pupils sing a children 's song instead of a hymn in the morning . The pupils could also eat and watch television with Vainio . In 1964 he had a temporary absence from teaching due to military service . Already having some reputation as a lyricist , whilst in the army Vainio was assigned to write the lyrics for the new cadence of the Karelia Brigade . Vainio finished his military service in the autumn of 1964 , at the age of 26 .

 Vainio 's musical influences included Tapio Rautavaara , Georg <unk> and Henry <unk> . As a young man he trained to play music because he wanted to become a professional musician . He started writing lyrics for friends ' bands , and his texts brought him some fame . Vainio was above all a lyricist ; he wrote lyrics or music for over 2 @,@ 400 published songs , the majority of which were recorded by others . Many of Vainio 's lyrics were written for Toivo Kärki 's compositions . He translated popular foreign songs into Finnish , work that he later abandoned since translators only received a fixed payment for their work rather than royalties . 
 At the beginning of his career , comedian <unk> Pasanen asked Vainio and his friends to play in a radio show called <unk> ( " Thrashing House of <unk> " ) . The band accepted , and after Pasanen gave up the radio show to start his television career , the musicians followed him . They played in Pasanen 's shows including <unk> <unk> ( " <unk> 's Saloon " ) and 50 <unk> <unk> ( " 50 Small Minutes " ) . 
 With the help of his friend Erkki <unk> , Vainio got a record deal with recording company <unk> . His debut single , Paras <unk> was recorded in 1964 . At the same time Vainio received the nickname " Watt " , which was printed on the front cover of the single . Vainio wrote lyrics for several performers , including Katri Helena . In 1965 his parents and siblings moved to Helsinki , and at about the same time Vainio and his family moved to Espoo , where they lived for over 25 years . In 1966 he lost a good friend when Olli Miettinen died at the age of 34 . 
 Vainio 's songs <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Where Do I Find a Friend " ) and <unk> ( " Monday Tango " ) had already been recorded by Katri Helena in 1963 before Vainio 's military service . After leaving the army , Vainio befriended composer and music journalist <unk> <unk> ( known to the Finnish public by the pseudonym <unk> ) , who told him that <unk> was in need of lyricists . Eager to leave his job as a teacher , Vainio quit and started collaborating with musician Reino <unk> . Their song <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " You Belong in Every Day " ) , composed by <unk> with lyrics by Vainio , was given to Eino Grön who made it into a hit . 
 Vainio worked at <unk> Music as a lyricist with monthly salary and at the same time wrote his own songs . He translated several international hits into Finnish , including <unk> ( " Hideout " , originally " You 've Got Your Troubles " ) by Danny and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Now I 'm Furious " ) , which became the breakthrough recording of pop group " The First " . Vainio was often late for arranged studio sessions , which irritated the bands and the company 's management . At 30 , Vainio wrote one of his best @-@ known translations , Fredi 's <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Back along <unk> <unk> " ) . Another success was his translation of The Beatles ' " Penny Lane " , recorded by Pepe <unk> as <unk> ( " To <unk> " ) . Although Vainio 's version is set in Helsinki , he has said he was thinking about Kotka when he wrote the lyrics . 
 In addition to writing songs for others , Vainio became a popular solo artist . He also wrote the music to several of his songs , despite never considering himself a singer or a composer but above all a lyricist . At first he worked with Pertti <unk> 's orchestra , recording the song " Hum @-@ Boogie " ( wordplay on the word <unk> , meaning " humbug " ) . Among his first recorded songs were Jos vain <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " If Only I Would Get the Spike Tooth Back " ) from 1964 and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ( " Salt , Salt , More Salt " ) along with <unk> ( " Midsummer 's Ball " ) from 1965 . All were included on Vainio 's debut album , Juha " Watt " Vainio . 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s Vainio had success with <unk> ol ' Viipuri ( " Such Was Vyborg " ) , <unk> <unk> ( " Tourists Arrive in the Small Town " ) and a song written with Erik Lindström , <unk> Helsingin ( " Big Shots of Helsinki " ) . When the <unk> company was sold to Scandia , Vainio and Lindström 's collaboration ended . <unk> soon afterwards became acquainted with composer Jaakko Salo , who was introduced to him by <unk> . He started writing lyrics for composer Toivo Kärki , who had lost his primary lyricist Reino <unk> in January 1965 . 
 Well @-@ known songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s included Suomi – <unk> ( " Finland – Sweden " ) and the 1971 release Matkarakastaja ( " Travelling Lover " ) , which met with criticism . While Vainio 's early albums were collections of singles , he recorded his first proper studio album in 1972 . The album Viisari värähtää ( " The Pointer Twitches " ) included the song <unk> ( a reference to a place in Finland ) , which Vainio recorded several times during his career . It was also included on his next album , Tulin , <unk> ja <unk> ( " I Came , I Saw , I Played " ) , which was released in 1975 . Although Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää were Vainio 's earliest published compositions , it was not until the late 1970s that he began to compose music more actively . 
 In 1966 Vainio befriended Vexi Salmi and Irwin Goodman . The trio made a summer tour called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Give People What the People Want " ) but at times Vainio was too intoxicated to perform . Vainio and Reijo Tani made a collection of singles in 1968 called Juha " Watt " Vainio ja Reijo Tani . The album included Vainio 's <unk> <unk> ( " Horrible Hangover " ) and <unk> <unk> Laitinen ( " Old Smuggler Laitinen " ) , which were both collaborations with Toivo Kärki . The latter song was named after Keijo Laitinen , a good friend of Vainio 's . In 1970 Vainio started writing <unk> with Gunnar Mattsson . 
 = = = Back to teaching = = = 
 Vainio returned to teaching in the early 1970s . Vainio made up nicknames for all his pupils , who in return called him Junnu . He had a habit of coming up with very unorthodox methods of punishment but in general got on well with his pupils . Often late and in the habit of leaving a lot of paperwork unfinished , shortly before he quit teaching Vainio organized an excursion for the pupils to express his gratitude for the time he had spent with them . 
 = = = Alcohol use = = = 
 As time went by , Vainio consumed more and more alcohol . In the late 1960s he frequented <unk> <unk> with Gunnar Mattsson and <unk> Elo . He often carried a hip flask in case he ran out of something to drink . Vainio 's deteriorating family relationships are considered to be one reason for his drinking . Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem , he always managed to finish his lyrics on time . 
 Vainio 's friends Heikki <unk> and Reijo Tani quit drinking in 1972 , and at first Vainio found their decision odd . When Vexi Salmi was hired by <unk> in 1970 , Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers . On one occasion , Vainio forgot that he was supposed to have finished the text of an advertising tune . When the deadline arrived , Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio 's composition . Vainio 's alcohol use increased in the 1970s , and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it . It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed , and he always kept a bottle with him . Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever . By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether . He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai <unk> , who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive . In late 1975 , Vainio stayed sober for four months , but then caved in for a short time . In January 1976 he finally managed to quit drinking for good . 
 Vainio was supported by his friends who had quit drinking a few years earlier , such as Osmo " <unk> " <unk> . Eino Grön , a friend of Vainio 's , decided to follow his example and managed to quit a year and a half after Vainio . Vainio never wanted to be called a teetotaler and considered himself a recovered alcoholic . After he quit drinking , Vainio 's songs became more serious and more sensitive , although he still wrote humorous lyrics as well . 
 Although Vainio himself did not consume alcohol , he was tolerant about others ' alcohol use and could spend time with his friends even if they drank , keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over . He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics . Getting rid of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio 's domestic problems ; he and Taina ended up divorcing . 
 = = = Changes = = = 
 After his divorce , Vainio 's life slowly began to change . Creatively he was more prolific than ever in the late 1970s and 1980s . He began composing in addition to writing lyrics . He worked a lot with Veikko Samuli and Jaakko Salo , and Salo started arranging songs Vainio had written . 
 In 1976 Vainio 's <unk> , <unk> from Kansi <unk> ja <unk> ( " Shut the Lid and Goodbye " ) was criticized for its commentary about German tourists who visit Lapland . The album also featured a sensitive song , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " I Believe in Tomorrow " ) . Other well @-@ known songs from the album are Playboy 60 v ( " Playboy 60 yrs " ) , Suomi – <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Back Again to Where I Grew Up " ) . 
 Vainio began composing actively in the late 1970s , although he had already published his own compositions at the beginning of the decade . His earliest compositions include Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää . Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " I Walk by the Side of a Glade " ) from the 1979 album of the same name . Even though Vainio had already quit drinking , he still occasionally sang about alcohol . Vainio started writing more sensitive songs , a trend which became evident in his next albums . 1981 's Albatrossi ja <unk> ( " The Albatross and the Duck " ) contains one of Vainio 's most well @-@ known songs , Albatrossi . The topic of the song was lost youth . Another sensitive song on the album is <unk> <unk> ( " The Pharmacy Doorbell " ) , the idea for which Vainio got from Tapio Rautavaara . Other well @-@ known songs were Panaman <unk> ( " The Consul of Panama " ) and Kun <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " When I Started Drinking " ) . 
 In 1976 , Vainio was hired to write a number of bawdy songs which were later released on cassette tape . Vainio wrote a part of the songs and sang on the record with all musicians using pseudonyms , Vainio 's being Junnu Kaihomieli . Many of the songs were based on a familiar melody whose copyright had already expired ; for example , the song Kumi @-@ Roope ( " Rubber Roope " ) was an obscene version of the folk song <unk> @-@ Roope ( " Roope the Robber " ) . In 1979 Vainio participated in another recording of similar songs . The songs were released on compact disc in 1992 and 1997 as <unk> <unk> <unk> 1 – 2 ( " Bad Boys ' Songs 1 – 2 " ) and Porno @-@ <unk> / <unk> <unk> <unk> 3 ( " Porn Opera / Bad Boys ' Songs 3 " ) . Both records went gold . 
 In 1982 Vainio collaborated with bodybuilder Kike <unk> when they sang together on the single <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " You 'll Get in Shape Too " ) , with lyrics by Vainio . The B @-@ side of the single was <unk> ja <unk> ( " Serious and Still " ) , sung by <unk> alone . A compilation album called Sellaista elämä on ( " That 's How Life Is " ) followed in 1983 , consisting of the most popular songs Vainio had himself recorded . 1985 's <unk> ja <unk> ( " Life and Erotica " ) was Vainio 's last finished studio album . Popular pieces from the album included Aleks ja Jaan ( " Aleks and Jaan " ) , <unk> <unk> kun <unk> ( " When We Hung Out with Heiskanen " ) and <unk> <unk> ( " Lonely Ash Tree " ) . 
 After his divorce , Vainio had started dating <unk> <unk> . The couple were married on 27 December 1981 in <unk> . In 1983 they had a daughter , <unk> . The couple moved to Switzerland in the late 1980s . In 1988 Katri Helena , Eino Grön , Pave <unk> and other popular artists performed at a concert organized to celebrate Vainio 's 50th birthday .

 Vainio 's childhood heart problems surfaced again in 1990 with his sister Marja recalling that he often placed his hand over his heart . He had even finished writing his will . At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend , composer Veikko Samuli . Vainio had to go to the bathroom during the flight , and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew . Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket , where the box had opened and mixed with his <unk> . Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident , and his heartbeat started to slow down . Once a stewardess found out what had happened , she saved Vainio 's life by quickly forcing him to vomit . 
 Vainio gave his last performance on 12 October 1990 . He died of a heart attack in his home in Gryon , Switzerland , on October 29 , 1990 , in the arms of his wife . He was 52 years old . A burial ceremony was held in the town of Vevey , and Vainio 's body brought back to Finland and buried in the family grave in <unk> graveyard in Helsinki . 
 The day before he died , Vainio had become friends with ice hockey coach Juhani Tamminen and dined with his family . According to Tamminen , Vainio had been in good condition at the time . The following week Tamminen learned of Vainio 's death from a friend who had read about it in a Finnish newspaper . 
 The record Vainio had worked on during the final years of his life was released posthumously by Scandia in 1991 as <unk> <unk> ( " Tunes of a Fifty @-@ year @-@ old " ) . Especially important for Vainio had been the song <unk> <unk> ( " Long Ago " ) which he had recorded in the early 1970s . Vainio 's most important collaborator during his last years was producer Jaakko Salo .

 Juha Vainio 's best @-@ known nicknames were Junnu and Juha " Watt " Vainio . Junnu was a familiar name also used in connection with his last name as Junnu Vainio . The name Juha " Watt " Vainio was used on the cover of several albums and was a name he was publicly known by . Vainio 's friends never used the nickname Watt – for them he always remained Junnu . 
 Among the pseudonyms used by Vainio were Junnu , Junnu Kaihomieli , Jorma Koski , Ilkka <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Heikki Ilmari . The name Junnu Kaihomieli was used for Vainio 's bawdy songs in the late 1970s .

 Peter von Bagh regards Vainio as the pioneer of Finnish 1960s humorous songs since he began their composition before Irwin Goodman . Producer Jaakko Salo commented that Vainio 's career found a new start once Vainio quit drinking . According to him , it is evident from Vainio 's texts that his songs are based on his own experiences . 
 According to writer and film director Jukka Virtanen , Vainio usually wrote his lyrics at the same time as the music . This is evident in the song <unk> <unk> , written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding . Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace , songs were never easy for him to write . His work did not become easier when he quit drinking , but it did become more emotional .

 Vainio frequently played football and basketball in his youth and later on remained an enthusiastic spectator . He wrote the lyrics for ice @-@ hockey team Tappara 's anthem Tappara on <unk> ( " Tappara Is Made of Steel " ) , which was composed by Reijo <unk> in 1976 . Tappara 's manager Mikko Westberg asked Vainio to write a song for the team , requesting that the lyrics contain the phrases " Tappara is made of steel " and " rye bread " . Vainio became a lifetime fan of Tappara after writing the song . 
 Vainio was fond of the sea and sailing . He often took his family and friends sailing in his boat , and in 1987 bought an island in <unk> with his wife <unk> . His love for sailing is evident in the song <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> ( " Everything But Sailing Is Pointless " ) , which was composed by Lasse <unk> .

 Since Vainio 's death many tribute concerts have been staged , with an event to celebrate his 70th birthday taking place in May 2008 . Vainio 's friend , songwriter Jukka Virtanen , wrote a play called Albatrossi ja Heiskanen ( " The Albatross and Heiskanen " ) based on Vainio 's songs . It was first performed in his hometown Kotka in 1992 and has been performed many times since . The Finnish film <unk> ( " The Empire " ) describes the youth of Vainio and his friends in Kotka during the 1950s . 
 The " Juha Vainio Award " ( Juha Vainio @-@ <unk> ) for writers was introduced in 1991 and is given annually to notable Finnish lyricists with yearly prize money of 5 @,@ 000 euros ( previously 30 @,@ 000 Finnish <unk> ) . In December 1994 , a club named Junnun <unk> ( Junnu 's singing club ) was established . Its members include Vainio 's friends Keijo Laitinen , Pertti <unk> and Reijo Tani . The club has published two books entitles Junnun <unk> 1 and Junnun <unk> 2 . 
 Vainio 's work continues to have major relevance in Finnish popular music , an example of which being two Vainio cover albums by Vesa @-@ Matti Loiri in 2003 and 2004 . 
 All of the songs that Vainio recorded were published in 2008 in a CD boxed set <unk> <unk> – <unk> <unk> 1963 – 1990 ( " Songs of the Legend – All Recordings 1963 – 1990 " ) . It included his advertising jingles , bawdy songs and a book . A compilation album released with the boxed set called <unk> <unk> – 48 <unk> ( " Songs of the Legend – 40 Masterpieces " ) reached second place in Finnish album charts . Juha Vainio 's son Ilkka Vainio is in the music business and works as a music producer and songwriter .

 = Italian battleship Emanuele Filiberto = 
 The Emanuele Filiberto was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Italian Navy ( Italian : Regia Marina ) during the 1890s . Her keel was laid down in October 1893 and she was launched in September 1897 ; work was completed in April 1902 . She had one sister ship , Ammiraglio di Saint Bon , the lead ship of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class . She was armed with a main battery of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns and was capable of a speed in excess of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Emanuele Filiberto served in the active squadron of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career . She was assigned to the 3rd Division during the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 1912 . During the war , she was involved in the assaults on Tripoli in North Africa and on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea . She was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914 – 15 , but the need for warships granted Emanuele Filiberto a respite . She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice . She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Emanuele Filiberto was 111 @.@ 8 meters ( 367 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 21 @.@ 12 m ( 69 @.@ 3 ft ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 27 m ( 23 @.@ 9 ft ) . She displaced 9 @,@ 940 long tons ( 10 @,@ 100 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple expansion engines rated at 13 @,@ 522 ihp ( 10 @,@ 083 kW ) . Steam for the engines was provided by twelve coal @-@ fired cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 18 @.@ 1 knots ( 34 km / h ; 21 mph ) and a range of approximately 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Emanuele Filiberto had a crew of 565 officers and enlisted men . 
 As built , the ship was armed with four 10 in ( 254 mm ) 40 @-@ caliber guns placed in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The ship was also equipped with eight 6 in ( 152 mm ) 40 @-@ cal. guns in individual casemates amidships . She was also equipped with six 3 in ( 76 mm ) 40 @-@ cal. guns in shielded pivot mounts directly above the casemate battery . The ship 's gun armament was rounded out by eight 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns . Emanuele Filiberto also carried four 17 @.@ 7 in ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes in deck @-@ mounted launchers . The ship was protected with Harvey steel . The main belt was 9 @.@ 8 in ( 249 mm ) thick , and the deck was 2 @.@ 75 in ( 70 mm ) thick . The conning tower was protected by 9 @.@ 8 in of armor plating . The main battery guns had 9 @.@ 8 in thick plating , and the casemates were 5 @.@ 9 in ( 150 mm ) thick .

 Emanuele Filiberto was named after Prince Emanuele Filiberto , Duke of Aosta . She was built by the Castellammare Naval Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia , Naples . She was laid down on 5 October 1893 and was launched on 29 September 1897 . In September 1900 , the ship began her sea trials off Naples ; during the tests , Emanuele Filiberto maintained a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) for a two @-@ hour period . She was completed on 16 April 1902 , although she had been commissioned on 6 September 1901 . 
 Emanuele Filiberto spent the first several years of her career in the 1st Squadron , along with her sister Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the two Regina Margherita @-@ class battleships . In October 1906 , the ship participated in major fleet maneuvers under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di <unk> in the Ionian Sea . The exercises lasted from 10 to 26 October . The maneuvers culminated in a mock attack by the Italian fleet on the harbor defenses at Taranto . During the 1908 maneuvers , Emanuele Filiberto served in the friendly squadron , while Ammiraglio de Saint Bon was assigned to the hostile squadron . 
 = = = Italo @-@ Turkish War = = = 
 On 29 September 1911 , Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya . Emanuele Filiberto served in the 3rd Division , which she joined on 30 September . She served alongside Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the two Regina Margherita @-@ class battleships . The ship took part in the bombardment of the fortresses defending Tripoli on 3 October . Italian soldiers went ashore two days later , and by the 11th , they had taken the city . In December , she was stationed in Italy . 
 On 13 April 1912 , Emanuele Filiberto and the rest of the 3rd Division sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to rendezvous with the 1st Division . The two units met on 17 April off the island of Stampalia , after which the combined fleet steamed north . The following day , the ships cut submarine telegraph cables between Imbros , Tenedos , Lemnos , Salonica , and the Dardanelles . Most of the fleet bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles ; in the meantime , Emanuele Filiberto and the torpedo boat Ostro steamed to the port of <unk> on the island of Samos and bombarded the Ottoman army barracks there . Ostro then torpedoed an Ottoman gunboat in the harbor , after which the Italian ships left . On 19 April , Emanuele Filiberto and most of the fleet returned to Italy , leaving only Pisa , Amalfi , and a flotilla of torpedo boats to cruise off the Ottoman coast . 
 On 30 April , Emanuele Filiberto and the rest of the 3rd Division escorted a convoy of troopships from Tobruk to the island of Rhodes . The Italian heavy ships demonstrated off the city of Rhodes while the transports landed the expeditionary force 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the south on 4 May ; the soldiers quickly advanced on the city , supported by artillery fire from the Italian fleet . The Turks surrendered the city the following day . Toward the end of May , the 3rd Division returned to Italy . In July , Emanuele Filiberto and the rest of the Division had withdrawn to Italy to replace worn @-@ out gun barrels , along with other repairs . By October , the Ottomans had agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Italy declared neutrality after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , but by July 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers with promises of territory acquisition in Italia irredenta . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , which had been Italy 's primary rival for decades , was the main opponent in the conflict . The Austro @-@ Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea . Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the Italian Naval Chief of Staff , believed that Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate very effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic . The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way . Instead , Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Meanwhile , Revel 's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro @-@ Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement . As a result , Emanuele Filiberto and the rest of the Italian battle fleet did not see significant action during the war . 
 Once Italy entered the war , Emanuele Filiberto was used as a harbor defense ship in Venice to protect the port from Austrian naval attacks . She was aided in this task by her sister and the old battleship Sardegna , along with two cruisers and several smaller craft . The ship remained in the Italian Navy 's inventory for only a short time after the end of the war in 1918 , and she was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = Cyclone Komen = 
 Cyclonic Storm Komen was an unusual tropical cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal . The second named storm of the 2015 season , Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar , Bangladesh , and India . It formed as a depression on July 26 over the Ganges delta and moved in a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal . Komen intensified into a 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July 30 . The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August 2 . 
 Across its path , Komen dropped torrential rainfall , primarily in northwestern Myanmar where the precipitation totaled at 840 mm ( 33 in ) in <unk> . The rains compounded upon ongoing flooding and contributed to the worst flooding in the country in a century . About 1 @.@ 7 million people were forced to evacuate as flood waters inundated houses to their rooftops . About 510 @,@ 000 houses in the country were damaged or destroyed , and many residents lost their source of income as 667 @,@ 221 acres ( 270 @,@ 000 ha ) of crop fields were damaged . The floods killed 132 people , of which at least 39 were directly related to Komen . The government requested assistance from the international community to cope with the disaster , considered the worst in the country since Cyclone Nargis in 2008 . Elsewhere , the storm 's flooding damaged 88 @,@ 900 houses in Bangladesh and covered crop fields for a week ; Komen killed 45 people in the country , some of whom due to illnesses spread by the storm . Later , floodwaters affected southeastern India , killing 103 people and damaging or destroying 476 @,@ 046 houses . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The monsoon spawned a low pressure area on July 25 over the extreme northern Bay of Bengal and along the southern coast of Bangladesh . With low wind shear and abundant convection south of a developing circulation , the system quickly organized . At 03 : 00 UTC on July 26 , the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) classified the system as a depression , while the circulation was nearly stationary near the southern coast of Bangladesh . Land interaction and an unfavorable phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation prevented further strengthening , despite warm water temperatures of 31 ° C ( 88 ° F ) . Early on July 27 , the American @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring the depression after the convection organized further , amplified by good outflow . Still embedded within the monsoon , the depression remained nearly nearly stationary for two days over southern Bangladesh . The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on July 28 , due to the increasingly defined circulation . 
 On July 28 , the system began moving more to the south and southeast , although its movement was very slow , possibly affected by another monsoon depression over western India . The IMD described the track as " unique " , taking a " semi @-@ circular path over the northeast [ Bay of Bengal ] . " At 00 : 00 UTC on the next day , the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression , and three hours later the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02B , located 135 km ( 85 mi ) southwest of Chittagong , Bangladesh . A tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast imparted dry air , but otherwise , conditions were generally favorable . A ridge over Myanmar turned the system to the north on July 29 . During that day , the circulation was somewhat elongated and exposed from the convection , while the thunderstorms in the southern periphery organized into spiral rainbands . At 18 : 00 UTC on July 29 , the IMD upgraded the system to Cyclonic Storm Komen , one of only four storms of such intensity in July since 1965 ; typically , low pressure areas that form in the month are in the extreme northern periphery of the Bay of Bengal , allowing little time to develop over waters , and usually impeded by wind shear . 
 Late on July 29 , the JTWC estimated that Komen attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) , based on estimates from satellite imagery . As the storm approached Bangladesh , the circulation remained very broad with most of the convection in the southern periphery , although radar imagery from the coast indicated there was a formative eye feature in the storm 's center . At 06 : 00 UTC on July 30 , the IMD estimated peak 3 minute winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . Between 14 : 00 – 15 : 00 UTC that day , Komen made landfall on Bangladesh just west of Chittagong , and the JTWC discontinued advisories once the storm was ashore . Komen quickly weakened as it turned to the northwest through Bangladesh , steered by a ridge over Tibet to the north . On July 31 , the system crossed into the Indian state of West Bengal as a weakened depression . The track shifted to the west @-@ southwest until Komen weakened into a remnant low on August 2 over Jharkhand . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 During the duration of Komen 's existence , the IMD issued warnings on the storm that were relayed to the governments of the countries affected . In southeastern India , government officials issued various warnings for fishermen and for the potential of disruptive rainfall . The widespread flooding forced 1 @.@ 2 million people to evacuate their homes , with 1 @,@ 537 shelters opened to house 214 @,@ 306 of the evacuees . West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee canceled an overseas trip to London to coordinate relief activities related to the storm . 
 The Bangladeshi government evacuated 331 @,@ 120 people to 766 storm shelters , mostly in low @-@ lying areas of Cox 's Bazar District . 
 = = Impact = = 
 For several days , Komen dropped heavy rainfall across the northern Bay of Bengal and onto the adjacent coastlines of northwestern Myanmar , Bangladesh , and eastern India . The southeast quadrant produced the heavy rainfall , resulting in a peak rainfall of 840 mm ( 33 in ) in <unk> , Myanmar ; the country experienced record rainfall totals during July and August 2015 in some locations . In extreme northwestern Myanmar , <unk> recorded winds of 124 km / h ( 77 mph ) , possibly during a passing squall . Nearby Sittwe recorded winds of 107 km / h ( 67 mph ) . In southeastern Bangladesh , a station at Teknaf Upazila briefly recorded winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) on July 30 . Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh recorded over 800 mm ( 31 in ) of rainfall over three days , and over 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) in Cox 's Bazar over ten days . In India , rainfall peaked at 520 mm ( 20 in ) in <unk> , West Bengal , after the storm moved inland and tracked westward . 
 Moving ashore Bangladesh , Komen was accompanied by a storm surge of 1 to 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 to 6 @.@ 6 ft ) that affected Chittagong , while flooding rains caused landslides . Rough seas killed two people off Cox 's Bazar when a boat capsized . Rain @-@ induced landslides killed five people in Cox 's Bazar , and two others died in the town due to flooding . The storm damaged 88 @,@ 900 houses across Bangladesh , including hundreds of fishermen huts . Trees knocked onto houses killed at least three people in separate instances . Flooding submerged at least 145 @,@ 000 ha ( 360 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops for at least a week after Komen struck the country . Komen killed 45 people in Bangladesh – 21 in Cox 's Bazar and 7 in <unk> District – some of whom due to illnesses spread by the storm . About 220 @,@ 000 residencies required some form of assistance after the storm , primarily to cover lack of food . 
 Komen 's rainfall in India compounded upon previous floods ; heavy rainfall from the storm occurred while rivers and dams were overflowing . Rainfall produced a landslide in Manipur state in extreme eastern India , killing 20 people . As the storm moved into West Bengal , it killed 10 @,@ 088 livestock while affecting millions of residents . Komen damaged 368 @,@ 238 houses and destroyed another 107 @,@ 808 . Across the state , the storm killed 83 people , some related to lightning and snakebites . Flooding covered a portion of National Highway 60 in neighboring Odisha state . The Indian government utilized 121 rescue boats to assist stranded residents . 
 = = = Myanmar = = = 
 Across northwestern Myanmar , Komen brought additional rainfall after weeks of monsoonal flooding . Torrential rainfall , reaching 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) per hour , caused flooding and landslides . In Chin State northeast of <unk> , Komen resulted in three landslides , including one along a mountain slope that moved 395 million tons of ground at a speed of up to 180 km / h ( 112 mph ) ; the landslide was 5 @.@ 9 km ( 3 @.@ 6 mi ) in length , one of the largest worldwide in a decade that was unrelated to an earthquake , and a much faster moving landslide than normal . The flooding after Komen 's passage were considered the worst disaster in Myanmar since Cyclone Nargis in 2008 , and according to the government , possibly the worst flooding in a century . About 1 @.@ 7 million people had to temporarily evacuate . 
 Water levels reached the top of buildings , which displaced residents and restricted travel to just by boat and helicopter . Floods from Komen caused further damage to houses and roads . The floods covered crop fields with mud and silt , particularly in valleys . By the end of July 2015 , over 1 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 acres ( 570 @,@ 000 ha ) of farmlands were inundated , of which 667 @,@ 221 acres ( 270 @,@ 000 ha ) of planted crops were damaged , mainly to the rice paddy . About 236 @,@ 000 chickens were killed , and there were lower losses to other livestock . In Sittwe , flooding and winds damaged six shelters and camps , where about 100 @,@ 000 people were residing during the storm . The shelters sustained damage to latrines and learning centers , necessitating the use of tarps to ride out the floods . The town of Kalay was isolated by floods and only reachable by air travel . 
 Flooding from Komen was worst in Rakhine State , where water distribution was contaminated , and entire towns were largely destroyed . Waters started to recede by August 4 , allowing residents to return home ; by September 2015 , most of the displaced residents nationwide had returned home . High winds in <unk> within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers . Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone . The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490 @,@ 000 houses and destroyed another 21 @,@ 000 , causing 132 deaths , at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State . Komen was directly responsible for at least 39 deaths in the country . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On July 31 , President of Myanmar Thein Sein declared disaster areas for Chin and Rakhine states and for Sagaing and <unk> regions . On August 4 , the government issued an appeal to the international community for assistance . In response , the government of Australia provided A $ 3 million , and the United States Agency for International Development sent US $ 600 @,@ 000 . Neighboring Bangladesh donated $ 800 @,@ 000 worth of medicine , water kits , and other supplies . Assistance from other countries included $ 775 @,@ 000 from the United Kingdom , $ 142 @,@ 202 from nearby Thailand , $ 100 @,@ 000 from the Singapore Red Cross , and $ 300 @,@ 000 from China . 
 After Myanmar 's government failed to respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008 , officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen . Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages , assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine . The government allocated US $ 1 @.@ 2 million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops . About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015 , and in most areas , the grounds remained fertile for future growing . Local businesses donated <unk> billion toward buying supplies , and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US $ 3 @.@ 6 million . The Myanmar Red Cross , which was already responding to the ongoing flooding , provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations . The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets . Volunteers distributed sleeping mats , mosquito nets , medical supplies , and tarps . Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen . Within a month of the storm , the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450 @,@ 000 people . Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods , and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015 . The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest . To help unemployed farm workers , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access . An assessment by the United Nations , the World Bank , and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster , due to the stresses of the damaged houses , and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months . 
 = SmarTrip = 
 SmarTrip is a contact @-@ less stored @-@ value smart card payment system managed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority ( WMATA ) . The Maryland Transit Administration ( MTA ) uses a compatible payment system called CharmCard . A reciprocity agreement between the MTA and WMATA allows either card to be used for travel on any of the participating transit systems in the Baltimore @-@ Washington metropolitan area . Unlike traditional paper farecards or bus passes , SmarTrip / CharmCard is designed to be permanent and reloadable . For the rest of this article , " SmarTrip " will refer to both unless there is a specific difference between the two . 
 WMATA began using SmarTrip for payment on Metrorail in 1999 followed shortly by Metrobus and Metro parking lots . It was later extended to other public transit systems throughout the region . SmarTrip users receive discounts on Metrorail fares . Although WMATA initially drew criticism due to the limited number of SmarTrip sales locations , distribution has expanded to local convenience stores and supermarkets . By late 2012 all Metrorail stations were equipped with SmarTrip vending machines . 
 In October 2010 , WMATA announced that it was working on a replacement system because the company that makes SmarTrip cards has since gone out of business . However , the transit agency found an alternate manufacturer to produce additional cards until a new payment system is introduced . After March 6 , 2016 , SmarTrip cards are the only Metrorail payment method , and paper farecards will no longer be accepted . 
 = = Overview = = 
 SmarTrip cards are 3 ⅜ by 2 ⅛ inches ( 85 @.@ 7 mm × 54 @.@ 0 mm ) , roughly the same size as a credit card or driver 's license . The card is brought into close proximity with a circular target on the top or side of each faregate rather than inserted into a slot . Because the card has a radio @-@ frequency identification ( RFID ) chip inside , it only has to be in close proximity to the target and is usually not necessary to actually touch it with the card , although it can be touched to the target if desired , or the card can be scanned while still inside a wallet or purse passed over the target , affording some speed and convenience over the paper farecard which must be physically inserted into a slot . In the Metrorail system , touching the card to the target will display the value remaining as the faregate opens , both when entering and exiting . On Metrobuses , the farebox will audibly beep and display the remaining value . In all cases , the appropriate fare is deducted automatically , accounting for any applicable transfers and discounts . 
 In an effort to reduce fraud and waste , Metro announced in October 2008 that it would be eliminating paper bus transfers effective January 4 , 2009 . All riders who wished to take advantage of reduced @-@ fare transfers were required to pay using SmarTrip . Paper bus passes were eliminated in January 2011 and passes are now only available on SmarTrip . 
 For SmarTrip , pass rules are different from CharmCard . All Metrorail passes are now available on SmarTrip . These include One @-@ Day , 7 @-@ Day , and 28 @-@ Day fast passes valid for unlimited travel on Metrorail . A 7 @-@ Day Short Trip Pass is also sold , allowing unlimited off @-@ peak rides , and unlimited peak rides for trips costing up to $ 3 @.@ 50 , with the difference in fare deducted from the stored value on the card if necessary . CharmCard allows a maximum of two of each pass to be stored , so two day passes and two monthly passes , plus cash , can be stored on the card . 
 Metro also sells SmarTrip cards that are preloaded with a One @-@ Day rail pass online for the same price as just the pass alone ( $ 14 since July 1 , 2012 ) , including all of the commemorative SmarTrip cards issued since 2009 . 
 Standard cards can be purchased at vending machines within all Metrorail stations , at Metro sales offices , selected retail stores , and online . The purchase price includes $ 2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value , which varies depending on where they are purchased : cards purchased at stations cost $ 10 ( $ 2 for the card and $ 8 fare value ) , while those purchased online cost either $ 10 or $ 30 ( $ 2 for the card and $ 8 or $ 28 fare value ) . The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses . Riders may also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards ( a used farecard up to $ 20 , or an unused farecard of any value ) . There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card . SmarTrip can store up to $ 300 in value , while CharmCard can store up to $ 200 . 
 SmarTrip and CharmCard have different qualifications for inter @-@ system usage , e.g. using CharmCard on non @-@ MTA providers , and using SmarTrip on MTA . Passes and non @-@ cash loads ( such as employee transit benefits ) are stored on the card in a separate " purse " from cash loads . Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit , so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or <unk> will only be valid on MTA , and a WMATA @-@ issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA even if it was loaded on a CharmCard . This does mean it is possible to have identical or different passes ( like a monthly pass from one and a day pass from the other ) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card . Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with , so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington , DC @-@ area transit providers , even if the benefits are loaded on a CharmCard . Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles . This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents , so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass . 
 Discounted ( half @-@ fare ) cards have different rules for SmarTrip and CharmCard . SmarTrip for seniors and the disabled may only be purchased in person from a metro agent or authorized sales office , and the person must show ID and for a disabled rider , proof of disability ( either WMATA Disabled ID or Medicare card . ) CharmCard for seniors and disabled are only available from the MTA reduced fare office at 6 St. Paul Street in downtown Baltimore , with similar requirements ( proof of age or disability ) . Also , while WMATA charges a $ 2 fee plus the amount to load in value for senior / disabled <unk> card , MTA merely requires at least $ 2 or more in value to be initially loaded onto a senior / disabled CharmCard , MTA waives any fee for the card . 
 “ Exit fare ” machines ( used with paper farecards ) previously did not accept SmarTrip , and riders with insufficient value to pay their fare were allowed to exit the system with a negative balance . This negative balance must , however , be paid before the card may be used again to enter the system . In addition , the card must contain sufficient value to pay the full fee in order to exit a Metro parking lot or board a Ride On bus . Because SmarTrip owners were allowed to exit the system with an unlimited negative balance , the Metro Board had previously rejected proposals to reduce the price of SmarTrip cards from $ 5 down to $ 2 @.@ 50 . Starting September 1 , 2012 , Metro began offering $ 3 rebates to customers who registered their cards online after purchase . The cards still cost $ 5 , but a $ 3 credit was refunded to the card five days after first use . Also starting Sep 1 , riders have been required to have a minimum balance of $ 1 @.@ 20 on their SmarTrip cards ( 35 ¢ for half @-@ fare senior / disabled cards ) in order to enter the Metrorail system , which reduced the possible negative balance upon exit . Effective October 1 , 2013 , the price of the card was reduced to $ 2 , the rebate program was discontinued , and the maximum permitted negative balance upon exit was set at $ 1 @.@ 50 , with riders who would exceed this being required to use the <unk> machines to add value to their cards . 
 SmarTrip cards comply with the ISO / IEC <unk> Type B standard . A microchip contained within the card stores its value , as well as the rider ’ s most recent entry and exit points , and a unique identifier . However , the unique identifier is not linked to a person ’ s name or identity , unless one registers the card online . Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance ( minus a $ 5 replacement fee ) , should the card be lost , stolen , or damaged . The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the <unk> program , which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax @-@ free , to credit their monthly benefits to their cards . 
 The SmarTrip system was built and designed by Cubic Transportation Systems , Inc . , a subsidiary of San Diego @-@ based Cubic Corporation . As of October 2010 Cubic is reportedly no longer producing the cards . In December 2010 , WMATA issued a request for proposals for a replacement system . The new payment system is expected to use federal employee badges and certain smart phones in addition to the stored value cards . In January 2014 WMATA announced that the contract for the new system was awarded to Accenture . 
 In May 2012 , the transit agency announced that it had found a replacement manufacturer for SmarTrip cards to avoid shortages until a new payment system goes into place . Customers will likely not notice any differences except that the new cards are slightly thinner and cheaper to produce . 
 = = History = = 
 SmarTrip was the first contact @-@ less smart card for transit in the United States when WMATA began selling SmarTrip cards on May 18 , 1999 . By 2004 , 650 @,@ 000 SmarTrip cards were in circulation . On November 12 , 2002 , the first SmarTrip readers were used on Metrobuses . In May 2004 , SmarTrip readers were introduced at parking garage gates . In December 2010 , 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 SmarTrip cards were in use . In February 2011 , WMATA replaced the antennas on all Metrorail faregates to improve the speed and range of its faregates ' SmarTrip processing . 
 In May 2011 , WMATA and the District of Columbia Department of Transportation started a pilot project to give students in the DC Public Schools " DC One Cards " which are SmarTrip compatible . The new cards serve as both a student identification card and provide reduced Metro fares during student commuting hours . The cards are intended to address youth behavior problems in Metrorail stations . 
 = = Design = = 
 On the front of the standard SmarTrip card is a stylized picture of a Metrorail car and Metrobus in front of representations of the Washington Monument , United States Capitol , and stylized versions of classical architecture found in Washington , D.C. The Metro logo appears in the bottom left . A " Senior " SmarTrip is also available that automatically calculates applicable discounted fares for senior citizens ( age 65 + ) . The design is identical to the standard SmarTrip except that the card is printed in shades of bright yellow and brown , instead of blue and green . Since the Senior SmarTrip allows for discounted fares , the card may only be purchased in person with a valid ID from a Metro sales office or authorized vendor . 
 The first two promotional SmarTrip cards were issued in 2008 to commemorate the opening of the newly built stadium of the Washington Nationals , Nationals Park . Special SmarTrip cards commemorating the inauguration of President Barack Obama were issued in January 2009 and 2013 . In July 2013 , a special July 4 commemorative SmarTrip card was introduced . 
 In June 2014 , Metro celebrated the 125th anniversary of the National Zoo by issuing commemorative SmarTrip cards featuring " popular zoo baby residents . " 
 In July 2014 , a commemorative SmarTrip card was issued to celebrate the opening of the Silver Line . 
 On March 27 , 2016 , Metro unveiled a new <unk> card design , to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Metrorail system opening . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 An early criticism of the SmarTrip cards had been that they were only sold at suburban Metrorail stations , online , a few selected retailers , and Metro sales offices . However , in 2008 , Metro reached an agreement with CVS / pharmacy to sell the cards at 187 DC @-@ area locations in an effort to increase SmarTrip use . The SmarTrip cards are also sold at area grocery store chains . In late 2012 WMATA installed SmarTrip vending machines at all Metrorail stations . 
 A number of SmarTrip features that were supposed to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip 's creator , Cubic Transportation Systems , were not fully implemented until 2012 . Initially , riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus . In November 2008 , after years of delays , WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009 , but that deadline was missed . WMATA did launch SmarTrip 's online reload feature in September 2011 . WMATA allowed customers to load a seven @-@ day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012 . 
 All trips made with a SmarTrip card , with the exception of bus transfers and passes , are charged as individual one @-@ way fares . WMATA offers discounted rail and bus passes to customers who make several trips in one day , or many trips , or many short trips , in a seven @-@ day period ; however , SmarTrip users can only use the 7 @-@ day unlimited pass , and must manually load each transit pass onto their SmarTrip cards . This is in contrast to the Oyster card system on the London Underground , for example , where fares are automatically capped to ensure that customers never pay more than the cost of a one @-@ day pass each day . 
 There have been complaints when customers ' cards cease to work as a result of placing the card in proximity to metal or physically damaging the card . In such cases Metro guarantees that the fund balance on the card will be transferred to a new card . However , customers have complained that WMATA has not been processing such balance transfers promptly . 
 = = = Parking = = = 
 In a controversial move , WMATA announced that as part of a new cashless parking payment system , SmarTrip would be the only way to pay for parking at Metro @-@ operated garages and lots effective June 28 , 2004 , after reports of widespread theft by Metro 's parking contractor , Penn Parking . 
 The decision prompted complaints that Metro was inconveniencing its many customers , including tourists and other infrequent users , who did not own a SmarTrip card . In April 2007 , WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay for parking at six Metro stations , avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations . The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line , Shady Grove on the Red Line , Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line , and Franconia @-@ Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line . One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target . WMATA has since announced that it will make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay @-@ on @-@ exit parking facilities .

 The following is a list of transit systems that accept the SmarTrip card for payment . The Maryland Transit Administration ’ s CharmCard uses a compatible payment system from the same manufacturer . A reciprocity agreement allows patrons to use either payment card to travel on any of the participating systems throughout the Baltimore @-@ Washington Metropolitan Area .

 = Whistle While Your Wife Works = 
 " Whistle While Your Wife Works " is the fifth episode of season five of Family Guy , the last episode produced for Season 4 . The show originally aired on November 12 , 2006 . The plot follows Peter losing his fingers after an accident while holding fireworks . Behind on his work and threatened with the possibility of dismissal , he asks Lois to catch up on his work for him , to which she agrees . However , he repeatedly attempts to seduce her , eventually succeeding , distracting her from the work . Meanwhile , Brian begins dating a woman named Jillian who , much to Stewie 's delight , lacks general knowledge and intelligence . 
 The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Greg Colton . It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references . According to Nielsen ratings , the episode was viewed in 9 @.@ 04 million homes in its original airing . The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore , Bobby Costanzo , Barclay DeVeau , Carrie Fisher , Anne @-@ Michelle Seiler and Audrey Wasilewski , along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The opening title sequence is different from many other episodes in that Peter trips during the theme song and injures a stage dancer ( consequently puncturing her lung ) . Also , Stewie comes towards the camera screen and suggests they cut from the opening sequence . 
 Quagmire returns home from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins ' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some fireworks into Quahog by hiding them in his anus . Peter tells him that fireworks aren 't illegal in Quahog , so he didn 't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally , but Quagmire doesn 't see any fun in doing that . Later on , the Griffins and Quagmire start to play with the fireworks . Peter attaches ten M @-@ 80s together and shows Quagmire , but they explode , detaching all the fingers from his right hand . With Joe 's help , Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand . The next day , Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland , Joe and Quagmire , and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes . Peter is behind on his work at the brewery , as he is unable to type due to his hand injury , and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up , so he asks Lois to help him . When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work , Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times . Later at the brewery , after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office , she gives in and they have sex in front of their co @-@ worker Opie , who runs away screaming . In the end , Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him . 
 Meanwhile , Stewie finds out that Brian has a new girlfriend . Brian later ( reluctantly ) allows Stewie to meet his new girlfriend , Jillian . Stewie discovers she is a dumb blonde , and mocks Brian . Jillian visits the house , where Peter and Chris take an instant liking to her while Lois and Stewie find her stupidity amusing . The next day , Brian goes out with Jillian , where he meets her equally unintelligent friends . Stewie tells Brian that the relationship will not succeed . Brian visits Jillian 's apartment to end the relationship ( with Stewie waiting in his car ) , but he is distracted by her naked body when she answers the door and he has sex with her instead . Stewie apparently anticipated this when he returns three hours later , turns on the stereo , plays his mix tape , and starts singing to the tune of Gary Numan 's " Cars " : " Brian had sex / With a really dumb girl / Now he 's taking his friend Stewie / To get some ice cream / In his car . " After Brian turns off the stereo , Stewie responds " Oh , you 're a poor sport . " . 
 = = Production = = 
 The character of Jillian was altered several times by the show producers before its original airing ; however , the final character personality was designed to be that of " a bulimic cheerleader . " The character of Jillian was also designed to be " not the brightest bauble on the tree , " but this too was repeatedly changed . The description of Jillian 's voice being that of a bulimic cheerleader somewhat relates to a future episode plot , where Stewie calls Jillian fat , to which she responds by leaving the room and throwing up . When Stewie exclaims " it 's like she 's fucking five , " this was not set to broadcast at its original air date , but rather added in at a later date for unknown reasons . When Stewie is entertaining the elderly citizens by singing a song entitled " there 's a hole in the bottom of the sea , " this is actually Seth MacFarlane 's father playing the guitar , as he used to sing it to Seth when he was a child . During the making of this episode , not much thought was put into the character of Jillian , despite the fact she was always meant to be recurring character ; although her regular appearances throughout season 5 were described as " a big thing for Family Guy . " 
 In addition to the regular cast , actress Drew Barrymore , voice actor Bobby Costanzo , voice actor Barclay DeVeau , actress Carrie Fisher , voice actress Anne @-@ Michelle Seiler and actress Audrey Wasilewski guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actor John G. Brennan , and writers Mike Henry , Mark Hentemann , Danny Smith , Alec Sulkin , and John Viener made minor appearances . Actor Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode as well . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Show creator Seth MacFarlane claims on the DVD commentary track that , unlike most Family Guy episodes , this episode has no cultural references or references to real @-@ world events except for Chris calling Meg " David Koresh " when they play with fireworks and the cutaway of Peter , Joe , Quagmire , and Cleveland spending last Saturday with the Lord of Darkness from Legend . There was also a discussion that the gang had about the show Wings while swimming in the beer tank . Quagmire admits that he is the most knowledgeable about the show because he is a pilot and the show focuses on two pilots . When Peter goes to look at his secret stash of pornography , the intro from Get Smart is referenced . Stewie asks Brian if Jillian has an alibi , and Brian says no . Stewie starts singing the song " <unk> " , understanding that Jillian does not have an alibi . Brian sets up a cutaway when he says that breaking up with Jillian will be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin . The ensuing gag shows the actors looking for mention of their play following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln .

 In a slight improvement over the previous week , the episode was viewed in 9 @.@ 04 million homes in its original airing , according to Nielsen ratings . The episode also acquired a 3 @.@ 2 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , slightly being edged out by The Simpsons , while still winning over American Dad ! . 
 IGN 's Dan Iverson gave a mixed review , commenting that " it is only passable " and that " it did not have that laugh out loud funny " concept . However , Iverson positively comments that the voice of Jillian by Drew Barrymore was perfect . Iverson added that it 's " pretty humorous in this episode was how they made fun of mediocre films . " In conclusion , Iverson gave the episode a final rating of 6 @.@ 9 / 10 . The press release for this episode commented that Jillian is a " very attractive but intellectually challenged , " giving no negative comments . The entire scene of Buzz Killington discussing bridges to Peter and his friends in a flashback is Barrymore 's favorite scene . 
 = Dorset = 
 Dorset / <unk> / ( or archaically , Dorsetshire ) is a county in South West England on the English Channel coast . The ceremonial county comprises the non @-@ metropolitan county , which is governed by Dorset County Council , and the unitary authority areas of Poole and Bournemouth . Covering an area of 2 @,@ 653 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 024 sq mi ) , Dorset borders Devon to the west , Somerset to the north @-@ west , Wiltshire to the north @-@ east , and Hampshire to the east . The county town is Dorchester which is in the south . After the reorganisation of local government in 1974 the county 's border was extended eastward to incorporate the Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation , while the rest of the county is largely rural with a low population density . 
 The county has a long history of human settlement stretching back to the Neolithic era . The Romans conquered Dorset 's indigenous Celtic tribe , and during the early Middle Ages , the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century . The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century , and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348 . Dorset has seen much civil unrest : during the English Civil War an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell 's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury ; the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis ; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement . During the World War II , Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy , and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points . The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics , and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing , Cornish pilot gig rowing , sea kayaking and powerboating . 
 Dorset has a varied landscape featuring broad elevated chalk downs , steep limestone ridges and low @-@ lying clay valleys . Over half the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . Three @-@ quarters of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and <unk> significance . It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove , the Isle of Portland , Chesil Beach and Durdle Door . Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy . There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London . Dorset has ports at Poole , Weymouth and Portland , and an international airport . The county has a variety of museums , theatres and festivals , and is host to one of Europe 's largest outdoor shows . It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy , who used the county as the principal setting of his novels , and William Barnes , whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 Dorset derives its name from the county town of Dorchester . The Romans established the settlement in the 1st century and named it Durnovaria which was a Latinised version of a Common Brittonic word possibly meaning " place with fist @-@ sized pebbles " . The Saxons named the town <unk> ( the suffix " ceaster " being the Old English name for a Roman town ) and <unk> came into use as the name for the inhabitants of the area from " Dorn " — a reduced form of <unk> — and the Old English word " <unk> " meaning people . It is first mentioned in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle in AD 845 and in the 10th century the county 's archaic name , " <unk> " ( Dorsetshire ) , was first recorded . 
 = = History = = 
 The first human visitors to Dorset were Mesolithic hunters , from around 8000 BC . The first permanent Neolithic settlers appeared around 3000 BC and were responsible for the creation of the Dorset <unk> , a 10 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 5 mi ) monument for ritual or ceremonial purposes . From 2800 BC onwards Bronze Age farmers cleared Dorset 's woodlands for agricultural use and Dorset 's high chalk hills provided a location for numerous round barrows . During the Iron Age , the British tribe known as the Durotriges established a series of hill forts across the county — most notably Maiden Castle which is one of the largest in Europe . 
 The Romans arrived in Dorset during their conquest of Britain in AD 43 . Maiden Castle was captured by a Roman legion under the command of Vespasian , and the Roman settlement of Durnovaria was established nearby . <unk> Dyke , a large defensive ditch built by the county 's post @-@ Roman inhabitants near the border with modern @-@ day Hampshire , delayed the advance of the Saxons into Dorset for almost 150 years . However , by the end of the 7th century Dorset had fallen under Saxon control and been incorporated into the Kingdom of Wessex . The Saxons established a diocese at Sherborne and Dorset was made a shire — an administrative district of Wessex and predecessor to the English county system — with borders that have changed little since . In 789 the first recorded Viking attack on the British Isles took place in Dorset on the Portland coast , and they continued to raid into the county for the next two centuries . 
 After the Norman Conquest in 1066 , feudal rule was established in Dorset and the bulk of the land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions . The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe , Wareham and Dorchester in the early part of the 12th century . Over the next 200 years Dorset 's population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required . The wool trade , the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth , Melcombe Regis , Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county . However , Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in 1348 which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony . The disease , more commonly known as the Black Death , created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country . 
 The dissolution of the monasteries ( 1536 – 1541 ) met little resistance in Dorset and many of the county 's abbeys , including Shaftesbury , Cerne and Milton , were sold to private owners . In 1642 , at the commencement of the English Civil War , the Royalists took control of the entire county apart from Poole and Lyme Regis . However , within three years their gains had been almost entirely reversed by the Parliamentarians . An uprising of Clubmen — vigilantes weary of the depredations of the war — took place in Dorset in 1645 . Some 2 @,@ 000 of these rebels offered battle to Lord Fairfax 's Parliamentary army at Hambledon Hill but they were easily routed . Sherborne Castle was taken by Fairfax that same year and in 1646 Corfe Castle , the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Dorset , was captured after an act of betrayal : both were subsequently slighted . The Duke of Monmouth 's unsuccessful attempt to overthrow James II began when he landed at Lyme Regis in 1685 . A series of trials known as the Bloody Assizes took place to punish the rebels . Over a five @-@ day period in Dorchester , Judge Jeffreys presided over 312 cases : 74 of the accused were executed , 175 were transported , and nine were publicly whipped . In 1686 , at <unk> Park , a meeting took place to plot the downfall of James II of England . This meeting was effectively the start of the Glorious Revolution . 
 During the 18th century , much smuggling took place along the Dorset coast ; its coves , caves and sandy beaches provided opportunities for gangs such as the <unk> to stealthily bring smuggled goods ashore . Poole became Dorset 's busiest port and established prosperous trade links with the fisheries of Newfoundland which supported cloth , rope and net manufacturing industries in the surrounding towns and villages . However , the industrial revolution largely bypassed Dorset which lacked coal resources and as a consequence the county remained predominantly agricultural . Farming has always been central to the economy of Dorset and the county became the birthplace of the modern trade union movement when , in 1834 , six farm labourers formed a union to protest against falling wages . The labourers , who are now known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs , were subsequently arrested for administering " unlawful oaths " and sentenced to transportation but they were pardoned following massive protests by the working classes . 
 The Dorsetshire Regiment were the first British unit to face a gas attack during the First World War ( 1914 – 1918 ) and they sustained particularly heavy losses at the Battle of the Somme . In total some 4 @,@ 500 Dorset servicemen died in the war and of the county 's towns and villages , only one , Langton Herring , known as a Thankful Village , had no residents killed . During the Second World War ( 1939 – 1945 ) Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy : beach landing exercises were carried out at Studland and Weymouth and the village of <unk> was requisitioned for army training . Tens @-@ of @-@ thousands of troops departed Weymouth , Portland and Poole harbours during D @-@ Day and gliders from RAF Tarrant Rushton dropped troops near Caen to begin Operation Tonga . Dorset experienced an increase in holiday @-@ makers after the war . First popularised as a tourist destination by George III 's frequent visits to Weymouth , the county 's coastline , seaside resorts and its sparsely populated rural areas attract millions of visitors each year . With farming declining across the country , tourism has edged ahead as the primary revenue @-@ earning sector . 
 = = Settlements = = 
 Dorset is largely rural with many small villages , few large towns and no cities . The only major urban area is the South East Dorset conurbation , which is situated at the south @-@ eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole . It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth , the historic port and borough of Poole , the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages . Bournemouth , the most populous town in the conurbation , was established in the Georgian era when sea bathing became popular . Poole , the second largest settlement ( once the largest town in the county ) , adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has some of the highest land values by area in the world . 
 The other two major settlements in the county are Dorchester , which has been the county town since at least 1305 , and Weymouth , a major seaside resort since the 18th century . Blandford Forum , Sherborne , Gillingham , Shaftesbury and <unk> Newton are historic market towns which serve the farms and villages of the Blackmore Vale in north Dorset . Beaminster and Bridport are situated in the west of the county ; <unk> and the historic Saxon market towns of Wareham and Wimborne Minster are located to the east . Lyme Regis and Swanage are small coastal towns popular with tourists . Under construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental new town of <unk> commissioned and co @-@ designed by Prince Charles . The suburb , which is expected to be fully completed by 2025 , was designed to integrate residential and retail buildings and counter the growth of dormitory towns and car @-@ oriented development . 
 = = Physical geography = = 
 Dorset covers an area of 2 @,@ 653 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 024 sq mi ) and contains considerable variety in its underlying geology , which is partly responsible for the diversity of landscape . A large percentage ( 66 % ) of the county comprises either chalk , clay or mixed sand and gravels . The remainder is less straightforward and includes Portland and Purbeck stone , other limestones , calcareous clays and shales . Portland and Purbeck stone are of national importance as a building material and for restoring some of Britain 's most famous landmarks . Almost every type of rock known from the Early Jurassic to the Eocene epochs can be found in the county . 
 Dorset has a number of limestone ridges which are mostly covered in either arable fields or calcareous grassland supporting sheep . These limestone areas include a wide band of Cretaceous chalk which crosses the county as a range of hills from north @-@ east to south @-@ west , incorporating Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs , and a narrow band running from south @-@ west to south @-@ east , incorporating the Purbeck Hills . Between the chalk hills are large , wide vales and wide flood plains . These vales are dotted with small villages , farms and coppices , and include the Blackmore Vale ( Stour valley ) and Frome valley . The Blackmore Vale is composed of older Jurassic deposits , largely clays interspersed with limestones , and has traditionally been a centre for dairy agriculture . South @-@ east Dorset , including the lower Frome valley and around Poole and Bournemouth , comprises younger Eocene deposits , mainly sands and clays of poor agricultural quality . The soils created from these deposits support a heathland habitat which sustains all six native British reptile species . Most of the Dorset heathland has Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) status with three areas designated as internationally important Ramsar sites . In the far west of the county and along the coast there are frequent changes in rock strata , which appear in a less obviously sequential way compared to the landscapes of the chalk and the heath . In the west this results in a hilly landscape of diverse character that resembles that of neighbouring county Devon . Marshwood Vale , a valley of Lower Lias clay at the western tip of the county , lies to the south of the two highest points in Dorset : <unk> Hill at 279 metres ( 915 ft ) and <unk> Pen at 277 metres ( 909 ft ) . 
 A former river valley flooded by rising sea levels 6 @,@ 000 years ago , Poole Harbour is one of the largest natural harbours in the world . The harbour is very shallow in places and contains a number of islands , notably Brownsea Island , the birthplace of the Scouting movement and one of the few remaining sanctuaries for indigenous red squirrels in England . The harbour , and the chalk and limestone hills of the Isle of Purbeck to the south , lie atop Western Europe 's largest onshore oil field . The field , operated by <unk> from Wytch Farm , has the world 's oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge which has been producing oil since the early 1960s . 
 Dorset 's diverse geography ensures it has an assortment of rivers , although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills , means most are typically lowland in nature . Much of the county drains into three rivers , the Frome , <unk> and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south @-@ easterly direction . The Frome and <unk> are chalk streams but the Stour , which rises in Wiltshire to the north , has its origins in clay soil . The River Avon , which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire , enters Dorset towards the end of its journey at Christchurch Harbour . The rivers Axe and Yeo , which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively , have their sources in the north @-@ west of the county . In the south @-@ west , a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline ; most notable of these are the Char , Brit , Bride and Wey . 
 Most of Dorset 's coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast , a World Heritage Site , which stretches for 155 kilometres ( 96 mi ) between Studland and Exmouth in Devon . This coast documents the entire Mesozoic era , from Triassic to Cretaceous and is noted for its geological landforms . The Dorset section has yielded important fossils , including Jurassic trees and the first complete <unk> , discovered near Lyme Regis in 1811 by Mary Anning . The county features some notable coastal landforms , including examples of a cove ( Lulworth Cove ) , a natural arch ( Durdle Door ) and chalk stacks ( Old Harry Rocks ) . <unk> out into the English Channel at roughly the midpoint of the Dorset coastline is the Isle of Portland , a limestone island that is connected to the mainland by Chesil Beach , a 27 @-@ kilometre ( 17 mi ) long shingle barrier beach protecting Britain 's largest tidal lagoon . 
 The county has one of the highest proportions of conservation areas in England — and two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty covering 53 % of the administrative county . It has two Heritage Coasts totalling 92 kilometres ( 57 mi ) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest covering 199 km2 ( 77 sq mi ) . The South West Coast Path , National Trail , begins at South Haven Point at the entrance to Poole Harbour . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Dorset 's climate of warm summers and mild winters is partly due to its position on Britain 's south coast . The third most southerly county in the UK , Dorset is less affected by the more intense Atlantic winds than Cornwall and Devon . Dorset , along with the entire south @-@ west , has higher winter temperatures , average 4 @.@ 5 to 8 @.@ 7 ° C ( 40 @.@ 1 to 47 @.@ 7 ° F ) , than the rest of the United Kingdom . However , Dorset maintains higher summer temperatures than Devon and Cornwall , with average highs of 19 @.@ 1 to 22 @.@ 2 ° C ( 66 @.@ 4 to 72 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Excluding hills such as the Dorset Downs , the average annual temperature of the county is 9 @.@ 8 to 12 ° C ( 49 @.@ 6 to 53 @.@ 6 ° F ) . 
 The south coast counties of Dorset , Hampshire , West Sussex , East Sussex and Kent enjoy more sunshine than anywhere else in the United Kingdom , receiving 1 @,@ 541 – 1 @,@ 885 hours a year . Average annual rainfall varies across the county — southern and eastern coastal areas receive 700 – 800 millimetres ( 28 – 31 inches ) per year ; the Dorset Downs receive between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 250 millimetres ( 39 and 49 inches ) per year ; less than Devon and Cornwall to the west but more than counties to the east .

 Dorset 's population has a high proportion of older people and a lower than average proportion of young people : According to 2013 mid @-@ year estimates , 23 @.@ 6 % are over 65 years of age , higher than the England and Wales average of 17 @.@ 4 % , and 18 @.@ 6 % are less than 17 years old , lower than the England and Wales average of 21 @.@ 3 % . The working age population ( females and males between 16 and 64 ) is lower than England and Wales average , 60 % compared to 64 % . Data collected between 2010 and 2012 shows that average life expectancy at birth in the county is 85 @.@ 3 years for females and 81 @.@ 2 years for males . This compares favourably with the averages for England and Wales of 82 @.@ 9 and 79 @.@ 1 years respectively . Around 95 @.@ 2 % of Dorset 's population are of white ethnicity , 60 @.@ 9 % of the population are Christian and 28 @.@ 5 % say they are not religious . 
 More than 33 % of the county ’ s population possess a level 4 qualification or above , such as a Higher National Diploma , Degree or a Higher Degree ; while nearly 6 @.@ 3 % have no qualifications at all .

 = = Politics = = 
 Local government in Dorset consists of a county council ( Dorset County Council ) and two unitary authorities ( Bournemouth Borough Council and Poole Borough Council ) . Dorset County Council was created by the Local Government Act 1888 to govern the newly created administrative county of Dorset which was based largely on the historic county borders . Dorset became a two @-@ tier non @-@ metropolitan county after a reorganisation of local government in 1974 and its border was extended eastwards to incorporate the former Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch . Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England , Bournemouth and Poole each became administratively independent single @-@ tier unitary authorities in 1997 , although they remain part of the county geographically and for ceremonial purposes . The county council is based in Dorchester and comprises six @-@ second @-@ tier districts : West Dorset , East Dorset , North Dorset , Purbeck , Christchurch , and Weymouth and Portland . The council is controlled by the Conservative Party : at the 2013 local elections 27 Conservative , 12 Liberal Democrat , 5 Labour and 1 UKIP county councillors were elected . Bournemouth is also Conservative @-@ controlled : the council comprises 46 Conservative , three Liberal Democrat , three Labour and two independent councillors . The Conservatives lost overall control of Poole at local elections in 2011 but subsequently formed a minority administration — the council comprises 21 Conservative councillors , 18 Liberal Democrat and three Poole People ( a political party of Poole residents ) . 
 For representation in Parliament Dorset is divided into eight Parliamentary constituencies — five county constituencies and three borough constituencies . At the 2010 general election , the Conservative Party was dominant , strengthening their lead in six seats , and regaining one other from Labour . The borough constituencies of Bournemouth East , Bournemouth West and Poole are traditionally Conservative safe seats and are all represented by Conservative members of parliament . The county constituencies of North Dorset and Christchurch are also represented by Conservative MPs . West Dorset is represented by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin who is the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office . The marginal seat of South Dorset is represented by Richard Drax , who gained the seat from Dorset 's only Labour representative , Jim Knight , in 2010 . Mid Dorset and North Poole is held by Liberal Democrat MP Annette Brooke who retained her seat in 2010 with a slim majority of 269 ( 0 @.@ 6 % of the vote ) over the Conservative candidate . For the European Parliament the county lies within the South West England constituency which elected three Conservative , two UK Independence Party and one Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) at the 2009 European Parliament election . 
 = = Economy and industry = = 
 In 2003 the gross value added ( GVA ) for the non @-@ metropolitan county was £ 4 @,@ 673 million , with an additional £ 4 @,@ 705 million for Poole and Bournemouth . Primary industry produced 2 @.@ 03 % of GVA , secondary industry produced 22 @.@ 44 % and 75 @.@ 53 % came from tertiary industry . The average GVA for the 16 regions of South West England was £ 4 @,@ 693 million . 
 The principal industry in Dorset was once agriculture . It has not , however , been the largest employer since the mid 19th century as mechanisation substantially reduced the number of workers required . Agriculture has become less profitable and the industry has declined further . Within the administrative county between 1995 and 2003 , GVA for primary industry ( largely agriculture , fishing and quarrying ) declined from £ 229 million to £ 188 million — 7 @.@ 1 % to 4 @.@ 0 % . In 2007 , 2 @,@ 039 km2 ( 787 sq mi ) of the county was in agricultural use , up from 1 @,@ 986 km2 ( 767 sq mi ) in 1989 , although this was due to an increase in permanent grass , and land set aside . By contrast , in the same period , arable land decreased from 9 @,@ 925 to 9 @,@ 157 km2 ( 3 @,@ 832 to 3 @,@ 536 sq mi ) . Excluding fowl , sheep are the most common animal stock in the county ; between 1989 and 2006 their numbers fell from 252 @,@ 189 to 193 @,@ 500 . Cattle and pig farming has declined similarly ; during the same period the number of cattle fell from 240 @,@ 413 to 170 @,@ 700 , and pigs from 169 @,@ 636 to 72 @,@ 700 . 
 In 2009 there were 2 @,@ 340 armed forces personnel stationed in Dorset including the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington , Royal Signals at Blandford and the Royal Marines at Poole . The military presence has had a mixed effect on the local economy , bringing additional employment for civilians , but on occasion having a negative impact on the tourist trade , particularly when popular areas are closed for military manoeuvres . Plans to relocate the Royal School of Signals from Blandford to South Wales could result in a loss of up to £ 74 million GVA for the area . 
 Other major employers in the county include : BAE Systems , Sunseeker International , J.P. Morgan , Cobham plc and Bournemouth University . Dorset 's three ports , Poole , Weymouth and Portland , and the smaller harbours of Christchurch , Swanage , Lyme Regis , Wareham and West Bay generate a substantial amount of international trade and tourism . Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset 's ports . When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games , the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector . It is expected that this will continue to have a positive effect on local businesses and tourism . 
 Tourism has grown in Dorset since the late 18th century and is now the predominant industry . It is estimated that 37 @,@ 500 people work in Dorset 's tourism sector . Some 3 @.@ 2 million British and 326 @,@ 000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008 , staying a total of 15 @.@ 1 million nights . In addition there were 14 @.@ 6 million day visitors . The combined spending of both groups was £ 1 @,@ 458 million . Towns received 56 % of Dorset 's day trippers , 27 % went to the coast and 17 % to the countryside . A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county 's coast and countryside . Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn , a trend reflected throughout the UK . 
 Manufacturing industry in Dorset provided 10 @.@ 3 % of employment in 2008 . This was slightly above the average for Great Britain but below that of the South West region which was at 10 @.@ 7 % for that period . The sector is the county 's fourth largest employer , but a predicted decline suggests there will be 10 @,@ 200 fewer jobs in manufacturing by 2026 . 
 = = Culture = = 
 As a largely rural county , Dorset has fewer major cultural institutions than larger or more densely populated areas . Major venues for concerts and theatre include Poole 's Lighthouse arts centre , Bournemouth 's BIC , Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy , and the Pavilion theatre in Weymouth . One of Dorset 's most noted cultural institutions is the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra which was founded in 1893 . Based in Poole , the orchestra performs over 130 concerts across southern England each year . 
 Dorset has more than 30 general and specialist museums . The Dorset County Museum in Dorchester was founded in 1846 and contains an extensive collection of exhibits covering the county 's history and environment . The Tank Museum at Bovington contains more than 300 tanks and armoured vehicles from 30 nations . The museum is the largest in Dorset and its collection has been designated of national importance . Other museums which reflect the cultural heritage of the county include The Keep Military Museum in Dorchester , the Russell @-@ Cotes Museum in Bournemouth , the Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre , Poole Museum , Portland Museum and Wareham Town Museum . 
 Dorset contains 190 Conservation Areas , more than 1 @,@ 500 Scheduled Ancient Monuments , over 30 registered parks and gardens and 12 @,@ 850 listed buildings . Grade I listed buildings include : Portland Castle , a coastal fort commissioned by Henry VIII ; a castle with more than a 1 @,@ 000 years of history at Corfe ; a Roman ruin described by English Heritage as the " only Roman town house visible in Britain " ; <unk> , a Tudor manor house ; Forde Abbey , a stately home and former Cistercian monastery ; Christchurch Priory , the longest church in England ; and St <unk> 's church , one of the smallest . 
 Dorset hosts a number of annual festivals , fairs and events including the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford , one of the largest events of its kind in Europe , and the Bournemouth Air Festival , a free air show that attracted 1 @.@ 3 million visitors in 2009 . The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland . Launched in 2008 , the festival features sporting activities , cultural events and local entertainers . The Dorset County Show , which was first held in 1841 , is a celebration of Dorset 's agriculture . The two @-@ day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55 @,@ 000 people . In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne , Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival , <unk> It in Dorset , End of the Road and the Larmer Tree Festival . 
 Dorset 's only Football League club is A.F.C. Bournemouth , which plays in the Premier League — the highest division in the English football league system . Non @-@ League semi @-@ professional teams in the county include Southern Premier Division teams Dorchester Town F.C. , Poole Town F.C. , and Weymouth F.C .. Dorset County Cricket Club competes in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship and is based at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth . Poole Stadium hosts regular greyhound racing and is the home to top @-@ flight speedway team Poole Pirates . The county 's coastline , on the English Channel , is noted for its watersports ( particularly sailing , gig racing , windsurfing , power boating and kayaking ) which take advantage of the sheltered waters in the bays of Weymouth and Poole , and the harbours of Poole and Portland . Dorset hosted the sailing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics at the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy . The venue was completed in May 2009 and was used by international sailing teams in preparation for the Games . 
 Dorset is famed in literature for being the native county of author and poet Thomas Hardy , and many of the places he describes in his novels in the fictional Wessex are in Dorset , which he renamed South Wessex . The National Trust owns Thomas Hardy 's Cottage , in Higher <unk> , east of Dorchester ; and Max Gate , his former house in Dorchester . Several other writers have called Dorset home , including Douglas Adams , who wrote much of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy while he lived in <unk> ; John le Carré , author of espionage novels , was born in Poole ; Tom Sharpe of Wilt fame lived in Bridport ; John Fowles ( The French Lieutenant 's Woman ) lived in Lyme Regis before he died in late 2005 ; T.F. Powys lived in <unk> Herring for over 20 years and used it as inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel Mr. Weston 's Good Wine ; John Cowper Powys , his elder brother , also set a number of his works in Dorset , such as the novels Maiden Castle and Weymouth Sands . The 19th @-@ century poet William Barnes was born in <unk> and wrote many poems in his native Dorset dialect . Originating from the ancient Norse and Saxon languages , the dialect was prevalent across the Blackmore Vale but has fallen into disuse . 
 Dorset 's flag , which is known as the Dorset Cross or St <unk> 's Cross , was adopted in 2008 following a public competition organised by Dorset County Council . The winning design , which features a white cross with a red border on a golden background , attracted 54 % of the vote . All three colours are used in Dorset County Council 's coat of arms and the red and white was used in recognition of the English flag . The golden colour represents Dorset 's sandy beaches and the Dorset landmarks of Golden Cap and Gold Hill . It is also a reference to the Wessex Dragon , a symbol of the Saxon Kingdom which Dorset once belonged to , and the gold wreath featured on the badge of the Dorset Regiment .

 Dorset is connected to London by two main line railways . The West of England Main Line runs through the north of the county at Gillingham and Sherborne . Running west from London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids in Devon , it provides a service for those who live in the western districts of Dorset . The South Western Main Line runs through the south at Bournemouth , Poole , Dorchester and the terminus at Weymouth . Additionally , the Heart of Wessex Line runs north from Weymouth to Bristol and the Swanage Railway , a heritage steam and diesel railway , runs the 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) between Norden and Swanage . 
 Dorset is one of the few counties in England not to have a motorway . The A303 , A35 and A31 trunk roads run through the county . The A303 , which connects the West Country to London via the M3 , clips the north @-@ west of the county . The A35 crosses the county in a west @-@ east direction from Honiton in Devon , via Bridport , Dorchester , Poole , Bournemouth and Christchurch , to Southampton in Hampshire . The A31 connects to the A35 at Bere Regis , and passes east through Wimborne and Ferndown to Hampshire , where it later becomes the M27 . Other main roads in the county include the A338 , A354 , A37 and A350 . The A338 heads north from Bournemouth to Ringwood ( Hampshire ) and on to Salisbury ( Wiltshire ) and beyond . The A354 also connects to Salisbury after travelling north @-@ east from Weymouth in the south of the county . The A37 travels north @-@ west from Dorchester to Yeovil in Somerset . The A350 also leads north , from Poole through Blandford and Shaftesbury , to Warminster in Wiltshire . 
 Two passenger sea ports and an international airport are situated in the county . Brittany Ferries and Condor Ferries , operate out of Poole Harbour ; Brittany Ferries provide access to Cherbourg in France and Condor Ferries sail a seasonal service to the Channel Islands and St Malo , France . Condor Ferries also operate services from Weymouth harbour to Guernsey , Jersey and St. Malo throughout the year . Poole , since the dredging of the main channel in 2008 , and Portland harbours are capable of taking cruise liners . Bournemouth Airport , which is situated on the edge of Hurn village 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) north of Bournemouth , has flights to 36 destinations and serves some 600 @,@ 000 passengers a year . In August 2007 work began on a £ 32 million expansion programme which includes enlargement of the terminal building and an increase in parking . 
 Dorset is served by 14 commercial bus operators . The Wilts & Dorset bus company has a county wide network with frequent services linking major towns and a limited service in rural locations . The First Group operate buses in the Weymouth and Bridport area , including : a regular route along the A35 from Weymouth to Axminster , which helps to compensate for the missing rail link west of Dorchester ; and the Jurassic Coast service , one of the longest bus routes in the UK , which provides through travel from Poole to Exeter , exploiting a popular tourist route . Yellow Buses are the main providers of routes within the South East Dorset Conurbation . Damory Coaches is one of a number of operators that provide access to more rural communities . 
 = = Religious sites = = 
 Unlike all of its neighbouring counties , Dorset does not have a cathedral . Over 95 % of the county falls within the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury . A small section to the west comes under the Diocese of Bath and Wells and to the east Christchurch and much of Bournemouth — both historically part of Hampshire — belong to the Diocese of Winchester . The Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth incorporates most of Dorset with the exception of Christchurch and a portion of Bournemouth which belongs to the Diocese of Portsmouth . Few purpose @-@ built places of worship exist in Dorset for faiths other than Christianity . In 2008 a Hindu temple was constructed in Blandford Forum for the Gurkhas based at the town 's military camp . Bournemouth , which contains a higher proportion of Jewish residents than the national average , has two synagogues . 
 Christianity was introduced to Dorset by the Romans . A 4th century Roman mosaic discovered near Hinton St Mary contains what is generally accepted to be an image of Christ . Christianity became firmly established in the county during the Saxon period although there are few surviving Saxon churches ; the most complete is St. Martin 's in Wareham which has features from the early 11th century . Mediaeval churches are more prevalent in Dorset ; most are 15th century and are of a Perpendicular style . Sherborne Abbey , one of the county 's largest , is noted for its broad fan vaulting added during an extensive 15th century rebuild . Founded in AD 705 by Aldhelm , the Abbey contained the chair of the Bishop of Sherborne and was granted cathedral status until 1075 when the diocese was transferred to Old Sarum . Wimborne Minster features a chained library and a 14th @-@ century astronomical clock ; Christchurch Priory is renowned for its miraculous beam which , according to legend , was installed by Christ ; and the 15th century roof spanning the nave at St John the Baptist Church in Bere Regis is described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as the " finest timber roof of Dorset " . St Candida and Holy Cross at Whitchurch <unk> is the only church in the country , besides Westminster Abbey , to have a shrine that contains the relics of a saint . 
 Monastic foundations were once abundant in Dorset , but all ceased to exist at the Dissolution . The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until the turn of the 18th century . Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers ' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum , and St George 's Church on the Isle of Portland , which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren . From the late 18th century onwards , churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style . A notable exception to this trend , however , is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth — the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation . George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church . It was completed in 1789 . Bournemouth , founded in 1810 , has a wealth of 19th @-@ century churches including St Peter 's and St Stephen 's . St Dunstan 's Church ( formerly St Osmund 's ) in Poole is one of a small number of 20th @-@ century churches in Dorset . The final major work of Edward Schroeder Prior , it is one of the last examples of the Neo Byzantine style . The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its elaborate engraved glass windows designed by Laurence Whistler . Severely damaged by a stray German bomb in 1940 , the church subsequently underwent extensive renovation and Whistler had replaced every window by 1984 . 
 = = Education = = 
 Responsibility for state schools in Dorset is divided between three local education authorities : Dorset County Council , which covers the majority of the county , and Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities . Most of the Dorset County Council area operates a two @-@ tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school . Only Dorchester , Ferndown , Wimborne and Purbeck maintain a three @-@ tier system ( first , middle and high school ) , although Purbeck is expected to switch to a two @-@ tier system by 2013 because of an excess of unfilled places . Bournemouth operates a two @-@ tier system ; Poole operates a three @-@ tier system but will switch to two tiers from September 2013 . Poole and Bournemouth are two of a minority of local authorities in England to maintain selective education , each containing two single @-@ sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven plus examination . Some of the county 's schools are academies — self @-@ governing state schools which have become independent of their local education authority and are maintained directly by the Department for Education . In 2010 , 59 @.@ 4 % of pupils attending schools in the county council area gained at least five GCSEs at A * – C grades including English and maths , above the national average of 53 @.@ 4 % . Bournemouth and Poole also recorded above average results at 56 @.@ 5 % and 55 @.@ 3 % respectively . However , most non @-@ selective schools in the two unitary authorities fell below the national average . 
 Dorset contains a range of privately funded independent schools . Many are boarding schools which also take day pupils , such as the co @-@ educational Canford School which is built around a 19th @-@ century Grade I listed manor house ; St Mary 's , a Catholic girls ' school in Shaftesbury ; and Sherborne School , a boys school founded in the 16th century . 
 Four of the county 's five largest towns contain a further education college : Weymouth College , Kingston <unk> College in Dorchester and Bournemouth and Poole College which is one of the largest in the UK . Dorset has two higher education establishments situated in the heart of the county 's south east conurbation . Bournemouth University has facilities across Bournemouth and Poole and over 17 @,@ 000 students . Previously named Bournemouth Polytechnic , it was granted university status as a result of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 . The Arts University Bournemouth is situated between the border of Poole and Bournemouth . It became a higher education institute in 2001 and was given degree @-@ awarding powers in 2008 . It was granted full university status in 2012 . 
 = Doomsday ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " Doomsday " is the thirteenth and final episode in the second series of the revival of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who . It was first broadcast on 8 July 2006 and is the conclusion of a two @-@ part story ; the first part , " Army of Ghosts " , was broadcast on 1 July 2006 . The two @-@ part story features the Daleks , presumed extinct after the events of the 2005 series ' finale , and the Cybermen , who appeared in a parallel universe in " Rise of the Cybermen " and " The Age of Steel " . Both species unexpectedly arrive on Earth at the conclusion of " Army of Ghosts " . 
 The concept of the Daleks and the Cybermen both appearing on @-@ screen was first proposed in 1967 , but was vetoed by Terry Nation , the creator of the Daleks . The episode is the first conflict between the two species in Doctor Who 's 45 @-@ year history , and features Billie Piper 's last appearance in the lead companion role as Rose Tyler ; the final regular appearance of Noel Clarke as Rose 's ex @-@ boyfriend and previous companion Mickey Smith ; and the final regular appearances of Camille Coduri and Shaun Dingwall as Rose 's parents , Jackie and Pete Tyler . The episode was filmed in December 2005 and January 2006 , alongside the episodes " Rise of the Cybermen " and " The Age of Steel " . 
 The plot consists mostly of the Daleks and Cybermen waging a global war , with humanity caught in the crossfire . The Doctor , the Tyler family , and Mickey Smith fight for their lives trying to reverse the situation . They are successful , but at an emotional cost to the Doctor and Rose , as they are left in separate universes . 
 The episode is one of the most popular Doctor Who episodes since the show 's revival . It was nominated , along with " Army of Ghosts " , for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form ; the award was won by the fourth episode in the series , " The Girl in the Fireplace " . It shared the revived series ' highest Audience Appreciation rating of 89 with " The Parting of the Ways " , " Silence in the Library " , and " Forest of the Dead " until 28 June 2008 — " The Stolen Earth " gained an AI rating of 91 — and is favoured by most critics for both the Dalek @-@ Cyberman conflict and the farewell scene between the Doctor and Rose . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Continuing the events of " Army of Ghosts " , the episode opens with Dr. Singh , Mickey Smith , and Rose Tyler trapped in a sealed room within the Torchwood Institute . Four Daleks , accompanied by a device known as the " Genesis Ark " , have emerged from the Void ship . A black Dalek called Dalek Sec extracts information about Earth from Dr. Singh , killing him in the process . Dalek Sec discovers that a separate invasion is in progress , and sends Dalek Thay to investigate . The Cybermen who took control of Torchwood detect the Dalek technology and confront them , offering an alliance . The Daleks decline and kill two Cybermen , causing the Cyber Leader to declare war on the Daleks . 
 Ms. Hartman and Jackie are taken by the Cybermen for conversion , but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has valuable information about the Daleks . The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds , who have travelled from their universe in pursuit of the Cybermen . Ms. Hartman is converted , but Jackie escapes into a stairwell . Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood . The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler , who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided what to do with them . In the meantime , the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth , which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void . Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed . 
 Meanwhile , Rose deduces that she and Mickey were kept alive because their touch can activate the Genesis Ark . Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the Ark because it is stolen Time Lord technology . He demands that Rose open it , but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives . The Doctor realises that these Daleks are the enigmatic Cult of Skaro , and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber . As the Cybermen attack the Daleks , Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping . The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside . The Doctor and his companions flee into tower . Along the way , Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace . The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis Ark open and millions of Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War pour out and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below , though humanity is caught in the crossfire and many are killed while running for cover . 
 The Doctor explains that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material . If he opens the breach and reverses it , anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in . Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void , so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe . Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him . The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman , who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self . The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in . The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape . Rose 's lever slips , and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void . At the last second , Pete reappears and grabs her , and together they transport back to the parallel universe . The breach closes , leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe . The Doctor presses his ear against the wall , as a tearful Rose does the same in the other universe , as if trying to listen for each other . 
 Some time later , Rose has a dream where she hears the Doctor 's voice calling her . The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway called Bad Wolf Bay , where a holographic image of the Doctor appears . He tells Rose he is using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small breach between universes . Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him , but before the Doctor can reply , the breach seals and the Doctor 's image disappears . In the TARDIS , tears run down the Doctor 's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course . As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS , he looks up to see a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room . With the Doctor shocked and confused , the mysterious bride angrily demands to know where she is , leading to the events of " The Runaway Bride " .

 = = = Conception = = = 
 The concept of the Daleks and Cybermen appearing together on screen is not new ; in December 1967 , the BBC approached Terry Nation to have both races in a serial , but Nation vetoed this idea . The concept came to Davies while mapping out the 2006 series : the story would both serve to resurrect the popular Daleks and provide a suitable exit for Piper , who had decided to leave Doctor Who . " Doomsday " is the first episode in the history of Doctor Who where the Cybermen and the Daleks appear on @-@ screen together ; Cybermen and Daleks were both featured in The Five Doctors and " Army of Ghosts " , but in separate scenes . 
 The two @-@ part finale was originally going to take place in Cardiff on the time rift , which was the focus of the episodes " The Unquiet Dead " and " Boom Town " . When Torchwood was commissioned in 2005 , Davies decided to base the spin @-@ off in Cardiff and relocate " Army of Ghosts " and " Doomsday " to Canary Wharf in London . 
 An item of discussion between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose ; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her , while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey . The role was ultimately given to Pete , to emphasise that he had accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter . The Doctor 's intended reply to Rose was also discussed ; Davies , who left the reply unspecified , stated he didn 't know when asked by Collinson on the episode 's commentary track , and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose 's love . 
 Some elements of the story were inspired by Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy . Pullman was " flattered " by the references in the episode , and compared Davies ' actions to his own practice of referencing works . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 To ensure that Clarke and Dingwall were available for filming , the story was filmed in the season 's third production block with " Rise of the Cybermen " and " The Age of Steel " . Filming for the story started on 2 November 2005 on location in Kennington , London , but did not become the primary focus of the production crew until 29 November , when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber . The scene of the Tylers driving through Norway was filmed at Bridgend on 6 December . Scenes in the lever room , the main setting for the story , were filmed on 12 – 15 December 2005 and 3 – 5 January 2006 . <unk> work for Rose being sucked into the void took place on 13 January , and the skirmish between the military and Cybermen on the bridge was filmed on 15 January . 
 Other location shooting took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square , Cardiff Bay . 
 The penultimate scene of the episode , the Doctor 's farewell to Rose , was filmed on 16 January 2006 ; it was the last day of filming for Clarke and Dingwall . As with all scenes set at Bad Wolf Bay , these were in fact filmed at Southerndown beach in the Vale of Glamorgan . Piper 's last scene was Rose 's reunion with the Doctor in " The Satan Pit " on 31 March , but the shoot was rather emotional , to the point there were several tears on set . The last scene of " Doomsday " , Catherine Tate 's appearance in the TARDIS as Donna Noble ( credited as " The Bride " ) , was filmed on 31 March during the wrap party . To ensure the secrecy of Rose 's departure and Tate 's appearance , only Piper and Tennant were given scripts of the departure scene , and director Graeme Harper was not informed of the final scene until the last possible second . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 As well as using existing music , such as the themes for the Daleks , Cybermen , and Rose , Murray Gold specially composed a piece of music for Rose 's farewell entitled " Doomsday " , which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim . Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies and the rest of the production team had expected , Gold took a minimalist approach . When pitching the track to the production team , Gold described the track as representing Rose 's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor . He later said , " I wanted to get that kind of throbbing , sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock , because I thought that 's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry , really . " The piece uses the same vocal work from " Rose " , when Rose first enters the TARDIS , thus creating a bookend effect . It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner , and is one of the reasons , along with Pappenheim 's overall contribution and the " Song for Ten " from " The Christmas Invasion " , that the soundtrack of both series was released several months later .

 To protect as much information concerning the episode as possible , the final scene of " Army of Ghosts " was withheld . The BBC website 's Fear Forecasters , a panel who rate the episodes , were not allowed to see " Doomsday " before its airing , and access to copies was restricted ; the website thus does not have a Fear Forecast for the episode . Despite this , the Dalek Sec prop , which had been previously unused in the series , had invaded the stage at the 2006 BAFTA Television Awards while the production team were collecting an award . A similar moratorium would be placed on the following series ' finale , " Last of the Time Lords " . 
 The episode 's finalised average viewing figure was 8 @.@ 22 million viewers and was , excepting World Cup games , the second most @-@ watched television programme of the week , behind an episode of Coronation Street , and eighth most @-@ watched overall . The companion episode of Doctor Who Confidential gained just over one million viewers , making it the second most watched programme on a non @-@ terrestrial channel that week . The ratings for the episode were higher than the following World Cup match between Germany and Portugal , which had a million fewer viewers . 
 = = = Critical reception and later release = = = 
 " Doomsday " is one of the most popular episodes of the revived Doctor Who . It gained an audience Appreciation Index ( AI ) of 89 , which was the highest figure for nearly two years — it was later surpassed by " The Stolen Earth " , which had an AI of 91 — and is the first episode of Doctor Who to receive a perfect 10 rating on IGN , who congratulated Davies on making an action @-@ packed episode so emotional . Television Without Pity gave the episode an A + rating . The Stage commented that the Dalek @-@ Cybermen conflict was the " only thing worth watching " at the weekend , overshadowing even the World Cup Final , and that the parting scene was " beautifully written and movingly played , " with " not a dry eye in the universe " . Dek Hogan of Digital Spy felt that the episode was " beautifully balanced and with moments of high excitement and touching poignancy " and that the single oil tear shed by the Cyberman version of Hartman was a " nice touch " . He criticised Catherine Tate 's appearance as being unnecessary to end the episode and for " breaking the mood " . Stephen Brook of The Guardian thought that the episode was " a highpoint of the modern series , highly emotional , scary and genuinely exciting " , while Rose 's departure was " brilliantly handled " . He positively compared the episode 's plot of a war between " the greatest monsters in the programme history " against the film Alien vs. Predator . 
 After its initial airing , the episode was released on DVD , with " Fear Her " and " Army of Ghosts " , on 25 September 2006 . It was first aired on CBC Television on 19 February 2007 . The story ( " Army of Ghosts " and " Doomsday " ) was one of three from the second series of Doctor Who to be nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form ; the other stories nominated were " School Reunion " and " The Girl in the Fireplace " , the latter winning the award .

 = Figwit = 
 Figwit is a fan @-@ created name for an unnamed Elven escort in Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy , played by actor and musician Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords fame . The name Figwit derives from an acronym for " Frodo is <unk> ... who is THAT ? ! ? " [ sic ] . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bret McKenzie , half of the musical comedy duo Flight of the Conchords and a Wellington native , first landed a small role as an extra in The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring . He appears sitting next to Aragorn during the council in Rivendell scene . When it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed , Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mordor , and Elrond proclaims the formation of the Fellowship of the Ring . The elf was dubbed " Figwit " by Tolkien fan Iris Hadad ; after seeing Frodo agree to take the ring , saying " I will take it " , the film switches to a shot where Figwit can be seen standing on the far right , and Hadad 's initial reaction was " Frodo is <unk> ... who is THAT ? ! ? " Later , Hadad corresponded with her university friend Sherry de Andres , and the two created the first Figwit fan website , <unk> , calling him " Legolas for the thinking woman " . 
 McKenzie appeared as Figwit again in the third film , The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , where he was credited as " Elf Escort " . He appears in the scene where Arwen is leaving for the Grey Havens and has a vision of her future son , <unk> , this time with two lines warning her to not delay and then exclaiming as she turns around . Director Peter Jackson stated in the DVD commentary for The Return of the King that Figwit was called back and given dialogue in the third film " just for fun for the fans " because " so much fuss has been made about him over the last couple of years " . 
 In the film version of The Hobbit , McKenzie was cast as <unk> , an elf of Rivendell who appeared briefly in J.R.R. Tolkien 's novel , The Fellowship of the Ring . 
 = = Popularity = = 
 Though he only appeared for about three seconds in the first film , Figwit 's popularity soon blossomed , with Hadad stating that " [ the fan site ] got a lot of e @-@ mails from people who thought they were the only ones who had noticed that handsome , dark @-@ haired elf " . Figwit 's physical appearance and demeanor are the source of much of his popularity : he has been noted for his " lithe and graceful " movement , " enigmatic <unk> " , " haughty demeanor " , and " pouty " looks . His fan website proclaims him " in a word , gorgeous . Or another , stunning ... hypnotic ... stupendous ... captivating ... take your pick . " 
 McKenzie has stated that the Figwit obsession is " weird , " though he is " flattered . " He has remarked that " it 's so hilarious because it 's been propelled by so little ... I 'm famous for doing nothing . " 
 = = = In other media = = = 
 Figwit does not appear in Tolkien 's writings and was created exclusively for the films ; thus there is little authentic information regarding him , save that he was an escort . The only " official " place where the name Figwit is used is on several Topps trading cards , including a The Return of the King series card , titled " Return to Rivendell , " and an Authentic Autographs card featuring the signature of actor Bret McKenzie . In The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game he was assigned the name of <unk> , one of Galadriel 's brothers in The Silmarillion . A Figwit action figure was also created , though it was named " Elven Escort , " as in the film . 
 Figwit has been a subject of poetry , art , and fiction . He is also a subject in slash fan fiction , where he is named " <unk> " , a rough , literal Elvish translation of " fig " and " wit , " derived from <unk> , the Quenya word for fruit ( fig ) , and maen , the Noldorin word for clever or skilled . 
 = = = Documentary = = = 
 In 2004 , a 57 @-@ minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon was created by McKenzie 's fiancée ( and now wife ) Hannah Clarke and friends Stan Alley and Nick Booth . Entitled Frodo Is Great ... Who Is That ? ! ! , it premiered at the Auckland International Film Festival on July 23 . Meant to " [ unravel ] Bret 's identity " , it follows McKenzie to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe , where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and " elvish good looks " , and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as with Peter Jackson , Barrie Osborne , Mark Ordesky , Ian McKellen , and other cast members . Booth stated that their film was " much more irreverent and strange " compared to other behind @-@ the @-@ scenes documentaries of the film trilogy , which were " very much driven around the production and the cast and Tolkien " . 
 = Madagascar women 's national football team = 
 The Madagascar women 's national football team is the FIFA recognised senior women 's A team for Madagascar . The team played their first FIFA matches in 2015 . The development of a national team in the country is problematic because of issues found on the continent and on the island , specifically the lack of popularity of women 's football as a participation sport in Madagascar . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Early development of the women 's game at the time colonial powers brought football to the continent was limited as colonial powers in the region tended to take make concepts of patriarchy and women 's participation in sport with them to local cultures that had similar concepts already embedded in them . The lack of later development of the national team on a wider international level symptomatic of all African teams is a result of several factors , including limited access to education , poverty amongst women in the wider society , and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses . When quality female football players are developed , they tend to leave for greater opportunities abroad . Continent wide , funding is also an issue , with most development money coming from FIFA , not the national football association . Future , success for women 's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities . Attempting to commercialise the game and make it commercially viable is not the solution , as demonstrated by the current existence of many youth and women 's football camps held throughout the continent . 
 Fédération Malagasy de Football was founded in 1961 and became a FIFA affiliate in 1964 . Women 's football is required on the board by a wider mandate though the organisation does not employee any full @-@ time employees to look after women 's football . 
 Football ranks as the eighth most popular women 's sport in the country , trailing behind basketball , which is the most popular . The popularity of rugby union as a woman 's participation sport also challenges football . In the nation 's capital , there are ten women 's rugby union club teams . This siphons off potential players from football . A women 's football programme was organised in the country in 2000 . In 2006 , there were 1 @,@ 065 registered female football players , 340 adults players and 725 youth players . This was an increase from 2000 when there were 800 registered female players , and the 210 total registered players in 2002 . In 2006 , there were 91 women only football clubs in the country . Women 's football was gaining popularity during the late 2000s . By 2009 , the total number of women 's clubs was 22 senior teams and 38 youth teams . Futsal is played by women in the country , with 80 unregistered female futsal players playing in 2006 . Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women 's World Cup in the country were bought by the African Union of Broadcasting and Supersport International . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1985 , almost no country in the world had a women 's national football team , including Madagascar who did not play in a single FIFA sanctioned match between 1950 and June 2012 . In 2005 , Zambia was supposed to host a regional COSAFA women 's football tournament , with ten teams agreeing to send teams including South Africa , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Malawi , Seychelles , Mauritius , Madagascar , Zambia , Botswana , Namibia , Lesotho and Swaziland . Madagascar did not record a result from this competition . In 2006 , there was a FIFA recognised senior A team that had two training sessions a week though they had not played a single game between 2000 and 2006 . A FIFA recognised senior A team existed in 2009 . In 2010 , the country did not have a team competing in the African Women 's Championships during the preliminary rounds . The country did not have a team competing at the 2011 All Africa Games . In June 2012 , the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA .

 Henryk Adam Aleksander Pius Sienkiewicz ( Polish : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ͡ ʂ ] ; also known by the pseudonym " Litwos " [ <unk> ] ; 5 May 1846 – 15 November 1916 ) was a Polish journalist , novelist and the Nobel Prize laureate . He is best remembered for his historical novels , especially for his internationally known best @-@ seller Quo Vadis ( 1896 ) . 
 Born into an impoverished Polish noble family in Russian @-@ ruled Congress Poland , in the late 1860s he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces . In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States , sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers . In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity . He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries , and numerous translations gained him international renown , culminating in his receipt of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature for his " outstanding merits as an epic writer . " 
 Many of his novels remain in print . In Poland he is best known for his " Trilogy " of historical novels – With Fire and Sword , The Deluge , and Sir Michael – set in the 17th @-@ century Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth ; internationally he is best known for Quo Vadis , set in Nero 's Rome . The Trilogy and Quo Vadis have been filmed , the latter several times , with Hollywood 's 1951 version receiving the most international recognition .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Sienkiewicz was born on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska , now a village in the eastern Polish region of Podlasie , then part of the Russian Empire . His family were impoverished Polish nobles , on his father 's side deriving from Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz ( 1813 – 96 ) and Stefania , née <unk> ( 1820 – 73 ) . He had five siblings : an older brother , Kazimierz ( died during January Uprising ) , and four sisters , Aniela , Helena , Zofia and Maria . His family were entitled to use the Polish <unk> coat of arms . Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer 's maternal grandmother , <unk> <unk> . His family moved several times , and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in <unk> Górne , <unk> and <unk> . In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw , where the family would finally settle in 1861 , having bought a tenement house ( <unk> ) in eastern Warsaw 's Praga district . He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities , notably Polish language and history . 
 Due to the hard times , 19 @-@ year @-@ old Sienkiewicz took a job as tutor to the Weyher family in <unk> . It was probably in this period that he wrote his first novel , <unk> ( Sacrifice ) ; he is thought to have destroyed the manuscript of the never @-@ published novel . He also worked on his first novel to be published , Na <unk> ( In Vain ) . He completed extramural secondary @-@ school classes , and in 1866 he received his secondary @-@ school diploma . He first tried to study medicine , then law , at the Imperial University of Warsaw , but he soon transferred to the university 's Institute of Philology and History , where he acquired a thorough knowledge of literature and Old Polish Language . Little is known about this period of his life , other than that he moved out of his parents ' home , tutored part @-@ time , and lived in poverty . His situation improved somewhat in 1868 when he became tutor to the princely <unk> family . 
 In 1867 he wrote a rhymed piece , " <unk> <unk> " ( " <unk> of Youth " ) , which was rejected by Tygodnik <unk> ( The Illustrated Weekly ) . In 1869 he debuted as a journalist ; Przegląd <unk> ( 1866 @-@ 1904 ) ( The Weekly Review ) ran his review of a play on 18 April 1869 , and shortly afterward The Illustrated Weekly printed an essay of his about the late @-@ Renaissance Polish poet Mikołaj <unk> <unk> . He completed his university studies in 1871 , though he failed to receive a diploma because he did not pass the examination in Greek language . Sienkiewicz also wrote for Gazeta Polska ( The Polish Gazette ) and Niwa ( magazine ) , under the pen name " Litwos " . In 1873 he began writing a column , " Bez <unk> " ( " Without a title " ) , in The Polish Gazette ; in 1874 a column , " <unk> <unk> " ( " Current matters " ) for Niwa ; and in 1875 the column , " <unk> <unk> " ( " The present moment " ) . He also collaborated on a Polish translation , published in 1874 , of Victor Hugo 's last novel , Ninety @-@ Three . In June that year , he became co @-@ owner of Niwa ( in 1878 , he would sell his share in the magazine ) . 
 Meanwhile , in 1872 , he had debuted as a fiction writer with his short novel Na <unk> ( In Vain ) , published in the magazine <unk> ( magazine ) ( Garland ) . This was followed by <unk> z <unk> <unk> ( Humorous Sketches from <unk> 's Files , 1872 ) , Stary <unk> ( The Old Servant , 1875 ) , Hania ( Sienkiewicz ) ( 1876 ) and Selim Mirza ( 1877 ) . The last three are known as the " Little Trilogy " . These publications made him a prominent figure in Warsaw 's journalistic @-@ literary world , and a guest at popular dinner parties hosted by actress Helena <unk> . 
 = = = Travels abroad = = = 
 In 1874 Sienkiewicz was briefly engaged to Maria Keller , and traveled abroad to Brussels and Paris . Soon after he returned , his fiancée 's parents cancelled the engagement . In 1876 Sienkiewicz went to the United States with Helena <unk> ( soon to become famous in the U.S. as actress Helena Modjeska ) and her husband . He traveled via London to New York and then on to San Francisco , staying for some time in California . His travels were financed by Gazeta Polska ( The Polish Gazette ) in exchange for a series of travel essays : Sienkiewicz wrote Listy z <unk> ( Letters from a Journey ) and Listy <unk> z <unk> ( Litwos ' Letters from a Journey ) , which were published in The Polish Gazette in 1876 – 78 and republished as a book in 1880 . Other articles by him also appeared in Przegląd <unk> ( The Weekly Review ) and <unk> <unk> i <unk> ( The Learned and Literary Guide ) , discussing the situation of American Polonia . He briefly lived in the town of Anaheim , later in Anaheim Landing ( now Seal Beach , California ) . He hunted , visited Native American camps , traveled in the nearby mountains ( the Santa Ana , Sierra Madre , San Jacinto , and San Bernardino Mountains ) , and visited the Mojave Desert , Yosemite Valley , and the silver mines at Virginia City , Nevada . On 20 August 1877 he witnessed Modjeska 's U.S. theatrical debut at San Francisco 's California Theatre , which he reviewed for The Polish Gazette ; and on 8 September he published in the Daily Evening Post an article , translated into English for him by Modjeska , on " Poland and Russia " . 
 In America he also continued writing fiction , in 1877 publishing <unk> <unk> ( Charcoal Sketches ) in The Polish Gazette . He wrote a play , Na <unk> , soon retitled Na <unk> <unk> ( On a Single Card ) , later staged at Lviv ( 1879 ) and , to a better reception , at Warsaw ( 1881 ) . He also wrote a play for Modjeska , aimed at an American public , Z <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Partisan Struggles ) , but it was never performed or published , and the manuscript appears to be lost . 
 On 24 March 1878 Sienkiewicz left the U.S. for Europe . He first stayed in London , then for a year in Paris , delaying his return to Poland due to rumors of possible conscription into the Imperial Russian Army on the eve of a predicted new war with Turkey . 
 = = = Return to Poland = = = 
 In April 1879 Sienkiewicz returned to Polish soil . In Lviv ( Lwów ) he gave a lecture that was not well attended : " Z <unk> <unk> do <unk> " ( " From New York to California " ) . Subsequent lectures in <unk> and <unk> in July – August that year , and in Warsaw and Poznań the following year , were much more successful . In late summer 1879 he went to Venice and Rome , which he toured for the next few weeks , on 7 November 1879 returning to Warsaw . There he met Maria <unk> , whom he married on 18 August 1881 . The marriage was reportedly a happy one . The couple had two children , Henryk Józef ( 1882 – 1959 ) and Jadwiga Maria ( 1883 – 1969 ) . It was a short @-@ lived marriage , however , because on 18 August 1885 Maria died of tuberculosis . 
 In 1879 the first collected edition of Sienkiewicz 's works was published , in four volumes ; the series would continue to 1917 , ending with a total of 17 volumes . He also continued writing journalistic pieces , mainly in The Polish Gazette and Niwa . In 1881 he published a favorable review of the first collected edition of works by Bolesław Prus . 
 In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a historical novella , <unk> <unk> ( Tartar Captivity ) . In late 1881 he became editor @-@ in @-@ chief of a new Warsaw newspaper , Słowo ( The Word ) . This substantially improved his finances . The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in the running of the newspaper , in which he published a number of columns and short stories . Soon , however , he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work . He paid less and less attention to his post of editor @-@ in @-@ chief , resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper 's literary section until 1892 . 
 From 1883 he increasingly shifted his focus from short pieces to historical novels . He began work on the historical novel , Ogniem i <unk> ( With Fire and Sword ) . Initially titled <unk> <unk> ( The Wolf 's Lair ) , it appeared in serial installments in The Word from May 1883 to March 1884 . It also ran concurrently in the Kraków newspaper , Czas ( Time ) . 
 Sienkiewicz soon began writing the second volume of his Trilogy , <unk> ( The Deluge ) . It ran in The Word from December 1884 to September 1886 . Beginning in 1884 , Sienkiewicz accompanied his wife Maria to foreign sanatoriums . After her death , he kept on traveling Europe , leaving his children with his late wife 's parents , though he often returned to Poland , particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and Kraków beginning in the 1890s . After his return to Warsaw in 1887 , the third volume of his Trilogy appeared – Pan Wołodyjowski ( Sir Michael ) – running in The Word from May 1887 to May 1888 . The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer . 
 Sienkiewicz received 15 @,@ 000 rubles , in recognition of his achievements , from an unknown admirer who signed himself " Michał Wołodyjowski " after the Trilogy character . Sienkiewicz used the money to set up a fund , named for his wife and supervised by the Academy of Learning , to aid artists endangered by tuberculosis . 
 In 1886 he visited Istanbul ; in 1888 , Spain . At the end of 1890 he went to Africa , resulting in Listy z <unk> ( Letters from Africa , published in The Word in 1891 – 92 , then collected as a book in 1893 ) . The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels . In 1891 his novel Without dogma ( Bez <unk> ) , previously serialized in 1889 – 90 in The Word , was published in book form . In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel , <unk> <unk> ( Children of the Soil ) , which was serialized in The Polish Gazette from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894 . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Sienkiewicz would have several romances , and in 1892 Maria Romanowska @-@ Wołodkowicz , stepdaughter of a wealthy <unk> , entered his life . He and Romanowska became engaged there in 1893 and married in Kraków on 11 November . Just two weeks later , however , his bride left him ; Sienkiewicz blamed " in @-@ law intrigues " . On 13 December 1895 he obtained papal consent to dissolution of the marriage . In 1904 he married his niece , Maria <unk> . 
 Sienkiewicz used his growing international fame to influence world opinion in favor of the Polish cause ( throughout his life and since the late 18th century , Poland remained partitioned by her neighbors , Russia , Austria and Prussia , later Germany ) . He often criticized German policies of Germanization of the Polish minority in Germany ; in 1901 he expressed support of Września schoolchildren who were protesting the banning of the Polish language . More cautiously , he called on Russia 's government to introduce reforms in Russian @-@ controlled Congress Poland . During the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland , he advocated broader Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire . 
 Sienkiewicz maintained some ties with Polish right @-@ wing National Democracy politicians and was critical of the socialists , but he was generally a moderate and declined to become a politician and a deputy to the Russian Duma . In the cultural sphere , he was involved in the creation of the Kraków and Warsaw monuments to Adam Mickiewicz . He supported educational endeavors and co @-@ founded the Polska <unk> <unk> organization . " Reasonably wealthy " by 1908 thanks to sales of his books , he often used his new wealth to support struggling writers . He helped gather funds for social @-@ welfare projects such as starvation relief , and for construction of a tuberculosis sanatorium at Zakopane . He was as prominent in philanthropy as in literature . 
 In February 1895 he wrote the first chapters of Quo Vadis . The novel was serialized , beginning in March 1895 , in Warsaw 's Polish Gazette , Kraków 's Czas ( Time ) , and Poznań 's <unk> Poznański ( Poznań Daily ) . The novel was finished by March 1896 . The book edition appeared later the same year , and soon gained international renown . In February 1897 he began serializing a new novel , Krzyżacy ( The Teutonic Knights , or The Knights of the Cross ) ; serialization finished in 1900 , and the book edition appeared that year . 
 In 1900 , with a three @-@ year delay due to the approaching centenary of Mickiewicz 's birth , Sienkiewicz celebrated his own quarter @-@ century , begun in 1872 , as a writer . Special events were held in a number of Polish cities , including Kraków , Lwów and Poznań . A jubilee committee presented him with a gift from the Polish people : an estate at Oblęgorek , near Kielce , where he later opened a school for children . 
 In 1905 he won a Nobel Prize for his lifetime achievements as an epic writer . In his acceptance speech , he said this honor was of particular value to a son of Poland : " She was pronounced dead — yet here is proof that she lives on .... She was pronounced defeated — and here is proof that she is victorious . " 
 His social and political activities resulted in a diminished literary output . He wrote a new historical novel , Na <unk> <unk> ( On the Field of Glory ) , that was meant as the beginning of a new trilogy ; it was , however , criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy , and was never continued . Similarly , his contemporary novel <unk> Whirlpool ( novel ) , 1910 , which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz 's political opponents , received a mostly polemical and politicized response . His 1910 novel for young people , W <unk> i w <unk> ( In Desert and Wilderness ) , serialized in Kurier <unk> ( The Warsaw Courier ) , finishing in 1911 , was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults . 
 After the outbreak of World War I , Sienkiewicz was visited at Oblęgorek by a Polish Legions cavalry unit under Bolesław Wieniawa @-@ Długoszowski . Soon after , he left for Switzerland . Together with Ignacy Paderewski and <unk> Piltz , he established an organization for Polish war relief . He also supported the work of the Red Cross . Otherwise , he eschewed politics , through shortly before his death he endorsed the Act of 5th November 1916 , a declaration by Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria , pledging the creation of a Kingdom of Poland envisioned as a puppet state allied with , and controlled by , the Central Powers . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Sienkiewicz died on 15 November 1916 , at the Grand Hotel du Lac in Vevey , Switzerland , where he was buried on 22 November . The cause of death was ischemic heart disease . His funeral was attended by representatives of both the Central Powers and the Entente , and an address by Pope Benedict XV was read . 
 In 1924 , after Poland had regained her independence , Sienkiewicz 's remains were repatriated to Warsaw , Poland , and placed in the crypt of St. John 's Cathedral . During the coffin 's transit , solemn memorial ceremonies were held in a number of cities . Thousands accompanied the coffin to its Warsaw resting place , and Poland 's President Stanisław Wojciechowski delivered a eulogy . 
 = = Works = = 
 Sienkiewicz 's early works ( e.g. , the 1872 <unk> z <unk> <unk> ) show him a strong supporter of Polish Positivism , endorsing constructive , practical characters such as an engineer . Polish " Positivism " advocated economic and social modernization and deprecated armed irredentist struggle . Unlike most other Polish Positivist writers , Sienkiewicz was a conservative . His Little Trilogy ( Stary <unk> , 1875 ; Hania , 1876 ; Selim Mirza , 1877 ) shows his interest in Polish history and his literary maturity , including fine mastery of humor and drama . His early works focused on three themes : the oppression and poverty of the peasants ( " Charcoal Sketches " , 1877 ) ; criticism of the partitioning powers ( " Z <unk> <unk> " , " Janko <unk> " [ " Janko the Musician " ] , 1879 ) ; and his voyage to the United States ( " Za <unk> " , " For Bread " , 1880 ) . His most common motif was the plight of the powerless : impoverished peasants , schoolchildren , emigrants . 
 His " <unk> " ( " The Lighthouse Keeper " , 1881 ) has been described as one of the best Polish short stories . His 1882 stories " Bartek <unk> " ( " Bart the Conqueror " ) and " Sachem " draw parallels between the tragic fates of their heroes and that of the occupied Polish nation . 
 His novel With Fire and Sword ( 1883 – 84 ) was enthusiastically received by readers ( as were the next two volumes of The Trilogy ) , becoming an " instant classic " , though critical reception was lukewarm . The Trilogy is set in 17th @-@ century Poland . While critics generally praised its style , they noted that some historic facts are misrepresented or distorted . The Trilogy merged elements of the epic and the historical novel , infused with special features of Sienkiewicz 's style . The Trilogy 's patriotism worried the censors ; Warsaw 's Russian censor I. <unk> warned Sienkiewicz that he would not allow publication of any further works of his dealing with Polish history . 
 Sienkiewicz 's Without dogma ( Bez <unk> , 1889 – 90 ) was a notable artistic experiment , a self @-@ analytical novel written as a fictitious diary . His works of the period are critical of decadent and naturalistic philosophies . He had expressed his opinions on naturalism and writing , generally , early on in " O <unk> w <unk> " ( " Naturalism in the Novel " , 1881 ) . A dozen years later , in 1893 , he wrote that novels should strengthen and ennoble life , rather than undermining and debasing it . Later , in the early 1900s , he fell into mutual hostility with the Young Poland movement in Polish literature . 
 These views informed his novel Quo Vadis ( 1896 ) . This story of early Christianity in Rome , with protagonists struggling against the Emperor Nero 's regime , draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles ; and , due to its focus on Christianity , it became widely popular in the Christian West . The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of materialism and decadence , and also an allegory for the strength of the Polish spirit . 
 His Teutonic Knights returned to Poland 's history . Describing the Battle of Grunwald ( 1410 ) , a Polish @-@ Lithuanian victory over the Germans in the Polish @-@ Lithuanian @-@ Teutonic War , the book had a substantial contemporary political context in the ongoing Germanization efforts ( Kulturkampf ) in German Poland . The book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland , and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been ; it was also applauded by the Polish right @-@ wing , anti @-@ German National Democracy political movement , and became part of the Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918 . 
 It is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for Quo Vadis . While Quo Vadis is the novel that brought him international fame , the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel , instead citing " his outstanding merits as an epic writer " . 
 Sienkiewicz often carried out substantial historic research for his novels , but he was selective in the findings that made it into the novels . Thus , for example , he prioritized Polish military victories over defeats . 
 Sienkiewicz kept a diary , but it has been lost .

 About the turn of the 20th century , Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland , and one of the most popular in Germany , France , Russia , and the English @-@ speaking world . The Trilogy went through many translations ; With Fire and Sword saw at least 26 in his lifetime . Quo Vadis became extremely popular , in at least 40 different language translations , including English @-@ language editions totaling a million copies . The American translator Jeremiah Curtin has been credited with helping popularize his works abroad . However , as Russia ( of which Sienkiewicz was a citizen ) was not a signatory to the Berne Convention , he rarely received any royalties from the translations . 
 Already in his lifetime his works were adapted for theatrical , operatic and musical presentations and for the emerging film industry . Writers and poets devoted works to him , or used him or his works as inspiration . Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewicz 's novels , and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz @-@ themed albums and exhibitions . The names of his characters were given to a variety of products . The popularity of Quo Vadis in France , where it was the best @-@ selling book of 1900 , is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book . In the United States , Quo Vadis sold 800 @,@ 000 copies in eighteen months . To avoid intrusive journalists and fans , Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito . 
 He was inducted into many international organizations and societies , including the Polish Academy of Learning , the Russian Academy of Sciences , the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts , the Royal Czech Society of Sciences , and the Italian Academy of Arcadia . He received the French Légion d 'honneur ( 1904 ) ; honorary doctorates from the Jagiellonian University ( 1900 ) and Lwów University ( 1911 ) , and honorary citizenship of Lwów ( 1902 ) . In 1905 he received the most prestigious award in the world of literature , the Nobel Prize , after having been nominated in that year by Hans Hildebrand , member of the Swedish Academy . 
 Named for Sienkiewicz , in Poland , are numerous streets and squares ( the first street to bear his name was in Lwów , in 1907 ) . Named for him is Białystok 's <unk> <unk> ; city parks in Wrocław and Łódź ; and over 70 schools in Poland . He has statues in a number of Polish cities , including Warsaw 's Łazienki Park ( the first statue was erected at Zbaraż , now in Ukraine ) , and in Rome A <unk> Mound stands at <unk> , near his birthplace , Wola Okrzejska . He has been featured on a number of postage stamps . 
 There are three museums dedicated to him in Poland . The first , the Henryk Sienkiewicz Museum in Oblęgorek ( his residence ) , opened in 1958 . The second , founded in 1966 , is in his birthplace : the Henryk Sienkiewicz Museum in Wola Okrzejska . The third opened in 1978 at Poznań . 
 In Rome ( Italy ) , in the small church of " Domine Quo Vadis " , there is a bronze bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz . It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel Quo Vadis while sitting in this church . 
 Outside Poland , Sienkiewicz 's popularity declined beginning in the interbellum , except for Quo Vadis , which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations , including a notable American one in 1951 . In Poland his works are still widely read ; he is seen as a classic author , and his works are often required reading in schools . They have also been adapted for Polish films and television series . 
 The first critical analyses of his works were published in his lifetime . He has been the subject of a number of biographies . His works have received criticism , in his lifetime and since , as being <unk> : a view expressed notably by the 20th @-@ century Polish novelist and dramatist Witold <unk> , who described Sienkiewicz as a " first @-@ rate second @-@ rate writer " . Nonetheless , the Polish historian of literature Henryk <unk> , writing the Polski <unk> <unk> ( Polish Biographical Dictionary ) entry on Sienkiewicz ( 1997 ) , describes him as a master of Polish prose , as the foremost Polish writer of historical fiction , and as Poland 's internationally best @-@ known writer .

 The music of the video game Final Fantasy X was composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu , along with Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano . It was the first title in the main Final Fantasy series in which Uematsu was not the sole composer . The Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack was released on four Compact Discs in 2001 by DigiCube , and was re @-@ released in 2004 by Square Enix . Prior to the album 's North American release , a reduced version entitled Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack was released on a single disk by Tokyopop in 2002 . An EP entitled feel / Go dream : Yuna & Tidus containing additional singles not present in the game was released by DigiCube in 2001 . Piano Collections Final Fantasy X , a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Masashi Hamauzu and performed by Aki Kuroda , was released by DigiCube in 2002 and re @-@ released by Square EA in 2004 . A collection of vocal arrangements of pieces from the game arranged by Katsumi <unk> along with radio drama tracks was released as Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection in 2002 by DigiCube . 
 The theme song for the game is titled " Suteki da ne " , which was performed by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano , known as " RIKKI " . The song was released as a single by DigiCube in 2001 and was re @-@ released by Square Enix in 2004 . The game 's music was well received overall ; reviewers praised the additions to the soundtrack by the two new composers for the series . They especially praised Hamauzu , both for his work in the original soundtrack and in arranging the themes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy X. Several tracks , especially " Suteki da ne " and " To Zanarkand " , remain popular today , and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series , as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups . 
 = = Creation and influence = = 
 Final Fantasy X marks the first time Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a Final Fantasy game . His fellow composers for Final Fantasy X were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano . Uematsu contributed 51 tracks , Hamauzu contributed 20 tracks and Nakano contributed 18 tracks to the game . The two new composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different than Uematsu 's while still working together . Uematsu states that his music has been inspired by the music of popstar idols such as Elton John and Paul McCartney , and that his favorite part about the soundtrack is the good reviews from listeners . Nakano set out to create music with a " vibrant and dynamic feel " that tied together his years of experience with game music , while Hamauzu tried to use the soundtrack to bring video game music to " greater heights " . 
 " To Zanarkand " was originally written by Uematsu before the development of Final Fantasy X , for the recital of a flutist friend named Seo . Uematsu eventually decided the track was too gloomy and kept it for a later use . When development of Final Fantasy X started , he decided to use the track for the game .

 = Mathematics and art = 
 Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways . Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty . Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music , dance , painting , architecture , sculpture , and textiles . This article focuses , however , on mathematics in the visual arts . 
 Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship . Artists have used mathematics since the 5th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon , prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1 : √ 2 for the ideal male nude . Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture , without reliable evidence . In the Italian Renaissance , Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De Divina <unk> ( 1509 ) , illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci , on the use of the golden ratio in art . Another Italian painter , Piero della Francesca , developed Euclid 's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi , and in his paintings . The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times , the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry , with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter , while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van <unk> and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms . Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting , knitting , cross @-@ stitch , crochet , embroidery , weaving , Turkish and other carpet @-@ making , as well as kilim . In Islamic art , symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework , Mughal <unk> pierced stone screens , and widespread muqarnas vaulting . 
 Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as linear perspective , the analysis of symmetry , and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip . Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra , originally as models for teaching . Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher . Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set , and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata . Controversially , the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes ; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings . 
 Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by X @-@ ray fluorescence spectroscopy , and stimuli to mathematics research , especially Filippo Brunelleschi 's theory of perspective , which eventually led to Girard Desargues 's projective geometry . A persistent view , based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music , holds that everything was arranged by Number , that God is the geometer of the world , and that therefore the world 's geometry is sacred , as seen in artworks such as William Blake 's The Ancient of Days . 
 = = Origins : from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance = = 
 = = = Polykleitos 's Canon and symmetria = = = 
 Polykleitos the Elder ( <unk> – 420 BCE ) was a Greek sculptor from the school of Argos , and a contemporary of Phidias . His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes . According to the philosopher and mathematician Xenocrates , Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of Classical antiquity for his work on the <unk> and the statue of Hera in the <unk> of Argos . While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias , they are much admired . In the Canon of Polykleitos , a treatise he wrote designed to document the " perfect " anatomical proportions of the male nude , Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body . 
 Polykleitos uses the distal phalanx of the little finger as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body . Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the square root of two ( √ 2 ) to get the distance of the second phalanges and multiplies the length again by √ 2 to get the length of the third phalanges . Next , he takes the finger length and multiplies that by √ 2 to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the ulna . This geometric series of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm , chest , body , and so on . 
 The influence of the Canon of Polykleitos is immense in Classical Greek , Roman , and Renaissance sculpture , many sculptors following Polykleitos 's prescription . While none of Polykleitos 's original works survive , Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision . Some scholars argue that Pythagorean thought influenced the Canon of Polykleitos . The Canon applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry , such as the ratio , proportion , and symmetria ( Greek for " harmonious proportions " ) and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous geometric progressions . 
 = = = Perspective and proportion = = = 
 In classical times , rather than making distant figures smaller with linear perspective , painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance . In the Middle Ages , some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis . The Muslim mathematician Alhazen ( Ibn al @-@ Haytham ) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021 , but never applied it to art . The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas , among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts . Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics . First , painters needed to figure out how to depict three @-@ dimensional scenes on a two @-@ dimensional canvas . Second , philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe , including the arts , could be explained in geometric terms . 
 The rudiments of perspective arrived with Giotto ( 1266 / 7 – 1337 ) , who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines . In 1415 , the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi and his friend Leon Battista Alberti demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence , using similar triangles as formulated by Euclid , to find the apparent height of distant objects . Brunelleschi 's own perspective paintings are lost , but Masaccio 's painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work . 
 The Italian painter Paolo Uccello ( 1397 – 1475 ) was fascinated by perspective , as shown in his paintings of The Battle of San Romano ( c . 1435 – 1460 ) : broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines . 
 The painter Piero della Francesca ( <unk> – 1492 ) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking . He was an expert mathematician and geometer , writing books on solid geometry and perspective , including De Prospectiva Pingendi ( On Perspective for Painting ) , Trattato d <unk> ( Abacus Treatise ) , and De <unk> <unk> ( Regular Solids ) . The historian Vasari in his Lives of the Painters calls Piero the " greatest geometer of his time , or perhaps of any time . " Piero 's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the <unk> of Perugia , the San Agostino altarpiece and The <unk> of Christ . His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including Luca Pacioli in his De Divina <unk> and Leonardo da Vinci . Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of Archimedes . He was taught commercial arithmetic in " abacus schools " ; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks , perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ( Fibonacci ) ' s 1202 Liber Abaci . Linear perspective was just being introduced into the artistic world . Leon Battista Alberti explained : " light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye , forming a kind of pyramid with the eye as vertex . " A painting constructed with linear perspective is a cross @-@ section of that pyramid . 
 In De Prospectiva Pingendi , Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs . His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid : he defines the point as " the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend " . He uses deductive logic to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three @-@ dimensional body . 
 The artist David Hockney argued in his book Secret Knowledge : Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters that artists started using a camera lucida from the 1420s , resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism , and that this practice was continued by major artists including Ingres , Van Eyck , and Caravaggio . Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct . Similarly , the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially that Vermeer had used a different device , the camera obscura , to help him create his distinctively observed paintings . 
 In 1509 , Luca Pacioli ( c . 1447 – 1517 ) published De divina proportione on mathematical and artistic proportion , including in the human face . Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452 – 1519 ) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s . Leonardo 's drawings are probably the first illustrations of <unk> solids . These , such as the <unk> , were among the first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other . The work discusses perspective in the works of Piero della Francesca , <unk> da Forlì , and Marco <unk> . Da Vinci studied Pacioli 's Summa , from which he copied tables of proportions . In Mona Lisa and The Last Supper , Da Vinci 's work incorporated linear perspective with a vanishing point to provide apparent depth . The Last Supper is constructed in a tight ratio of 12 : 6 : 4 : 3 , as is Raphael 's The School of Athens , which includes Pythagoras with a tablet of ideal ratios , sacred to the Pythagoreans . In Vitruvian Man , Leonardo expressed the ideas of the Roman architect Vitruvius , innovatively showing the male figure twice , and centring him in both a circle and a square . 
 As early as the 15th century , curvilinear perspective found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions . Jan van Eyck 's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene , while Parmigianino 's Self @-@ portrait in a Convex Mirror , c . 1523 – 1524 , shows the artist 's largely undistorted face at the centre , with a strongly curved background and artist 's hand around the edge . 
 Three @-@ dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art , as in technical drawing , by means other than perspective . Oblique projections , including cavalier perspective ( used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century ) , were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century . The Chinese acquired the technique from India , which acquired it from Ancient Rome . Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art , such as in the Ukiyo @-@ e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga ( 1752 – 1815 ) . 
 = = = Golden ratio = = = 
 The golden ratio , roughly equal to 1 @.@ 618 , was known to Euclid . The golden ratio has persistently been claimed in modern times to have been used in art and architecture by the ancients in Egypt , Greece and elsewhere , without reliable evidence . The claim may derive from confusion with " golden mean " , which to the Ancient Greeks meant " avoidance of excess in either direction " , not a ratio . <unk> since the nineteenth century have argued on dubious mathematical grounds for the golden ratio in pyramid design . The 5th century BCE temple , the Parthenon in Athens , has been claimed to use the golden ratio in its façade and floor plan , but these claims too are disproved by measurement . The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia has similarly been claimed to use the golden ratio in its design , but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque . The historian of architecture Frederik <unk> Lund argued in 1919 that the Cathedral of Chartres ( 12th century ) , Notre @-@ Dame of Laon ( 1157 – 1205 ) and Notre Dame de Paris ( 1160 ) are designed according to the golden ratio , drawing regulator lines to make his case . Other scholars argue that until Pacioli 's work in 1509 , the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects . For example , the height and width of the front of Notre @-@ Dame of Laon have the ratio 8 / 5 or 1 @.@ 6 , not 1 @.@ 618 . Such Fibonacci ratios quickly become hard to distinguish from the golden ratio . After Pacioli , the golden ratio is more definitely discernible in artworks including Leonardo 's Mona Lisa . 
 = = = Planar symmetries = = = 
 Planar symmetries have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as carpets , lattices , textiles and tilings . 
 Many traditional rugs , whether pile carpets or <unk> kilims , are divided into a central field and a framing border ; both can have symmetries , though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details , variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver . In kilims from Anatolia , the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical . The general layout , too , is usually present , with arrangements such as stripes , stripes alternating with rows of motifs , and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs . The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as <unk> , while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group <unk> , <unk> or <unk> . Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups . Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry , without explicit knowledge of its mathematics . The mathematician and architectural theorist Nikos Salingaros suggests that the " powerful presence " ( aesthetic effect ) of a " great carpet " such as the best Konya two @-@ medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect Christopher Alexander . These techniques include making opposites couple ; opposing colour values ; differentiating areas geometrically , whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles ; providing small @-@ scale complexity ( from the knot level upwards ) and both small- and large @-@ scale symmetry ; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales ( with a ratio of about 2 @.@ 7 from each level to the next ) . Salingaros argues that " all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules " , and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules . 
 Elaborate lattices are found in Indian <unk> work , carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces . Chinese lattices , always with some symmetry , exist in 14 of the 17 wallpaper groups ; they often have mirror , double mirror , or rotational symmetry . Some have a central medallion , and some have a border in a frieze group . Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye ; he identifies Sichuan as the centre of the craft . 
 Symmetries are prominent in textile arts including quilting , knitting , cross @-@ stitch , crochet , embroidery and weaving , where they may be purely decorative or may be marks of status . Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes ; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out , as at the 1619 Sheikh <unk> Mosque in Isfahan . Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats , made using bobbins or by <unk> , can have a wide variety of <unk> and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically . 
 Islamic art exploits symmetries in many of its artforms , notably in girih tilings . These are formed using a set of five tile shapes , namely a regular decagon , an elongated hexagon , a bow tie , a rhombus , and a regular pentagon . All the sides of these tiles have the same length ; and all their angles are multiples of 36 ° ( π / 5 radians ) , offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries . The tiles are decorated with strapwork lines ( girih ) , generally more visible than the tile boundaries . In 2007 , the physicists Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt argued that girih resembled <unk> Penrose tilings . Elaborate geometric zellige tilework is a distinctive element in Moroccan architecture . Muqarnas vaults are three @-@ dimensional but were designed in two dimensions with drawings of geometrical cells .

 The Platonic solids and other polyhedra are a recurring theme in Western art . They are found , for instance , in a marble mosaic featuring the small stellated dodecahedron , attributed to Paolo Uccello , in the floor of the San Marco Basilica in Venice ; in Leonardo da Vinci 's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for Luca Pacioli 's 1509 book The Divine Proportion ; as a glass <unk> in Jacopo de Barbari 's portrait of Pacioli , painted in 1495 ; in the truncated polyhedron ( and various other mathematical objects ) in Albrecht Dürer 's engraving Melencolia I ; and in Salvador Dalí 's painting The Last Supper in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron . 
 Albrecht Dürer ( 1471 – 1528 ) was a German Renaissance printmaker who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book , <unk> der <unk> ( Education on Measurement ) , meant to teach the subjects of linear perspective , geometry in architecture , Platonic solids , and regular polygons . Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy . While the examples of perspective in <unk> der <unk> are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies , there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra . Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets , polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing . Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier <unk> von <unk> Proportion ( Four Books on Human Proportion ) in 1528 . 
 Dürer 's well @-@ known engraving Melencolia I depicts a frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular <unk> and a magic square . These two objects , and the engraving as a whole , have been the subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print , including a two @-@ volume book by Peter @-@ Klaus Schuster , and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky 's monograph of Dürer . Salvador Dali 's Corpus <unk> depicts an unfolded three @-@ dimensional net for a hypercube , a four @-@ dimensional regular polyhedron .

 The astronomer Galileo Galilei in his Il Saggiatore wrote that " [ The universe ] is written in the language of mathematics , and its characters are triangles , circles , and other geometric figures . " Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first , in Galileo 's view , fully understand mathematics . Mathematicians , conversely , have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality . The mathematician Felipe <unk> suggests that mathematics , and especially geometry , is a source of rules for " rule @-@ driven artistic creation " , though not the only one . Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship are described below . 
 = = = Mathematics as an art = = = 
 The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art , stating that " the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality " , and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research . King cites the mathematician G. H. Hardy 's 1940 essay A Mathematician 's Apology . In it , Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate , namely Euclid 's proof there are infinitely many prime numbers , and the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational . King evaluates this last against Hardy 's criteria for mathematical elegance : " seriousness , depth , generality , unexpectedness , inevitability , and economy " ( King 's italics ) , and describes the proof as " aesthetically pleasing " . The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation : " Why are numbers beautiful ? It 's like asking why is Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony beautiful . If you don 't see why , someone can 't tell you . I know numbers are beautiful . 
 = = = Mathematical tools for art = = = 
 Mathematics can be discerned in many of the arts , such as music , dance , painting , architecture , and sculpture . Each of these is richly associated with mathematics . Among the connections to the visual arts , mathematics can provide tools for artists , such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert , or the methods of descriptive geometry , now applied in software modelling of solids , dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge . Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work . The use of perspective began , despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece , with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century ; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413 , his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer . Isaac Newton 's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe 's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge , J. M. W. Turner , the Pre @-@ Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky . Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene . Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art , or artists inspired by mathematics , such as M. C. Escher ( inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter ) and the architect Frank Gehry , who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way . 
 The artist Richard Wright argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either " as processes to simulate phenomena " or as works of " computer art " . He considers the nature of mathematical thought , observing that fractals were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such . Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to " come to terms with cultural artifacts like art , the tension between objectivity and subjectivity , their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems . " He gives as instances an image from the Mandelbrot set , an image generated by a cellular automaton algorithm , and a computer @-@ rendered image , and discusses , with reference to the Turing test , whether algorithmic products can be art . <unk> <unk> 's Math and Art : An Introduction to Visual Mathematics takes a similar approach , looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings , fractals and hyperbolic geometry . Some of the first works of computer art were created by Desmond Paul Henry 's " Drawing Machine 1 " , an analogue machine based on a bombsight computer and exhibited in 1962 . The machine was capable of creating complex , abstract , asymmetrical , curvilinear , but repetitive line drawings . More recently , Hamid <unk> <unk> has created shapes suggestive of real world objects such as fish , using formulae that are successively varied to draw families of curves or angled lines . Artists such as Mikael <unk> Christensen create works of generative or algorithmic art by writing scripts for a software system such as Structure Synth : the artist effectively directs the system to apply a desired combination of mathematical operations to a chosen set of data . 
 = = = From mathematics to art = = = 
 The mathematician and theoretical physicist Henri Poincaré 's Science and Hypothesis was widely read by the Cubists , including Pablo Picasso and Jean Metzinger . Poincaré viewed Euclidean geometry as just one of many possible geometric configurations , rather than as an absolute objective truth . The possible existence of a fourth dimension inspired artists to question classical Renaissance perspective : non @-@ Euclidean geometry became a valid alternative . The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically , in colour and form , contributed to Cubism , the art movement that led to abstract art . Metzinger , in 1910 , wrote that : " [ Picasso ] lays out a free , mobile perspective , from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice <unk> has deduced a whole geometry " . Later , Metzinger wrote in his memoirs : 
 Maurice <unk> joined us often ... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics , as an aesthetician that he invoked n @-@ dimensional <unk> . He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others . He succeeded at that . 
 The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes . Some of these have inspired artists such as the Dadaists Man Ray , Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst , and following Man Ray , Hiroshi Sugimoto . 
 Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris , including <unk> <unk> ( Mathematical object ) . He noted that this represented <unk> surfaces with constant negative curvature , derived from the pseudo @-@ sphere . This mathematical foundation was important to him , as it allowed him to deny that the object was " abstract " , instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art . Man Ray admitted that the object 's [ <unk> surface ] formula " meant nothing to me , but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature . " He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare 's plays , such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra . The art reporter Jonathan Keats , writing in <unk> , argues that Man Ray photographed " the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse " , and " ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire " . Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore , Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models . Moore wrote of his 1938 <unk> Mother and Child : " Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum ... I was fascinated by the mathematical models I saw there ... It wasn 't the scientific study of these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me . " 
 The artists Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian founded the De Stijl movement , which they wanted to " establish a visual vocabulary comprised of elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline " . Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles , sometimes also with circles . De Stijl artists worked in painting , furniture , interior design and architecture . After the breakup of De Stijl , Van Doesburg founded the Avant @-@ garde Art <unk> movement , describing his 1929 – 1930 Arithmetic Composition , a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background , as " a structure that can be controlled , a definite surface without chance elements or individual caprice " , yet " not lacking in spirit , not lacking the universal and not ... empty as there is everything which fits the internal rhythm " . The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting , namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds . 
 The mathematics of tessellation , polyhedra , shaping of space , and self @-@ reference provided the graphic artist M. C. Escher ( 1898 — 1972 ) with a lifetime 's worth of materials for his woodcuts . In the Alhambra Sketch , Escher showed that art can be created with polygons or regular shapes such as triangles , squares , and hexagons . Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections , glide reflections , and translations to obtain further patterns . Many of his works contain impossible constructions , made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions , but are pleasant to the human sight . Escher 's Ascending and Descending is based on the " impossible staircase " created by the medical scientist Lionel Penrose and his son the mathematician Roger Penrose . 
 Some of Escher 's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry . Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra , which appear many times in his work . The Platonic solids — tetrahedrons , cubes , octahedrons , <unk> , and <unk> — are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids . These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the <unk> and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork . 
 The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks . Stewart Coffin makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods ; George W. Hart works on the theory of polyhedra and <unk> objects inspired by them ; Magnus Wenninger makes " especially beautiful " models of complex stellated polyhedra . 
 The mathematics of topology has inspired several artists in modern times . The sculptor John Robinson ( 1935 – 2007 ) created works such as Gordian Knot and Bands of Friendship , displaying knot theory in polished bronze . Other works by Robinson explore the topology of <unk> . Genesis is based on Borromean rings – a set of three circles , no two of which link but in which the whole structure cannot be taken apart without breaking . The sculptor Helaman Ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects . His works are visual representations of mathematical objects ; The Eightfold Way is based on the projective special linear group PSL ( 2 @,@ 7 ) , a finite group of 168 elements . The sculptor Bathsheba Grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures . 
 A liberal arts inquiry project examines connections between mathematics and art through the Möbius strip , <unk> , origami and panorama photography . 
 Mathematical objects including the Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using fiber arts including crochet . The American weaver Ada Dietz wrote a 1949 monograph Algebraic Expressions in <unk> Textiles , defining weaving patterns based on the expansion of multivariate polynomials . The mathematician J. C. P. Miller used the Rule 90 cellular automaton to design tapestries depicting both trees and abstract patterns of triangles . The " <unk> " Pat <unk> and Steve Plummer use knitted versions of mathematical objects such as <unk> in their teaching , though their Menger sponge proved too troublesome to knit and was made of plastic canvas instead . Their " <unk> " ( Afghans for Schools ) project introduced knitting into the British mathematics and technology curriculum . 
 = = = Illustrating mathematics = = = 
 Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts . Giotto 's <unk> Triptych , 1320 , illustrates recursion ; the central panel of the triptych contains , lower left , the kneeling figure of Cardinal <unk> , holding up the triptych as an offering . Giorgio Chirico 's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings . 
 Art can exemplify logical paradoxes , as in some paintings by the surrealist René Magritte , which can be read as semiotic jokes about confusion between levels . In La condition humaine ( 1933 ) , Magritte depicts an easel ( on the real canvas ) , seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by " real " curtains in the painting . Similarly , Escher 's Print Gallery ( 1956 ) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains the picture , and so ad infinitum . Magritte made use of spheres and <unk> to distort reality in a different way , painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 Mental Arithmetic as if they were children 's building blocks , but house @-@ sized . The Guardian observed that the " eerie <unk> image " prophesied Modernism 's usurpation of " cosy traditional forms " , but also plays with the human tendency to seek patterns in nature . 
 Salvador Dalí 's last painting , The Swallow 's Tail ( 1983 ) , was part of a series inspired by René Thom 's catastrophe theory . The Spanish painter and sculptor Pablo <unk> ( 1916 – 2007 ) focused on the investigation of form . He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature . Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring , in works such as Angular I and <unk> , <unk> expressed himself in geometric transformations . 
 Artists , however , do not necessarily take geometry literally . As Douglas Hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought , Gödel , Escher , Bach , by way of ( among other things ) the mathematics of art : " The difference between an Escher drawing and non @-@ Euclidean geometry is that in the latter , comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms , resulting in a comprehensible total system , whereas for the former , the end result is not <unk> with one 's conception of the world , no matter how long one stares at the pictures . " Hofstadter discusses the seemingly paradoxical lithograph Print Gallery by M. C. Escher ; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town , there being a " strange loop , or tangled hierarchy " to the levels of reality in the image . The artist himself , Hofstadter observes , is not seen ; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical . The image 's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and Hendrik Lenstra , who propose that it could contain a Droste effect copy of itself , rotated and shrunk ; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter . 
 = = = Analysis of art history = = = 
 Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks , for example using X @-@ ray fluorescence spectroscopy , can reveal information about art . Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist ; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded ; help to tell a copy from an original , or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices . 
 Jackson Pollock 's drip painting style has a definite fractal dimension ; among the artists who may have influenced Pollock 's controlled chaos , Max Ernst painted <unk> figures directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas . 
 The computer scientist Neil Dodgson investigated whether Bridget Riley 's stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically , concluding that while separation distance could " provide some characterisation " and global entropy worked on some paintings , autocorrelation failed as Riley 's patterns were irregular . Local entropy worked best , and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert <unk> . 
 The American mathematician George Birkhoff 's 1933 Aesthetic Measure proposes a quantitative metric of the aesthetic quality of an artwork . It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work , such as what a painting might mean , but is limited to the " elements of order " of a polygonal figure . Birkhoff first combines ( as a sum ) five such elements : whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry ; whether there is optical equilibrium ; how many rotational symmetries it has ; how wallpaper @-@ like the figure is ; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together . This metric , O , takes a value between − 3 and 7 . The second metric , C , counts elements of the figure , which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides . Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object 's beauty as O / C. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives , and the amount of effort needed to take it in . Birkhoff 's proposal has been criticized in various ways , not least for trying to put beauty in a formula , but he never claimed to have done that . 
 = = = Stimuli to mathematical research = = = 
 Art has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics , as when Brunelleschi 's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing , and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean @-@ Victor Poncelet . 
 The Japanese paper @-@ folding art of origami has been reworked mathematically by Tomoko <unk> using modules , congruent pieces of paper such as squares , and making them into polyhedra or tilings . Paper @-@ folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding to demonstrate geometrical proofs . The mathematics of paper folding has been explored in Maekawa 's theorem , Kawasaki 's theorem , and the <unk> – <unk> axioms . 
 = = = Illusion to Op art = = = 
 Optical illusions such as the Fraser spiral strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception , creating what the art historian Ernst Gombrich called a " baffling trick . " The black and white ropes that appear to form spirals are in fact concentric circles . The mid @-@ twentieth century Op art or optical art style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as Bridget Riley , Spyros <unk> , and Victor <unk> . 
 = = = Sacred geometry = = = 
 A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world , and the world 's geometry therefore as sacred . The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins . Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato , writing that " Plato said God <unk> continually " ( <unk> <unk> , liber 8 @,@ 2 ) . This image has influenced Western thought ever since . The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a Pythagorean notion of harmony in music , where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions , corresponding to the lengths of the lyre 's strings ; indeed , the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number . In the same way , in Platonic thought , the regular or Platonic solids dictate the proportions found in nature , and in art . A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament : " When he established the heavens I was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the deep " ( Proverbs 8 : 27 ) , showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses . In 1596 , the mathematical astronomer Johannes Kepler modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids , determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets . William Blake 's Ancient of Days and his painting of the physicist Isaac Newton , naked and drawing with a compass , attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world , as in a different way does Salvador Dali 's 1954 Crucifixion ( Corpus <unk> ) , which depicts the cross as a hypercube , representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three . In Dali 's The Sacrament of the Last Supper ( 1955 ) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron . 
 = Kalapuya brunnea = 
 Kalapuya brunnea is a species of truffle in the monotypic fungal genus Kalapuya . The truffle occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States , in western Oregon and northern California . Known locally as the Oregon brown truffle , it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus . The truffle is reddish brown with a rough and warty outer skin , while the interior spore @-@ producing gleba is initially whitish before developing greyish @-@ brown mottling as it matures . Mature truffles have an odor resembling <unk> cheese , similar to mature Camembert . The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described scientifically in 2010 , based on specimens collected in February , 2009 from Benton County , Oregon . Before this , it had been known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle , and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium , based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle , Leucangium carthusianum ; it was given the provisional name Leucangium <unk> . Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species is not related to the truffle genera of the family <unk> , including Tuber , <unk> and <unk> . Rather , it has close affinity with the hypogeous ( below the soil surface ) genera of the Morchellaceae , including <unk> , <unk> , and Leucangium , but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus . All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores , with sizes ranging from 32 to 100 micrometers ( μm ) . Both Kalapuya and <unk> have asci ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) that have thick cell walls when young , but become thin when mature — a trait not shared with <unk> . The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size , striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella , were it not for the convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness . 
 The generic name Kalapuya refers to the Kalapuya people , a Native American ethnic group whose traditional homelands encompassed the range of the fungus . The Kalapuya people , however , are not known to have eaten the truffle , and some regard mushrooms as taboo food . The specific epithet brunnea is Latin for " brown " , the color of the mature truffle . 
 = = Description = = 
 The truffle @-@ like fruit bodies of Kalapuya are roughly spherical , with lobes and furrows , and dimensions of typically 12 – 60 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 – 2 @.@ 36 in ) by 10 – 45 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 1 @.@ 77 in ) . The peridium ( outer " skin " ) is up to 2 mm thick , and ranges in color from light yellowish @-@ brown to orange @-@ brown to reddish @-@ brown , usually with darker patches in maturity . The surface texture is rough , as the truffle is covered with flat to rounded warts that are 0 @.@ 5 – 3 mm wide ; larger warts often have smaller warts on them . Older specimens develop narrow cracks over the surface such that it becomes areolate or <unk> . The undersurface of the peridium has an branching basal attachment that is roughly similar in texture to cartilage , and which breaks off readily when the truffle is extracted from the soil . The internal spore @-@ bearing tissue , the gleba , is initially whitish and firm , but develops grayish @-@ brown mottling as it matures . 
 The truffle is edible , and has been harvested for culinary purposes , although with less frequency than other Pacific Northwest truffles . Both the flavor and odor of the edible fruit body resemble mature Camembert cheese . One source described the taste as follows : " Served in melted butter on sliced baguette , they reminded of buttered lobster . " 
 The spores are ellipsoid in shape , with a smooth surface , and contain a large central oil drop surrounded by smaller droplets . The spore dimensions are 32 – 43 by 25 – 38 μm , the walls measuring 1 – 3 μm thick . Although not reactive with Melzer 's reagent , spores stain readily with Methyl blue . The asci contain 6 to 8 spores per ascus . They are variably shaped , with dimensions of 70 – 110 by 60 – 100 μm , with a stem 10 – 40 by 6 – 10 μm , and a forked base . Initially about 3 μm thick , the ascus walls thin to roughly 1 μm when mature . The gleba comprises loosely interwoven , thin @-@ walled hyaline hyphae measuring 5 – 13 μm in diameter .

 Leucangium carthusianum , the Oregon black truffle , is roughly similar in appearance , habitat , and growing season , but can be distinguished by its darker ( charcoal black ) peridium . Microscopically , the spores of Leucangium are larger ( 60 – 90 μm ) and have a single large oil droplet . L. carthusianum is also edible and prized for its taste and aroma . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The species is known only from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States , where it grows in Douglas fir forests that are up to about 50 years old ; the authors suggest that it is obligately symbiotic with this tree . Usually appearing from October through March , fruit bodies grow in the top 2 – 10 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) of soil , beneath soil litter , at elevations ranging from roughly sea level to about 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) . It occurs on the west side of Oregon 's Cascade Range , as well as in the Coastal Ranges of Oregon and northern California .

 Behind the Exclusive Brethren : Politics Persuasion and Persecution is a non @-@ fiction book by journalist and author Michael Bachelard about the group Exclusive Brethren , focusing on the sect in Australia . It was published in 2008 by Scribe Publications Pty Ltd . Bachelard first became interested in the organisation while a journalist for The Age , after finding out that prior to the 2007 Australian federal election the Exclusive Brethren organisation in Australia had close access to John Howard . He spent two years researching the group , focusing on its history , influence in Australia , and ties to the Liberal Party of Australia and to Howard . The book gives a historical background of the group 's origins 200 years ago in Ireland under John Nelson Darby . Since 2002 , Bruce Hales served as the international leader and " Elect Vessel " of the organisation , which has 15 @,@ 000 members in Australia and 43 @,@ 000 total globally . The author describes the beliefs and practices and doctrine of the organisation , including some of its more controversial methodology including excommunication of former members from their family still within the group . Daniel Hales , brother of the organisation 's worldwide leader Bruce Hales , described the book as part of a trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members . 
 The book was a best @-@ seller in Australia , and in November 2008 it hit number 8 on a list of top ten best @-@ selling books in the country in political and social science books according to data from Nielsen BookScan . The book received positive reception in books reviews and media coverage . The Sunday Age called it a " sober " and " well @-@ argued " expose . The Sydney Morning Herald , called the book an " exhaustive study of the Exclusive Brethren in Australia " . GayNZ.com characterised Behind the Exclusive Brethren as a " comprehensive reference work on the sect " . Media / Culture Reviews noted , " The expose is written in a calm , clear style and the chapters relating to the broken families are deeply moving and respectful . "

 At the time of the book 's publication , Bachelard was a journalist for The Age newspaper . He began investigating the organisation in his capacity as a newspaper journalist . Bachelard 's first book The Great Land Grab discussed the Wik and Mabo cases , and was first published in 1997 . Bachelard became an investigative journalist with The Age in 2006 , and wrote about conditions in the workplace . In April 2008 , he became a senior reporter for The Sunday Age . Bachelard received Melbourne Press Club Quill Award for Best News Report in 2008 , for his reporting on <unk> . After discovering that prior to the 2007 election the Exclusive Brethren organisation in Australia had close access to John Howard , Bachelard became interested in writing a book about the group . He researched the organisation 's history , and focused on the version of the group in Australia ; analysing its ties to the Liberal Party of Australia and to Howard . He spent over two years researching the organisation . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Bachelard discusses the Australian branch of the Exclusive Brethren that was formed approximately 200 years ago by John Nelson Darby of Ireland . The introduction emphasises the point that intense investigation should not be seen as vilification of the organisation . He writes that since the organisation 's beginnings in Ireland in 1827 , it has maintained that the world external to the group is evil , and has kept a " doctrine of separation " from non @-@ members . Since 2002 , Bruce Hales served as the international leader and " Elect Vessel " of the organisation , which has 15 @,@ 000 members in Australia and 43 @,@ 000 total globally . The author describes the beliefs and practices and doctrine of the organisation , including its approaches to business and finance , as well as its methodology with respect to charity , Sunday services , and preparing the dead for burial . Bachelard asserts that the group had " elements of <unk> " , but had recently reduced its standards of stringency . 
 According to the book , wives are deemed second @-@ class citizens within the organisation , and cannot hold positions higher than administrative jobs at companies owned by the group . The book describes the story of the treatment of Alison Alderton , an 85 @-@ year @-@ old woman who was excommunicated from the organisation . For twenty years , Alderton did not see four of her six children after she had been excommunicated by the organisation . During the 1980s , Alderton and her husband Bob had served within the organisation as senior figures at the group 's location in Bathurst , New South Wales . The author quotes former Family Court chief justice Alastair Nicholson , who had said that methods used by the organisation to excommunicate family members were " abusive ... psychologically it 's very damaging to the child " . 
 The author publicises a letter in the book that was written by the organisation in 2004 to Brendan Nelson , the former minister for education in Australia . According to the letter , a survey of membership within the organisation found that individuals were in the " middle to upper levels of the socio @-@ economic group " , over the last few decades . Bachelard writes , " Any funding system which delivers poverty @-@ level funding to a group that boasts of its average wealth , needs to be reviewed . " Behind the Exclusive Brethren describes how the organisation paid a private detective in New Zealand to put forth information claiming that the husband of politician Helen Clark was homosexual . The book details methods of social control used by the organisation , including the usage of exclusion from the group as a threat used to police members . 
 The book reveals that members of the organisation had attempted to donate funds to the 2007 re @-@ election campaign of Prime Minister of Australia John Howard in a way in which information about the financing would not have been available to the general public . Individuals describing themselves as a " private group " had met with a senior figure within the Liberal Party of Australia in a hotel in Sydney , and offered him a significant amount of money by way of an anonymous donation . The book 's source recounted the events : " They said ' We are a private group ' . I asked them if they voted . It was a testing question . They said they didn 't . It was a very short discussion . " The organisation 's members are instructed that government is controlled by God , and they are told not to vote in elections . " We 're in the business of ideas and so are the Exclusive Brethren . I regard many of the party 's views and those of the Exclusive Brethren as inconsistent . What the [ Liberal ] Party stands for should not be confused in the mind of the electorate by the acceptance of donations from fringe groups . In my view , if you accept this money , you 're arguably accepting some of their opinions , " said the book 's source , explaining that he had turned down the offer of funds from the organisation .

 Daniel Hales , brother of the organisation 's worldwide leader Bruce Hales , described the book as part of a trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members . He said such criticism showed it is " open season to kill us " . " We 're happy to live our lives in anonymity , just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low @-@ key way . We 're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned , ethically debated , and points of religion looked at . That 's not a problem . We don 't mind being criticised . We don 't even mind being despised because of it . But once it starts to be charged that we 're acting criminally , we 're acting illegally , we 're acting immorally , we 're acting against society , then we felt that we really had to put our point of view . We felt that it wasn 't fair to our members , " said Daniel Hales to The West Australian .

 In November 2008 , the book hit number 8 on a list compiled by Nielsen BookScan of the top 10 political and social science best @-@ sellers in Australia . The author was a featured presenter on the topic of his book , at the 2009 Sydney Writers ' Festival . 
 The Daily Telegraph noted that the book investigates , " One of the world 's most mysterious religious sects , little is known of the origins , intentions and beliefs of the Brethren , seen as increasingly powerful in Australian politics . " Writing in The Sunday Age , Lucy Sussex described the book as " one of the most sober and well @-@ argued exposes I have ever read . " Shelley McInnis reviewed the book for The Age , and commented , " Michael Bachelard is brave to investigate the Exclusive Brethren sect " . McInnis elaborated , " The Exclusive Brethren is a conservative Christian sect with a scrappy , pit @-@ bull attitude towards the outside world , and Michael Bachelard is courageous for investigating it . The award @-@ winning Sunday Age journalist has received a number of legal threats from the sect since he began reporting on it for The Age " . McInnis described the author 's work as that of " a scrupulous reporter " . 
 Bruce Elder reviewed the book for The Sydney Morning Herald , and described it as an " exhaustive study of the Exclusive Brethren in Australia " . Elder concluded , " This is a very fair assessment of the modus operandi of an influential Christian sect . " Craig Young reviewed the book for GayNZ.com , and called Behind the Exclusive Brethren a " comprehensive reference work on the sect " , and a " most incisive book " . In her review of the book for Media / Culture Reviews , Sandra Hogan wrote , " Bachelard has done his research very thoroughly . He has interviewed both sides of the story : people who left the Exclusive Brethren or were expelled from them and also , as much as possible , the current leaders of the group . He has witnessed Brethren documentation , and has spoken to politicians from major and minor parties as well as to lawyers and judges . The expose is written in a calm , clear style and the chapters relating to the broken families are deeply moving and respectful . " 
 = 1872 FA Cup Final = 
 The 1872 FA Cup Final was a football match between Wanderers and Royal Engineers on 16 March 1872 at Kennington Oval in London . It was the final of the first staging of the Football Association Challenge Cup ( known in the modern era as the FA Cup ) , which became the primary cup competition in English football and the oldest football competition in the world . Fifteen teams entered the competition in its first season and , due to the rules in place at the time , Wanderers reached the final having won only one match in the four preceding rounds . In the semi @-@ finals , they drew with the Scottish club Queen 's Park , but reached the final when the Scots withdrew from the competition as they could not afford to return to London for a replay . 
 The final was decided by a single goal , scored after fifteen minutes by Morton Betts of Wanderers , who was playing under the pseudonym " A.H. Chequer " . The Engineers were praised for their innovative use of passing , then referred to as the " Combination Game " , at a time when most teams relied almost solely on dribbling tactics . Despite this they could not manage to score a goal . The winning Wanderers team did not receive the trophy until the following month , when it was presented to them at a special reception at the Pall Mall Restaurant . 
 = = Route to the final = = 
 Wanderers and Royal Engineers were among fifteen teams who entered the inaugural FA Cup competition , and both were allocated home matches in the first round . Wanderers were paired with Harrow Chequers , a team consisting of former pupils of Harrow School , and the Engineers were set to face Reigate Priory . Neither match actually took place , however , as in both cases the away team withdrew from the competition , sending the home team through to the next round on a walkover . In the second round , both teams played away matches and emerged victorious . Wanderers defeated Clapham Rovers 3 – 1 in December and the Engineers beat Hitchin 5 – 0 the following month . 
 At the quarter @-@ final stage , Wanderers drew 0 – 0 with Crystal Palace ( a different club to the modern club of the same name ) . Rather than be made to replay the match , however , both teams were permitted to go through to the semi @-@ finals under one of the competition 's original rules , which stated that in the event of a drawn match the teams would either be made to play again or both progress to the next round , at the organising committee 's discretion . The Engineers beat Hampstead Heathens 2 – 0 . In the semi @-@ finals Wanderers took on the leading Scottish club Queen 's Park who , due to a combination of walkovers and byes , had reached this stage of the competition without actually playing a match . The rules of the competition stated that all matches from the semi @-@ final stage onwards would take place at Kennington Oval in London and , after being held to a 0 – 0 draw , the Scottish club could not afford to make the lengthy trip from Glasgow a second time for a replay and withdrew from the competition , sending Wanderers into the final . The Engineers also drew their semi @-@ final at the Oval 0 – 0 , and beat Crystal Palace 3 – 0 in the replay .

 As was common at the time , both teams focused mainly on attack rather than defence , the Engineers lining up with seven forwards and Wanderers with eight . Wanderers forward Morton Betts played under the pseudonym " A. H. Chequer " , derived from his membership of the Harrow Chequers club . Some sources state that he played under an assumed name to disguise the fact that he was cup @-@ tied , having been a registered player of the Chequers club at the start of the competition and therefore ineligible to play for another club in that season 's cup . This , however , is unlikely to be true , as in the early amateur era of football players were not required to be formally registered with clubs . Cuthbert Ottaway , a future captain of the England national team , played for two different clubs in consecutive rounds of the 1871 – 72 FA Cup without incident . 
 Wanderers captain C. W. Alcock won the coin toss and chose to defend the Harleyford Road end of the ground , meaning that the Engineers , who were considered the favourites at the start of play , initially had the sun and wind in their faces . Early in the game , Edmund Creswell of the Royal Engineers suffered a broken collar bone in a melee . He refused to leave the pitch but due to his injury was forced to spend the remainder of the match as a " passenger " on the wing . Wanderers ' tactics centred on the dribbling skills of individual players , while the Engineers favoured passing the ball , a style then known as the " Combination Game " and considered innovative , of which they were leading exponents . 
 Wanderers took the lead fifteen minutes into the game when Betts opened the scoring from an acute angle after Robert Vidal 's long dribble . Under the rules in use at the time , the teams changed ends after each goal , but the Engineers were unable to take advantage of the fact that the sun and wind were now behind them , and the Wanderers players remained dominant . After twenty minutes Alcock put the ball past the Engineers ' goalkeeper , William Merriman , but the goal was disallowed because Charles Wollaston had handled the ball . Wanderers continued to exert further pressure on the Engineers ' goal and only Merriman 's skill was able to prevent them from increasing their lead . One newspaper later described his performance as " perfect " . Despite a late rally from the Engineers , Wanderers were able to hold on to their lead and the game ended in a 1 – 0 victory . Newspaper The Field called the final " the fastest and hardest match that has ever been seen at The Oval " and said that the Wanderers displayed " some of the best play , individually and collectively , that has ever been shown in an Association game " .

 The Cup was presented by the President of the Football Association , Mr E. C. Morley , at the annual dinner of the Wanderers at the Pall Mall Restaurant , Charing Cross , on 11 April . The Football Association also gave each player in the winning team a silk badge commemorating the victory and the Wanderers ' committee presented each player with an inscribed gold medal . As cup @-@ holders , Wanderers received a bye straight to the final of the following year 's FA Cup , in keeping with the original concept of the competition being a " challenge cup " . This was the only time this rule was used . 
 In 1938 , The Times published an obituary for Thomas Hooman and stated that he had scored the winning goal in the 1872 cup final , citing an interview the player gave shortly before his death . This claim is not backed up by contemporary newspaper reports , all of which list Betts as the goalscorer , and , as other quoted aspects of Hooman 's reminiscences about the match were incorrect , it seems that in his old age he was confusing the 1872 final with another match in which he played . 
 In 2010 , the only known surviving medal from the final was offered for sale at an auction in London . It had been purchased by a jeweller as part of a house clearance in the 1950s and was expected to sell for up to £ 50 @,@ 000 , but was ultimately purchased by the Professional Footballers ' Association for £ 70 @,@ 500 . 
 On 7 November 2012 , the match was replayed by the reformed Wanderers side and the Royal Engineers team at the original venue , The Oval . The result went in a completely opposite direction to the actual final , as the Royal Engineers won 7 – 1 . 
 = Saviem = 
 The Société Anonyme de Véhicules Industriels et d <unk> <unk> ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> də <unk> ɛ ̃ <unk> e <unk> ̃ <unk> ] ) , commonly known by the acronym Saviem ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ̃ ] ) , was a French manufacturer of trucks and buses / coaches part of the Renault group , headquartered in Suresnes . The company was established in 1955 by merging Renault heavy vehicle operations with Somua and Latil and disappeared in 1978 when was merged with former rival Berliet to form Renault Véhicules Industriels . 
 The company initially had various factories for vehicle production around France ( mainly at the Paris area ) which came from its predecessors and Chausson , but it soon centred assembly on Blainville @-@ sur @-@ Orne ( trucks ) and Annonay ( buses and coaches ) . Saviem formed partnerships with other manufacturers , leading to technology @-@ sharing agreements .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 At the end of 1946 , Renault abandoned the production of heavy trucks in view of its financial troubles , and the company lost the position of France 's market leader which it had before World War II . However , the rapid development and production concentration on that sector made Renault to seek ways to enter into the market . In 1950 , the Renault 's technical chief , Fernand Picard , elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine , taking advantage of the economies of scale , which proved unsuccessful . In 1953 , the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers , starting with Somua and Latil . The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault 's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider ( owner of Somua ) and the Blum family ( owner of Latil ) had stakes in the new company . Initially , the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but , from 1957 onwards , Saviem @-@ LRS appeared as marque 's name on the company 's products ( the acronym representing the former marques Latil , Renault and Somua ) , which was simplified to Saviem in 1960 . In 1959 , Saviem became a whole @-@ owned subsidiary of Renault . The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault 's existing models ( Goélette and Galion ) , new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach / bus production . With an aggressive market approach focussed in volume rather than quality , Saviem became the leader by sales in France . 
 = = = New vehicles and partnerships = = = 
 During the early 1960s the company introduced a renovated JL heavy and medium duty trucks range with a revised design , new buses and coaches and , in 1964 , a S range of medium duty trucks ( with Renault and Perkins engines ) , unveiled at the Paris Motor Show . In January 1961 , Saviem took control of the bus manufacturer Floirat , based at Annonay . That year , Saviem signed a cooperation agreement with Henschel @-@ Werke . In 1962 , Pierre Dreyfus decided to expand the European partnerships of Saviem and the company received a large capital amount from the French State for recapitalisation and modernisation . It also got the Limoges factory , which manufactured diesel engines . Between 1963 and 1966 , Saviem moved most of its production from the Paris area to Blainville @-@ sur @-@ Orne and Annonay . In 1967 , the Blainville @-@ sur @-@ Orne factory produced 26 @,@ 000 large goods vehicles and the Annonay factory 1 @,@ 777 buses / coaches . In 1965 , Saviem acquired the French heavy equipment manufacturer Richard @-@ Continental in a bid to compete with Caterpillar . 
 From 1963 to 1977 , Saviem cooperated with MAN of Germany ( in 1967 such cooperation was expanded ) . As part of the agreement Saviem supplied cabs and in return MAN supplied axles and engines . The result of this was the launch of the SM ( Saviem @-@ MAN ) and JM truck ranges in France . Renault also introduced the Super Galion , in partnership with Avia . In 1975 Saviem , together with DAF , Volvo and <unk> @-@ Deutz ( soon after to become a part of Iveco ) became co @-@ founder of the Club of Four cooperation to produce medium @-@ sized trucks . The same year Saviem also acquired <unk> and completed , together with Fiat and Alfa Romeo , the construction of a joint production facility for engines ( <unk> ) in Foggia , Italy , at a cost of US $ 250 million . 
 In January 1968 , the main Saviem factory at Blainville @-@ sur @-@ Orne was the setting for one of the first workers ' protests that led to the French May . 
 = = = Merger with Berliet = = = 
 As a result of companies ' reorganisation and a French State decision of unifying the heavy vehicle production in France , in 1975 Renault also acquired the truck and bus manufacturer Berliet from the Michelin group . In 1978 , Berliet and Saviem were merged to form Renault Véhicules Industriels ( <unk> ) . Again , the old marque names were retained for two more years while the model lineups gradually were assimilated , and in April 1980 they were replaced by the name Renault , putting an end to the Saviem badging . In 1977 , its last year as a separate company within Renault , Saviem manufactured 35 @,@ 059 buses / coaches and trucks .
