 Another virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author 's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result in phrasing difficult to precisely translate . One such instance is found in the first sentence of " The Metamorphosis " . English translators often render the word Ungeziefer as " insect " ; in Middle German , however , Ungeziefer literally means " an animal unclean for sacrifice " ; in today 's German it means vermin . It is sometimes used colloquially to mean " bug " — a very general term , unlike the scientific " insect " . Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor , the protagonist of the story , as any specific thing , but instead wanted to convey Gregor 's disgust at his transformation . Another example is Kafka 's use of the German noun Verkehr in the final sentence of " Das Urteil " . Literally , Verkehr means intercourse and , as in English , can have either a sexual or non @-@ sexual meaning ; in addition , it is used to mean transport or traffic . The sentence can be translated as : " At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge " . The double meaning of Verkehr is given added weight by Kafka 's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line , he was thinking of " a violent ejaculation " .

 = = = Literary and cultural influence = = = 
 Unlike many famous writers , Kafka is rarely quoted by others . Instead , he is noted more for his visions and perspective . Shimon Sandbank , a professor , literary critic , and writer , identifies Kafka as having influenced Jorge Luis Borges , Albert Camus , Eugène Ionesco , J. M. Coetzee and Jean @-@ Paul Sartre . A Financial Times literary critic credits Kafka with influencing José Saramago , and Al Silverman , a writer and editor , states that J. D. Salinger loved to read Kafka 's works . In 1999 a committee of 99 authors , scholars , and literary critics ranked Der Process and Das Schloss the second and ninth most significant German @-@ language novels of the 20th century . Sandbank argues that despite Kafka 's pervasiveness , his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated . Neil Christian Pages , a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Binghamton University who specialises in Kafka 's works , says Kafka 's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship ; it impacts visual arts , music , and popular culture . Harry Steinhauer , a professor of German and Jewish literature , says that Kafka " has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century " . Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the " century of Kafka " . 
 Michel @-@ André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe . Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms . Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour , all highlighting the " irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world " . His characters are trapped , confused , full of guilt , frustrated , and lacking understanding of their surreal world . Much of the post @-@ Kafka fiction , especially science fiction , follow the themes and precepts of Kafka 's universe . This can be seen in the works of authors such as George Orwell and Ray Bradbury . 
 The following are examples of works across a range of literary , musical , and dramatic genres which demonstrate the extent of cultural influence : 
 = = = " Kafkaesque " = = = 
 Kafka 's writing has inspired the term " Kafkaesque " , used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work , particularly Der Process ( The Trial ) and " Die Verwandlung " ( The Metamorphosis ) . Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people , often in a surreal , nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness , disorientation , and helplessness . Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation . Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works , but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real @-@ life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex , bizarre , or illogical . 
 Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque , and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction . Works in this genre that have been thus described include Patrick <unk> 's 1982 film The Angel , Terry Gilliam 's 1985 film Brazil , and the 1998 science fiction film noir , Dark City . Films from other genres which have been similarly described include The Tenant ( 1976 ) and Barton Fink ( 1991 ) . The television series The Prisoner and The Twilight Zone are also frequently described as Kafkaesque . 
 However , with common usage , the term has become so ubiquitous that Kafka scholars note it 's often misused . More accurately then , according to author Ben Marcus , paraphrased in " What it Means to be Kafkaesque " by Joe <unk> in The Atlantic , " Kafka ’ s quintessential qualities are affecting use of language , a setting that straddles fantasy and reality , and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness — hopelessly and full of hope .

The museum calls its display of original photos and documents <unk> K. Franz Kafka a Praha ( City K. Kafka and Prague ) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote . 
 The Franz Kafka Prize is an annual literary award of the Franz Kafka Society and the City of Prague established in 2001 . It recognizes the merits of literature as " humanistic character and contribution to cultural , national , language and religious tolerance , its existential , timeless character , its generally human validity , and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times " . The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world , but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language . The recipient receives $ 10 @,@ 000 , a diploma , and a bronze statuette at a presentation in Prague 's Old Town Hall on the Czech State Holiday in late October . 
 San Diego State University ( SDSU ) operates the Kafka Project , which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka 's last writings . 
 = Tropical Storm Jerry ( 1995 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Jerry was a tropical storm that caused severe flooding throughout the southeast United States in August of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season . Jerry , the tenth tropical storm of the season , formed from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast in early August , which organized into a tropical depression and tropical storm between the Bahamas and Florida later in the month , before striking Florida in the latter part of the month . Its remnant circulation persisted until five days after landfall . The rainfall it produced , amounting to over 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in several locations across Florida , Georgia , and South Carolina , was responsible for $ 40 million ( 2005 USD ) in damage and 6 deaths . At the time , Jerry was the earliest tenth storm to form in a season on record , until Jose in the 2005 season overtook it . Tropical Storm Jerry was also the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 9 . It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean , and reached the Lesser Antilles on August 15 . While passing through the islands , convection greatly increased , causing wind gusts of up to 45 miles per hour ( 72 km / h ) , though it remained disorganized . On August 22 , convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas , and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day . Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west , but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23 . 
 Jerry , having reached tropical storm strength 33 miles ( 53 km ) east of the coast of Florida , moved to the northwest and hit Jupiter later on August 23 . It continued to the northwest across the state , and remained a tropical storm until late on August 24 when it entered the Gulf of Mexico over Citrus County . It remained over waters briefly until moving inland in Dixie County on August 25 . It continued slowly northward , entering Georgia on August 26 . The weak depression turned to the east , and dissipated into a trough of low pressure on August 28 near the Georgia / South Carolina border . The trough developed two circulation centers , one of which moved eastward while the other moved southward . The latter drifted southwestward across Florida until dissipating in early September . It is unknown if either of the circulations are directly related to the original center of Jerry . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Because much of the circulation was over land , Jerry was not predicted to intensify to a tropical storm . This caused tropical storm warnings not to be issued until just hours before landfall . While crossing over the state , the storm retained its strength , causing officials to issue Tropical Storm Warnings over the Florida Panhandle . However , Jerry remained a tropical depression over the Gulf of Mexico , and the warnings were dropped after Jerry 's second landfall .

 Upon making landfall in southeastern and western Florida , Jerry caused a storm surge of 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) to 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) in most areas . Rainfall was generally moderate in the southeastern portion of the state , with the highest amounts of over 10 inches ( 250 mm ) occurring in Palm Beach County . A larger area of higher totals was recorded in southwestern Florida , with rainfall peaking at 16 @.@ 8 inches ( 430 mm ) in Golden Gate . Winds were light , peaking at 43 miles per hour ( 69 km / h ) at Patrick Air Force Base in Brevard County . The storm caused two weak tornadoes and one waterspout , though damage was minimal . In addition , Jerry caused light beach erosion . 
 While wind damage was minimal , the heavy flooding left many roads across the state under water . In addition , it damaged 340 houses and destroyed 12 , most of which were in Collier County . In northwestern Florida , the flooding caused severe damage to the citrus crop , with total agricultural damage amounting to $ 15 million . In all , damage in Florida amounted to $ 19 million ( 1995 USD ) . The storm also caused two indirect deaths in the state , though no fatalities were directly attributed to Jerry .

 In Georgia , Jerry dropped severe rainfall of over 12 inches ( 300 mm ) near <unk> , covering numerous waterways and flooding numerous houses . A state of emergency was declared within Georgia as Jerry moved through the state . Flooding from the storm across Georgia was mild to moderate due to the very dry conditions which preceded Jerry 's arrival .

 Portions of South Carolina experienced significant rainfall totals of up to 19 inches ( 480 mm ) . The significant rainfall led to flooding along the Saluda , the Edisto , the Broad , and the Congaree Rivers in South Carolina . Dam breaks were also reported , which led to flooding which covered numerous roadways and washed out bridges , with the statewide transportation damage totaling $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( 1995 USD ) . In addition , houses were flooded and fields covered , which caused a damage total of $ 10 million ( 1995 USD ) . Jerry also killed 3 people in the state .

 The remnants of Jerry caused heavy precipitation in North Carolina , amounting up to 10 inches ( 250 mm ) in the southwest corner of the state . This led to flooding along the Neuse , the French Broad , the Warned , the <unk> , the Black , the Little Pee Dee , the Pee Dee , and the <unk> rivers . Across the state , numerous roads , including portions of Interstate 85 , and houses were submerged . Flood stage records were set for McMullen and McAlpine Creeks , with McAlpine reaching a stage of 19 @.@ 4 feet ( 5 @.@ 9 m ) . In the Charlotte area , the flooding forced the evacuation of 63 people from a nursing home , as well as 200 people from a pair of apartment complexes . Mecklenburg County reported damages of $ 5 million ( 1995 USD ) . In Raleigh , over 140 buildings or houses were damaged or destroyed , resulting a damage total in the area of $ 6 million ( 1995 USD ) . In all , Jerry caused $ 11 million ( 1995 USD ) in damage across the state and 3 fatalities . It washed out Perry Mill Pond 's dam outside of Zebulon NC on SR 1001 .

 With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995 , Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel . They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August , and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date , which is a break from the usual 3 @-@ year gap between films . Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang . The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre @-@ production on A Time to Kill . Portions of Mr. Freeze 's back @-@ story were based on the Batman : The Animated Series episode " Heart of Ice " , written by Paul Dini . 
 While Chris O 'Donnell reprises the role of Robin , Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role of Batman from Batman Forever . Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on Forever . " He sort of quit , " Schumacher said , " and we sort of fired him . " Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast track production and was already committed to The Saint ( 1997 ) . Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer 's place , but George Clooney was cast instead . Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Michael Keaton ( in Batman and Batman Returns ) and Kilmer . The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on ER without any scheduling conflicts . 
 Patrick Stewart was considered for the role of Mr. Freeze , before the script was rewritten to accommodate Arnold Schwarzenegger 's casting . Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be " big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier " . Schwarzenegger was paid a $ 25 million salary for the role . His prosthetic makeup and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day . Thurman took the role of Poison Ivy because she liked the femme fatale characterization of the character . Alicia Silverstone was the only choice for the role of Batgirl . Leonardo DiCaprio stated that he had a meeting with Schumacher about appearing in the film , but was ultimately not cast .

 The original start date was August 1996 , but principal photography did not begin until September 12 , 1996 . Batman & Robin finished filming in late January 1997 , two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule . The film was mostly shot at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank , California . 
 When comparing work on Batman Forever , Chris O 'Donnell , who portrayed Robin , explained , " It just felt like everything got a little soft the second time . On Batman Forever , I felt like I was making a movie . The second time , I felt like I was making a kid 's toy commercial . " He also complained of the Robin costume , saying it was more involved and uncomfortable than the one he wore in Batman Forever , with a glued @-@ on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face . According to John Glover , who played Dr. Jason Woodrue , " Joel [ Schumacher ] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take , ' Remember , everyone , this is a cartoon ' . It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film . " Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from " neon @-@ ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age . Gotham is like a World 's Fair on ecstasy . " Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences , with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors . 
 According to Shadows of the Bat : The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6 : Batman Unbound , Chris O 'Donnell revealed that despite hanging out with Arnold Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film , they never worked a single day together . This was achieved with stand ins when one of the actors wasn 't available .

 The film received generally unfavorable reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic , two of the most popular review aggregator websites .

The website 's consensus reads : " Joel Schumacher 's tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin , resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that 's too jokey to care much for . " On Metacritic , the film achieved an average score of 28 out of 100 based on 21 reviews , signifying " generally unfavorable reviews " . 
 Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor @-@ Scott blamed the negative reception of Batman & Robin on Warner Bros. ' decision to fast track production . " There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make Batman & Robin more family @-@ friendly , " Schumacher explained . " We decided to do a less depressing Batman movie and less torture and more heroic . I know I have been criticized a lot for this , but I didn 't see the harm in that approach at all . " Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times criticized the toyetic approach and Mr. Freeze 's one @-@ liner jokes in his two @-@ star review of the film . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed the film " killed " the Batman film series , and felt Batman & Robin depended too much on visual effects . Desson Thomson of The Washington Post largely disapproved of Schumacher 's direction and Akiva Goldsman 's script . Mick LaSalle , writing in the San Francisco Chronicle , said , " George Clooney is the big zero of the film , and should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series . " However , Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave a positive review . She praised Uma Thurman 's acting , as well as the production and costume design . 
 Batman & Robin was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film , as well as Best Make @-@ up and Best Costume , but won none . Alicia Silverstone won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress . Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher ( Worst Director ) , George Clooney and Chris O 'Donnell ( Worst Screen Couple ) , Akiva Goldsman ( Worst Screenplay ) , both Chris O 'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger ( Worst Supporting Actor ) , Uma Thurman ( Worst Supporting Actress ) , as well as Billy Corgan ( Worst Song for " The End Is the Beginning Is the End " ) . Batman & Robin also received nominations for Worst Picture , Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property . Ultimately , out of 11 nominations , Batman & Robin garnered only one Razzie Award . 
 Many observers thought Schumacher , a gay man , added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline . James Berardinelli questioned the " random amount [ sic ] of rubber nipples and camera angle close @-@ ups of the Dynamic Duo 's butts and Bat @-@ crotches . " Similar to Batman Forever , this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits . Schumacher stated , " I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines . The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues , which display perfect bodies . They are anatomically correct . " Chris O 'Donnell , who portrayed Robin , felt " it wasn 't so much the nipples that bothered me . It was the <unk> . The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal , especially with Joel directing . I didn 't think twice about the controversy , but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures , it was very unusual . " George Clooney joked , " Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay " . Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film , saying , " I think we might have killed the franchise " , and called it " a waste of money " .

 During the filming of Batman & Robin , Warner Bros. was impressed with the dailies , prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a sequel . However , writer Akiva Goldsman turned down an offer to write the script . In late 1996 , Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth Batman film . A projected mid @-@ 1999 release date was announced . Titled Batman Unchained , Protosevich 's script had the Scarecrow as the main villain . Through the use of his fear toxin , he resurrects the Joker as a hallucination in Batman 's mind . Harley Quinn appeared as a supporting character , written as the Joker 's daughter . George Clooney , Chris O 'Donnell , and Alicia Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman , Robin , and Batgirl . However , following the poor critical reception of Batman & Robin , Clooney vowed never to reprise his role . 
 Warner Bros. decided to consider a live @-@ action Batman Beyond film and an adaptation of Frank Miller 's Batman : Year One . Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most . Schumacher felt he " owe [ d ] the Batman culture a real Batman movie . I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight . " He approached Warner Bros. about doing Batman : Year One in mid @-@ 1998 , but they were more interested in hiring Darren Aronofsky . Aronofsky and Frank Miller developed a Year One script with Aronofsky to direct , but it was ultimately canceled . Christopher Nolan was eventually hired to helm the next Batman film in January 2003 , resulting in the rebooted Batman Begins ( 2005 ) . 
 In " Legends of the Dark Knight " , an episode of The New Batman Adventures , three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like . They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher 's Batman and Robin . The teens treat Joel 's ideas with utter disdain . In Watchmen , director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from Batman & Robin for the Ozymandias costume . The film is referenced in the Batman : The Brave and the Bold episode " Legends of the Dark Mite ! " , when Bat @-@ Mite briefly uses his powers to transform Batman 's costume into the same suit shown in the Joel Schumacher Batman films , before declaring it " Too icky " . The Batman from Batman & Robin later appeared as part of an army of Batmen gathered from across the Multiverse in " Night of the Batmen ! " , complete with the blue rubber Batsuit . Additionally , there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to Batman & Robin and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct @-@ to @-@ video animated film Batman & Mr. Freeze : SubZero , which was originally planned for release at around the same time as Batman & Robin but was subsequently delayed . However , SubZero received a far stronger positive response from critics than Batman & Robin , with Mr. Freeze 's role within it being seen in a much more positive light , returning his popularity as a Batman villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy @-@ winning episodes the character featured in of Batman : The Animated Series .

 WSJ. or WSJ . Magazine , which was originally intended to be a monthly magazine named Pursuits , is a luxury glossy news and lifestyle monthly magazine by the publishers of The Wall Street Journal . It features luxury consumer products advertisements and is distributed to subscribers in large United States markets as well as throughout Europe and Asia . Its coverage spans art , fashion , entertainment , design , food , architecture , travel and more . Kristina O ’ Neill is Editor in Chief and Anthony <unk> is Publisher . Launched as a quarterly in 2008 , the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014 . 
 The magazine is distributed within the U.S. Weekend Edition of The Wall Street Journal newspaper ( paid print circulation for the Weekend edition is + 2 @.@ 2 million * ) , the European and Asian editions , and is available on <unk> Each issue is also available throughout the month in The Wall Street Journal ’ s iPad app . 
 With its tagline " The Luxury of Choice " , the magazine began operations with an advertising business model that allowed for free delivery to select readers . It followed a trend of contemporaneous new luxury magazines many of which were also delivered as part of free subscriptions that supplemented other subscriptions or memberships . Since it is leveraging a high @-@ end subset of The Wall Street Journal with favorable demographics , many expected the magazine to be successful . 
 = = Initial release = = 
 The magazine was originally sent as an insert with September 6 , 2008 weekend home delivery in the seventeen largest United States The Wall Street Journal subscription markets as well as the September 5 editions of the Wall Street Journal Europe and Wall Street Journal Asia . By selecting these markets , it began with a readership of 960 @,@ 000 ( 800 @,@ 000 domestic ) . The magazine is also available with newsstand purchases of the newspaper in the selected domestic markets , and its content is available for free online at <unk> In addition , this readership has greater wealth ( average household assets of US $ 2 @.@ 9 million ) , higher income ( $ 265 @,@ 000 per @-@ household income ) , and takes more than twice as many international leisure trips than the readership of the newspaper . This is notable because the readership of the newspaper spent more on women 's apparel than the readers of Vogue and more on leisure travel than the readers of Travel & Leisure . The launch press release was sent in English , French , German , Italian , Japanese , Simplified Chinese , and Traditional Chinese . The September 6 debut had been announced nearly a year earlier . 
 The magazine was officially unveiled at the Pierpont Morgan Library on September 3 , 2008 . The unveiling was led by Ellen <unk> @-@ Giglio , its publisher ; Michael Rooney , Dow Jones chief revenue officer ; Tina Gaudoin , WSJ. editor in chief ( and former launch editor of The Times of London ’ s <unk> ) ; and Robert J. Thomson , managing editor of The Wall Street Journal . It has been compared to How To Spend It , the weekend magazine of the Financial Times , T magazine , a New York Times offshoot , Style & Design , a spinoff of Time , and Departures , a magazine distributed for free to American Express platinum and black cardholders . Gaudoin had also previously worked for Tatler , Harper 's Bazaar and Vogue and helped to launch the women 's magazine Frank .

 In 2008 , luxury magazines had become the new wave of print media . These aforementioned similar magazines have generally succeeded at both giving free luxury magazine subscriptions to a selected elite audience and hoping that they would read them so that the magazine could sell advertising . This magazine is considered to be a similar bet on the viability for the luxury advertising revenues market . Nearly half of the advertiser bought globally in the United States , Europe and Asia and many advertisers committed to advertising deals for all of next year . Some advertisers committed for two years . 
 The Wall Street Journal launched its weekend newspaper edition , which its publisher , Dow Jones & Company , described as the first and only Saturday morning national weekend newspaper , on September 17 , 2005 . When the weekend newspaper was launched , it had the highest circulation of any national newspaper published on Saturday . Prior to the launch of the weekend edition , The Wall Street Journal had commonly only been delivered to business addresses . With the home delivery aspect of the weekend edition , the possibility of supplemental weekend luxury magazine arose . The original name Pursuits had been widely publicized as a section of the newly launched weekend edition of the magazine .

 In December 2009 , WSJ. announced plans to expand domestic circulation beyond the 17 largest domestic markets to the entire domestic subscription base , which nearly doubled its domestic circulation from 800 @,@ 000 to 1 @.@ 5 million . In addition the frequency of distribution was expanded from 4 to 6 times per year . In order to increase the frequency a May and an October edition were added to the March , June , September and December 2010 distribution schedule . At the time of the expansion , the magazine claimed its first fifteen months of its first six issues had been a success during which the magazine attracted 64 new subscribers to the Journal 's franchise . Deborah Needleman replaced Tina Gaudoin in 2010 . After Needleman left for T in 2012 , she was replaced by Kristina O ’ Neill . In 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , the magazine increased its publication frequency to 10 , 11 and 12 times per year , respectively . When Pursuits initially was marketed , the plan was for it to be a monthly magazine .

 The magazine is oversized to be as large as would fit within the fold of The Wall Street Journal . Its specs are 9 @.@ 875 by 11 @.@ 5 inches ( 25 @.@ 1 by 29 @.@ 2 cm ) trim size and a 50 @-@ 50 ad @-@ to @-@ edit ratio on a 60 @-@ pound ( 27 kg ) paper stock . The premiere issue of WSJ. had 104 pages in the U.S. and 80 pages in the Europe and Asia editions . It included 51 advertisers of which 19 are new to The Wall Street Journal franchise . The initial cover featured Diana <unk> in a dress fabricated from The Wall Street Journal newsprint design , which the New York Observer feels is a tip of the hat to a controversy noted in the New York Times about a poverty chic photo spread in the India edition of the August 2008 Vogue .

 Some media experts consider that pursuit of luxury retail advertising an effective strategy , but whether the magazine becomes a success is an open issue . Immediate speculation commented on the likelihood for success given the demographics of the initial subscription base . Others ascribed their great expectations to the brand . Some skeptics claim that since Journal readers are financial information seekers giving them a free magazine of luxury ads may be a waste of time . Others note the magazine 's launch despite a market with declining advertising and a world economy suffering from the Financial crisis of 2007 – 2008 . Some advertisers expressed appreciation for an opportunity to present to The Wall Street Journal 's readers in a different format . 
 The content is slightly less focussed on consumption than How To Spend It . Gaudoin stated her intention was to make a publication that was less about how to spend it and more about " how to live it . " She also intends to differentiate her magazine via wit and irreverence in order to make WSJ. less urban and less gritty " than T. The magazine claims to have planned to feature Sarah Palin in its inaugural issue even before she became John McCain 's running mate in the 2008 United States presidential election . 
 In 2013 , Adweek named WSJ . " Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year " for its annual Hot List . The November 2013 cover featuring Gisele <unk> and Daft Punk won the Clio Award for Top Magazine cover of the year .

 = SMS Tegetthoff ( 1878 ) = 
 SMS Tegetthoff was an ironclad warship of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . She was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste , between April 1876 and October 1881 . She was armed with a main battery of six 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns mounted in a central @-@ battery . The ship had a limited career , and did not see action . In 1897 , she was reduced to a guard ship in Pola , and in 1912 she was renamed Mars . She served as a training ship after 1917 , and after the end of World War I , she was surrendered as a war prize to Italy , which sold her for scrapping in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Tegetthoff was a central battery ship designed by Chief Engineer Joseph von <unk> . The ship 's namesake , Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff , victor of the Battle of Lissa , had proposed building four new ironclads . These were to be completed by 1878 , but poor economic conditions in the early 1870s forced the Austro @-@ Hungarian government to cut back the naval budget . Admiral Friedrich von Pöck , who succeeded Tegetthoff as the head of naval administration , had attempted to secure funding for two new ships , to be named Tegetthoff and Erzherzog Karl from 1871 . Pöck finally succeeded in convincing parliament to allocate funds for the first ship in 1875 . He continued to try to convince the parliament to build a sister ship for Tegetthoff until 1880 , without success . Austro @-@ Hungarian industry was incapable of supporting the construction of the ship , and significant components had to be ordered from foreign manufacturers , including guns from Germany and armor plating from Britain . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Tegetthoff was 89 @.@ 39 meters ( 293 @.@ 3 ft ) long at the waterline and 92 @.@ 46 m ( 303 @.@ 3 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 21 @.@ 78 m ( 71 @.@ 5 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 57 m ( 24 @.@ 8 ft ) and she displaced 7 @,@ 431 t ( 7 @,@ 314 long tons ; 8 @,@ 191 short tons ) . Tegetthoff was the first ship in the Austrian Navy to be built with an all @-@ steel hull , which allowed for a considerable savings in weight . The ship 's crew numbered 525 officers and men , though after her reconstruction in the mid @-@ 1890s , this number was increased to between 568 and 575 . The main armored belt and the casemate for the main battery guns were protected with 356 mm ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) thick armor plate , and the end bulkheads of the armored citadel were 254 to 305 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 to 12 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The conning tower had sides that were 127 to 178 mm ( 5 @.@ 0 to 7 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 As built , the ship was powered by a single 2 @-@ cylinder , vertical compound steam engine that was rated at 6 @,@ 706 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 001 kW ) . This gave Tegetthoff a top speed of 13 @.@ 97 knots ( 25 @.@ 87 km / h ; 16 @.@ 08 mph ) on trials . After her reconstruction in the early 1890s , her propulsion system was replaced with a pair of 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines built by the German firm Schichau @-@ Werke . These were rated at 8 @,@ 160 ihp ( 6 @,@ 080 kW ) , for a top speed of 15 @.@ 32 kn ( 28 @.@ 37 km / h ; 17 @.@ 63 mph ) on trials . After the refit , she was equipped with eight Scotch marine boilers . She was initially fitted with a sailing rig , though this was removed during the modernization , and two heavy fighting masts were installed in its place . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Tegetthoff was initially equipped with a main battery of six 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) L / 18 breech @-@ loading guns manufactured by Krupp . These guns were mounted in a central battery amidships , and were intended to be used during pursuit and ramming attempts . The ammunition magazine was located directly below the main battery . The ship also carried six 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 24 breech @-@ loaders , two 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) L / 15 breech @-@ loaders , and four 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns . 
 After her modernization , the main battery was replaced with 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) L / 35 C / 86 guns from Krupp . The secondary guns now consisted of five 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 35 QF guns , two 7 cm L / 15 guns , nine 47 mm L / 44 QF guns , six 47 mm L / 33 machine guns , and a pair of 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine guns . Tegetthoff was also equipped with two 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , one in the bow and one in the stern . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Tegetthoff was laid down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste . The ship was launched in 1878 , and completed in 1881 . She conducted her sea trials in October of that year , and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882 ; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the ship in Pola . Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship 's completion ; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881 . At the time , she was the largest and most powerful ship in the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , and she would keep that distinction until after the turn of the century . She was , nevertheless , a political compromise , and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships , particularly British and French vessels . 
 Tegetthoff 's career was rather limited , in large part due to significant problems with her engines . For the first decade of her career , she was assigned to the Active Squadron , and her crew could only keep her engines fully operational in the years 1883 , 1887 , and 1888 . Tegetthoff and an Austro @-@ Hungarian squadron that included the ironclads Custoza , Kaiser Max , Don Juan d 'Austria , and Prinz Eugen and the torpedo cruisers Panther and Leopard travelled to Barcelona , Spain , to take part in the opening ceremonies for the Barcelona Universal Exposition . This was the largest squadron of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy that had operated outside the Adriatic . 
 In 1893 – 1894 , she was modernized and had her propulsion system updated and her armament was replaced with newer guns . Her engines were replaced with more reliable models manufactured by the German firm Schichau @-@ Werke . By this time , she was the only remotely modern ironclad in the Austrian fleet , apart from the two newly built barbette ships Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf and Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie . Admiral Maximilian <unk> von <unk> had replaced Pöck , and unable to secure funding for capital ships , instead tried to modernize the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet by embracing the Jeune École doctrine . 
 After 1897 she was used as a guard ship in Pola . During the summer maneuvers of June 1901 , she served in the reserve squadron . The other major ships in the squadron included the new armored cruiser Kaiser Karl VI and the protected cruiser SMS Kaiser Franz Joseph I. In 1912 Tegetthoff was renamed Mars , so that her original name could be used on a new battleship launched that year . She remained in service as a guard ship after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 . In 1917 , she was used as a school ship for midshipmen , and the following year she was reduced to a hulk . Following the end of World War I , the ship was surrendered to Italy , where she was broken up by 1920 . 
 = 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix = 
 The 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix ( formally known as the Formula 1 Grande Prêmio Petrobras do Brasil 2012 ) was a Formula One motor race that took place at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo , Brazil on 25 November 2012 . The race was the twentieth and final round of the 2012 Formula One World Championship , and marked the forty @-@ first running of the Brazilian Grand Prix . The race was won by Jenson Button driving for McLaren . 
 It was at this race that Sebastian Vettel won the 2012 World Drivers ' Championship , his third title in a row . Fernando Alonso finished second in both the race and the championship , and had the provisional championship lead at a late stage of the race , before Vettel moved up the order to have a three @-@ point cushion . 
 = = Report = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix marked Michael Schumacher 's final race before his second retirement and was also the last race for Bruno Senna and the HRT Formula 1 Team . HRT in their history did not score a point , and withdrew because of financial issues . 
 Tyre supplier Pirelli provided teams with early prototypes of their 2013 compounds during Friday practice for testing and review . 
 Pirelli brought its silver @-@ banded hard compound tyre as the harder " prime " tyre and the white @-@ banded medium compound tyre as the softer " option " tyre , as opposed to the previous year when they brought the medium and soft compound dry tyres . 
 In order to become world champion for the third time , Sebastian Vettel needed to defend a 13 @-@ point advantage over Fernando Alonso meaning the Spaniard needed at least third place even if the German failed to score . Conversely , a fourth place was sufficient for Vettel even if Alonso won . 
 = = = Free Practice = = = 
 During free practice on Friday and Saturday , it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren who set the pace , closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber . While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions , Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning . Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice , trailing Vettel by 0 @.@ 465 seconds , twice as much as in previous races . However , he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session . Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa putting in the most consistently fast lap times , 0 @.@ 1 seconds ahead of Hamilton . With high temperatures , tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that " it felt almost as though I was sliding around the track with the tyres melting " . 
 = = = Qualifying = = = 
 After the very warm practice sessions , qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions . Qualifying one ( Q1 ) started on a damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres , while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used . In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing . While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane , he was unable to change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid . Michael Schumacher 's last ever qualifying did not go well either . He took 14th position , almost half a second down on his teammate , admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race . The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row , with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team . Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled , taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively . Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10 @-@ place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge in the second part of qualifying . He dropped from sixth to 16th , moving Alonso one place up to seventh .

 Title contender Alonso and Ferrari were hoping for damp conditions during the race , stating : " Wet races are a bit more unpredictable so we need some kind of damp race with many things happening , because we know that in normal conditions , fighting for the championship will be very difficult " . Felipe Massa discounted rumours he might try to help Alonso win the title by forcing Vettel into retirement , stating " I 've always been an honest person and an honest driver . And that will continue to be the case . My limit is the limit of the regulations , and I will stay true to this limit " . 
 = = = = Race report = = = = 
 With only light rain just 10 minutes before the start , all teams opted to start on slick tyres . Vettel got away poorly , dropping to seventh position , while his rival Alonso moved up into fifth . Vettel and Bruno Senna collided at turn 4 in a racing incident , which saw Vettel spin while Senna ended up hitting the rear of Pérez . Vettel suffered damage to his left sidepod but was able to carry on , in 22nd position . However , the reigning world champion began to move up the order , as there was close racing for position at the front of the field as well . Massa helped his teammate overtake Mark Webber on lap two going into the Senna @-@ S , giving the Spaniard the crucial third position he would need to win the title . But Alonso lost the position again to the fast running Force India of Nico Hülkenberg after running wide on lap four . Maldonado crashed out on lap two , when he lost control of his car on the kerb through the inside of turn 3 , and crashed into the tyre barrier on the exit of the corner . 
 Rain began to fall during the next few laps and the first cars made pit stops for intermediate tyres , including the two title contenders , while Button and Hülkenberg stayed out . This proved to be the right decision since the rain decreased shortly afterwards and cars on intermediates were forced to pit for slick tyres once again . Hülkenberg continued his strong performance by overtaking Button for the lead on lap 19 . 
 With the two cars in front leading the field by almost a minute , debris on the track brought out the safety car on lap 23 . At this point Alonso and Vettel were running in fourth and fifth place . At the restart on lap 29 , Kamui Kobayashi took fifth position from Vettel . The damage on the Red Bull car slowed Vettel down considerably more in dry conditions , and Massa helped his teammate by overtaking the German shortly after . Meanwhile , at the front , Hamilton took second from his teammate and was able to pass Hülkenberg when the German half @-@ spun . Hülkenberg pursued the McLaren but slid into him on lap 54 , leaving Hamilton out of the race with damage to the left front suspension and himself with a drive @-@ through penalty , handing Button the lead . 
 When the rain started again , Vettel was one of the first to pit for intermediates , but since his radio had failed the team was not ready for him , causing a long delay . Ferrari timed Massa 's pit stop well , letting Alonso take second position from him . Vettel took sixth position from Michael Schumacher which proved sufficient to retain the title even with Alonso finishing second . 
 The race ended after Paul di Resta crashed on the start / finish straight shortly before the end , bringing out the safety car once again until the conclusion of the race . Caterham 's Vitaly Petrov took 11th position which meant his team overtook Marussia in the constructors ' championship . Former world champion Kimi Räikkönen had an eventful race as well , almost crashing into Vettel after the start and later trying to use an escape road only to find it to be a dead end . He later stated the way had been open 11 years prior , having made the same manoeuver at the 2001 race . He also had a close contest with the retiring Michael Schumacher , who finished seventh after recovering from an early puncture , but gave up sixth to Vettel in order to help him extend his small point advantage over Fernando Alonso in the championship . 
 = = = Post @-@ race = = = 
 International reception of the race was positive , with The Guardian calling it a " rollercoaster " . Three @-@ time world champions Niki Lauda and Nelson Piquet stated that they had never seen a race like it . German magazine Der Spiegel deemed the race " spectacular " and " historic " due to the record @-@ breaking 147 successful overtaking manoeuvres carried out during the race . Sebastian Vettel himself called it his " toughest race ever " . 
 At age 25 , Vettel became the youngest triple world champion of the sport , six years younger than Ayrton Senna had been in 1991 . On drawing level with Senna , Vettel commented : " To win that third title here , where one of my greatest idols , Ayrton Senna , was from , it is very difficult to imagine I join him and other great names by winning three successive titles " . Red Bull 's team principal Christian Horner praised his driver , saying " Sebastian has driven better than ever this season and has fought his way back into this championship , he 's never given up and you saw that in today 's race " . 
 The Daily Mirror lauded Red Bull designer Adrian Newey for making the decision to change the engine mapping on Vettel 's car after reviewing photos of the damage sustained in the first lap accident . Newey was quoted saying : " So we photographed it going past , saw huge crease in exhaust , which usually means it will soon crack and the bodywork catch fire . [ ... ] So we changed the engine mapping to keep the exhaust as cool as we could , even though it meant lost performance " . 
 Championship runner @-@ up Fernando Alonso expressed pride for his team , going so far as to call the 2012 season " the best season of my career " . During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet , he asserted : " Obviously we lost the championship now , but I don 't think , as you said , that we lost here in Brazil , we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky . But this is a sport , but when you do something with your heart , when you do something with 100 per cent , you have to be proud of your team , happy for them , and we will try next year . " The press later pointed out Alonso 's " grace after the race " , contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition 's " dirty tricks " during his post @-@ race press conference . 
 Speaking about his victory , Jenson Button congratulated his team , saying : " This is the perfect way to end the season . We have had ups and downs and to end on a high bodes well for 2013 . " 
 Upon his second retirement from the sport , Michael Schumacher commented on the three years at Mercedes GP : " I have tried that mission to end successful . It didn 't work this time but I 'm quite happy to finish from here and go for a different life again . " 
 Commenting on the outcome of the season , former team owner Eddie Jordan said he believed Alonso would have deserved the title more , considering the " less competitive machine " . BBC columnist and former Formula One driver Jaime Alguersuari took a different viewpoint , saying the German deserved the title , having gone into the last race with " the most difficult position [ ... ] – he had everything to lose " . 
 = = = = Controversies = = = = 
 Three days after the race , Ferrari announced they were contemplating filing an appeal with the FIA due to video footage allegedly showing Sebastian Vettel overtaking Jean @-@ Éric Vergne under yellow flags . Should the allegations have proven valid , the FIA could have added 20 seconds to Vettel 's finishing time , demoting him to 8th in the race result , handing the driver 's title to Alonso . Just two days later however , Ferrari opted not to appeal the result after receiving additional information from the FIA . Formula One CEO Bernie Ecclestone had previously stated that he considered Ferrari 's allegations " a shame " and " a joke " . 
 After losing 10th place in the constructor 's championship to Caterham , Marussia 's director of engineering Nikolai <unk> accused driver Charles Pic of deliberately letting Vitaly Petrov pass him due to Pic having already signed a contract with Caterham for next season . However , no actions were taken following these accusations .

 New York State Route 149 ( NY 149 ) is an east – west state highway that runs for 32 @.@ 20 miles ( 51 @.@ 82 km ) through the Capital District of New York in the United States . It begins at exit 20 on the Adirondack Northway ( Interstate 87 or I @-@ 87 ) in the Warren County town of Queensbury and intersects U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) , US 4 , and NY 22 , among other routes , as it progresses eastward to its eastern end at the Vermont state line in the Washington County village of Granville . Here , the highway becomes Vermont Route 149 ( VT 149 ) and continues for an additional 1 @.@ 302 miles ( 2 @.@ 095 km ) to an intersection with VT 30 in Rutland County . Both NY 149 and VT 149 traverse mostly rural areas . 
 NY 149 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and initially extended from NY 9L in Queensbury to NY 22 south of Granville by way of an east – west highway built during the first two decades of the 20th century . It was cut back to US 4 c . 1939 , but extended westward back to NY 9L in the mid @-@ 1950s . It was extended further west to US 9 in the late 1950s and to I @-@ 87 exit 20 c . 1962 . In the mid @-@ 1960s , NY 22 was rerouted to bypass Granville to the west . NY 149 was then extended to Vermont by way of NY 22 's former routing into the village and East Main Street . The short continuation of Granville 's East Main Street in Vermont , designated as Vermont Route 30B since 1935 , was renumbered to VT 149 at this time to match the New York number .

 = = = Queensbury and Fort Ann = = = 
 NY 149 officially begins at exit 20 on the northbound Adirondack Northway ( I @-@ 87 ) in the town of Queensbury , from where it follows a ramp eastward to US 9 . As signed , however , NY 149 begins at the southbound portion of I @-@ 87 exit 20 and follows County Route 23 ( CR 23 , named Gurney Lane ) east to US 9 , where it turns to follow US 9 northward . The signed and official routings join at the exit 's northbound ramps . While concurrent with US 9 , NY 149 passes the Adirondack / Lake George Factory Outlet Mall and several other businesses located on both sides of the highway . At the end of the factory outlets in the hamlet of French Mountain , NY 149 turns off US 9 and proceeds in a generally eastward direction toward the village of Fort Ann . 
 After passing under a bike path overpass and a recreational vehicle park , the route runs through an area of rural residential dwellings and wooded areas situated north of Glen Lake . At the northern tip of the lake , NY 149 intersects Oxbow Hill Road , a connector to CR 63 ( Moon Hill Road ) that is maintained by Warren County county despite not being a numbered Warren County route . East of this junction , the highway turns to the northeast and crosses the Blue Line into Adirondack Park ahead of an intersection with CR 7 ( Bay Road ) . NY 149 continues on , curving back to the east as it passes the Queensbury Country Club and meets NY 9L . The route enters Washington County and the town of Fort Ann roughly 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) later . 
 The first several miles of NY 149 in Washington County pass through isolated , rural areas as it curves to the north and south while following a generally east – west alignment . In West Fort Ann , the only community along the route between the county line and the village of Fort Ann , NY 149 intersects with Old State Route 149 , a loop route of NY 149 that was created when the highway was realigned . The route continues east from the community , exiting Adirondack Park and crossing over Halfway Creek on its way into the village of Fort Ann , where it becomes Ann Street . Within the village , NY 149 passes the Fort Ann Cemetery and two blocks of homes before intersecting with US 4 at George Street . NY 149 turns to the south , joining US 4 along George Street through downtown Fort Ann . After passing the town park , US 4 and NY 149 leave the village and become nameless as they head south into the town of Kingsbury . 
 = = = East of Fort Ann = = = 
 In Kingsbury , US 4 and NY 149 head through an open area dotted with farms and ponds . The routes proceed southward to a junction known as Baldwin Corner , where US 4 and NY 149 split . While US 4 heads to the southeast , NY 149 continues due south , paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith 's Basin . Here , NY 149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal — which NY 149 had been following since joining US 4 in downtown Fort Ann — to enter the town of Hartford . Here , the route winds its way eastward through a rural , mostly undeveloped area of Washington County as it intersects several county roads on its way to the hamlet of Hartford . 
 In Hartford , NY 149 intersects both Christian Hill Road and CR 23 ( the main street of the community ) ahead of a junction with NY 40 south of the community . The two routes converge here as NY 149 follows NY 40 northward around the small community to a junction east of the hamlet 's center , where NY 149 turns off to the east and begins to pass through more rural areas of the town of Hartford and the adjacent town of Granville . Upon crossing into Granville , the open areas along the route give way to dense forests . NY 149 continues generally northeastward through the town , passing through the isolated hamlet of Hillsdale before curving to the southeast toward South Granville . At the center of the community , NY 149 turns to the northeast at an intersection with CR 27 and CR 28 . 
 The route leaves South Granville , passing patches of trees and a smattering of homes as it heads toward the border village of Granville . Just south of the village limits , NY 149 intersects with NY 22 . NY 22 and NY 149 briefly overlap before NY 22 forks off to bypass Granville to the west . NY 149 continues into Granville , becoming Quaker Street upon entering the village limits . The route proceeds through the village to its center , where NY 149 forks northeastward onto West Main Street and crosses over the <unk> River . At an intersection with Church Street ( CR 26 ) , NY 149 becomes East Main Street and turns to the southeast on its way to the Vermont state line , where the roadway becomes VT 149 . 
 VT 149 heads southeastward away from the built up village of Granville into a more rural region of the Rutland County town of Pawlet , paralleling the <unk> River as it progresses onward . It heads past homes and through a dense forest as it intersects with Bull Frog Hollow Road just after the border . After Bull Frog Hollow Road , the route proceeds eastward through an area dominated by quarries . VT 149 continues on , entering a more open area and passing only a few homes before ending at an intersection with VT 30 in Blossom Corners , a small , largely unpopulated community within the town of Pawlet .

 = = = State takeover and improvements = = = 
 Several portions of NY 149 were constructed during the early 20th century when the state of New York assumed ownership over thousands of highways across the state . The earliest known constructed portion of modern NY 149 is the segment between the southern end of the NY 22 overlap and the southern village limits of Granville . The state let a $ 10 @,@ 850 ( equivalent to $ 296 @,@ 748 in 2016 ) contract to improve the highway , legislatively designated as part of State Highway 104 ( SH 104 ) , on May 12 , 1902 . The highway was added to the state highway system on October 6 , 1902 , following the completion of the project . The portion of NY 149 that overlaps US 9 in Queensbury , designated as part of SH 417 , was improved under the terms of a $ 82 @,@ 700 ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 1 million in 2016 ) contract awarded on July 10 , 1906 . It was added to the state highway system on January 10 , 1907 . 
 Other portions of modern NY 149 were constructed over the course of the next decade . In 1911 , work began on the section of current NY 149 between Smith 's Basin and the northern junction with NY 40 in Hartford . The contract for the portion in the town of Fort Ann ( SH 942 ) was let on June 15 while the contract for the section in Hartford ( SH 802 ) was awarded three months earlier on March 30 . The two projects were carried out simultaneously over the next two years . SH 802 was added to the state highway system on February 9 , 1914 , while SH 942 was included in the system on May 5 , 1914 . In all , the improvement of the two state highways cost $ 69 @,@ 577 @.@ 20 ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 64 million in 2016 ) . 
 In 1913 , construction began on the portion of what is now NY 149 in Granville south of North Street , internally designated as SH <unk> . The $ 77 @,@ 684 @.@ 89 ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 84 million in 2016 ) contract was awarded on September 5 , 1913 . The necessary improvements were made over the course of the next year and the highway was incorporated into the state highway system on October 29 , 1914 . The last portion of NY 149 with a known construction date is the section concurrent to US 4 in Fort Ann ( part of SH 1224 ) . A contract for its improvement was let on January 8 , 1915 at a cost of $ 43 @,@ 778 @.@ 92 ( equivalent to $ 952 thousand in 2016 ) . The improvements were made over the next year and the roadway was added to the state highway system on January 10 , 1916 . 
 When the first set of New York state routes were assigned in 1924 , SH 417 became part of NY 6 while SH 104 and SH <unk> were included in NY 24 and SH 1224 was designated as part of NY 30 . NY 6 was replaced by US 9 while NY 30 was co @-@ designated as US 4 between Glens Falls and Whitehall in 1927 following the creation of the U.S. Highway System in late 1926 . The remainder of modern NY 149 was unnumbered prior to 1930 . 
 = = = Assignment and alignment changes = = = 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the NY 30 designation was reassigned elsewhere , leaving just US 4 on the portion of highway that US 4 now shares with NY 149 . At the same time , all of NY 24 south of Middle Granville became part of NY 22 while NY 149 was assigned to the portion of its modern alignment between NY 9L in Queensbury and NY 22 south of the village of Granville . In July 1935 , several floods devastated many highways in the state of New York . One highway affected was NY 149 , as a bridge carrying the highway in the hamlet of South Granville was washed out . With the bridge out , drivers were detoured onto a town highway ( now maintained by Washington County as CR 27 ) to access NY 22 and Granville from South Granville and to access NY 40 from Granville . NY 22 was also affected by the flood as a bridge in the town of Cambridge was washed out as well . 
 NY 149 was truncated eastward c . 1939 to the southern terminus of its overlap with US 4 south of Fort Ann . The change lasted for roughly 15 years before the highway was reextended westward to NY 9L in the mid @-@ 1950s . It was extended again in the late 1950s to follow a pre @-@ existing , unnumbered roadway west to US 9 in the Queensbury hamlet of French Mountain . NY 149 was altered once more c . 1962 to meet the new I @-@ 87 at exit 20 , resulting in a short overlap with US 9 . 
 In Granville , NY 22 was originally routed on Quaker , Main , and North streets . It was rerouted in the mid @-@ 1960s to bypass Granville on a new highway west of the village . NY 149 was then extended northward along NY 22 's former routing to the junction of Main and North streets in Granville . From there , it continued eastward on Main Street to reach the Vermont state line , where it connected to VT 30B , a spur route of VT 30 that had been in place since 1935 . Vermont renumbered VT 30B to VT 149 at this time to match the highway it now connected to in New York . 
 = = = Other developments = = = 
 On July 2 , 2005 , the Hadlock Pond Dam north of West Fort Ann failed , washing out four sections of NY 149 near that community . As a result , the portion of the route between NY 9L in Queensbury and US 4 in Fort Ann was closed to all traffic . After one week , the highway was reopened , but only for local traffic and construction crews . It was reopened to all traffic on July 24 . The impromptu repair project cost the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 82 million in 2016 ) . 
 In 2007 , the Times Union of Albany received letters from readers requesting that all of NY 149 be widened from two to four lanes . The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT , who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont , the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four @-@ lane divided highway . Additionally , the state would also have to take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it , which would affect the character of the area . 
 On July 10 , 2008 , a tanker truck full of water crashed into a tree along a portion of NY 149 between Bay Road ( CR 7 ) and Ridge Road ( NY 9L ) that features a sharp curve . After the first accident occurred at 3 : 10 a.m. , a second tractor @-@ trailer , who had stopped because of the tanker , rolled in reverse , <unk> across the road and hitting a car . The road was shut down for the accident , where the driver of the tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital . The drivers of the car and the tractor @-@ trailer that <unk> were not hurt . The route was reopened by 11 : 40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor @-@ trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY 149 . 
 NY 149 between Martindale Road in the town of Queensbury and the Washington County line was upgraded by New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) in the late 2000s . Construction began on February 9 , 2009 to upgrade the 2 @.@ 75 miles ( 4 @.@ 43 km ) long segment . The project consisted of repaving the roadway in areas , but also included widening the shoulder to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) wide , reconstructing and straightening NY 149 near Martindale Road along with a spot near the Queensbury Country Club . <unk> would be replaced , drainage systems would be upgraded and they would create a new wetland mitigation area aside of NY 149 . Finally , left turn lanes would be constructed at NY 9L and CR 7 ( Bay Road ) . Announced alongside of a project to reconstruct NY 372 , the project would cost $ 8 million ( 2009 USD ) and given to <unk> Construction Corporation , based in Queensbury , with a slated completion date of June 2010 . However , by July 2010 , construction had not been completed , as they just had shut down NY 149 between NY 9L and CR 7 . 
 On December 19 , 2012 , NYSDOT announced a project to reconstruct NY 149 and its junction with US 4 in Fort Ann . The project would upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion , requiring the condemnation of one property . This new widening would help make turns from US 4 south to NY 149 west . The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US 4 and NY 149 , which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road . NYSDOT 's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall 2013 with construction beginning soon after . The slated date of completion for the $ 1 @.@ 3 million project would be in Fall 2014 .

 " Owls " is the fifteenth episode of the second season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It originally aired on the Fox network on March 6 , 1998 . The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by Thomas J. Wright . " Owls " featured guest appearances by Kristen Cloke , R. G. Armstrong and Kimberly Patton . 
 Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) and Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) become embroiled in a growing schism within the Group , prompted by the discovery of the True Cross . " Owls " is a two @-@ part episode , with the story continued in " Roosters " . 
 " Owls " was inspired by the earlier second season episode " The Hand of St. Sebastian " , with Morgan wishing to introduce secular beliefs within the Millennium Group . The episode has received positive responses from critics , and was viewed by approximately 5 @.@ 5 percent of the available audience in its initial broadcast . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Damascus , Syria , a team of men excavate a piece of petrified wood — the True Cross . They are interrupted by the arrival of two armed assailants ; one of the excavators , Le Fur , clutches the wood as a shield , and the attackers ' guns jam when they attempt to fire on him . However , when Le Fur attempts to smuggle the wood out of the country , he is killed by a bomb at the airport and the cross is taken by a man named Helmut Gunsche . Gunsche later calls his employer , Rudolf Axmann , to inform him of the theft ; Axmann 's cufflinks bear a Germanic rune . 
 In Seattle , Washington , Catherine Black ( Megan Gallagher ) meets Clear Knight ( Kimberly Patton ) , an executive at <unk> International . Knight offers Black a position as a counselor for the fledgling company , which she accepts . 
 Millennium Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) meets several other Group members to discuss the competing factions within the Group — the Roosters believe that the coming millennium will trigger a theological apocalypse , while the Owls believe the end of the world will be a secular , material disaster . The discovery and theft of the True Cross threatens to tip the internecine conflict in the favor of the Owls , leaving them in control of the Group ; the assembled members are Roosters and wish to stop this . 
 Meanwhile , Lara Means ( Kristen Cloke ) , another Group member , sees a vision of an angel . She begins researching her visions , and is scouted by a Mr. Johnston , who asks her to work with the Owl faction . Meanwhile , Catherine 's husband Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) returns home to find Watts in the house . Watts explains that Black 's modem has been bugged ; the two argue heatedly and Black declares he is done with the Group . 
 Watts and Means discuss the theft of the Cross ; Watts explains that it is fabled to grant its possessor invulnerability , and that the Nazis had attempted to find it to turn the tide of the Second World War . Means believes that the Owls would not have stolen it , as they would not wish to risk sparking a civil war within the Group . Elsewhere , Catherine leaves work at <unk> one evening , and finds that her car will not start . She is met by Knight , who invites the Black family to her home ; it is seen that she wears the same Germanic rune cufflinks as Axmann . 
 Johnston is driving along a quiet road , when his car is overtaken by Gunsche . Gunsche forces Johnston off the road , strangles him to death , and places a piece of wood — meant to resemble the Cross — inside Johnston 's car , before setting him and the car ablaze . The remains are later examined by Watts and Means ; they cannot determine if the wood is the Cross or not . However , Watts finds Johnston 's partially burnt diary , and reads an entry about his contacting Means . Suspecting betrayal , he expels Means from the Group immediately . 
 Meanwhile , Black realizes that a painting he has seen in Knight 's office was a watercolor by Adolf Hitler . He then notices two men watching his house from a car . He approaches and holds them at gunpoint , and they identify themselves as Group members ; however , one of them discreetly draws his own pistol .

 " Owls " was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong . It was the twelfth episode to have been written by the pair , who had penned several across the first and second seasons of the series . The pair had also taken the roles of co @-@ executive producers for the season . " Owls " was directed by Thomas J. Wright ; Wright had directed eleven episodes previously and would helm a further fourteen over the series ' run . Wright would also go on to direct " Millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 Morgan has noted that the plot for " Owls " , and the concluding two @-@ part episode " Roosters " , grew out of the internecine conflict seen within the Millennium Group in " The Hand of St. Sebastian " , an earlier second season episode he had penned with Wong . Morgan had wanted to introduce secular elements to the series ' focus on eschatology , after the theological focus of the earlier episode ; he began focussing on ideas such as biological warfare as a possible way of depicting the end of the world — an idea which would later play out in the two @-@ part episodes concluding the second season , " The Time Is Now " and " The Fourth Horseman " . 
 Guest star Kimberly Patton had worked with Morgan and Wong on several occasions prior to this episode , appearing in " Blood " , an episode of The X @-@ Files they had written , as well as acting in Space : Above and Beyond , the pair 's short @-@ lived science fiction series .

This represented approximately 5 @.@ 39 million households , and left the episode the seventy @-@ ninth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an " A " , finding it " exhilarating " despite its seemingly nonsensical plot . However , VanDerWerff felt that the episode moved at a constant and entertaining pace , and that it and " Roosters " never felt stretched out longer than they should have been . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 5 out of 5 , writing that it " poses amazing questions while precisely and purposefully offering up the answers " . Gibron felt that the episode was a perfect summation of the themes which had been hinted at in the earlier episode " Beware of the Dog " , and would set the tone for the season . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " Owls " three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . Shearman felt the episode was entertaining and fun , but that its plot was confusing and cluttered . However , he felt that the episode served as a better version of " The Hand of St. Sebastian " , with the slower pace of a two @-@ part episode allowing for greater " gravitas " to be given to the storyline . 
 = Thulium = 
 Thulium is a chemical element with symbol Tm and atomic number 69 . It is the thirteenth and antepenultimate ( third @-@ last ) element in the lanthanide series . Like the other lanthanides , the most common oxidation state is + 3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds . In aqueous solution , like compounds of other late lanthanides , soluble thulium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules . 
 In 1879 , Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve separated in the rare earth erbia another two previously unknown components , which he called holmia and thulia : these were the oxides of holmium and thulium respectively . A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911 . 
 Thulium is the second least abundant of the lanthanides after promethium , which is only found in trace quantities on Earth . It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery @-@ gray luster . It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air . Despite its high price and rarity , thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X @-@ ray devices and in solid @-@ state lasers . It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 Pure thulium metal has a bright , silvery luster , which tarnishes on exposure to air . The metal can be cut with a knife , as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3 ; it is malleable and ductile . Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32 K , antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56 K , and paramagnetic above 56 K. 
 Thulium has two major allotropes : the tetragonal α @-@ Tm and the more stable hexagonal β @-@ Tm . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Thulium tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150 ° C to form thulium ( III ) oxide : 
 4 Tm + 3 O2 → 2 <unk> 
 Thulium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form thulium hydroxide : 
 2 Tm ( s ) + 6 H2O ( l ) → 2 Tm ( OH ) 3 ( aq ) + 3 H2 ( g ) 
 Thulium reacts with all the halogens . Reactions are slow at room temperature , but are vigorous above 200 ° C : 
 2 Tm ( s ) + 3 F2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) ( white ) 
 2 Tm ( s ) + 3 Cl2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) ( yellow ) 
 2 Tm ( s ) + 3 Br2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) ( white ) 
 2 Tm ( s ) + 3 I2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) ( yellow ) 
 Thulium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the pale green Tm ( III ) ions , which exist as [ Tm ( OH2 ) 9 ] 3 + complexes : 
 2 Tm ( s ) + 3 H2SO4 ( aq ) → 2 Tm3 + ( aq ) + 3 SO2 − 
 4 ( aq ) + 3 H2 ( g ) 
 Thulium reacts with various metallic and non @-@ metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In those compounds , thulium exhibits valence states + 2 and + 3 , however , the + 3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in thulium solutions . Thulium exists as a Tm3 + ion in solution . In this state , the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water . Tm3 + ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence . 
 Thulium 's only known oxide is <unk> . This oxide is sometimes called " thulia " . Reddish @-@ purple thulium ( II ) compounds can be made by the reduction of thulium ( III ) compounds . Examples of thulium ( II ) compounds include the halides ( except the fluoride ) . Some hydrated thulium compounds , such as <unk> · 7H2O and <unk> ( C2O4 ) 3 · 6H2O are green or greenish @-@ white . Thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with water . This reaction results in hydrogen gas and Tm ( OH ) 3 exhibiting a fading reddish color . Combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides . 
 Thulium reacts with hydrogen chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride . With nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate , or Tm ( NO3 ) 3 . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 The isotopes of thulium range from <unk> to <unk> . The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope , <unk> , is electron capture , and the primary mode after is beta emission . The primary decay products before <unk> are element 68 ( erbium ) isotopes , and the primary products after are element 70 ( ytterbium ) isotopes . 
 Thulium @-@ 169 is thulium 's longest @-@ lived and most abundant isotope . It is the only isotope of thulium that is thought to be stable , although it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium @-@ 165 with a very long half @-@ life . After thulium @-@ 169 , the next @-@ longest @-@ lived isotopes are thulium @-@ 171 , which has a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 92 years , and thulium @-@ 170 , which has a half @-@ life of 128 @.@ 6 days . Most other isotopes have half @-@ lives of a few minutes or less . Thirty @-@ five isotopes and 26 nuclear isomers of thulium have been detected . Most isotopes of thulium lighter than 169 atomic mass units decay via electron capture or beta @-@ plus decay , although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission . Heavier isotopes undergo beta @-@ minus decay . 
 = = History = = 
 Thulium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements ( this was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements ) . Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia ( <unk> ) . Upon additional processing , he obtained two new substances ; one brown and one green . The brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by Cleve , and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element . Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after Thule , an Ancient Greek place name associated with Scandinavia or Iceland . Thulium 's atomic symbol was once Tu , but this was changed to Tm . 
 Thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color ; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands , as erbium was progressively removed . The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James , a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham . In 1911 he reported his results , having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification . He famously needed 15 @,@ 000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous . 
 High @-@ purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in the late 1950s , as a result of the adoption of ion @-@ exchange separation technology . Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99 % and 99 @.@ 9 % purity . The price per kilogram has oscillated between US $ 4 @,@ 600 and $ 13 @,@ 300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99 @.@ 9 % purity , and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 The element is never found in nature in pure form , but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths . Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium . In particular , thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite . However , thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite , xenotime , and euxenite . Its abundance in the Earth crust is 0 @.@ 5 mg / kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles . Thulium makes up approximately 0 @.@ 5 parts per million of soil , although this value can range from 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 8 parts per million . Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater . In the solar system , thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1 part per trillion by moles . Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China . However , Australia , Brazil , Greenland , India , Tanzania , and the United States also have large reserves of thulium . Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100 @,@ 000 tonnes . Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium . 
 = = Production = = 
 Thulium is principally extracted from monazite ores ( ~ 0 @.@ 007 % thulium ) found in river sands , through ion @-@ exchange . Newer ion @-@ exchange and solvent @-@ extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths , which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production . The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China . In these , where about two @-@ thirds of the total rare @-@ earth content is yttrium , thulium is about 0 @.@ 5 % ( or about tied with lutetium for rarity ) . The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container . None of thulium 's natural compounds are commercially important . Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced . In 1996 , thulium oxide cost US $ 20 per gram , and in 2005 , 99 % <unk> thulium metal powder cost US $ 70 per gram .

 = = = X @-@ ray source = = = 
 Despite its high cost , portable X @-@ ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source . These sources have a useful life of about one year , as tools in medical and dental diagnosis , as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components . Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead . 
 Thulium @-@ 170 is gaining popularity as an X @-@ ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy . This isotope has a half @-@ life of 128 @.@ 6 days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity ( at 7 @.@ 4 , 51 @.@ 354 , 52 @.@ 389 , 59 @.@ 4 and 84 @.@ 253 keV ) . Thulium @-@ 170 is one of the four most popular radioisotopes for use in industrial radiography . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 Thulium has been used in high @-@ temperature superconductors similarly to yttrium . Thulium potentially has use in ferrites , ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment . Thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum , in this case , its green emission lines , which are not covered by other elements . Because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light , thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting . The blue fluorescence of Tm @-@ doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation . 
 = = Biological role and precautions = = 
 There is only a very small amount of thulium in the human body , but the exact amount is unknown . Thulium has not been observed to have a biological role , but small amounts of soluble thulium salts stimulate metabolism . Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic , but insoluble thulium salts are completely nontoxic . When injected , thulium can cause degeneration of the liver and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate . Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice . Despite this , thulium has a low level of toxicity . In humans , thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver , kidneys and bones . Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year . The roots of plants do not take up thulium , and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium . Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions . Radioactive thulium isotopes can cause radiation poisoning . 
 = Pitru Paksha = 
 Pitru Paksha ( Sanskrit : <unk> <unk> ् <unk> ) , also spelt as Pitru paksha or Pitri paksha , ( literally " fortnight of the ancestors " ) is a 16 – lunar day period in Hindu calendar when Hindus pay homage to their ancestor ( Pitrs ) , especially through food offerings . The period is also known as Pitru <unk> , Pitri <unk> , Sola Shraddha ( " sixteen <unk> " ) , <unk> , <unk> , Mahalaya Paksha and <unk> paksha . 
 Pitru Paksha is considered by Hindus to be inauspicious , given the death rite performed during the ceremony , known as Shraddha or tarpan . In southern and western India , it falls in the 2nd paksha ( forthnight ) Hindu lunar month of Bhadrapada ( September ) and follows the forthnight immediately after the Ganesh festival . It begins on the <unk> ( first day of the forthnight ) ending with the new moon day known as Sarvapitri amavasya , Pitru Amavasya , <unk> Amavasya , Mahalaya amavasya or simply Mahalaya . Most years , the autumnal equinox falls within this period , i.e. the Sun transitions from the northern to the southern hemisphere during this period . In North India and Nepal , and cultures following the <unk> calendar or the solar calendar , this period may correspond to the waning fortnight of the <unk> @-@ solar month Ashvin , instead of Bhadrapada . 
 = = Legend = = 
 According to Hinduism , the souls of three preceding generations of one 's ancestor reside in Pitru – loka , a realm between heaven and earth . This realm is governed by Yama , the god of death , who takes the soul of a dying man from earth to Pitru – loka . When a person of the next generation dies , the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God , so Shraddha offerings are not given . Thus , only the three generations in Pitru – loka are given Shraddha rites , in which Yama plays a significant role . According to the sacred Hindu epics ( <unk> ) , at the beginning of Pitru Paksha , the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra ( <unk> ) . Coinciding with this moment , it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru – loka and reside in their descendants ' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiac — Scorpio ( <unk> ) — and there is a full moon . Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half , during the dark fortnight . 
 When Karna , the brave warrior whose acts of giving are legendary even today , died in the epic Mahabharata war , his soul transcended to heaven , where he was offered gold and jewels as food . However , Karna needed real food to eat and asked Indra , the lord of heaven , the reason for serving gold as food . Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life , but had never donated food to his ancestors in Shraddha . Karna said that since he was unaware of his ancestors , he never donated anything in their memory . To make amends , Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15 – day period , so that he could perform Shraddha and donate food and water in their memory . This period is now known as Pitru Paksha . In some legends , Yama replaces Indra . 
 = = Significance = = 
 The performance of Shraddha by a son during Pitru Paksha is regarded as compulsory by Hindus , to ensure that the soul of the ancestor goes to heaven . In this context , the scripture Garuda Purana says , " there is no salvation for a man without a son " . The scriptures preach that a householder should propitiate ancestors ( <unk> ) , along with the gods ( devas ) , ghosts ( bhutas ) and guests . The scripture Markandeya Purana says that if the ancestors are content with the <unk> , they will bestow health , wealth , knowledge and longevity , and ultimately heaven and salvation ( moksha ) upon the performer . 
 The performance of Sarvapitri amavasya rites can also compensate a forgotten or neglected annual Shraddha ceremony , which should ideally coincide with the death anniversary of the deceased . According to Sharma , the ceremony is central to the concept of lineages . Shraddha involves oblations to three preceding generations — by reciting their names — as well as to the mythical lineage ancestor ( gotra ) . A person thus gets to know the names of six generations ( three preceding generation , his own and two succeeding generations — his sons and grandsons ) in his life , reaffirming lineage ties . Anthropologist Usha Menon of Drexel University presents a similar idea — that Pitru Paksha emphasises the fact that the ancestors and the current generation and their next unborn generation are connected by blood ties . The current generation repays their debt to the ancestors in the Pitru Paksha . This debt is considered of utmost importance along with a person 's debt to his gurus and his parents .

 = = = When and where = = = 
 The shraddha is performed on the specific lunar day during the Pitru Paksha , when the ancestor — usually a parent or paternal grandparent — died . There are exceptions to the lunar day rule ; special days are allotted for people who died in a particular manner or had a certain status in life . <unk> Bharani and Bharani Panchami , the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively , are allocated for people deceased in the past year . <unk> <unk> ( " <unk> ninth " ) , the ninth lunar day , is for married women who died before their husband . Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife 's shraddha . The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures . The fourteenth day is known as Ghata <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and is reserved for those people killed by arms , in war or suffered a violent death . 
 Sarvapitri amavasya ( all ancestors ' new moon day ) is intended for all ancestors , irrespective of the lunar day they died . It is the most important day of the Pitru Paksha . Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha can do so on this day . A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya , which is seen as a special place to perform the rite , and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period . In Bengal , Mahalaya ( Bengali : <unk> ় <unk> ) marks the beginning of Durga Puja festivities . Mahalaya is the day when the goddess Durga is believed to have descended to Earth . Bengali people traditionally wake up early in the morning at around 4 am on Mahalaya to listens to the enchanting voice of the late <unk> Krishna Bhadra and the late Pankaj Kumar <unk> on All India Radio as they recite hymns from the scriptures from the Devi Mahatmyam ( Chandi Path ) . This program has almost become synonymous with Mahalaya for almost nearly six decades now . Offerings to the ancestors are made in homes and at puja <unk> ( temporary shrines ) . <unk> ( " Mother 's father " ) or <unk> ( " Daughter 's son " ) also marks the first day of the month of Ashvin and beginning of the bright fortnight . It is assigned for the grandson of the deceased maternal grandfather . 
 The ritual is also held on the death anniversary of the ancestor . The shraddha is performed only at noon , usually on the bank of a river or lake or at one 's own house . Families may also make a pilgrimage to places like Varanasi and Gaya to perform Shraddha . An annual Pitri Paksha Mela at Gaya on the banks of River <unk> . Pilgrims from all corners of the country visit Gaya for offering <unk> to their Ancestors . According to Bihar Tourism Department estimates , some 5 @,@ 00 @,@ 000 to 75 @,@ 00 @,@ 000 pilgrims arrive in the Gaya city during the Pitri Paksha Mela every year .

 It is essential that Shraddha be performed by the son — usually the eldest — or male relative of the paternal branch of the family , limited to the preceding three generations . However , on Sarvapitri amavasya or <unk> , the daughter 's son can offer Shraddha for the maternal side of his family if a male heir is absent in his mother 's family . Some castes only perform the shraddha for one generation . Prior to performing the rite , the male should have experienced a sacred thread ceremony . Since the ceremony is considered inauspicious due to its association with death , the royal family of Kutch , the king or heirs of the throne are prohibited from conducting Shraddha .

 The food offerings made to the ancestors are usually cooked in silver or copper vessels and typically placed on a banana leaf or cups made of dried leaves . The food must include Kheer ( a type of sweet rice and milk ) , <unk> ( a sweet porridge made of wheat grains ) , rice , dal ( lentils ) , the vegetable of spring bean ( <unk> ) and a yellow gourd ( pumpkin ) .

 The male who performs the shraddha should take a purifying bath beforehand and is expected to wear a dhoti . He wears a ring of <unk> grass . Then the ancestors are invoked to reside in the ring . The shraddha is usually performed bare @-@ chested , as the position of the sacred thread worn by him needs to be changed multiple times during the ceremony . The shraddha involves <unk> @-@ <unk> , which is an offering to the ancestors of <unk> ( cooked rice and barley flour balls mixed with ghee and black sesame seeds ) , accompanying the release of water from the hand . It is followed by the worship of Vishnu in form of the <unk> grass , a gold image or Shaligram stone and Yama . The food offering is then made , cooked especially for the ceremony on the roof . The offering is considered to be accepted if a crow arrives and devours the food ; the bird is believed to be a messenger from Yama or the spirit of the ancestors . A cow and a dog are also fed , and Brahmin priests are also offered food . Once the ancestors ( crow ) and Brahmins have eaten , the family members can begin lunch .

 Some families also conduct ritual recitals of scriptures such the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita . Others may be charitable and present gifts to the priests or pay them to recite prayers for the ancestor 's well @-@ being . 
 = Medieval cuisine = 
 Medieval cuisine includes the foods , eating habits , and cooking methods of various European cultures during the Middle Ages , a period roughly dating from the 5th to the 15th century . During this period , diets and cooking changed less across Europe than they did in the far briefer early modern period that followed , when those changes helped lay the foundations for modern European cuisine . Cereals remained the most important staple during the early Middle Ages as rice was a late introduction to Europe , and the potato was only introduced in 1536 , with a much later date for widespread consumption . Barley , oat and rye among the poor , and wheat for the governing classes , were eaten as bread , porridge , gruel and pasta by all of society 's members . Fava beans and vegetables were important supplements to the cereal @-@ based diet of the lower orders . ( <unk> beans , today the " common bean , " were of New World origin and were introduced after the Columbian Exchange in the 16th century . ) 
 Meat was more expensive and therefore more prestigious . Game , a form of meat acquired from hunting , was common only on the nobility 's tables . The most prevalent butcher 's meats were pork , chicken and other domestic fowl ; beef , which required greater investment in land , was less common . Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations ; dried , smoked or salted they made their way far inland , but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten . 
 Slow transportation and food preservation techniques ( based on drying , salting , smoking and pickling ) made long @-@ distance trade of many foods very expensive . Because of this , the food of the nobility was more prone to foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor ; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports . As each level of society imitated the one above it , innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities . Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices , decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches . Social norms also dictated that the food of the working class be less refined , since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one 's labour and one 's food ; manual labour required coarser , cheaper food . 
 A type of refined cooking developed in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe . Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet @-@ sour repertory typical of upper @-@ class medieval food included verjuice , wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper , saffron and ginger . These , along with the widespread use of sugar or honey , gave many dishes a sweet @-@ sour flavour . Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups , stews , and sauces , particularly as almond milk . 
 = = Dietary norms = = 
 The cuisines of the cultures of the Mediterranean Basin had since antiquity been based on cereals , particularly various types of wheat . Porridge , gruel and later , bread , became the basic food staple that made up the majority of calorie intake for most of the population . From the 8th to the 11th centuries , the proportion of various cereals in the diet rose from about 1 ⁄ 3 to 3 ⁄ 4 . Dependence on wheat remained significant throughout the medieval era , and spread northwards with the rise of Christianity . In colder climates , however , it was usually unaffordable for the majority population , and was associated with the higher classes . The centrality of bread in religious rituals such as the Eucharist meant that it enjoyed an especially high prestige among foodstuffs . Only ( olive ) oil and wine had a comparable value , but both remained quite exclusive outside the warmer <unk> and olive @-@ growing regions . The symbolic role of bread as both sustenance and substance is illustrated in a sermon given by Saint Augustine : 
 This bread retells your history … You were brought to the threshing floor of the Lord and were threshed … While awaiting catechism , you were like grain kept in the granary … At the baptismal font you were kneaded into a single dough . In the oven of the Holy Ghost you were baked into God 's true bread . 
 = = = The Church = = = 
 The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches and their calendars had great influence on eating habits ; consumption of meat was forbidden for a full third of the year for most Christians , and all animal products , including eggs and dairy products ( but not fish ) , were generally prohibited during Lent and fast . Additionally , it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist , and these fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence . 
 Both the Eastern and the Western churches ordained that feast should alternate with fast . In most of Europe , Fridays were fast days , and fasting was observed on various other days and periods , including Lent and Advent . Meat , and animal products such as milk , cheese , butter and eggs , were not allowed , only fish . The fast was intended to mortify the body and invigorate the soul , and also to remind the faster of Christ 's sacrifice for humanity . The intention was not to portray certain foods as unclean , but rather to teach a spiritual lesson in self @-@ restraint through abstention . During particularly severe fast days , the number of daily meals was also reduced to one . Even if most people respected these restrictions and usually made penance when they violated them , there were also numerous ways of circumventing them , a conflict of ideals and practice summarized by writer Bridget Ann <unk> : 
 It is the nature of man to build the most complicated cage of rules and regulations in which to trap himself , and then , with equal ingenuity and zest , to bend his brain to the problem of wriggling triumphantly out again . Lent was a challenge ; the game was to ferret out the loopholes . 
 While animal products were to be avoided during times of penance , pragmatic compromises often prevailed . The definition of " fish " was often extended to marine and semi @-@ aquatic animals such as whales , barnacle geese , puffins and even beavers . The choice of ingredients may have been limited , but that did not mean that meals were smaller . Neither were there any restrictions against ( moderate ) drinking or eating sweets . Banquets held on fish days could be splendid , and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat , cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways ; fish could be moulded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking them in coals . While Byzantine church officials took a hard @-@ line approach , and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy , their Western counterparts were far more lenient . There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigours of fasting among the laity . During Lent , kings and schoolboys , commoners and nobility , all complained about being deprived of meat for the long , hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins . At Lent , owners of livestock were even warned to keep an eye out for hungry dogs frustrated by a " hard siege by Lent and fish bones " . 
 The trend from the 13th century onward was toward a more legalistic interpretation of fasting . Nobles were careful not to eat meat on fast days , but still dined in style ; fish replaced meat , often as imitation hams and bacon ; almond milk replaced animal milk as an expensive non @-@ dairy alternative ; faux eggs made from almond milk were cooked in blown @-@ out eggshells , flavoured and coloured with exclusive spices . In some cases the lavishness of noble tables was outdone by Benedictine monasteries , which served as many as sixteen courses during certain feast days . Exceptions from fasting were frequently made for very broadly defined groups . Thomas Aquinas ( c . 1225 – 1274 ) believed dispensation should be provided for children , the old , pilgrims , workers and beggars , but not the poor as long as they had some sort of shelter . There are many accounts of members of monastic orders who flouted fasting restrictions through clever interpretations of the Bible . Since the sick were exempt from fasting , there often evolved the notion that fasting restrictions only applied to the main dining area , and many Benedictine friars would simply eat their fast day meals in what was called the misericord ( at those times ) rather than the refectory . Newly assigned Catholic monastery officials sought to amend the problem of fast evasion not merely with moral condemnations , but by making sure that well @-@ prepared non @-@ meat dishes were available on fast days . 
 = = = Class constraints = = = 
 Medieval society was highly stratified . In a time when famine was commonplace and social hierarchies were often brutally enforced , food was an important marker of social status in a way that has no equivalent today in most developed countries . According to the ideological norm , society consisted of the three estates of the realm : commoners , that is , the working classes — by far the largest group ; the clergy , and the nobility . The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical , with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners . Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes , bishops and their subordinates , such as priests . One was expected to remain in one 's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes . Political power was displayed not just by rule , but also by displaying wealth . Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices , and displayed refined table manners ; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread , salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette . Even dietary recommendations were different : the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality . The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods . 
 In the late Middle Ages , the increasing wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy , and threatened to break down some of the symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes . The response came in two forms : didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one 's class , and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners ' banquets . 
 = = = Dietetics = = = 
 Medical science of the Middle Ages had a considerable influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes . One 's lifestyle — including diet , exercise , appropriate social behavior , and approved medical remedies — was the way to good health , and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person 's health . All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry , according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century . 
 Medieval scholars considered human digestion to be a process similar to cooking . The processing of food in the stomach was seen as a continuation of the preparation initiated by the cook . In order for the food to be properly " cooked " and for the nutrients to be properly absorbed , it was important that the stomach be filled in an appropriate manner . Easily digestible foods would be consumed first , followed by gradually heavier dishes . If this regimen were not respected it was believed that heavy foods would sink to the bottom of the stomach , thus blocking the digestion duct , so that food would digest very slowly and cause putrefaction of the body and draw bad humours into the stomach . It was also of vital importance that food of differing properties not be mixed . 
 Before a meal , the stomach would preferably be " opened " with an apéritif ( from Latin <unk> , " to open " ) that was preferably of a hot and dry nature : confections made from <unk> or honey @-@ coated spices like ginger , caraway and seeds of anise , fennel or cumin , wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks . As the stomach had been opened , it should then be " closed " at the end of the meal with the help of a digestive , most commonly a <unk> , which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar , or hypocras , a wine flavoured with fragrant spices , along with aged cheese . A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit , such as apples . It would then be followed by vegetables such as lettuce , cabbage , purslane , herbs , moist fruits , light meats , such as chicken or goat kid , with potages and <unk> . After that came the " heavy " meats , such as pork and beef , as well as vegetables and nuts , including pears and chestnuts , both considered difficult to digest . It was popular , and recommended by medical expertise , to finish the meal with aged cheese and various <unk> . 
 The most ideal food was that which most closely matched the humour of human beings , i.e. moderately warm and moist . Food should preferably also be finely chopped , ground , pounded and strained to achieve a true mixture of all the ingredients . White wine was believed to be cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar . Milk was moderately warm and moist , but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ . Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist . Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine . Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare , there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef . 
 = = = Caloric structure = = = 
 The caloric content and structure of medieval diet varied over time , from region to region , and between classes . However , for most people , the diet tended to be high @-@ carbohydrate , with most of the budget spent on , and the majority of calories provided by , cereals and alcohol ( such as beer ) . Even though meat was highly valued by all , lower classes often could not afford , nor were they allowed by the church to consume it every day . In England in the 13th century , meat contributed a negligible portion of calories to a typical harvest worker 's diet ; however , its share increased after the Black Death and , by the 15th century , it provided about 20 % of the total . Even among the lay nobility of medieval England , grain provided 65 – 70 % of calories in the early 14th century , though a generous provision of meat and fish was included , and their consumption of meat increased in the aftermath of the Black Death as well . In one early 15th @-@ century English aristocratic household for which detailed records are available ( that of the Earl of Warwick ) , gentle members of the household received a staggering 3 @.@ 8 pounds ( 1 @.@ 7 kg ) of assorted meats in a typical meat meal in the autumn and 2 @.@ 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) in the winter , in addition to 0 @.@ 9 pounds ( 0 @.@ 41 kg ) of bread and 1 ⁄ 4 imperial gallon ( 1 @.@ 1 L ; 0 @.@ 30 US gal ) of beer or possibly wine ( and there would have been two meat meals per day , five days a week , except during Lent ) . In the household of Henry Stafford in 1469 , gentle members received 2 @.@ 1 pounds ( 0 @.@ 95 kg ) of meat per meal , and all others received 1 @.@ 04 pounds ( 0 @.@ 47 kg ) , and everyone was given 0 @.@ 4 pounds ( 0 @.@ 18 kg ) of bread and 1 ⁄ 4 imperial gallon ( 1 @.@ 1 L ; 0 @.@ 30 US gal ) of alcohol . On top of these quantities , some members of these households ( usually , a minority ) ate breakfast , which would not include any meat , but would probably include another 1 ⁄ 4 imperial gallon ( 1 @.@ 1 L ; 0 @.@ 30 US gal ) of beer ; and uncertain quantities of bread and ale could have been consumed in between meals . The diet of the lord of the household differed somewhat from this structure , including less red meat , more high @-@ quality wild game , fresh fish , fruit , and wine . 
 In monasteries , the basic structure of the diet was laid down by the Rule of Saint Benedict in the 7th century and tightened by Pope Benedict XII in 1336 , but ( as mentioned above ) monks were adept at " working around " these rules . Wine was restricted to about 10 imperial fluid ounces ( 280 mL ; 9 @.@ 6 US fl oz ) per day , but there was no corresponding limit on beer , and , at Westminster Abbey , each monk was given an allowance of 1 imperial gallon ( 4 @.@ 5 L ; 1 @.@ 2 US gal ) of beer per day . Meat of " four @-@ footed animals " was prohibited altogether , year @-@ round , for everyone but the very weak and the sick . This was circumvented in part by declaring that offal , and various processed foods such as bacon , were not meat . Secondly , Benedictine monasteries contained a room called the misericord , where the Rule of Saint Benedict did not apply , and where a large number of monks ate . Each monk would be regularly sent either to the misericord or to the refectory . When Pope Benedict XII ruled that at least half of all monks should be required to eat in the refectory on any given day , monks responded by excluding the sick and those invited to the abbot 's table from the reckoning . Overall , a monk at Westminster Abbey in the late 15th century would have been allowed 2 @.@ 25 pounds ( 1 @.@ 02 kg ) of bread per day ; 5 eggs per day , except on Fridays and in Lent ; 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 91 kg ) of meat per day , 4 days / week ( excluding Wednesday , Friday , and Saturday ) , except in Advent and Lent ; and 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 91 kg ) of fish per day , 3 days / week and every day during Advent and Lent . This caloric structure partly reflected the high @-@ class status of late Medieval monasteries in England , and partly that of Westminster Abbey , which was one of the richest monasteries in the country ; diets of monks in other monasteries may have been more modest . 
 The overall caloric intake is subject to some debate . One typical estimate is that an adult peasant male needed 2 @,@ 900 calories ( 12 @,@ 000 kJ ) per day , and an adult female needed 2 @,@ 150 calories ( 9 @,@ 000 kJ ) . Both lower and higher estimates have been proposed . Those engaged in particularly heavy physical labor , as well as sailors and soldiers , may have consumed 3 @,@ 500 calories ( 15 @,@ 000 kJ ) or more per day . Intakes of aristocrats may have reached 4 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 calories ( 17 @,@ 000 to 21 @,@ 000 kJ ) per day . Monks consumed 6 @,@ 000 calories ( 25 @,@ 000 kJ ) per day on " normal " days , and 4 @,@ 500 calories ( 19 @,@ 000 kJ ) per day when fasting . As a consequence of these excesses , obesity was common among upper classes . Monks especially frequently suffered from obesity @-@ related ( in some cases ) conditions such as arthritis . 
 = = Regional variation = = 
 The regional specialties that are a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives . Instead , medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and , later , national boundaries . Geographical variation in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate , political administration , and local customs that varied across the continent . Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided , more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned . In the British Isles , northern France , the Low Countries , the northern German @-@ speaking areas , Scandinavia and the Baltic , the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives . In the south , wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike ( though the commoner usually had to settle for cheap second pressing wine ) while beer was the commoner 's drink in the north and wine an expensive import . Citrus fruits ( though not the kinds most common today ) and pomegranates were common around in the Mediterranean . Dried figs and dates were available in the north , but were used rather sparingly in cooking . 
 Olive oil was a ubiquitous ingredient in Mediterranean cultures , but remained an expensive import in the north where oils of poppy , walnut , hazel and filbert were the most affordable alternatives . Butter and lard , especially after the terrible mortality during the Black Death made them less scarce , were used in considerable quantities in the northern and northwestern regions , especially in the Low Countries . Almost universal in middle and upper class cooking all over Europe was the almond , which was in the ubiquitous and highly versatile almond milk , which was used as a substitute in dishes that otherwise required eggs or milk , though the bitter variety of almonds came along much later . 
 = = Meals = = 
 In Europe there were typically two meals a day : dinner at mid @-@ day and a lighter supper in the evening . The two @-@ meal system remained consistent throughout the late Middle Ages . Smaller intermediate meals were common , but became a matter of social status , as those who did not have to perform manual labor could go without them . <unk> frowned on breaking the overnight fast too early , and members of the church and cultivated gentry avoided it . For practical reasons , breakfast was still eaten by working men , and was tolerated for young children , women , the elderly and the sick . Because the church preached against gluttony and other weaknesses of the flesh , men tended to be ashamed of the weak practicality of breakfast . Lavish dinner banquets and late @-@ night <unk> ( from Occitan <unk> @-@ <unk> , " late supper " ) with considerable amounts of alcoholic beverage were considered immoral . The latter were especially associated with gambling , crude language , drunkenness , and lewd behavior . Minor meals and snacks were common ( although also disliked by the church ) , and working men commonly received an allowance from their employers in order to buy <unk> , small morsels to be eaten during breaks . 
 = = = Etiquette = = = 
 As with almost every part of life at the time , a medieval meal was generally a communal affair . The entire household , including servants , would ideally dine together . To sneak off to enjoy private company was considered a haughty and inefficient egotism in a world where people depended very much on each other . In the 13th century , English bishop Robert Grosseteste advised the Countess of Lincoln : " forbid dinners and suppers out of hall , in secret and in private rooms , for from this arises waste and no honour to the lord and lady . " He also recommended watching that the servants not make off with leftovers to make merry at <unk> @-@ suppers , rather than giving it as alms . Towards the end of the Middle Ages , the wealthy increasingly sought to escape this regime of stern collectivism . When possible , rich hosts retired with their consorts to private chambers where the meal could be enjoyed in greater exclusivity and privacy . Being invited to a lord 's chambers was a great privilege and could be used as a way to reward friends and allies and to awe subordinates . It allowed lords to distance themselves further from the household and to enjoy more luxurious treats while serving inferior food to the rest of the household that still dined in the great hall . At major occasions and banquets , however , the host and hostess generally dined in the great hall with the other diners . Although there are descriptions of dining etiquette on special occasions , less is known about the details of day @-@ to @-@ day meals of the elite or about the table manners of the common people and the destitute . However , it can be assumed there were no such extravagant luxuries as multiple courses , luxurious spices or hand @-@ washing in scented water in everyday meals . 
 Things were different for the wealthy . Before the meal and between courses , shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests so they could wash their hands , as cleanliness was emphasized . Social codes made it difficult for women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal , so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very little at such feasts . She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done . Overall , fine dining was a predominantly male affair , and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting . The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher , the younger to assist the elder , and men to spare women the risk of <unk> dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion . Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table , as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one 's fellow diners . 
 Food was mostly served on plates or in stew pots , and diners would take their share from the dishes and place it on trenchers of stale bread , wood or pewter with the help of spoons or bare hands . In lower @-@ class households it was common to eat food straight off the table . Knives were used at the table , but most people were expected to bring their own , and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife . A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest , unless one was of very high rank or well @-@ acquainted with the host . Forks for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the early modern period , and early on were limited to Italy . Even there it was not until the 14th century that the fork became common among Italians of all social classes . The change in attitudes can be illustrated by the reactions to the table manners of the Byzantine princess Theodora Doukaina in the late 11th century . She was the wife of Domenico Selvo , the Doge of Venice , and caused considerable dismay among upstanding Venetians . The foreign consort 's insistence on having her food cut up by her eunuch servants and then eating the pieces with a golden fork shocked and upset the diners so much that there was a claim that Peter Damian , Cardinal Bishop of Ostia , later interpreted her refined foreign manners as pride and referred to her as " ... the Venetian Doge 's wife , whose body , after her excessive delicacy , entirely rotted away . " However this is ambiguous since Peter Damian died in 1072 or 1073 , and their marriage ( Theodora and Domenico ) took place in 1075 . 
 = = Food preparation = = 
 All types of cooking involved the direct use of fire . Kitchen stoves did not appear until the 18th century , and cooks had to know how to cook directly over an open fire . Ovens were used , but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries . It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private . There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals , and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns . But for most people , almost all cooking was done in simple <unk> , since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices , making potages and stews the most common dishes . Overall , most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content , or at least when fat could be afforded . This was considered less of a problem in a time of back @-@ breaking toil , famine , and a greater acceptance — even desirability — of <unk> ; only the poor or sick , and devout ascetics , were thin . 
 Fruit was readily combined with meat , fish and eggs . The recipe for Tart de <unk> , a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury , includes a mix of figs , raisins , apples and pears with fish ( salmon , codling or haddock ) and pitted damson plums under the top crust . It was considered important to make sure that the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics . This meant that food had to be " tempered " according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients , condiments and spices ; fish was seen as being cold and moist , and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it , such as frying or oven baking , and seasoned with hot and dry spices ; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled ; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted . In some recipe collections , alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste . In a recipe for quince pie , cabbage is said to work equally well , and in another turnips could be replaced by pears . 
 The completely edible shortcrust pie did not appear in recipes until the 15th century . Before that the pastry was primarily used as a cooking container in a technique known as ' huff paste ' . Extant recipe collections show that gastronomy in the Late Middle Ages developed significantly . New techniques , like the shortcrust pie and the clarification of jelly with egg whites began to appear in recipes in the late 14th century and recipes began to include detailed instructions instead of being mere memory aids to an already skilled cook . 
 = = = Medieval kitchens = = = 
 In most households , cooking was done on an open hearth in the middle of the main living area , to make efficient use of the heat . This was the most common arrangement , even in wealthy households , for most of the Middle Ages , where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall . Towards the Late Middle Ages a separate kitchen area began to evolve . The first step was to move the fireplaces towards the walls of the main hall , and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area , often separated from the main building by a covered arcade . This way , the smoke , odors and bustle of the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests , and the fire risk lessened . 
 Many basic variations of cooking utensils available today , such as frying pans , pots , kettles , and waffle irons , already existed , although they were often too expensive for poorer households . Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes , and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen . There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire to keep them from burning or boiling over . Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods . To assist the cook there were also assorted knives , stirring spoons , ladles and graters . In wealthy households one of the most common tools was the mortar and sieve cloth , since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped , mashed , strained and seasoned either before or after cooking . This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food , the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment . It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results . Fine @-@ textured food was also associated with wealth ; for example , finely milled flour was expensive , while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse . A typical procedure was <unk> ( from the Latin <unk> , " to cram " ) , to skin and dress an animal , grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin , or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal . 
 The kitchen staff of huge noble or royal courts occasionally numbered in the hundreds : <unk> , bakers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , butchers , carvers , page boys , milkmaids , butlers and numerous <unk> . While an average peasant household often made do with firewood collected from the surrounding woodlands , the major kitchens of households had to cope with the logistics of daily providing at least two meals for several hundred people . Guidelines on how to prepare for a two @-@ day banquet can be found in the cookbook Du fait de cuisine ( " On cookery " ) written in 1420 in part to compete with the court of Burgundy by Maistre <unk> , master chef of Amadeus VIII , Duke of Savoy . <unk> recommends that the chief cook should have at hand at least 1 @,@ 000 cartloads of " good , dry firewood " and a large <unk> of coal . 
 = = = Preservation = = = 
 Food preservation methods were basically the same as had been used since antiquity , and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century . The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture , thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats ; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water @-@ dependent microorganisms that cause decay . In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun , and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds ( especially common for the preparation of stockfish ) , or in warm ovens , cellars , attics , and at times even in living quarters . Subjecting food to a number of chemical processes such as smoking , salting , <unk> , conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer . Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors . Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months . Butter tended to be heavily salted ( 5 – 10 % ) in order not to spoil . Vegetables , eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars , containing brine and acidic liquids ( lemon juice , verjuice or vinegar ) . Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat , in which it was then stored . Microbial modification was also encouraged , however , by a number of methods ; grains , fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens , and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk . 
 = = = Professional cooking = = = 
 The majority of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households . The norm was self @-@ sufficiency with only a small percentage of production being exported or sold in markets . Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel . The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups . Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth , and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking . Food from vendors was in such cases the only option . <unk> could either sell ready @-@ made hot food , an early form of fast food , or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients . Travellers , such as pilgrims en route to a holy site , made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them . For the more affluent , there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments : <unk> , pie bakers , saucers , <unk> , etc . Well @-@ off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet . 
 Urban <unk> that catered to workers or the destitute were regarded as unsavory and disreputable places by the well @-@ to @-@ do and professional cooks tended to have a bad reputation . Geoffrey Chaucer 's Hodge of Ware , the London cook from the Canterbury Tales , is described as a sleazy purveyor of unpalatable food . French cardinal Jacques de Vitry 's sermons from the early 13th century describe sellers of cooked meat as an outright health hazard . While the necessity of the cook 's services was occasionally recognized and appreciated , they were often disparaged since they catered to the baser of bodily human needs rather than spiritual betterment . The stereotypical cook in art and literature was male , hot @-@ tempered , prone to drunkenness , and often depicted guarding his stewpot from being pilfered by both humans and animals . In the early 15th century , the English monk John Lydgate articulated the beliefs of many of his contemporaries by proclaiming that " Hoot <unk> [ fire ] and smoke <unk> many an angry cook . " 
 = = Cereals = = 
 The period between c . 500 and 1300 saw a major change in diet that affected most of Europe . More intense agriculture on an ever @-@ increasing acreage resulted in a shift from animal products , like meat and dairy , to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population . Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes , especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow . A bread @-@ based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were <unk> or gruel @-@ based . <unk> bread was more common in wheat @-@ growing regions in the south , while unleavened flatbread of barley , rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions , and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops . 
 The most common grains were rye , barley , buckwheat , millet , and oats . Rice remained a fairly expensive import for most of the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only towards the end of the period . Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains , but was more prestigious and thus more expensive . The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes . As one descended the social ladder , bread became coarser , darker , and its bran content increased . In times of grain shortages or outright famine , grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts , dried legumes , acorns , ferns , and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter . 
 One of the most common constituents of a medieval meal , either as part of a banquet or as a small snack , were <unk> , pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine , soup , broth , or sauce could be soaked up and eaten . Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the <unk> , a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices . <unk> were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick , if boiled in milk ( or almond milk ) and sweetened with sugar . Pies filled with meats , eggs , vegetables , or fruit were common throughout Europe , as were turnovers , fritters , doughnuts , and many similar pastries . By the Late Middle Ages biscuits ( cookies in the U.S. ) and especially wafers , eaten for dessert , had become high @-@ prestige foods and came in many varieties . Grain , either as bread crumbs or flour , was also the most common thickener of soups and stews , alone or in combination with almond milk . 
 The importance of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers played a crucial role in any medieval community . Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century . Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar : around 1 to 1 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 2 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 3 lb ) of bread per person per day . Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers ' , and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable . The English Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size , weight , and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices . The baker 's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker 's Company by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker 's wife , house , and dog . Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet , swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense . Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating dough with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties . This gave rise to the " baker 's dozen " : a baker would give 13 for the price of 12 , to be certain of not being known as a cheat . 
 = = Fruit and vegetables = = 
 While grains were the primary constituent of most meals , vegetables such as cabbage , chard , onions , garlic and carrots were common foodstuffs . Many of these were eaten daily by peasants and workers , but were less prestigious than meat . The cookbooks , which appeared in the late Middle Ages and were intended mostly for those who could afford such luxuries , contained only a small number of recipes using vegetables as the main ingredient . The lack of recipes for many basic vegetable dishes , such as potages , has been interpreted not to mean that they were absent from the meals of the nobility , but rather that they were considered so basic that they did not require recording . Carrots were available in many variants during the Middle Ages : among them a tastier reddish @-@ purple variety and a less prestigious green @-@ yellow type . Various legumes , like chickpeas , fava beans and field peas were also common and important sources of protein , especially among the lower classes . With the exception of peas , legumes were often viewed with some suspicion by the dietitians advising the upper class , partly because of their tendency to cause flatulence but also because they were associated with the coarse food of peasants . The importance of vegetables to the common people is illustrated by accounts from 16th @-@ century Germany stating that many peasants ate sauerkraut from three to four times a day . 
 Fruit was popular and could be served fresh , dried , or preserved , and was a common ingredient in many cooked dishes . Since sugar and honey were both expensive , it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort . The fruits of choice in the south were lemons , <unk> , bitter oranges ( the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later ) , pomegranates , quinces , and , of course , grapes . Farther north , apples , pears , plums , and strawberries were more common . Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe , but remained rather expensive imports in the north . 
 Common and often basic ingredients in many modern European cuisines like potatoes , kidney beans , cacao , vanilla , tomatoes , chili peppers and maize were not available to Europeans until after 1492 , after European contact with the Americas , and even then it often took considerable time , sometimes several centuries , for the new foodstuffs to be accepted by society at large . 
 = = Dairy products = = 
 Milk was an important source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat . It would mostly come from cows , but milk from goats and sheep was also common . Plain fresh milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick , and was usually reserved for the very young or elderly . Poor adults would sometimes drink buttermilk or whey or milk that was soured or watered down . Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling . On occasion it was used in upper @-@ class kitchens in stews , but it was difficult to keep fresh in bulk and almond milk was generally used in its stead . 
 Cheese was far more important as a foodstuff , especially for common people , and it has been suggested that it was , during many periods , the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes . Many varieties of cheese eaten today , like Dutch Edam , Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan , were available and well known in late medieval times . There were also whey cheeses , like ricotta , made from by @-@ products of the production of harder cheeses . Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups , the latter being common fare in German @-@ speaking areas . Butter , another important dairy product , was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages , the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia . While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats , butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas . Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward . 
 = = Meats = = 
 While all forms of wild game were popular among those who could obtain it , most meat came from domestic animals . Domestic working animals that were no longer able to work were slaughtered but not particularly <unk> and therefore were less valued as meat . Beef was not as common as today because raising cattle was labor @-@ intensive , requiring pastures and feed , and oxen and cows were much more valuable as draught animals and for producing milk . Mutton and lamb were fairly common , especially in areas with a sizeable wool industry , as was veal . Far more common was pork , as domestic pigs required less attention and cheaper feed . Domestic pigs often ran freely even in towns and could be fed on just about any organic waste , and suckling pig was a sought @-@ after delicacy . Just about every part of the pig was eaten , including ears , snout , tail , tongue , and womb . Intestines , bladder and stomach could be used as casings for sausage or even illusion food such as giant eggs . Among the meats that today are rare or even considered inappropriate for human consumption are the hedgehog and porcupine , occasionally mentioned in late medieval recipe collections . Rabbits remained a rare and highly prized commodity . In England , they were deliberately introduced by the 13th century and their colonies were carefully protected . Further south , domesticated rabbits were commonly raised and bred both for their meat and fur . They were of particular value for monasteries , because newborn rabbits were allegedly declared fish ( or , at least , not @-@ meat ) by the church and therefore they could be eaten during Lent . 
 A wide range of birds were eaten , including swans , peafowl , quail , partridge , storks , cranes , larks , linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets , and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted . Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent , but were only eaten by the social elite , and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes , entremets , than for their meat . As today , geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken , the fowl equivalent of the pig . Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds , but by growing in barnacles , and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent . But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran ( 1215 ) , Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent , arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds . 
 Meats were more expensive than plant foods . Though rich in protein , the calorie @-@ to @-@ weight ratio of meat was less than that of plant food . Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread . Fish was up to 16 times as costly , and was expensive even for coastal populations . This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs . It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people . The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage , meaning that wages dramatically increased . It also left vast areas of farmland untended , making them available for pasture and putting more meat on the market . 
 = = = Fish and seafood = = = 
 Although less prestigious than other animal meats , and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days , seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations . " Fish " to the medieval person was also a general name for anything not considered a proper land @-@ living animal , including marine mammals such as whales and porpoises . Also included were the beaver , due to its scaly tail and considerable time spent in water , and barnacle geese , due to the belief that they developed underwater in the form of barnacles . Such foods were also considered appropriate for fast days , though rather contrived classification of barnacle geese as fish was not universally accepted . The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird @-@ like embryo in them , and the secretary of Leo of <unk> wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served barnacle goose at a fish @-@ day dinner in 1456 . 
 Especially important was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea . The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe , and it was one of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League , a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds . <unk> made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople . While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh , a large proportion was salted , dried , and , to a lesser extent , smoked . <unk> , cod that was split down the middle , fixed to a pole and dried , was very common , though preparation could be time @-@ consuming , and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water . A wide range of mollusks including oysters , mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river @-@ dwelling populations , and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days . Compared to meat , fish was much more expensive for inland populations , especially in Central Europe , and therefore not an option for most . Freshwater fish such as pike , carp , bream , perch , lamprey , and trout were common . 
 = = Drink = = 
 In modern times , water is seen as a common choice to drink with a meal . In the Middle Ages , however , concerns over purity , medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored , and alcoholic beverages were always preferred . They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water , with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content . Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated . Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it , and far less common among peasants and workers . The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale . 
 Juices , as well as wines , of a multitude of fruits and berries had been known at least since Roman antiquity and were still consumed in the Middle Ages : pomegranate , mulberry and blackberry wines , <unk> , and cider which was especially popular in the north where both apples and pears were plentiful . Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include <unk> from wild plums ( modern @-@ day <unk> ) , mulberry gin and blackberry wine . Many variants of mead have been found in medieval recipes , with or without alcoholic content . However , the honey @-@ based drink became less common as a table beverage towards the end of the period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use . Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs . This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions . When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state , mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift . It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties , though in limited quantity due to its high price . In medieval Poland , mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries , such as spices and wines . <unk> , the fermented milk of mares or camels , was known in Europe , but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians . 
 Plain milk was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick , being reserved for the very young or elderly , and then usually as buttermilk or whey . Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products because of the lack of technology to keep it from spoiling . Tea and coffee , both made from plants found in the Old World , were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages . However , neither of these non @-@ alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century . 
 = = = Wine = = = 
 Wine was commonly drunk and was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice . According to Galen 's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down . Unlike water or beer , which were considered cold and moist , consumption of wine in moderation ( especially red wine ) was , among other things , believed to aid digestion , generate good blood and brighten the mood . The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage , the type of grape and more importantly , the number of grape pressings . The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes . The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content . Common folk usually had to settle for a cheap white or rosé from a second or even third pressing , meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication . For the poorest ( or the most pious ) , watered @-@ down vinegar ( similar to Ancient Roman <unk> ) would often be the only available choice . 
 The aging of high quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment , and resulted in an even more expensive end product . Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad , preservation must have been a widespread problem . Even if vinegar was a common ingredient , there was only so much of it that could be used . In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine ; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective <unk> , even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time . <unk> or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent , but was also considered especially healthy by physicians . Wine was believed to act as a kind of <unk> and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body , and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome . <unk> wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary ( red ) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger , cardamom , pepper , grains of paradise , nutmeg , cloves and sugar . These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and <unk> . By the 14th century , bagged spice mixes could be bought ready @-@ made from spice merchants . 
 = = = Beer = = = 
 While wine was the most common table beverage in much of Europe , this was not the case in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated . Those who could afford it drank imported wine , but even for nobility in these areas it was common to drink beer or ale , particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages . In England , the Low Countries , northern Germany , Poland and Scandinavia , beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes and age groups . By the mid @-@ 15th century , barley , a cereal known to be somewhat poorly suited for <unk> but excellent for brewing , accounted for 27 % of all cereal acreage in England . However , the heavy influence from Arab and Mediterranean culture on medical science ( particularly due to the Reconquista and the influx of Arabic texts ) meant that beer was often heavily disfavored . For most medieval Europeans , it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients , such as wine , lemons and olive oil . Even comparatively exotic products like camel 's milk and gazelle meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts . Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities . In 1256 , the Sienese physician <unk> described beer in the following way : 
 But from whichever it is made , whether from oats , barley or wheat , it harms the head and the stomach , it causes bad breath and ruins the teeth , it fills the stomach with bad fumes , and as a result anyone who drinks it along with wine becomes drunk quickly ; but it does have the property of facilitating urination and makes one 's flesh white and smooth . 
 The intoxicating effect of beer was believed to last longer than that of wine , but it was also admitted that it did not create the " false thirst " associated with wine . Though less prominent than in the north , beer was consumed in northern France and the Italian mainland . Perhaps as a consequence of the Norman conquest and the travelling of nobles between France and England , one French variant described in the 14th century cookbook Le <unk> de Paris was called <unk> ( most likely a direct borrowing from the English " good ale " ) and was made from barley and spelt , but without hops . In England there were also the variants <unk> ale , made from hot milk and cold ale , and <unk> or <unk> , a spiced ale prepared much like hypocras . 
 That hops could be used for flavoring beer had been known at least since Carolingian times , but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions . Before the widespread use of hops , <unk> , a mix of various herbs , had been used . <unk> had the same preserving properties as hops , though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it , and the end result was much more variable . Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content , but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant . Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century ; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249 , and possibly much earlier . 
 Before hops became popular as an ingredient , it was difficult to preserve this beverage for any time , and so , it was mostly consumed fresh . It was unfiltered , and therefore cloudy , and likely had a lower alcohol content than the typical modern equivalent . Quantities of beer consumed by medieval residents of Europe , as recorded in contemporary literature , far exceed intakes in the modern world . For example , sailors in 16th century England and Denmark received a ration of 1 imperial gallon ( 4 @.@ 5 L ; 1 @.@ 2 US gal ) of beer per day . Polish peasants consumed up to 3 litres ( 0 @.@ 66 imp gal ; 0 @.@ 79 US gal ) of beer per day . 
 In the Early Middle Ages beer was primarily brewed in monasteries , and on a smaller scale in individual households . By the High Middle Ages breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production . Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people , regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques . These operations later spread to the Netherlands in the 14th century , then to Flanders and Brabant , and reached England by the 15th century . <unk> beer became very popular in the last decades of the Late Middle Ages . In England and the Low Countries , the per capita annual consumption was around 275 to 300 litres ( 60 to 66 imp gal ; 73 to 79 US gal ) , and it was consumed with practically every meal : low alcohol @-@ content beers for breakfast , and stronger ones later in the day . When perfected as an ingredient , hops could make beer keep for six months or more , and facilitated extensive exports . In Late Medieval England , the word beer came to mean a hopped beverage , whereas ale had to be <unk> . In turn , ale or beer was classified into " strong " and " small " , the latter less intoxicating , regarded as a drink of temperate people , and suitable for consumption by children . As late as 1693 , John Locke stated that the only drink he considered suitable for children of all ages was small beer , while criticizing the apparently common practice among Englishmen of the time to give their children wine and strong alcohol . 
 By modern standards , the brewing process was relatively inefficient , but capable of producing quite strong alcohol when that was desired . One recent attempt to recreate medieval English " strong ale " using recipes and techniques of the era ( albeit with the use of modern yeast strains ) yielded a strongly alcoholic brew with original gravity of 1 @.@ 091 ( corresponding to a potential alcohol content over 9 % ) and " pleasant , apple @-@ like taste " . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The ancient Greeks and Romans knew of the technique of distillation , but it was not practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century , when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water @-@ cooled glass <unk> were introduced . Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified , and the term aqua vitae ( " water of life " ) was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates . The early use of various distillates , alcoholic or not , was varied , but it was primarily culinary or medicinal ; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments , and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing . Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling , fire @-@ breathing entremets ( a type of entertainment dish after a course ) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits . It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed , cooked and occasionally redressed animals , and lit just before presenting the creation . 
 Aqua vitae in its alcoholic forms was highly praised by medieval physicians . In 1309 <unk> of Villanova wrote that " [ i ] t prolongs good health , dissipates superfluous humours , reanimates the heart and maintains youth . " In the Late Middle Ages , the production of moonshine started to pick up , especially in the German @-@ speaking regions . By the 13th century , <unk> ( literally " home @-@ burnt " from <unk> <unk> , <unk> ; " burnt [ distilled ] wine " ) was commonplace , marking the origin of brandy . Towards the end of the Late Middle Ages , the consumption of spirits became so ingrained even among the general population that restrictions on sales and production began to appear in the late 15th century . In 1496 the city of Nuremberg issued restrictions on the selling of <unk> on Sundays and official holidays . 
 = = Herbs , spices and condiments = = 
 Spices were among the most luxurious products available in the Middle Ages , the most common being black pepper , cinnamon ( and the cheaper alternative cassia ) , cumin , nutmeg , ginger and cloves . They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa , which made them extremely expensive , and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded , traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion . It has been estimated that around 1 @,@ 000 tons of pepper and 1 @,@ 000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages . The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1 @.@ 5 million people . While pepper was the most common spice , the most exclusive ( though not the most obscure in its origin ) was saffron , used as much for its vivid yellow @-@ red color as for its flavor , for according to the humours , yellow signified hot and dry , valued qualities ; turmeric provided a yellow substitute , and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore : at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal <unk> offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473 , the bread was gilded . Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise , a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking , long pepper , mace , spikenard , <unk> and cubeb . Sugar , unlike today , was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities . Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb , but rather a combination of several different ones . Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste , for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger . 
 Common herbs such as sage , mustard , and parsley were grown and used in cooking all over Europe , as were caraway , mint , dill and fennel . Many of these plants grew throughout all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens , and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices . Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen ( 1098 – 1179 ) as poor man 's food . While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices , they were still used in upper @-@ class food , but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring . Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes , and its seeds were served as sugar @-@ coated comfits . 
 Surviving medieval recipes frequently call for flavoring with a number of sour , tart liquids . Wine , verjuice ( the juice of unripe grapes or fruits ) vinegar and the juices of various fruits , especially those with tart flavors , were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking . In combination with sweeteners and spices , it produced a distinctive " <unk> , fruity " flavor . Equally common , and used to complement the <unk> of these ingredients , were ( sweet ) almonds . They were used in a variety of ways : whole , shelled or unshelled , <unk> , ground and , most importantly , processed into almond milk . This last type of non @-@ dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture . 
 Salt was ubiquitous and indispensable in medieval cooking . Salting and drying was the most common form of food preservation and meant that fish and meat in particular were often heavily salted . Many medieval recipes specifically warn against <unk> and there were recommendations for soaking certain products in water to get rid of excess salt . Salt was present during more elaborate or expensive meals . The richer the host , and the more prestigious the guest , the more elaborate would be the container in which it was served and the higher the quality and price of the salt . Wealthy guests were seated " above the salt " , while others sat " below the salt " , where salt cellars were made of pewter , precious metals or other fine materials , often intricately decorated . The rank of a diner also decided how finely ground and white the salt was . Salt for cooking , preservation or for use by common people was coarser ; sea salt , or " bay salt " , in particular , had more impurities , and was described in colors ranging from black to green . Expensive salt , on the other hand , looked like the standard commercial salt common today . 
 = = Sweets and desserts = = 
 The term " dessert " comes from the Old French <unk> , " to clear a table " , literally " to un @-@ serve " , and originated during the Middle Ages . It would typically consist of <unk> and mulled wine accompanied by aged cheese , and by the Late Middle Ages could also include fresh fruit covered in sugar , honey or syrup and boiled @-@ down fruit pastes . Sugar , from its first appearance in Europe , was viewed as much as a drug as a sweetener ; its long @-@ lived medieval reputation as an exotic luxury encouraged its appearance in elite contexts accompanying meats and other dishes that to modern taste are more naturally savoury . There was a wide variety of fritters , crêpes with sugar , sweet <unk> and <unk> , almond milk and eggs in a pastry shell that could also include fruit and sometimes even bone marrow or fish . German @-@ speaking areas had a particular fondness for <unk> : fried pastries and dough with various sweet and savory fillings . <unk> in many forms was well known in Italy and southern France by the 1340s and is assumed to be of Arab origin . Anglo @-@ Norman cookbooks are full of recipes for sweet and savory <unk> , potages , sauces and tarts with strawberries , cherries , apples and plums . The English chefs also had a penchant for using flower petals such as roses , violets , and elder flowers . An early form of <unk> can be found in Forme of Cury , a 14th @-@ century recipe collection , as a <unk> de Bry with a cheese and egg yolk filling . 
 In northern France , a wide assortment of waffles and wafers was eaten with cheese and hypocras or a sweet <unk> as issue de table ( " departure from the table " ) . The ever @-@ present candied ginger , coriander , <unk> and other spices were referred to as <unk> de chambre ( " parlor spices " ) and were taken as <unk> at the end of a meal to " close " the stomach . Like their Muslim counterparts in Spain , the Arab conquerors of Sicily introduced a wide variety of new sweets and desserts that eventually found their way to the rest of Europe . Just like Montpellier , Sicily was once famous for its comfits , nougat candy ( <unk> , or <unk> in Spanish ) and almond clusters ( confetti ) . From the south , the Arabs also brought the art of ice cream making that produced sorbet and several examples of sweet cakes and pastries ; <unk> alla Siciliana ( from Arabic <unk> 'ah , the term for the terra cotta bowl with which it was shaped ) , made from marzipan , sponge cake and sweetened ricotta and <unk> alla Siciliana , originally <unk> di <unk> ( " Turkish hats " ) , fried , chilled pastry tubes with a sweet cheese filling . 
 = = Historiography and sources = = 
 Research into medieval <unk> was , until around 1980 , a much neglected field of study . Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians , and are still present in as a part of the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward , primitive and barbaric era . Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors , the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices . The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat , a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources . Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it . The preservation techniques available at the time , although crude by today 's standards , were perfectly adequate . The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices , and thereby the reputation of the host , would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods . 
 The common method of grinding and mashing ingredients into pastes and the many potages and sauces has been used as an argument that most adults within the medieval nobility lost their teeth at an early age , and hence were forced to eat nothing but porridge , soup and ground @-@ up meat . The image of nobles <unk> their way through multi @-@ course meals of nothing but mush has lived side by side with the contradictory apparition of the " mob of uncouth louts ( disguised as noble lords ) who , when not actually hurling huge joints of greasy meat at one another across the banquet hall , are engaged in tearing at them with a perfectly healthy complement of incisors , canines , bicuspids and molars " . 
 The numerous descriptions of banquets from the later Middle Ages concentrated on the pageantry of the event rather than the minutiae of the food , which was not the same for most <unk> as those choice mets served at the high table . Banquet dishes were apart from mainstream of cuisine , and have been described as " the outcome of grand banquets serving political ambition rather than gastronomy ; today as yesterday " by historian <unk> Toussant @-@ Samat . 
 = = = Cookbooks = = = 
 Cookbooks , or more specifically , recipe collections , compiled in the Middle Ages are among the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine . The first cookbooks began to appear towards the end of the 13th century . The Liber de coquina , perhaps originating near Naples , and the Tractatus de modo <unk> have found a modern editor in Marianne <unk> , and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons @-@ sur @-@ Marne has been edited by <unk> Toussaint @-@ Samat . Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes , food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today , as a step @-@ by @-@ step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish . Few in a kitchen , at those times , would have been able to read , and working texts have a low survival rate . 
 The recipes were often brief and did not give precise quantities . Cooking times and temperatures were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire . At best , cooking times could be specified as the time it took to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field . Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training , working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy . A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction . Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household , such as the <unk> de Paris from the late 14th century . Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today , written in several major European languages . 
 The repertory of housekeeping instructions laid down by manuscripts like the <unk> de Paris also include many details of overseeing correct preparations in the kitchen . Towards the onset of the early modern period , in 1474 , the Vatican librarian Bartolomeo Platina wrote the De <unk> <unk> et <unk> ( " On honourable pleasure and health " ) and the physician Iodocus Willich edited Apicius in Zurich in 1563 . 
 High @-@ status exotic spices and rarities like ginger , pepper , cloves , sesame , citron leaves and " onions of <unk> " all appear in an eighth @-@ century list of spices that the Carolingian cook should have at hand . It was written by <unk> , whose excerpts of Apicius survive in an eighth century uncial manuscript . <unk> ' own dates may not be much earlier . 
 = Flag of Belarus = 
 The current state flag of Belarus ( Belarusian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; Russian : <unk> Беларуси , Flag <unk> ) is a red and green flag with a white and red ornament pattern placed at the staff ( hoist ) end . The current design was introduced in 2012 by the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic of Belarus , and is adapted from a design approved in a referendum in May 1995 . It is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union . Changes made to the Soviet @-@ era flag were the removal of symbols of communism ( the hammer and sickle and the red star ) and the reversal of the colors of the ornament pattern , from white on red to red on white . Since the 1995 referendum , several flags used by government officials and agencies were modeled from the national flag . 
 This design replaced the historical white @-@ red @-@ white flag used by the Belarusian People 's Republic of 1918 , before Belarus became a Soviet Republic , and again after it regained its independence in 1991 . Opposition groups have continued to use this flag , though its display in Belarus has been restricted by the government of Belarus , which claims it was linked with Nazi collaboration during the Second World War . The white @-@ red @-@ white flag is used in protests against the government and by the Belarusian diaspora . 
 = = Design = = 
 The basic design of the national flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree <unk> of June 7 , 1995 . The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes : a red upper stripe covering two @-@ thirds of the flag 's height , and green lower stripe covering one @-@ third . A vertical red @-@ on @-@ white Belarusian decorative pattern , which occupies one @-@ ninth of the flag 's length , is placed against the flagstaff . The flag 's ratio of width to length is 1 : 2 . 
 The flag does not differ significantly from the flag of the Byelorussian SSR , other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star , and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern . While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag , an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation 's forefathers , while green represents life . 
 In addition to the 1995 decree , " STB 911 – 2008 : National Flag of the Republic of Belarus " was published by the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic of Belarus in 2008 . It gives the technical specifications of the national flag , such as the details of the colors and the ornament pattern . The red ornament design on the national flag was , until 2012 , 1 ⁄ 12 the width of the flag , and 1 ⁄ 9 with the white margin . As of 2012 , the red pattern has occupied the whole of the white margin ( which stayed at 1 ⁄ 9 ) .

 A decorative pattern , designed in 1917 by <unk> <unk> , is displayed on the hoist of the flag ( as it was previously , on the 1951 flag ) . The pattern , derived from local plants and flowers , is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus . These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments , most importantly in the traditional ' <unk> ' , a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services , funerals , and other more mundane social functions , such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a <unk> . 
 = = Proper flag protocol = = 
 By law , the Belarusian flag should be flown daily , weather permitting , from the following locations : 
 National Assembly of Belarus 
 Council of Ministers of Belarus 
 Courts of Belarus , and offices of local executive and administrative bodies 
 Above buildings in which sessions of local Councils of deputies are carried out 
 Military bases or military ships owned by the government 
 Buildings used by Belarusian diplomats 
 The Belarusian flag is also officially flown on these occasions : 
 Sessions of local executive and administrative bodies 
 Voting / polling places 
 Sports arenas during competitions ( note that the IOC has its own rules on flag display ) 
 The flag is also displayed on vehicles used by Belarusian diplomats and various government officials ( such as the President and the Prime Minister ) . The law allows for the flag to be used for special occasions , such as memorial services , and family holidays , and it can be used by various groups of people , such as public organizations , companies , and NGOs . The regulations were issued in the same decree that created the Belarusian flag . May 15 has been declared the Day of the National Emblem and Flag of Belarus ( Belarusian : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Рэспублікі Беларусь , Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> и <unk> <unk> Республики Беларусь ) . The national flag itself has been incorporated into the badge of the guard units in the Belarusian armed forces . The pole should be three times longer than the width of the flag . 
 In the 1995 presidential decree , the national flag is to be used on a staff that is colored gold ( ochre ) . In other parts of the protocol , the finial ( metal ornament on a flag pole ) is going to be diamond @-@ shaped and colored in a yellow metal . In this diamond , there is a five @-@ pointed star ( similar to that used in national emblem ) . The diamond @-@ pattern was another carry @-@ over of Soviet flag traditions .

 = = = Soviet flag of 1951 = = = 
 The flag of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted by decree on December 25 , 1951 . The flag was slightly modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star , and golden hammer and sickle . The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and are very similar to the current Belarusian flag . The flag had a length @-@ to @-@ width ratio of one to two ( 1 : 2 ) , just like the flag of the Soviet Union ( and the other fourteen union republics ) . The main portion of the flag was red ( representing the Revolution ) , with the rest being green ( representing the Belarusian forests ) . A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag ; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes . In the upper corner of the flag , in the red portion , a gold hammer and sickle was added , with a red star outlined in gold above it . The hammer represented the worker , and the sickle the peasant ; according to Soviet ideology , these two symbols crossed together symbolized co @-@ operation between the two classes . The red star , a symbol commonly used by Communist parties , was said to stand either for the five social groups ( workers , youth , peasants , military , and academics ) , the five known continents , or the five fingers of the worker 's hand . The hammer , sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag . The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR , along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR , were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other . The designer of the flag was <unk> <unk> .

 Before 1951 , several different flags had been in use since the Revolution . The earliest flag was plain red , and was used in 1919 during the existence of the Lithuanian @-@ Byelorussian SSR . After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR , the lettering <unk> ( <unk> ) was added in gold to the top hoist . This design was established with the passage of the first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR . It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР ( <unk> ) but kept the overall design the same . This design was changed in 1937 , when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters . The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1 : 2 for the first time . This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag , which did away with the letters . 
 = = = White @-@ red @-@ white flag = = = 
 The design of the flag used between 19 September 1991 and 5 June 1995 had originally been devised by the Belarusian People 's Republic ( March to December 1918 ) . The original person behind the design of the flag is believed to have been <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> before 1917 and this design is known in Belarusian as the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> s <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ; literally " white @-@ red @-@ white flag " ) . Red and white have traditionally been used in state heraldry of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . The colors are also based on those of the coat of arms Pahonia that was a traditional coat of arms of Belarusian lands and had a white horseman on a red background . There are several other theories explaining the flag 's origin . One theory speaks of an allusion to the name of the country : White Ruthenia . 
 Variations of this flag were used during the Belarusian People 's Republic in 1918 – 1919 . The white @-@ red @-@ white flag is still used by the Republic 's government @-@ in @-@ exile . Lasting from 1919 until 1925 , the flag of the BPR retained the white , red , white design , but with the addition of black stripes at the top and bottom of the red stripe . Between 1921 and 1939 the white @-@ red @-@ white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus ( part of the Second Polish Republic ) , both by political organizations like the Belarusian Peasants ' and Workers ' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy , and non @-@ political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society . The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania . After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern @-@ day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well . 
 In 1941 the flag was allowed for usage by the Nazi occupation administration , and it appeared on arm patches of Belarusian volunteers in the German Army and Waffen SS and was used by the Belarusian Central Rada , the pro @-@ German government of Belarus in 1943 – 1944 . After the end of World War II the flag was used by Belarusian diaspora in the West and by small groups of anti @-@ Soviet resistance in Belarus itself . In late 1980s the flag was again used as a symbol of national revival and democratic changes in Belarus . By proposal of the Belarusian Popular Front the flag became state symbol of Belarus upon its regaining of independence in 1991 . 
 After 1995 the white @-@ red @-@ white flag is used as a symbol of the opposition to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko , most notably at the protests after the 2006 and 2010 presidential elections and at mass rallies on Freedom Day celebrations as well as Dziady memorial marches . The flag is not officially banned from public usage , but is treated by the authorities as an unregistered symbol which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags . In early 2010 , the political activist <unk> Kavalenka was arrested for placing the white @-@ red @-@ white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of Vitsebsk . The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka 's several weeks long hunger strike . The hunger strike was interrupted by force @-@ feeding on 16 January 2012 .

 The referendum that was held to adopt the state symbols took place on May 14 , 1995 . With a voter turnout of 64 @.@ 7 % , the new flag was approved by a majority in the ratio of three to one ( 75 @.@ 1 % to 24 @.@ 9 % ) . The other three questions were also passed by the voters . The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition . Opposition parties claimed that only 48 @.@ 7 % of the entire voting population ( 75 @.@ 1 % of the 64 @.@ 7 % who showed at the polling stations ) supported the adoption of the new flag , but Belarusian law ( as in many other countries ) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue . Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko , he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet @-@ style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation . 
 Lukashenko had tried to hold a similar referendum before , in 1993 , but failed to get parliamentary support . Two months before the May 1995 referendum , Lukashenko proposed a flag design that consisted of two small bars of green and one wide bar of red . While it is not known what became of this suggestion , new designs ( called " projects " in Belarus ) were suggested a few days later , which were then put up to vote in the 1995 referendum . 
 = = Other related flags = = 
 Since the introduction of the 1995 flag , several other flags adopted by government agencies or bodies have been modeled on it . 
 The presidential standard , which has been in use since 1997 , was adopted by a decree called " Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus " . The standard 's design is an exact copy of the national flag , with the addition of the Belarusian national emblem in gold and red . The standard 's ratio of 5 : 6 differs from that of the national flag , making the standard almost square . It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the president . 
 In 2001 , President Lukashenko issued a decree granting a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus . The flag , which has a ratio of 1 : 1 @.@ 7 , has the national ornamental pattern along the length of the hoist side of the flag . On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms , with the wording <unk> <unk> ( " Armed Forces " ) arched over it , and <unk> <unk> ( " of Republic of Belarus " ) written below ; the text of both is in gold . On the reverse of the flag , the center contains the symbol of the armed forces , which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel . Above the symbol is the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " For our Motherland " ) , while below is the full name of the military unit .

 The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park is the presidential library of Bill Clinton , the 42nd President of the United States ( 1993 – 2001 ) . It is located in Little Rock , Arkansas and includes the Clinton Presidential Library , the offices of the Clinton Foundation , and the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service . It is the thirteenth presidential library to have been completed in the United States , the eleventh to be operated by the National Archives and Records Administration , and the third to comply with the Presidential Records Act of 1978 . 
 It is situated on 17 acres ( 69 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land located next to the Arkansas River and Interstate 30 and was designed by architectural firm Polshek Partnership , LLP with exhibition design by Ralph Appelbaum Associates . The main building cantilevers over the Arkansas River , echoing Clinton 's campaign promise of " building a bridge to the 21st century " . With a 68 @,@ 698 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 6 @,@ 382 @.@ 3 m2 ) floor plan , the library itself is the largest presidential library in terms of physical area , although the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library has the greatest space overall , due to its addition of the 90 @,@ 000 square feet ( 8 @,@ 400 m2 ) Air Force One Pavilion in 2005 . The archives are the largest as well , containing 2 million photographs , 80 million pages of documents , 21 million e @-@ mail messages , and 79 @,@ 000 artifacts from the Clinton presidency .

 Preliminary planning for the library ( including the site choice ) began in 1997 , while groundbreaking for the complex occurred on December 5 , 2001 . Early estimates put the library 's cost at about $ 125 million . In 2001 , the Clinton Foundation hoped to gather $ 200 million in donations to cover project costs . In the end , the entire project cost $ 165 million in private funding , with an additional $ 11 @.@ 5 million of land given by the city of Little Rock to construct and covers 152 @,@ 000 square feet ( 14 @,@ 100 m2 ) within a 28 acres ( 110 @,@ 000 m2 ) park . 
 Fund @-@ raising for the center was led by Terry McAuliffe , a friend of Clinton 's who had also contributed heavily to the Clinton @-@ Gore campaign in 1995 . Clinton himself was prohibited by law from personally soliciting donations for the center , but he did host private events relating to the library . There were no other legal restrictions on donations , and the Clinton Foundation was able to accept unlimited private donations , all of which were tax deductible . Approximately $ 10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia . However , the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list , similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library ( although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee ) . Donations exceeding $ 1 million were also given from various other foreign governments ( such as Kuwait and Taiwan ) , as well as foreign individuals .

 Choctaw Station is a restored historic redbrick train station opened by the Choctaw , Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad in 1901 and used by the Chicago , Rock Island & Pacific Railroad until passenger service was discontinued in November 1967 . The building was subsequently purchased by the Arkansas Gazette and later restored by a restaurant chain , Spaghetti Warehouse , which was known for preserving old buildings . The Choctaw Station now houses the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service , the Clinton Public Policy Institute , and the Clinton Foundation . The station is 13 @,@ 200 square feet ( 1 @,@ 230 m2 ) after having been renovated . A companion structure , the 1899 Choctaw freight station , was razed in November 2001 after a contentious debate between the City of Little Rock and historic preservationists .

 The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge across the Arkansas River , originally leading to Choctaw Station , has been converted into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock . On the fifth anniversary of the library 's opening , Clinton said that construction on the project would begin in 2010 , but full funding had not yet been secured , as the project was still short about $ 3 million . The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $ 4 million in exchange for a $ 1 @-@ a @-@ year land lease from the state . In 2009 , Arkansas governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $ 2 @.@ 5 million of stimulus funds to fund part of the renovation . A previous $ 8 million earmark for the project had failed to pass the state legislature . In 2010 , fundraising was finally completed for the bridge , renamed as the Clinton Park Bridge , and construction began on May 28 , 2010 . On September 30 , 2011 , Clinton spoke at a dedication ceremony for the bridge , which opened to the public on October 2 , 2011 .

 The Clinton Library features numerous items from Clinton 's time as president . Clinton 's Cadillac One is on the first floor of the main building . The second floor includes the main gallery . It consists of a 110 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) timeline of each of Clinton 's years as President , as well as 14 alcoves featuring various events during Clinton 's terms . There is an orientation theater and full @-@ size replicas of the Clinton @-@ era Oval Office and Cabinet Room as well . The Oval Office exhibit is the only full @-@ size model Oval Office in any presidential library , and was constructed using thousands of photos taken by White House officials of the original office . 
 The timeline comprises eight panels , each one 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) wide and begins with Clinton 's 1993 inaugural address . Items on the alcove displays include the Oklahoma City bombing and Northern Ireland and Middle East peace efforts . Items released by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 are included in the exhibits , including personal letters written to and by the Clinton family , such as ones from Whoopi Goldberg and Arsenio Hall , as well as family photographs and even a Valentine 's Day note from Bill Clinton to Hillary . The second floor of the main gallery showcases artifacts from previous state dinners and various state gifts , such as ceramics and other decorative pieces . An exhibit on Clinton 's saxophone and another on family pets Socks and Buddy are also on the second floor . 
 Clinton has been criticized for not including enough details about the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his impeachment . One of the 14 alcoves is dedicated to the " politics of persecution " and is titled The Fight For Power . The alcove includes the Lewinsky affair , the Whitewater scandal , and the Republican Contract with America . Ralph Applebaum , the chief exhibit designer for the center , said that Clinton was heavily involved in the alcove 's design , and that Clinton " insisted on a transparent and illuminating exhibition " . The scandal is portrayed as a power struggle between Republicans in Congress and Clinton after the Republican Party took control of both the House of Representatives and Senate in 1994 .

 In 1997 , Eugene Pfeifer III sued the city of Little Rock to challenge its use of eminent domain in the use of the land but the city 's method of taking the land was upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 2001 . Pfeifer argued against the use of revenue bonds for the project because he believed that the city could not afford to repay them . In 2001 , a rail depot dating from 1899 was discovered within a warehouse on the site . Preservationists lost a court battle to save the building , and the depot was destroyed . Protesters also picketed the city hall when the city tried to name the street in front of the library " President Clinton Avenue " . The two groups later compromised and only half of the street was renamed . 
 The library has been criticized for not including much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office . On January 20 , 2001 , his last day in office , Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich , a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering , wire fraud , income tax evasion , and illegal oil trading . Rich 's wife , Denise Eisenberg Rich , was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to Clinton 's presidential library fund , as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Rodham Clinton 's senate campaign . It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $ 450 @,@ 000 to the fundraiser . The Senate Judiciary Committee was investigating the pardon and issued subpoenas for Denise Rich 's bank records because she refused to testify before the House Government Reform Committee , in accordance with her Fifth Amendment right against self @-@ incrimination . U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White also launched a criminal investigation into whether the pardon had been a result of the contributions . It was later claimed that Rich had donated the funds months before asking for a pardon . Clinton maintained that the pardon had not been bought , but had been based instead on the legal merits of Marc Rich 's appeal . During the 2008 U.S. presidential election , Barack Obama referenced the donations in an attempt win over supporters of opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton . 
 Clinton has also been criticized for the library 's lack of coverage regarding various scandals during his presidency , including the Whitewater scandal . Clinton adviser Bruce Lindsey said that Clinton wanted to provide information regarding the incidents , but depicting the attacks as a scheme to " delegitimize " Clinton 's administration . The museum 's main exhibit designer has said that " this is the way the president wanted to see his legacy defined . "

 The primarily modernist complex was designed by James Polshek 's Polshek Partnership Architects , led by Polshek and partner Richard Olcott . The structural engineer for this project was Leslie E. Robertson Associates . The museum and exhibitions were designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates , with landscaping by Hargreaves associates . Clinton did not announce his choice of architect until 1999 , when Polshek was officially hired that August . Although Appelbaum was the official designer for the exhibitions , Appelbaum called Clinton " the editor @-@ in @-@ chief , the curator @-@ in @-@ chief and in many times the art director of the exhibits " . 
 It is constructed primarily of steel and glass . The main building is based on the diagonal truss . Originally , the museum was planned parallel to the river , but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river , for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors . The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles , providing a sunscreen for the building . The underside is constructed of aluminum . Some critics dislike the bridge design , saying it looks too much like a trailer on stilts .

In addition , over $ 1 billion of new real estate has been invested in downtown Little Rock . The world headquarters of Heifer International is located just beyond the library . 
 The center has spurred an estimated $ 2 billion in new projects in the surrounding parts of Little Rock . Since its opening , the library has had over 1 @.@ 64 million visitors .

 = Chilembwe uprising = 
 The Chilembwe uprising was a rebellion against British colonial rule in Nyasaland ( modern @-@ day Malawi ) in January 1915 . Led by John Chilembwe , an American @-@ educated black millenarian Christian minister , the uprising was based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south @-@ east of the country . It was centred on the black middle class and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system , including forced labour , discrimination and the new demands on the indigenous population caused by the outbreak of World War I. 
 The revolt broke out in the evening of 23 January 1915 , when rebels , incited by Chilembwe , attacked the A. L. Bruce plantation 's headquarters at Magomero and killed three white colonists ; and a largely unsuccessful attack on a weapons store in Blantyre followed during the night . By the morning of 24 January the colonial authorities had mobilised the white settler militia and redeployed regular military forces south . After a failed attack on Mbombwe by troops of the King 's African Rifles ( KAR ) on 25 January , a group of rebels attacked a Christian mission at <unk> and burned it down . The KAR and militia took Mbombwe without encountering resistance on 26 January after many of the rebels , including Chilembwe , fled , hoping to reach safety in neighbouring Portuguese East Africa ( modern Mozambique ) . About 40 rebels were executed in the revolt 's aftermath , and 300 were imprisoned ; Chilembwe was shot dead by a police patrol near the border on 3 February . 
 Although the rebellion did not itself achieve lasting success , it is commonly cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history . The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath . After World War II , the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt , and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation 's history . Chilembwe 's memory , which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness , has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians . Today , the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero . 
 = = Background = = 
 British colonial rule in the region of modern @-@ day Malawi , where the revolt occurred , began between 1899 and 1900 , when the British sought to increase their formal control over the territory to preempt encroachment by German or Portuguese colonial empires . The region became a British protectorate in 1891 ( as " British Central Africa " ) and in 1907 , was named Nyasaland . Unlike many other parts of Africa , where British rule was dependent on the support of local factions , in Nyasaland British control rested on military superiority . During the 1890s the colonial authorities put down numerous rebellions by the local Yao , Ngoni and <unk> peoples . 
 British rule in Nyasaland radically altered the local indigenous power structures . The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists , who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs , often for token payments in beads or guns . Most of the land acquired , particularly in the Shire Highlands , was converted into plantations where tea , coffee , cotton and tobacco were grown . The enforcement of colonial institutions , such as the Hut Tax , compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and the demand for labour created by the plantations , led to their becoming a major employer . Once employed on the plantations , black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination . Increasingly , the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée , known locally at the thangata . 
 = = = Chilembwe and the Providence Industrial Mission = = = 
 John Chilembwe , born locally in around 1871 , received his early education at a Scottish mission and later met Joseph Booth , a radical Baptist missionary who ran the Zambezi Industrial Mission . Booth preached a form of egalitarianism and his progressive attitude towards race attracted Chilembwe 's attention . Under Booth 's patronage , Chilembwe travelled to the United States to study at a theological college in Virginia . There he mixed in African @-@ American circles and was influenced by stories of the abolitionist John Brown and the <unk> Booker T. Washington . 
 Chilembwe returned to Nyasaland in 1900 and founded his own independent church , the Providence Industrial Mission , in the village of Mbombwe . He was considered a " model of non @-@ violent African advancement " by the colonial authorities during the mission 's early years . He established a chain of independent black African schools , with over 900 pupils in total and founded the Natives ' Industrial Union , a form of cooperative union that has been described as an " embryo chamber of commerce " . Nevertheless , Chilembwe 's activities led to friction with the managers of local plantations , who feared Chilembwe 's influence over their workers . In November 1913 , employees of the local Alexander Livingstone Bruce Plantation , burnt down Chilembwe 's church in Mbombwe , though it was soon rebuilt . 
 Chilembwe preached a form of Millenarian Christianity , common in southern Africa at the time , which predicted the liberation of the Africans and the end of colonial rule . He preached aggressive sermons , often from the Old Testament , concentrating on aspects such as the Israelites ' escape from slavery in Egypt . Chilembwe 's activities were initially supported by white missionaries . Information about his Church before the rebellion is scant , but his ideology proved popular and he developed a strong local following . Chilembwe was not part of the apocalyptic Watchtower ( Kitawala ) movement , which was popular in central Africa at the time but some of his followers may have been influenced by it . Kitawala predicted that the <unk> would occur in October 1914 and that God would then come to earth and end colonialism . 
 Chilembwe 's ideology grew more aggressive in the decade after his return to Nyasaland . He became demanding of his followers , encouraging them to adopt European @-@ style intellectual improvement . The Mission 's schools meanwhile began teaching racial equality , based on Christian teaching and anti @-@ colonialism . Chilembwe adopted Western dress , customs and ideas and encouraged his followers to do likewise . Many of his followers came from the local middle @-@ class , who had similarly adopted European customs . Chilembwe 's acceptance of European culture created an unorthodox anti @-@ colonial ideology based around a form of nationalism , rather than a desire to restore the pre @-@ colonial social order . 
 = = = Outbreak of World War I = = = 
 World War I broke out in July 1914 . By September 1914 , the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long military campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa . In Nyasaland , the major effect of the war was massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies . Porters lived in extremely poor conditions and many died . At the same time , the recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased the economic pressure on Africans in Nyasaland . 
 Chilembwe opposed the recruitment of black people to fight what he considered to be a war totally unconnected to them . He promoted a form of Christian pacifism and argued that the lack of civil rights for Africans in the colonial system , should exempt them from the duties of military service . <unk> at the time believed that World War I would be a form of Armageddon , which they believed would destroy the colonial powers and pave the way for the emergence of independent African states . In November 1914 , following reports of large loss of life during fighting at Karonga , Chilembwe wrote a letter to the The Nyasaland Times in Blantyre , explicitly appealing to the colonial authorities not to recruit black troops : 
 As I hear that , [ sic ] war has broken out between you and other nations , only <unk> , I request , therefore , not to recruit more of my countrymen , my brothers who do not know the cause of your fight , who indeed , have nothing to do with it ... It is better to recruit white planters , traders , missionaries and other white settlers in the country , who are , indeed , of much value and who also know the cause of this war and have something to do with it ... 
 = = = Preparations = = = 
 Preparations for the uprising had begun by the end of 1914 . Chilembwe acquired a military manual and began to organise his followers and wider support . In particular , he formed close ties with Filipo Chinyama in Ncheu , 110 miles ( 180 km ) to the north @-@ west and received his assurance that he would also mobilise his followers to join the rebellion when it broke out . 
 The colonial authorities received two warnings that a revolt was imminent . A disaffected follower of Chilembwe reported the preacher 's " worrying intentions " to Philip Mitchell , a minor colonial functionary who later served as Governor of Uganda and Kenya , in August 1914 . A Catholic mission was also informed . Neither took any action . 
 = = Rebellion = = 
 = = = Outbreak = = = 
 During the night of Saturday 23 – 24 January , the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe , where Chilembwe gave a speech stressing that none of them should expect to survive the reprisals that would follow the revolt but that the uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system . This , Chilembwe believed , was the only way change would ever occur . 
 A contingent of rebels was sent to Blantyre and Limbe , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to south , where most of the white colonialists lived and where the insurgents hoped to capture the African Lakes Company 's store of weapons . Another group headed towards the Alexander Livingstone Bruce Plantation 's headquarters at Magomero . Chilembwe sent a messenger to Ncheu to alert Chinyama that the rebellion was starting . 
 Chilembwe also sought support for his uprising from the German forces in German East Africa , on Nyasaland 's far northern border , hoping that a German offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of Nyasaland permanently . On 24 January , he sent a letter to the German Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa . The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received . During the latter stages of the East African Campaign , after the German invasion of Portuguese East Africa , the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti @-@ Portuguese rebellions , among the <unk> and <unk> peoples , worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order . 
 = = = Attack on the Livingstone Bruce Plantation = = = 
 The major action of the Chilembwe uprising involved an attack on the Bruce plantation at Magomero . The plantation spanned about 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 ha ) and grew both cotton and tobacco . Around 5 @,@ 000 locals worked on it as part of their thangata obligations . The plantation had a reputation locally for the poor treatment of its workers and for the brutality of its managers , who closed local schools , beat their workers and paid them less than had been promised . Their burning of Chilembwe 's church in November 1913 created a personal animosity with the rebel leadership . The insurgents launched two roughly concurrent attacks — one group targeted Magomero , the plantation headquarters and home of the main manager William Jervis Livingstone and a few other white staff , while a second assaulted the plantation @-@ owned village of Mwanje , where there were two white households . 
 The rebels moved into Magomero in the early evening , while Livingstone and his wife were entertaining some dinner guests . The estate official , Duncan MacCormick , was in another house nearby . A third building , occupied by Emily Stanton , Alyce Roach and five children , contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club . The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone 's house and injured him during hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , prompting him to take refuge in the bedroom , where his wife attempted to treat his wounds . The rebels forced their way into the bedroom , and after capturing his wife , decapitated Livingstone . MacCormick , who had been alerted , was killed by a rebel spear . The attackers took the women and children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt , having reportedly treated them well . It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use the women and children as hostages , but this remains unclear . The attack on Magomero , and in particular the killing of Livingstone , had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe 's men . The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury for the rest of the uprising . 
 Mwanje had little military value but it has been proposed that the rebels may have hoped to find weapons and ammunition there . Led by Jonathan <unk> , the insurgents stormed one of the houses and killed the plantation 's stock manager , Robert Ferguson , with a spear as he lay in bed reading a newspaper . Two of the colonists , John Robertson and his wife Charlotte , escaped into the cotton fields and walked 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) to a neighbouring plantation to raise the alarm . One of the <unk> ' African servants , who remained loyal , was killed by the attackers . 
 = = = Later actions = = = 
 The rebels cut the Zomba @-@ Tete and Blantyre @-@ <unk> telephone lines , delaying the spread of the news . The African Lakes ' Company weapons store in Blantyre was raided by a force of around 100 rebels at around 02 : 00 on 24 January , before the general alarm had been raised by news of the Magomero and Mwanje attacks . The defenders mobilised after an African watchman was shot dead by the rebels . The insurgents were repulsed , but not before they had captured five rifles and some ammunition , which was taken back to Mbombwe . A number of rebels were taken prisoner during the retreat from Magomero . 
 After the initial attacks on the Bruce plantation , the rebels returned home . Livingstone 's head was taken back and displayed at the Providence Industrial Mission on the second day of the uprising as Chilembwe preached a sermon . During much of the rebellion , Chilembwe remained in Mbombwe praying and leadership of the rebels was taken by David Kaduya , a former soldier in the King 's African Rifles ( KAR ) . Under Kaduya 's command , the rebels ambushed a small party of government soldiers near Mbombwe on 24 January , described as the " one reverse suffered by the government " during the uprising . 
 By the morning of 24 January the government had levied the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve , a settler militia and redeployed the 1st Battalion , KAR from the north of the colony . The rebels did not mount any further attack any of the many other isolated plantations in the region . They also did not occupy the boma ( fort ) at <unk> just 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from Mbombwe , even though it was ungarrisoned at the time . Rumours of rebel attacks spread , but despite earlier offers of support , there were no parallel uprisings elsewhere in Nyasaland and the promised reinforcements from Ncheu did not materialise . The Mlanje or Zomba regions likewise refused to join the uprising . 
 = = = Siege of Mbombwe and attempted escape = = = 
 Troops of the KAR launched a tentative attack on Mbombwe on 25 January but the engagement proved inconclusive . Chilembwe 's forces held a strong defensive position along the Mbombwe river and could not be pushed back . Two African government soldiers were killed and three were wounded ; Chilembwe 's losses have been estimated as about 20 . 
 On 26 January , a group of rebels attacked a Catholic mission at <unk> belonging to Father <unk> . The mission was defended by four African armed guards , one of whom was killed . <unk> was also wounded in the fighting and the church was burnt down . The military and militia forces assaulted Mbombwe again the same day but encountered no resistance . Many rebels , including Chilembwe , had fled the village disguised as civilians . Mbombwe 's fall and the government troops ' subsequent demolition of Chilembwe 's church with dynamite ended the rebellion . Kaduya was captured and brought back to Magomero where he was publicly executed . 
 After the defeat of the rebellion , most of the remaining insurgents attempted to escape eastwards across the Shire Highlands , towards Portuguese East Africa , from where they hoped to head north to German territory . Chilembwe was seen by a patrol of Nyasaland police and shot dead on 3 February near Mlanje . Many other rebels were captured ; 300 were imprisoned following the rebellion and 40 were executed . Around 30 evaded capture and settled in Portuguese territory near the Nyasaland border . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Worrying that the rebellion might rapidly reignite and spread , the colonial authorities instigated arbitrary reprisals against the Nyasa population , including mass hut burnings . All weapons were confiscated and fines of 4 shillings per person were levied in the districts affected by the revolt , regardless of whether the people in question had been involved . The colonial government also begun attacking the rights of missionaries in Nyasaland and banned many independent churches , including Kitawala , from Nyasaland , and placed restrictions on other African @-@ run churches . Public gatherings , especially those associated with African @-@ initiated religious groups , were banned until 1919 . Fear of similar uprisings in other colonies , notably Northern Rhodesia , also led to similar repression of independent churches and foreign missions beyond Nyasaland . 
 Though the rebellion failed , the threat to colonial rule posed by the Chilembwe revolt compelled the local authorities to introduce some reform . The colonial government proposed to undermine the power of independent churches like Chilembwe 's , by promoting secular education but lack of funding made this impossible . The government began to promote tribal loyalties in the colony , through the system of indirect rule , which was expanded after the revolt . In particular , the Muslim Yao people , who attempted to distance themselves from Chilembwe , were given more power and autonomy . Although delayed by the war , the Nyasaland Police , which had been primarily composed of African askaris levied by local white officials , was restructured as a professional force of white colonists . Forced labour was retained , and would remain a resentment for decades afterwards . 
 = = = Commission of Enquiry = = = 
 In the aftermath of the revolt , the colonial administration formed a Commission of Enquiry to examine the causes and handling of the rebellion . The Commission , which presented its conclusions in early 1916 , found that the revolt was chiefly caused by mismanagement of the Bruce plantation . The Commission also blamed Livingstone himself for " treatment of natives [ that was ] often unduly harsh " and for poor management of the estate . The Commission found that the systematic discrimination , lack of freedoms and respect were key causes of resentment among the local population . It also emphasised the effect of Booth 's ideology on Chilembwe . 
 The Commission 's reforms were not far @-@ reaching — though it criticised the thangata system , it made only minor changes aimed at ending " casual brutality " . Though the government passed laws banning plantation owners from using the services of their tenants as payment of rent in 1917 , effectively abolishing thangata , it was " uniformly ignored " . A further Commission in 1920 concluded that the thangata could not be effectively abolished , and it remained a constant source of friction into the 1950s . 
 = = In later culture = = 
 Despite its failure , the Chilembwe rebellion has since gained an important place in the modern Malawian cultural memory , with Chilembwe himself gaining " iconic status . " The uprising had " local notoriety " in the years immediately after it , and former rebels were kept under police observation . Over the next three decades , anti @-@ colonial activists idealised Chilembwe and began to see him as a semi @-@ mythical figure . The Nyasaland African Congress ( NAC ) of the 1940s and 1950s used him as a symbolic figurehead , partly because its president , James Chinyama , had a family connection to Filipo Chinyama , who had been believed to be an ally of Chilembwe 's . When the NAC announced that it intended to mark 15 February annually as Chilembwe Day , colonial officials were scandalised . One wrote that to " venerate the memory of the fanatic and blood thirsty Chilembwe seems to us to be nothing less than a confession of violent intention . " 
 D. D. <unk> , a Malawian historian , characterised Chilembwe 's uprising as an early expression of Malawian nationalism , as did George <unk> and Thomas Price in their 1958 book Independent African , an exhaustive study of Chilembwe and his rebellion that was banned during the colonial era but still widely read by the educated classes . Chilembwe became viewed as an " unproblematic " hero by many of the country 's people . The Malawi Congress Party ( MCP ) , which ultimately led the country to independence in 1964 , made a conscious effort to identify its leader Hastings Banda with Chilembwe through speeches and radio broadcasts . Bakili Muluzi , who succeeded Banda in 1994 , similarly invoked Chilembwe 's memory to win popular support , inaugurating a new annual national holiday , Chilembwe Day , on 16 January 1995 . Chilembwe 's portrait was soon added to the national currency , the <unk> , and reproduced on Malawian stamps . It has been argued that for Malawian politicians , Chilembwe has become " symbol , legitimising myth , instrument and propaganda " . 
 = = Historical analysis = = 
 The revolt has been the subject of much research and has been interpreted in various ways by historians . At the time , the uprising was generally considered to mark a turning point in colonial rule . The Governor of Nyasaland , George Smith , declared that the revolt marked a " new phase in the existence of Nyasaland " . According to the military historian Hew Strachan , the Chilembwe uprising tarnished British prestige in East Africa which contributed , after the appointment of the future Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law as Secretary of State for the Colonies , to renewed pressure for an Anglo @-@ Belgian offensive against German East Africa . 
 Chilembwe 's aims have also come under scrutiny . According to Robert I. Rotberg , Chilembwe 's speech of 23 January appeared to stress the importance and inevitability of martyrdom as a principal motivation . The same speech depicted the uprising as a manifestation of desperation but because of his desire to " strike a blow and die " , he did not have any idea of what he would replace colonialism with if the revolt succeeded . Rotberg concludes that Chilembwe planned to seize power in the Shire Highlands or perhaps in all of Nyasaland . Some contemporaries of Chilembwe believed that he had planned to make himself " King of Nyasaland " . 
 John McCracken attacks the idea that the revolt could be considered nationalist , arguing that Chilembwe 's ideology was instead fundamentally utopian and created in opposition to localised abuses of the colonial system , particularly thangata . According to McCracken , the uprising failed because Chilembwe was over @-@ reliant on a small Europeanised petite bourgeoisie and did not gain enough mass support . Rotberg 's examination the Chilembwe revolt from a psychoanalytical perspective concludes that Chilembwe 's personal situation , his psychosomatic asthma and financial debt may have been contributory factors in his decision to plot the rebellion . 
 = French Spaniel = 
 The French Spaniel ( <unk> Français ) is a breed of dog of the Spaniel @-@ like setter . It was developed in France and Canada as a hunting dog , descended from dogs of the 14th century . Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages , it nearly became extinct by the turn of the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier , a French priest . One of the largest breeds of Spaniel , it typically has a white coat with brown markings . It is a friendly breed that has few health issues , but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia . The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club ( UK ) . The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service , the first step to full recognition . 
 = = History = = 
 Spaniels were first mentioned in France during the 14th century in Gaston III of Foix @-@ Béarn 's work Livre de chasse , later translated into English as The Master of Game . They were speculated to have originated during the Crusades of the 11th century . The French Spaniel was referred to as a specific type of Spaniel by 1660 and was noted as being distinctive from the King Charles Spaniel of the Holland type . 
 The breed was popular during the Middle Ages with it used for falconry and as a settling dog for net hunting . They became a favourite of French Royalty and Kings and Princes at the royal courts of Versailles favored them over other breeds of hunting dogs . In addition , Catherine I of Russia ( 1684 – 1727 ) was known to have owned a French Spaniel named Babe . During this period , the French Spaniel was known to have split into several regional types . 
 The Sporting Magazine wrote of the French Spaniel and the hunting of mallards in 1805 , " The rough French Spaniel has been found the best companion on these occasions : he watches the conduct of the sportsman , and , with a velocity unequalled , darts on the wounded prey , presents it with all possible speed at the feet of his master . " In the 1850s , the Brittany ( formerly known as Brittany Spaniel ) was developed from crossing French Spaniels with English Setters . 
 James de Connick established the first breed standard for the French Spaniel in 1891 . At the turn of the 20th century , the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs , in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs . A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint <unk> kennels in order to preserve the breed . There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have . The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921 , with Father Fournier as the president of the association . The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels , including the Brittany , Picardy and Blue Picardy .

 The French Spaniel was little known outside France and neighboring countries until it was introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s . It quickly became a popular dog for hunting woodcock and grouse . The Club de l <unk> Français du Canada was formed in 1978 to ensure the French Spaniel would continue to meet breed standards and to pursue official recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club , by which the breed was recognised in 1985 . 
 French Spaniels are also recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale , and the United Kennel Club . The Kennel Club ( UK ) and the American Kennel Club do not recognize the French Spaniel , but is recognised by the North American <unk> Hunting Dog Association , and can be registered with US dog registries in order to record their registries and compete in associated dog shows , such as the Dog Registry of America , American Canine Association , and America 's Pet Registry . 
 To qualify for recognition by the American Kennel Club , a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs to be sent to the AKC along with a breed standard . This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service . The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class . This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club , along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree ( all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed ) . In addition , they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more , and finally the clubs by @-@ laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff . There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted . During this time , the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars , matches as well as local and national speciality shows . The Kennel Club ( UK ) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service , instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them , along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard . This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register , with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee .

 The French Spaniel is one of the two tallest spaniel breeds , being taller than the English Springer Spaniel . Males can range in height from 22 – 24 inches ( 56 – 61 cm ) , and females are about an inch shorter . Dogs can range in weight from 45 – 60 pounds ( 20 – 27 kg ) . 
 A normal dog has a muscular appearance with a deep chest and strong legs . The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour , and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip . The hair is medium , dense , with long feathers on the ears , backs of the legs and tail . It has some <unk> on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body . The normal colour of a French Spaniel 's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver . Historically , the coat was only white with black markings , but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century . 
 = = Temperament = = 
 The French Spaniel has a friendly and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient . It is not a naturally aggressive dog , is eager to please and thus can be trained easily . A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master , being typically a working dog . It has a high level of stamina and requires vigorous exercise . 
 = = Health = = 
 The breed is robustly healthy with few issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions . A dermatological condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels . It is a newly recognised disorder , with symptoms becoming apparent between three and a half months and a year of age . It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German <unk> Pointer , English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels . Dogs who are affected will lick , bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections . Self amputation of claws , digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases . The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed .

 = Lysurus mokusin = 
 Lysurus mokusin , commonly known as the lantern stinkhorn , the small lizard 's claw , or the ribbed lizard claw , is a saprobic species of fungus in the family Phallaceae . The fruit body consists of a reddish , cylindrical fluted stipe that is capped with several " arms " . The arms can approach or even close in on each other to form a spire . The gleba — an olive @-@ green slimy spore mass — is carried on the outer surface of the arms . The fruit body , which has an odor comparable to " fresh dog feces " , " rotting flesh " , or " sewage " when mature , is edible in its immature " egg " stage . The fungus is native to Asia , and is also found in Australia , Europe and North America , where it is probably an introduced species . It has been used medicinally in China as an ulcer remedy . 
 = = History , taxonomy , and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described by the Catholic Priest and missionary Pierre @-@ Martial <unk> in the publication Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum <unk> <unk> ( New memoirs of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg ) ( 1775 ) , where he reported finding it near Peking ( now Beijing ) . This finding represents the earliest published scientific record of a fungus from China . <unk> 's original name for the lantern stinkhorn , Phallus mokusin , was sanctioned by Christian Hendrik Persoon in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum . In 1823 , Elias Magnus Fries transferred it to the genus Lysurus in his Systema Mycologicum . L. mokusin is the type species of the genus Lysurus . 
 In 1938 , Y. Kobayasi reported the form L. mokusin f. sinensis , which he said differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top ; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995 . Some authors have attempted to define forms of L. mokusin as new species based on the degree of separation of the apical arms . For example , to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused , the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused . As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L. mokusin , and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences , the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years . 
 L. mokusin is commonly known as the " lantern stinkhorn " , the " small lizard 's claw " , or the " ribbed lizard claw " . 
 <unk> mokusin has been included in a large @-@ scale phylogenetic analysis of <unk> and <unk> fungi published in 2006 , and was shown to form a clade with Simblum sphaerocephalum , Lysurus borealis , and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 Immature fruit bodies of L. mokusin are white , gelatinous " eggs " measuring 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter , and are attached to the ground by thickened strands of mycelium called rhizomorphs . As the fungus matures , the egg ruptures as the fruit body rapidly expands , leaving volval remnants behind at the base . The stipe of the hollow , spongy mature fruiting body has dimensions of 10 – 15 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) by 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) , and ranges in color from white to pink to red , with 4 – 6 distinct deeply grooved sides divided lengthwise by ribs . The basis of distinction between L. mokusin and other species of Lysurus is the angular form of its stipe . The sides branch out into 4 – 6 arms that are fused together at the tip to form a pointed apex , resembling a spire . As the mushroom matures , the arms may spread apart . The outer surface of the arms is coated by a brownish , slimy , foul @-@ smelling spore mass called the gleba ; its fetid odor helps it attract flies and other insects to assist in spore dispersal . The odor has been compared to " fresh dog feces " , " rotting flesh " or sewage . 
 The spores are cylindrical in shape , smooth , thin @-@ walled , and hyaline ( translucent ) , with dimensions of 4 – 6 by 2 – 2 @.@ 5 µm . Scanning electron microscopy reveals that one end of the spores has a hilar scar — an indentation in the spore wall that results during its separation from the sterigma of the basidium . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are usually eight @-@ spored , and the gleba composed of chains of roughly spherical , fusiform , ellipsoid to broadly club @-@ shaped cells that are either 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 4 by 2 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 6 µm or 37 @.@ 1 – 46 @.@ 3 by 18 – 28 µm and also mixed with filamentous cells 2 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 5 µm wide .

 This species is considered to be edible when still in the immature " egg " stage , and is thought to be a delicacy in China . When mature , its foul odor would deter most individuals from attempting consumption . The fungus has been used medicinally in China as a remedy for ulcers .

 Lysurus mokusin is saprobic , and grows solitarily or in small groups in forest litter , and wood chip mulch used in landscaping , and compost . Documented sightings of L. mokusin include Australasia , the Canary Islands , Korea , Japan , China ( Fujian Province ) , and the Bonin Islands . The species was unknown in Europe until it was reported in Italy in 1979 ; it is considered an alien species in that continent . In the United States , it has been collected from the states of California , Texas , and Washington , D.C .. 
 = Husayn ibn Hamdan = 
 Husayn ibn Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al @-@ Harith al @-@ Taghlibi was an early member of the Hamdanid family , who distinguished himself as a general for the Abbasid Caliphate and played a major role in the Hamdanids ' rise to power among the Arab tribes in the Jazira . 
 Husayn entered caliphal service in 895 , and through his co @-@ operation with the caliphal government , he established himself and his family as the leader of the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira , leading his troops to successful campaigns against the Qarmatians , Dulafids and Tulunids over the next few years . As one of the most distinguished generals of the Abbasid Caliphate , he rose in power and influence until 908 , when he was one of the leading conspirators in the abortive coup against Caliph al @-@ Muqtadir . Although the coup failed and Husayn was forced to flee the capital , he soon secured a pardon and served as governor in Jibal , where he again distinguished himself in military operations in south @-@ central Iran . In ca . 911 , he was appointed governor in Mosul , where he remained until rising in revolt in 914 / 5 , for reasons that are unclear . Defeated and captured in 916 , he was imprisoned in Baghdad , where he was executed in 918 . Through his influence , the family rose to high offices , beginning a long period during which Mosul and the entire Jazira were ruled by the Hamdanids . His nephews , Nasir al @-@ Dawla and Sayf al @-@ Dawla , went on to establish autonomous emirates in Mosul and Aleppo respectively . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Origin and early career = = = 
 Husayn was a son of the Hamdanid family 's patriarch , Hamdan ibn Hamdun . His family belonged to the Banu Taghlib tribe , established in the Jazira since before the Muslim conquests . In a pattern repeated across the Abbasid Caliphate , the Taghlibi leaders took advantage of the collapse of central caliphal authority of the during the decade @-@ long Anarchy at Samarra ( 861 – 870 ) to assert increasing control over their particular area , centred on Mosul . Hamdan established himself among the leading tribal leaders during this time , and led the resistance against caliphal attempts to restore direct control , even allying with the Kharijite rebels in the 880s . Finally , in 895 Caliph al @-@ Mu 'tadid launched a determined attack to recover the Jazira . Hamdan fled before the Caliph 's advance and was captured after a long pursuit and thrown in prison . 
 Husayn , however , who had been entrusted with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris , chose to surrender it instead , and offered his services to the Caliph . He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al @-@ Shari , thereby bringing an end to the Kharijite revolt in the Jazira . In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father , but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay , and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense . This was a major success , laying the groundwork for his own and his family 's ascent to power . In the words of the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy , 
 to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership ; to the Taghlib , and other people in the Jazira , he offered the prospect of salaries and booty ; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services . It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader , c but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al @-@ Husayn made the family fortune . 
 = = = In Abbasid service = = = 
 Husayn led his Taghlibi regiment with distinction over the next few years . He fought against the Dulafid Bakr ibn Abd al @-@ Aziz ibn Ahmad ibn Abi <unk> in the Jibal in 896 . After 903 he played a decisive role in the campaigns of Muhammad ibn Sulayman al @-@ Katib against the Qarmatians of the Syrian desert , where his experienced cavalry was crucial in countering the highly mobile Qarmatians . In 903 he participated in Muhammad 's major victory over the Qarmatian leader al @-@ Husayn ibn Zikrawayh , better known by his laqab of " Sahib al @-@ Shama " , near Hama . The Qarmatian leaders fled to the desert , but were soon captured , and brought in triumph to Baghdad . Husayn then participated as commander of the vanguard in Muhammad 's 904 – 905 campaign that ended the Tulunid dynasty and restored Syria and Egypt to direct caliphal control . Muhammad ibn Sulayman reportedly offered him the governorship of Egypt , but Husayn refused , preferring to return to Baghdad with the enormous booty he had collected . 
 On his return from Egypt , in 905 – 906 , Husayn was sent against the Banu Kalb of Syria , who had risen in revolt at the instigation of the Qarmatians . Although he drove them into the desert , the <unk> filled up the wells as they retreated , and he was unable to follow them . As a result , the rebels were able to reach the Lower Euphrates , where they defeated another Abbasid force at al @-@ <unk> and raided the hajj caravan of the Mecca pilgrims ( late 906 ) . In the end , the forces of the central government defeated the Qarmatians and drove them to flight . On their retreat back to Syria along the Euphrates , they were attacked and annihilated by Husayn in March / April 907 . Although these victories did not entirely remove the Qarmatian threat — the Qarmatians based in Bahrayn continued to remain active and raided lower Iraq — they signalled the near @-@ eradication of the sect from Syria . Husayn then subdued the remaining Kalbi rebels between the Euphrates and Aleppo , and in 907 – 908 confronted and drove back into Syria the Banu Tamim who had invaded the Jazira seeking pillage , defeating them near <unk> . 
 By 908 , this distinguished service had established Husayn as " one of the leading generals " ( Kennedy ) in the Caliphate , and enabled him to advance his own brothers to positions of power : they received various offices , the most important of which was the award of the governorship of Mosul to Husayn 's brother Abu 'l @-@ Hayja Abdallah in 905 . In December 908 , Husayn became involved in a palace plot to depose the new Caliph , al @-@ Muqtadir , in favour of the older Ibn al @-@ Mu 'tazz . Along with two others , on 17 December 908 he attacked and killed the vizier al @-@ Abbas ibn al @-@ Hasan al @-@ Jarjara 'i , who had endorsed al @-@ Muqtadir 's accession . The conspirators then sought to kill the young caliph as well , but the latter had barricaded himself in the Hasani Palace . Ibn al @-@ Mu 'tazz was proclaimed as caliph , and Husayn went to the palace to persuade al @-@ Muqtadir to surrender . However , the unexpected resistance of the palace servants under the chamberlains <unk> , Mu 'nis al @-@ Fahl and Mu 'nis al @-@ Khadim , and the plotters ' indecision , doomed the coup . Al @-@ Muqtadir prevailed , and Husayn fled from Baghdad to Mosul and to Balad . He then spent some time wandering with his followers across the Jazira . The caliph sent Husayn 's own brother , Abu 'l @-@ Hayja Abdallah , to pursue him , but Husayn managed to surprise and defeat him . This success encouraged him to contact the new vizier , Ali ibn al @-@ Furat , through the mediation of his brother Ibrahim . Although he had been a leading figure in the conspiracy , and most of the other participants in the coup were executed or imprisoned , Husayn succeeded in receiving a pardon . He was not welcomed back to Baghdad , however , but appointed governor of <unk> and Kashan in the Jibal . 
 As governor , he aided Mu 'nis al @-@ Khadim in his campaign against the Saffarid al @-@ Layth ibn Ali in <unk> and Fars , and later against the former Saffarid general and rebel <unk> and his lieutenant al @-@ <unk> . The Abbasid forces under Mu 'nis al @-@ Khadim succeeded in suppressing the rebellion by 910 / 1 , with al @-@ <unk> being captured by Husayn in person , according to a celebratory poem by the later Hamdanid poet Abu Firas . 
 Abu Firas further reports that Husayn was offered the governorship of Fars , but refused , and returned to Baghdad . Ibn al @-@ Furat , who probably still mistrusted his intentions , promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi 'a , the province encompassing the eastern Jazira , including Mosul . From this post , Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913 / 4 . Soon after , however , an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al @-@ Jarrah . The reason is unclear , but revolved around the finances of Husayn 's province . In 914 / 5 he rose in open rebellion , assembling a force of 30 @,@ 000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira , a testament to his influence there . He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him , but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu 'nis al @-@ Khadim , recalled from Egypt , he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia . He was brought to Baghdad , where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation , riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame . He was put into prison , and executed in October / November 918 on the caliph 's orders . 
 The reason for Husayn 's execution is unclear . The historian of the Hamdanid dynasty , Marius Canard , suggested that it may have been due to his involvement in a Shi 'a @-@ inspired conspiracy , possibly connected to the dismissal of Ibn al @-@ Furat from his second vizierate at the same period , or with the rebellion of the autonomous governor of Adharbayjan , Yusuf ibn Abi 'l @-@ Saj , whom al @-@ Muqtadir may have suspected of ties with the imprisoned Husayn . As Canard writes , " in any case the caliph must have feared that if Husayn were released he would once again start a revolt , either through a desire for independence or as a Shi 'i . In order to avoid attempts by those ( probably numerous ) who desired his release to secure it by force , the caliph preferred to take a measure which put a stop to all intrigue " . 
 Despite Husayn 's rebellion and execution , the Hamdanid family continued to prosper : his brothers were soon released from captivity , and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu 'nis al @-@ Khadim and sharing in the ups and downs of the court politics in Baghdad . It was Abdallah 's two sons , however , al @-@ Hasan and Ali , better known by their honorific titles Nasir al @-@ Dawla and Sayf al @-@ Dawla , who established the family as the ruling dynasty in the semi @-@ independent emirates of Mosul ( until 978 ) and Aleppo ( until 1002 ) respectively . 
 = = Character and assessment = = 
 According to Canard , Husayn " stands out more clearly than the supreme commander Mu 'nis or any other military leaders " of the period for his ability and valour , as well as for his restive and ambitious spirit . He was also singled out in being of Arab descent , an unusual case among the Caliphate 's senior leaders of the period . Canard assesses him as unusually open @-@ minded , and attuned to the ideological turmoil and ferment in the Muslim world of his time , as indicated by his contact with the Sufi mystic al @-@ <unk> , who dedicated a work on politics to Husayn . Indeed , according to Canard , Husayn 's espousal of Shi 'ism , and his participation in the abortive coup of 908 , can best be seen in light of a desire — typical of Shi 'a sympathisers — for a renewal of the Caliphate and the establishment of an " ideal Muslim government " , something which the corrupt and decadent Abbasids were no longer capable of . Finally , although it fell to his brother to found the actual Hamdanid dynasty , it was Husayn who first gave his family a taste of power and glory , for which he was later celebrated in the poetry of Abu Firas . 
 = Reflector sight = 
 A reflector sight or reflex sight is an optical device that allows the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed on the field of view . These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror ( such as an illuminated reticle ) will look like it is sitting in front of the viewer at infinity . Reflector sights employ some sort of " reflector " to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time , either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate , or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector . Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer 's eye position , removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices . 
 Since their invention in 1900 , reflector sights have come to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons . They were used on fighter aircraft , in a limited capacity in World War I , widely used in World War II , and still used as the base component in many types of modern head @-@ up displays . They have been used in other types of ( usually large ) weapons as well , such as anti @-@ aircraft gun sights , anti tank gun sights , and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view , and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function . There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight , with a red light @-@ emitting diode ( LED ) as its reticle , making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time . 
 Reflector sights are also used in civilian applications such as sights on surveying equipment , optical telescope pointing aids , and camera <unk> . 
 = = Design = = 
 Reflector sights work by using a lens or an image @-@ forming curved mirror with a luminous or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus , creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle . The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer ( looking through the beam splitter or mirror ) will see the image at the focus of the collimating optics superimposed in the sight 's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity . Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light , light that is nearly parallel , the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with , i.e. with no parallax at infinity . The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window . But this also means , for targets closer than infinity , sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge . Eye movement perpendicular to the device 's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics . 
 A common type ( used in applications such as aircraft gun sights ) uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter . This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components , the lens and the beam splitter / glass plate . The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90 ° to the optical path making lighting difficult , usually needing additional electric illumination , condensing lenses , etc . A more compact type replaces the lens / beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining the image of an offset reticle . This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms . It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror 's focus . The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity . This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van <unk> in 1932 , originally as a camera viewfinder , and was also used as a gunsight on WW2 bazookas : the US M9 and M9A1 " Bazooka " featured the <unk> folding " Reflecting Sight Assembly " . 
 The viewing portion of a reflector sight does not use any refractive optical elements , it is simply a projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye . This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use , as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights . A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes : depending on design constraints their field of view is the user 's naked eye field of view , and their non @-@ focusing collimated nature means they don 't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief . Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes , usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight , but this re @-@ introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief . The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function . <unk> illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations , and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails . 
 = = History = = 
 The idea of a reflector sight originated in 1900 with Irish optical designer and telescope maker Howard Grubb in patent <unk> Grubb conceived of his " Gun Sight for large and small Ordnance " as a better alternative to the difficult to use iron sight while avoiding the telescopic sight 's limited field of view , greater apparent target speed , parallax errors , and the danger of keeping the eye against an eye stop . In the 1901 the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society he described his invention as : 
 It would be possible to conceive an arrangement by which a fine beam of light like that from a search light would be projected from a gun in the direction of its axis and so adjusted as to correspond with the line of fire so that wherever the beam of light impinged upon an object the shot would hit . This arrangement would be of course equally impracticable for obvious reasons but it is instanced to show that a beam of light has the necessary qualifications for our purposes . 
 Now the sight which forms the subject of this Paper attains a similar result not by projecting an actual spot of light or an image on the object but by projecting what is called in optical language a virtual image upon it . 
 It was noted soon after its invention that the sight could be a good alternative to iron sights and also had uses in surveying and measuring equipment . The reflector sight was first used on German fighter aircraft in 1918 and widely adopted on all kinds of fighter and bomber aircraft in the 1930s . By World War II the reflector sight was being used on many types of weapons besides aircraft , including anti @-@ aircraft guns , naval guns , anti tank weapons , and many other weapon where the user needed the simplicity and quick target acquisition nature of the sight . Through their development in the 1930s and into WWII the sight was also being referred to in some applications by the abbreviation " reflex sight " . 
 = = Weapon sights = = 
 Reflector sights were invented as an improved gun @-@ sight and since their invention they have been adapted to many types of weapons . When used with different types of guns , reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights ( sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points that have to be aligned ) . Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and simultaneously focus on the rear sight , the front sight , a target at different distances , and align all three planes of focus to achieve a hit . The reflector sight 's single , parallax @-@ free virtual image , in focus with the target , removes this aiming problem , helping poor , average , and expert shooters alike . 
 Since the collimated image produced by the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity , the sight has an error circle equal to the diameter of the collimating optics for any target at a finite distance . Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error . For larger targets at a distance ( given the non @-@ magnifying , quick target acquisitions nature of the sight ) this aiming error is considered trivial . On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle in the middle of the optical window ( sighting down its optical axis ) . Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance . This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance ( somewhere around a desired target range of 25 @-@ 50 yards ) . 
 Compared to standard telescopic sights , a reflector sight can be held at any distance from the eye ( does not require a designed eye relief ) , and at almost any angle , without distorting the image of the target or reticle . They are often used with both eyes open ( the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye 's unobstructed view ) , giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view . Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief , they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically @-@ convenient mounting position on a weapon . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 The earliest record of the reflector sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918 . The optical firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> of Berlin , working from the Grubb patents , developed 2 versions what came to be known as the <unk> Reflector Sight . Both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim the plane 's machine guns . One version was used in operational trials on the Albatros <unk> fighter biplane and Fokker <unk> fighter triplane . There was some interest in this sight after World War I but reflector sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until the 1930s , first by the French , then by most other major <unk> . These sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft , they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights . 
 Reflector sights as aircraft gun @-@ sights have many advantages . The pilot / gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely as they did in two @-@ point mechanical sights , head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator , mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens . The sight does not interfere with the overall view , particularly when the collimator light is turned off . Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting . 
 The optical nature of the reflector sight meant it was possible to feed other information into field of view , such as modifications of the aiming point due to deflection determined by input from a gyroscope . 1939 saw the development by the British of the first of these gyro gunsights , reflector sights adjusted by gyroscope for the aircraft 's speed and rate of turn , enabling the display of a lead @-@ adjusted sighting reticle that lagged the actual " boresight " of the weapon ( s ) , allowing the boresight to lead the target in a turn by the proper amount for an effective strike 
 As reflector sight designs advanced after World War II , giving the pilot more and more information , they eventually evolved into the head up display ( HUD ) . The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at the focus of the collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead @-@ finding computer and radar , but also various aircraft indicators ( such as an artificial horizon , compass , altitude and airspeed indicators ) , facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings .

 The idea of attaching a reflector sight to a firearm has been around since its invention in 1900 . Soon after World War II models appeared for rifles and shotguns including the <unk> shotgun sight ( 1945 ) , which used a curved semi @-@ reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle , and the Giese electric gunsight ( 1947 ) , which had a battery @-@ powered illuminated reticle . Later types included the <unk> @-@ Point ( 1970 ) and the Thompson Insta @-@ Sight . Both were beam @-@ splitter type reflector sights that used ambient light : illuminating a green crosshair in the Insta @-@ Sight , and a red plastic rod " light pipe " that produced a red aiming spot reticle in the <unk> @-@ Point . 
 The mid- to late 1970s saw the introduction of what are usually referred to as red dot sights , a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point . The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light @-@ emitting diode ( LED ) at its focus . Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight : there is no need for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle ; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum , passing through most other light ; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power , allowing battery @-@ powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours . 
 Reflector sights for military firearms ( usually referred to as reflex sights ) took a long time to be adopted . The US House Committee on Armed Services noted as far back as 1975 on the suitability of the use of reflex sight for the M16 , but the US military did not widely introduce reflector sights until the early 2000s with the <unk> <unk> red dot sight , designated the " M68 Close Combat Optic " .

 Many reticle illumination and pattern options are available . Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights , fiber optic light collectors , and even tritium capsules . Some sights are specifically designed to be visible when viewed through night vision devices . The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds . Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead , to aid precision aiming and range estimation , and still others provide selectable patterns . 
 Sights that use dot <unk> are almost invariably measured in minutes of angle , or " MOA " . MOA is a convenient measure for shooters using English units , since 1 MOA subtends approximately 1 inch ( 25 mm ) at a distance of 100 yards ( 91 m ) , which makes MOA a handy unit to use in ballistics . The 5 MOA ( 1 @.@ 5 mrad ) dot is small enough not to obscure most targets , and large enough to quickly acquire a proper " sight picture " . For many types of action shooting , a larger dot is preferred ; 7 ( 2 @.@ 0 mrad ) , 10 ( 2 @.@ 9 mrad ) , 15 ( 4 @.@ 4 mrad ) or even 20 MOA ( 5 @.@ 8 mrad ) dots or rings are used ; often these will be combined with horizontal and / or vertical lines to provide a level reference . 
 Most sights have either active or passive adjustments for the reticle brightness , which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions . A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of night vision in low @-@ light conditions , while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight .

 Modern optical reflector sights designed for firearms and other uses fall into two housing @-@ configurations : tubed and open . 
 Tube sights look similar to standard telescopic sights , with a cylindrical tube containing the optics . Many tube sights offer the option of interchangeable filters ( such as polarizing or haze @-@ reducing filters ) , glare @-@ reducing sunshades , and conveniently protective " flip @-@ up " lens covers . 
 Open sights ( also known as " mini reflex sights " and " mini red dots " ) take advantage of the fact that the reflector sight 's only optical element , the optical window , doesn 't need any housing at all . This configuration consists of a base with just the necessary reflective surface for collimating the reticle mounted on it . Due to their diminished profile , open sights do not usually accommodate filters and other accessory options typically supported by tube designs .
