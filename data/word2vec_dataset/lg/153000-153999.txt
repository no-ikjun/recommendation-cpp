 In para @-@ Alpine events , this classification is grouped with sitting classes who are seeded to start after visually impaired classes and classes in the slalom and giant slalom . In downhill , Super @-@ G and Super Combined , this same group competes after the visually impaired classes and before standing classes . A skier is allowed one push from the starting position at the start of the race : no one is allowed to run while pushing them . In cross @-@ country and biathlon events , this classification is grouped with other sitting classes . The IPC advises event organisers to run the men 's sit @-@ ski group first , and the women 's sit @-@ ski group section , with the visually impaired and standing skiers following . If the competitor skis off the course during a para @-@ Nordic race , they may be assisted back onto the course where they left it by a race official . Skiers cannot use their legs to break or steer during the race . 
 Skiers in this class may injure themselves while skiing . Between 1994 and 2006 , the German national para @-@ Alpine skiing team had a skier in the LW12 class that had an injury while skiing . The skier fractured their wrist at the 2002 Winter Paralympics . This class has a higher rate of " plexus brachialis distorsion and a higher rate of shoulder injuries " compared to able bodied skiers .

 = First Roumanian @-@ American Congregation = 
 The First Roumanian @-@ American Congregation , also known as Congregation Shaarey Shomayim ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> , " Gates of Heaven " ) , or the <unk> <unk> ( Yiddish for " Romanian synagogue " ) , was an Orthodox Jewish congregation which , for over 100 years , occupied a historic building at 89 – 93 Rivington Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , New York . 
 Those who organized the congregation in 1885 were part of a substantial wave of Romanian @-@ Jewish immigrants , most of whom settled in the Lower East Side . The Rivington Street building , built around 1860 , had previously been a church , then a synagogue , then a church again , and had been extensively remodeled in 1889 . It was transformed into a synagogue for a second time when the First Roumanian @-@ American congregation purchased it in 1902 and again remodeled it . 
 The synagogue became famous as the " Cantor 's Carnegie Hall " , because of its high ceiling , good acoustics , and seating for up to 1 @,@ 800 people . <unk> Rosenblatt , Moshe Koussevitzky , <unk> <unk> , Moishe Oysher , Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker were all cantors there . Red Buttons sang in the choir , George Burns was a member , and Edward G. Robinson had his Bar Mitzvah there . 
 The congregation 's membership was in the thousands in the 1940s , but by the early 2000s had declined to around 40 , as Jews moved out of the Lower East Side . Though its building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 , the congregation was reluctant to accept outside assistance in maintaining it . In December 2005 , water damage was found in the structural beams , and services were moved to the living room of the rabbi 's mother . In January 2006 , the synagogue 's roof collapsed , and the building was demolished two months later . 
 = = Origins = = 
 = = = First Roumanian @-@ American / Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim = = = 
 From 1881 through 1914 , approximately 2 million Jews immigrated to the United States from Europe . An estimated three @-@ quarters of them settled in New York City , primarily in the Lower East Side . Over 75 @,@ 000 of these immigrants were from Romania , where Jews faced antisemitic laws , violence and expulsion . These hardships , combined with low crop yields and economic depression , resulted in 30 percent of the Jews in Romania emigrating to the United States . 
 Romanian Jewish immigrants in New York City gravitated to a fifteen @-@ block area bounded by Allen , Ludlow , Houston and Grand streets . This " Romanian quarter " became the most densely populated part of the Lower East Side , with 1 @,@ 500 to 1 @,@ 800 people per block . These immigrants founded the First Roumanian @-@ American congregation , also known as Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim . 
 The origins of the congregation are disputed ; its establishment in 1885 may have been a re @-@ organization of a congregation originally founded in 1860 . Located initially close to the Romanian quarter at 70 Hester Street , and later situated at the heart of it with the move to Rivington Street , the synagogue was the preferred house of worship for the quarter 's inhabitants . 
 = = = Rivington Street building = = = 
 The Rivington Street building was constructed as a Protestant church around 1860 by the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church , which served the area 's large German immigrant community . In November 1864 the building was sold to the Orthodox German @-@ Jewish Congregation Shaaray <unk> ( " Gates of the Heavens " ) , which had been founded in 1841 . Though its Hebrew name was essentially the same as that used by the First Roumanian @-@ American congregation — Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim — which later purchased the building in 1902 , the two congregations were unrelated . 
 By the late 1880s , the German @-@ Jewish community had mostly moved from the Lower East Side . In 1889 , Congregation Shaaray <unk> moved to 216 East 15th Street , near Second Avenue , selling the Rivington Street building to the New York City Church Extension and Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church , which built or purchased churches , missions , and Sunday schools in New York City . 
 The Church Extension and Missionary Society engaged J. Cleaveland Cady to design major alterations to the structure . Cady was , at the time , New York 's most famous church architect , and had designed many other public institutional buildings , including university buildings , hospitals and museums . His work included the original Metropolitan Opera building ( since demolished ) , the Richardsonian Romanesque West 78th Street wing of the American Museum of Natural History , and several other buildings for the Church Extension and Missionary Society . The renovations cost approximately $ 36 @,@ 000 ( today $ 948 @,@ 000 ) , and included an entirely new Romanesque Revival facade in the reddish @-@ orange brick that Cady also used on several other churches . 
 Renamed the Allen Street Methodist Episcopal Church ( or Allen Street Memorial Church ) , the Rivington Street building 's new purpose was to " attract Jewish immigrants seeking conversion " . It was , however , unsuccessful in this endeavor . In 1895 , the church 's pastor stated , " The existence of the church here attracts few . Our audiences are small , and contain almost no Jews . " 
 = = Purchase and renovation by First Roumanian @-@ American = = 
 In 1902 , the First Roumanian @-@ American congregation / Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim purchased the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society to satisfy a need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side 's rapidly growing Romanian @-@ Jewish population . At the time , the property was valued at $ 95 @,@ 000 ( today $ 2 @.@ 6 million ) . The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation , and to honor those contributing $ 10 or more , names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary . The most generous gift was $ 500 , at a time when $ 10 was two weeks ' pay . The congregation also took out two mortgages ; one for $ 50 @,@ 000 ( today $ 1 @.@ 37 million ) with the Title Insurance Company , and a second for $ 30 @,@ 000 ( today $ 820 @,@ 000 ) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society . 
 The congregation commissioned Charles E. Reid for extensive renovations , at a cost of $ 6 @,@ 000 ( today $ 164 @,@ 000 ) . The " eclectic Byzantine " remodeling involved converting it for Jewish use by removing Christian symbols and adding a Torah ark and bimah ( central platform from which the Torah is read ) at the sanctuary 's north end . The renovations retained the original " horseshoe @-@ shaped gallery supported by twelve Ionic columns " and wooden pews with reading shelves ( likely from the 1889 Cady renovation ) , but a number of structural changes were made . Steel beams were added to support the weight of the ark and bimah , the rear wall was re @-@ built and the gallery extended to meet it , two skylights were added ( a concave stained glass one and a clear glass one over the ark ) , and at the front of the building , on top of the shallow ( 14 feet deep ) fourth @-@ story attic , an equally shallow fifth @-@ story attic was added . 
 The completed structure filled almost the entire width of its approximately 70 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 21 m ) by 100 @-@ foot @-@ deep ( 30 m ) lot , and seated 1 @,@ 600 to 1 @,@ 800 . Dedicated in late December 1902 , it was the Lower East Side 's largest synagogue and only Romanesque one , and it became an " architectural and public showpiece " . 
 = = Early activities = = 
 By 1903 the synagogue was well established on Rivington Street , and , due to its capacity and prominence , was often the site of significant or mass meetings . In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of Reform rabbi and Zionist leader Gustav Gottheil was held there , and a similar service was held for Theodore Herzl the following year . At the latter service , which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis , Herzl was not eulogized , nor was his name mentioned . 
 The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America ( <unk> ) held its third annual convention at the synagogue in June 1903 , attended by around 100 delegates , and presided over by the organization 's president , Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes . The most important resolutions adopted at that meeting were one which deprecated the granting of a get ( religious divorce document ) to — or allowing subsequent re @-@ marriage by — people who had not first obtained a civil divorce , and the request that congregations with mostly foreign @-@ born members " secure an English @-@ speaking rabbi for the benefit of their American @-@ born English @-@ speaking children " . Pereira Mendes spoke in favor of the creation of a committee to bring victims of the Kishinev pogrom to the United States , and against a proposal by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations ( UAHC ) that the Jewish Sabbath be moved to Sunday . Pereira Mendes also announced that the <unk> would " unite " with the UAHC and other national " religious , philanthropic , or educational " Jewish organizations in Washington " to discuss the subjects of vital concern to Judaism and Jews " , while rejecting the proposition that " the main topic of the discussion at the first congress shall be the immigration problem . " 
 At the meeting Albert Lucas also spoke out strongly against attempts by Christian groups to proselytize Jewish children in nurseries and kindergartens . Ostensibly to combat this proselytization , in 1903 the congregation was one of several New York City synagogues that allowed Lucas the use of its premises for free religious classes , " open to all children of the neighborhood " . 
 In December 1905 a mass meeting was held at the synagogue to protest massacres of Jews in Russia and mourn their deaths , and the congregation donated $ 500 to a fund for the sufferers . In March 1909 Orthodox groups held meetings there to organize opposition to the constitution and make @-@ up of Judah Leon Magnes 's <unk> , an overarching organization intended to represent all of New York 's Jews , which lasted until 1922 . A mass meeting of local residents and businessmen to combat Lower East Side gangsters was held at the synagogue in 1913 . 
 The Rivington Street synagogue was also a preferred venue for airing issues relevant specifically to Romanian @-@ American Jews . In 1905 it was the site of New York City 's only memorial service honoring United States Secretary of State John Hay , who had worked on behalf of oppressed Jews in Romania . In 1908 , the synagogue hosted a meeting of over 30 religious organizations representing Romanian @-@ American Jews , at which the formation of a federation of those organizations was proposed , and again in 1916 hosted a similar meeting of " two hundred delegates representing thirty @-@ five organizations ... to plan incorporation of the American League of Rumanian Jews " . At the latter meeting steps were taken to raise $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( today $ 22 million ) for oppressed Jews in Romania , and to campaign for their " equal rights and their emancipation from <unk> " . 
 The congregation carried out extensive charity campaigns during the Passover season ; by 1905 the congregation was distributing wagon @-@ loads of matzos to poor Jews so they could celebrate the holiday . By 1907 – 1908 membership had risen to 500 ( up from 160 in 1900 ) , the Talmud Torah had 250 students , and the synagogue 's annual revenues were $ 25 @,@ 000 ( today $ 630 @,@ 000 ) . The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908 , and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction . 
 Members who would become famous included George Burns and Bucharest @-@ born Edward G. Robinson , who had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1906 . Robinson would later laugh that his propensity for taking the stage was demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech in the history of the congregation — " but the men sat still and listened " . 
 In 1911 First Roumanian @-@ American celebrated its ten @-@ year jubilee at the synagogue . Guest speakers included United Synagogue of America president Solomon Schechter , Congressman Henry M. <unk> , and the principal speaker was William Jay Gaynor , then Mayor of New York City . 
 Membership had grown to 350 families by 1919 . The congregational school held classes daily , and had 4 teachers and 300 students . The American Jewish Year Book listed the synagogue 's rabbi as Abraham <unk> , a well @-@ known cantor . 
 = = " Cantor 's Carnegie Hall " = = 
 The synagogue 's sanctuary had a high ceiling and " opera house " characteristics , and was renowned for its " exquisite " or " magnificent " acoustics . Known as " the Cantor 's Carnegie Hall " , First Roumanian @-@ American became a center for cantorial music , and many of the greatest cantors of the 20th century led services there . <unk> Rosenblatt , Moshe Koussevitzky , <unk> <unk> and Moishe Oysher all sang there , as did Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker before they became famous opera singers . Having a reputation for good cantorial singing had a positive impact on a synagogue 's finances ; congregations depended on the funds from the sale of tickets for seats on the High Holy Days , and the better the cantor , the greater the attendance . 
 Red Buttons sang at the synagogue with Rosenblatt in 1927 , and when visiting the synagogue almost 70 years later could still remember the songs . Though his family actually went to a " small storefront synagogue " , Buttons was discovered , at age eight , by a talent scout for Rosenblatt 's <unk> Choir , who heard him singing near the intersection of Fifth Street and Avenue C , at a " pickle stand " . Buttons would sing in the choir for three years . Eddie Cantor has also been claimed as a choir member , though this is less likely . 
 Oysher — " the greatest of all <unk> of cantorial singing " — became the synagogue 's cantor in 1935 , and the congregation 's membership peaked in the 1940s , when it numbered in the thousands . In a 1956 interview by Brendan Gill in The New Yorker magazine , Oysher described First Roumanian @-@ American as " the most orthodox Orthodox synagogue in town " . Oysher died of a heart attack two years later " at the young age of 51 " . The week of his death , he had said , " half @-@ jokingly " , that he wanted only one person to deliver his eulogy : Chaim <unk> , rabbi of the First Roumanian @-@ American Congregation . <unk> had been born in <unk> ( then in Poland ) in 1899 , and moved to the United States in 1927 , to serve as rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of Providence , Rhode Island . He became rabbi of First Roumanian @-@ American in 1932 , a post he filled until 1962 , and was a member of the executive board of the Agudath <unk> . He died in September 1968 . 
 = = Subsequent building renovations and appearance in the 1990s = = 
 In the years following First Roumanian @-@ American 's initial purchase and renovation of the Rivington Street building , the congregation made a number of other structural alterations . These included : 
 1916 – 1917 : Adding fire escapes on the east and west sides of the building . 
 1920s or later : Installing individual theatre @-@ style seats in the gallery . 
 1938 – 1943 : Removing the staircase to the fourth floor , leaving access only from the fire escapes . 
 1948 – 1950 : Reconstructing the portico with some of the existing stone and brick , and adding new " fireproof steel stairs with terrazzo treads " and light @-@ yellow and blue tinted glass windows on the east and west walls of the sanctuary , and other improvements . 
 1964 : Adding a kitchen to the basement " for social purposes " . 
 In the 1990s , the north @-@ facing orange @-@ red brick facade presented a large , compound arched brick and stone portico , with deeply recessed doors . This arch was " supported by three carved columns , two twisted columns , and a central column with a chevron pattern , each with a Byzantine @-@ style capital " , and had a stone coping on top . Carved into the portico arch in capital letters were the words " First Roumanian @-@ American Congregation " . 
 Originally there were large rectangular window openings on the ground floor on each side of the portico , each divided into two windows , but these had been bricked in by the 1990s . The second- and third @-@ floor windows above them were originally stained glass but later clear glass , each second @-@ floor window having eight square panes , and each third @-@ floor window six panes topped with an arch . " Ornamental red terra cotta panels " separated the second- and third @-@ floor openings . On the third floor , centered above the portico , was a similar window , this one flanked by two short recessed twisted columns , each " supporting a stone lintel incised with a cupid 's @-@ bow ornament " . Similar lintels capped three @-@ story pilasters at each corner of the facade , and these pilasters and lintels extended around the northeast and northwest corners . The six @-@ paned windows were each capped with a roundel and three spandrels , " two large and one small " , and these retained their original stained glass . 
 The shallow fourth floor was demarcated on the bottom by " a heavy frieze and corbelled brick cornice " , which supported " eight round @-@ arched windows with molded brick voussoirs ... massed in a 3 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 pattern " . By the 1990s these had also been bricked in . The attic on top of the fourth floor , added during the 1902 – 1903 renovations , was " capped by a band of small red terra @-@ cotta blocks " . 
 The sides of the building were faced with plain brick , and flanked by narrow alleys with iron gates at each entrance . The walls generally had plain windows , though there was a round arched one on each side of the fourth floor . One fire escape remained , in the east alley . 
 Inside , the building held a two @-@ story balconied main sanctuary and dining room , in addition to the basement kitchen and bathrooms . The heating system was in a sub @-@ basement . The front ark and wood bimah in the sanctuary were ornate ; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated , and the bimah was also decorated , and supported a large bronze candelabra . The sanctuary floor was wood , with wood wainscoting and plaster walls .

 = = Decline = = 
 Over time the synagogue appealed to a broader constituency than just Roumanian @-@ American Jews . Nevertheless , membership declined during the latter half of the 20th century as the upwardly mobile Jewish population of the Lower East Side moved to north Manhattan , Brooklyn , and the Bronx . First Roumanian @-@ American was particularly affected : as it was an Orthodox congregation , in order to attend Sabbath services its members had to live within walking distance . 
 In 1980 First Roumanian @-@ American was one of the few congregations on the Lower East Side to still have its own Talmud Torah . This school had been housed in a small building on the east side of the synagogue that had formerly served as the church rectory . The congregation was eventually forced to sell the building , but the new owners retained the school 's carved sign . 
 Rabbi Mordecai Mayer , who had led the congregation for 20 years , died in 1981 , two days before his 66th birthday . Born in <unk> ( then in Poland ) , he had graduated from the <unk> Lublin Yeshiva , and had emigrated to the United States in 1936 . He had , for 40 years , conducted programs on Jewish topics on radio station <unk> , then owned by The Forward . In the 1970s he was a columnist for the Yiddish weekly <unk> Journal , and was the author of the English @-@ language books Israel 's Wisdom in Modern Life ( 1949 ) and Seeing Through Believing ( 1973 ) . He was succeeded by Jacob Spiegel . 
 In the early 1990s the congregation could still be assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week , as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops . By 1996 , however , the membership was down to around two dozen , and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement , as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain . 
 With the decline in membership , the building deteriorated . In 1997 the congregation received a grant for preservation and repair of the structure from the New York Landmarks Conservancy , and the following year received $ 4 @,@ 000 from the Landmarks Conservancy 's Sacred Sites program for roof truss repairs . That same year the synagogue building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places at the local level . In the fall of that year Shimon Attie 's laser visual work Between Dreams and History was projected onto the synagogue and neighboring buildings for three weeks . 
 Spiegel had a heart attack and died in 2001 , leaving charge of the synagogue to the youngest of his three sons , Rabbi Shmuel Spiegel . The other sons , Rabbi Gershon and Rabbi Ari , were , respectively , synagogue president and assistant rabbi . In June 2003 the name " Rabbi Yaakov Spiegel Way " was given collectively to the corner of Rivington Street and Ludlow Street near the synagogue location and the stretch of Rivington in front of the synagogue . 
 The roof had long been in bad shape by the time of Jacob Spiegel 's death in 2001 and it was threatening to collapse . In December of that year , Shmuel Spiegel managed to raise $ 25 @,@ 000 for emergency repairs . However , despite offering <unk> ( the traditional Sabbath lunch stew ) at the Sabbath morning <unk> , Spiegel had to search local streets to make the ten men for the minyan . In 2004 the regular membership hovered around 40 . Spiegel kept the synagogue running at an annual cost of around $ 75 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Collapse = = 
 On January 22 , 2006 , the roof of the synagogue caved in , severely damaging the main sanctuary . Joshua Cohen , writing in The Forward in 2008 , described the roof as " falling in respectfully , careful not to disturb the local nightclubs , or the wine and <unk> newly opened across the street . " No one was injured , and a party to celebrate that fact was later held at the <unk> Sopher Synagogue on Clinton Street . 
 The National Trust for Historic Preservation issued a press release about the collapse , in which it described " older religious properties , like the First Roumanian @-@ American Synagogue " as " national treasures " , and stated : 
 The roof collapse at First Roumanian – American Synagogue this week demonstrates that houses of worship must have access to necessary technical assistance , staff and board training , and the development of new funding sources in order to save these landmarks of spirituality , cultural tradition , and community service . 
 Amy Waterman , executive director of a project to repair and renovate the Eldridge Street Synagogue , noted in The Forward : 
 Synagogues like the First Roumanian @-@ American Congregation , more familiarly known as the <unk> shul , were the first spiritual homes for successive waves of European immigrants . They were built more than 100 years ago , and just like the bridges and tunnels of New York City , they 're bound to fail if not attended to . 
 Though First Roumanian @-@ American had hosted a wedding as recently as October 30 , 2005 , the sanctuary had not been in regular use for over 10 years as a result of the difficulty maintaining it . Services had been held instead on a lower floor , and by autumn 2005 the roof was so porous that on Yom Kippur — even in the basement — they prayed " with buckets " . After a contractor found water damage in the ceiling beams in early December , the three Spiegel brothers had been holding services in their mother Chana 's apartment at 383 Grand Street , where they placed the congregation 's 15 Torah scrolls following the roof cave @-@ in . The synagogue 's historic ark was also retrieved from the ruins . According to Shmuel Spiegel , " the insurance company [ was ] playing hardball . " 
 Because the building had never been registered as a National Historic Landmark , after the collapse it was demolished on March 3 , 2006 . The New York City Department of Buildings said that the decision to demolish was the congregation 's , but congregational vice president Joshua Shainberg said the Department of Buildings had left them no choice : " The Department of Buildings told us , ' You are to demolish it or we are to demolish it . ' There were figures of up to $ 1 @.@ 5 million for demolition . " At the time of the building 's collapse , the Spiegel brothers vowed that it would be re @-@ built , but not nearly as large : " perhaps 20 feet high by 60 feet deep by 75 feet wide , which would cost about $ 2 million to $ 3 million . " 
 Richard Price described the collapsed building in his novel Lush Life , writing that , after the demolition , only the rear wall with a Star of David in stained glass remained : " The candlesticks were standing up in the rubble , and the whole place looked like an experimental stage set — like Shakespeare in the Park . " By October 2007 all that was left was " an empty lot dotted with weeds and crushed bricks " . In a 2008 addendum to his book Dough : A Memoir , Mort <unk> described the remains as " a multimillion dollar real estate opportunity masquerading as a vacant , weed @-@ strewn lot . " 
 = = Controversy = = 
 The collapse of the roof , and subsequent destruction of the synagogue , generated widespread concern and criticism among preservationists , who blamed Jacob and Shmuel Spiegel — a charge the family rejected . 
 Julia Vitullo @-@ Martin , senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and director of its Center for Rethinking Development , stated that First Roumanian @-@ American 's roof collapse and subsequent destruction dramatized an " ongoing though undocumented synagogue crisis — particularly in poor neighborhoods " and revealed a broader problem peculiar to Jewish houses of worship : 
 Since Judaism , unlike Catholicism , lacks a hierarchy that could keep track of how many [ synagogues ] are abandoned and demolished , the breadth of the problem is more difficult to ascertain . 
 In the years preceding the building 's collapse , the congregation had received offers of assistance from the New York Landmarks Conservancy , the National Trust for Historic Preservation , Lower East Side Conservancy , and the New York State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation , though reports on the amounts and types of assistance offered varied . The congregation , then under the leadership of Jacob Spiegel , rejected them . Joel Kaplan of the Lower East Side Conservancy stated that the congregation " didn 't want the several hundred thousand dollars in <unk> grants that went to other Lower East <unk> , money that could have kept the shul in repair . " 
 The reasons given for this rejection also varied . According to Vitullo @-@ Martin , writing in The Wall Street Journal , Shmuel Spiegel was not sure why the offers were rejected , as the records were " buried in the rubble " . Vitullo @-@ Martin speculated that congregants might have hesitated to agree to a condition that they would need permission from the state for any sale or alteration of the building during the following 20 years . According to The New York Times , Spiegel stated that the repairs required were so extensive that the congregation could not have made them even with this financial assistance . According to The Jewish Week , Spiegel stated that the congregation " didn 't want outside interference " , was " uncomfortable with the idea of being <unk> and having to answer to landmark guidelines " , and was also uncomfortable with making part of the building into a " museum of past glory " , as others nearby had done .

 A few blocks away , the Eldridge Street Synagogue survives . Why this synagogue was renovated , and the First Roumanian torn down , is a question for the rabbis and the historians . 
 = Osteopathic medicine in the United States = 
 Osteopathic Medicine is a branch of the medical profession in the United States . Osteopathic physicians ( <unk> ) are equivalent to both Doctors of Medicine ( <unk> ) and Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS ) doctors in the United Kingdom and are considered fully licensed physicians ( medical doctors ) to practice medicine and surgery in all 50 states and are recognized in sixty five other countries , including all Canadian provinces . 
 Frontier physician Andrew Taylor Still founded the profession as a rejection of the prevailing system of medical thought of the 19th century . Still 's techniques relied on manipulation of joints and bones , to diagnose and treat illness , and he called his practices “ osteopathy ” . By the middle of the 20th century , the profession had moved closer to mainstream medicine , adopting modern public health and biomedical principles . American " osteopaths " became " osteopathic medical doctors " , ultimately achieving full practice rights as allopathic medical doctors in all 50 states , including serving in the U.S. armed forces as physicians . 
 In the 21st century , the training of osteopathic medical physicians in the United States is equivalent to the training of Doctors of Medicine ( <unk> ) . Osteopathic medical physicians attend four years of medical school followed by an internship and a minimum two years of residency . They use all conventional methods of diagnosis and treatment . Though still trained in osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) , the modern derivative of Still 's techniques , they work in all specialties of medicine . OMT is a skill they use often in family practice , sports medicine , emergency medicine , but OMT is not commonly used in specialties such as dermatology , surgery , or other fields that do not lend themselves to correcting the body with their hands . 
 In modern medicine , any distinction between the M.D. and the D.O. professions has eroded steadily ; diminishing numbers of D.O. graduates enter primary care fields , fewer use OMT , and increasing numbers of osteopathic graduates choose to train in non @-@ osteopathic residency programs . An osteopathic physician ( DO ) is a fully licensed , patient @-@ centered medical doctor . DO has full medical practice rights throughout the United States and in 44 countries abroad . 
 Discussions about the future of modern medicine frequently debate the utility of maintaining separate , distinct pathways for educating physicians in the United States . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 Physicians and surgeons who graduate from osteopathic medical schools are known as physicians or osteopathic medical doctors . Upon graduation , they are conferred a professional doctorate , the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine ( D.O. ) . 
 Osteopathic curricula in other countries differ from those in the United States . European @-@ trained practitioners of osteopathic manipulative techniques are referred to as " osteopaths " : their scope of practice excludes most medical therapies and relies more on osteopathic manipulative medicine and alternative medical modalities . While it was once common for D.O. graduates in the United States to refer to themselves as ' osteopaths , ' this term is now considered archaic and those holding the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree are commonly referred to as ' osteopathic medical physicians ' .

 Currently , there are 30 accredited osteopathic medical schools offering education in 42 locations across the United States and 141 accredited U.S. M.D. medical schools . 
 In 1960 , there were 13 @,@ 708 physicians who were graduates of the 5 osteopathic medical schools . 
 In 2002 , there were 49 @,@ 210 physicians from 19 osteopathic medical schools . 
 Between 1980 and 2005 , the number of osteopathic graduates per year increased over 250 percent from about 1 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 800 . This number is expected to approach 5 @,@ 000 by 2015 . 
 In 2015 , there were 31 colleges of osteopathic medicine in 45 locations . One in four medical students in the United States is enrolled in an osteopathic medical school .

 By 2020 , the number of osteopathic medical physicians will be over 100 @,@ 000 , say expert predictions , according to the American Medical Association . 
 Osteopathic physicians are not evenly distributed in the United States . States with the highest concentration of osteopathic medical physicians are Oklahoma , Iowa , and Michigan where osteopathic medical physicians comprise 17 @-@ 20 % of the total physician workforce . The state with the greatest number of osteopathic medical physicians is Pennsylvania , with 7 @,@ 260 DOs in active practice in 2011 . The states with the lowest concentrations of DOs are Louisiana , Massachusetts and Vermont where only 1 – 3 % of physicians have an osteopathic medical degree . Public awareness of osteopathic medicine likewise varies widely in different regions . People living in the midwest states are the most likely to be familiar with osteopathic medicine . In the Northeastern United States , osteopathic medical physicians provide more than one third of general and family medicine patient visits . 
 Between 2010 and 2015 twelve states experienced greater than 50 % growth in the number of DOs — Virginia , South Carolina , Utah , Tennessee , North Dakota , Kentucky , South Dakota , Wyoming , Oregon , North Carolina , Minnesota , Washington . 
 = = Osteopathic principles = = 
 Osteopathic medical students take the Osteopathic Oath , similar to the Hippocratic oath , to maintain and uphold the " core principles " of osteopathic medical philosophy . Revised in 1953 , and again in 2002 , the core principles are : 
 The body is a unit ; a person is a unit of body , mind , and spirit . 
 The body is capable of self @-@ regulation , self @-@ healing , and health maintenance . 
 Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated . 
 Rational treatment is based on an understanding of these principles : body unity , self @-@ regulation , and the interrelationship of structure and function . 
 Contemporary osteopathic physicians practice evidence @-@ based medicine , indistinguishable from their MD colleagues . 
 = = = Significance = = = 
 There are different opinions on the significance of these principles . Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine , suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine , one that promotes a more patient @-@ centered , holistic approach to medicine , and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system . Others point out that there is nothing in the principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way . One study , published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above , and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 19th century , a new movement within medicine = = = 
 Frontier physician Andrew Taylor Still , M.D. , DO , founded the American School of Osteopathy ( now the A.T. Still University @-@ Kirksville ( Mo . ) College of Osteopathic Medicine ) in Kirksville , MO , in 1892 as a radical protest against the turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ century medical system . A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy , was morally corrupt , and treated effects rather than causes of disease . He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri at a time when medications , surgery , and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good . Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic , castor oil , whiskey , and opium . In addition , unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures . 
 Dr. Still intended his new system of medicine to be a reformation of the existing 19th @-@ century medical practices . He imagined that someday " rational medical therapy " would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system , surgery , and very sparingly used drugs . He invented the name " osteopathy " by blending two Greek roots <unk> for bone and <unk> for suffering in order to communicate his theory that disease and physiologic dysfunction were <unk> grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system . Thus , by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system , he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side @-@ effects of drugs . 
 The new profession faced stiff opposition from the medical establishment at the time . The relationship of the osteopathic and medical professions was often " bitterly contentious " and involved " strong efforts " by medical organizations to discredit osteopathic medicine . Throughout the first half of the twentieth century , the policy of the American Medical Association labeled osteopathic medicine as a cult and osteopaths were seen as " cultist . " The AMA code of ethics declared it unethical for a medical physician to voluntarily associate with an osteopath . 
 One notable advocate for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain . <unk> treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean 's epilepsy as well as Twain 's own chronic bronchitis . In 1909 , he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state . " I don 't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard you were going to drive them out of the state , but since I heard that I haven 't been able to sleep . " Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association 's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one , he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths . Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain , who retorted with " [ t ] he physicians think they are moved by regard for the best interests of the public . Isn 't there a little touch of self @-@ interest back of it all ? " " ... The objection is , people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business . " 
 = = = 1916 – 1966 , federal recognition = = = 
 Recognition by the U.S. federal government was a key goal of the osteopathic medical profession in its effort to establish equivalency with its M.D. counterparts . Between 1916 and 1966 , the profession engaged in a " long and tortuous struggle " for the right to serve as physicians and surgeons in the U.S. Military Medical Corps . On May 3 , 1966 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara authorized the acceptance of osteopathic physicians into all the medical military services on the same basis as MDs . The first osteopathic physician to take the oath of office to serve as a military physician was Harry J. Walter . The acceptance of osteopathic physicians was further solidified in 1996 when Ronald <unk> , DO was appointed to serve as Surgeon General of the Army , the only osteopathic physician to hold the post . 
 = = = 1962 , California = = = 
 In the 1960s in California , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) spent nearly $ 8 million to end the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state . In 1962 , Proposition 22 , a statewide ballot initiative in California , eliminated the practice of osteopathic medicine in the state . The California Medical Association ( CMA ) issued M.D. degrees to all DOs in the state of California for a nominal fee . " By attending a short seminar and paying $ 65 , a doctor of osteopathy ( D.O. ) could obtain an M.D. degree ; 86 percent of the DOs in the state ( out of a total of about 2000 ) chose to do so . " Immediately following , the AMA re @-@ accredited the formerly the osteopathic University of California at Irvine College of Osteopathic Medicine as the University of California , Irvine School of Medicine , an M.D. medical school . It also placed a ban on issuing physician licenses to DOs moving to California from other states . However , the decision proved to be controversial . In 1974 , after protests and lobbying by influential and prominent DOs , the California Supreme Court ruled in Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California v. California Medical Association , that licensing of DOs in that state must be resumed . Four years later , in 1978 , the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific opened in Pomona , and in 1997 Touro University California opened in Vallejo . As of 2012 , there were 6 @,@ 368 <unk> practicing in California .

 In 1969 , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) approved a measure allowing qualified osteopathic physicians as full and active members of the Association . The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA @-@ approved intern and residency programs . However , the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure , claiming it was an attempt to eliminate the distinctiveness of osteopathic medicine . In 1970 , AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur , M.D. sponsored a measure in the AMA 's House of Delegates permitting the AMA Board of Trustees ' plan for the merger of D.O. and M.D. professions . Today , a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs , in residency programs governed by the ACGME , an independent board of the AMA .

 In recent years , the largest M.D. organization in the U.S. , the American Medical Association , adopted a fee non @-@ discrimination policy discouraging differential pricing based on attendance of an M.D. or D.O. medical school . 
 In 2006 , calls for an investigation into the existence of differential fees charged for visiting D.O. and M.D. medical students at American medical schools were brought to the American Medical Association . After an internal investigation into the fee structure for visiting D.O. and M.D. medical students at M.D. medical schools , it was found that one institution of the 102 surveyed charged different fees for D.O. and M.D. students . The house of delegates of the American Medical Association adopted resolution 809 , I @-@ 05 in 2007 . 
 Our AMA , in collaboration with the American Osteopathic Association , discourages discrimination against medical students by institutions and programs based on osteopathic or allopathic training . 
 = = = State licensing of practice rights = = = 
 In the United States , laws regulating physician licenses are governed by the states . Between 1901 and 1989 , osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an M.D. degree . In many states , the debate was long and protracted . Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process . The first state to pass such a law was California in 1901 , the last was Nebraska in 1989 . 
 = = Current status = = 
 = = = Education and training = = = 
 According to Harrison 's Principles of Internal Medicine , " the training , practice , credentialing , licensure , and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of allopathic ( MD ) physicians , with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [ board ] certification . " 
 <unk> U.S. medical schools have curricula identical for the most part to those of <unk> schools . Generally , the first two years are classroom @-@ based , while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine . Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners , who may not be able to provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student . Other <unk> and <unk> schools place their students in hospital @-@ based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school , and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients . 
 = = = = Graduate medical education = = = = 
 Upon graduation , most osteopathic medical physicians pursue residency training programs . Depending on state licensing laws , osteopathic medical physicians may also complete a one @-@ year rotating internship at a hospital approved by the American Osteopathic Association ( AOA ) . 
 Osteopathic physicians may apply to residency programs accredited by either the AOA or the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) . Currently , osteopathic physicians participate in more ACGME programs than in programs approved by the American Osteopathic Association ( AOA ) . By June 30 , 2020 , all AOA residencies will also be required to have ACGME accreditation , and the AOA will cease accreditation activities . 
 = = Osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) = = 
 Within the osteopathic medical curriculum , manipulative treatment is taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions for a number of disorders and diseases . However , a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50 % of the respondents used OMT on less than 5 % of their patients . The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect — few perform OMT , and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment . The American Osteopathic Association has made an effort in recent years to support scientific inquiry into the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulation as well as to encourage osteopathic physicians to consistently offer manipulative treatments to their patients . However , the number of osteopathic physicians who report consistently prescribing and performing manipulative treatment has been falling steadily . Medical historian and sociologist Norman <unk> cites poor educational quarters and few full @-@ time OMT instructors as major factors for the decreasing interest of medical students in OMT . He describes problems with " the quality , breadth , nature , and orientation of OMM instruction , " and he claims that the teaching of osteopathic medicine has not changed sufficiently over the years to meet the intellectual and practical needs of students . 
 In their assigned readings , students learn what certain prominent DOs have to say about various somatic dysfunctions . There is often a theory or model presented that provides conjectures and putative explanations about why somatic dysfunction exists and what its significance is . Instructors spend the bulk of their time demonstrating osteopathic manipulative ( OM ) techniques without providing evidence that the techniques are significant and efficacious . Even worse , faculty members rarely provide instrument @-@ based objective evidence that somatic dysfunction is present in the first place . 
 At the same time , recent studies show an increasingly positive attitude of patients and physicians ( M.D. and D.O. ) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid , safe and effective treatment modality . One survey , published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education , found that a majority of physicians ( 81 % ) and patients ( 76 % ) felt that manual manipulation ( MM ) was safe , and over half ( 56 % of physicians and 59 % of patients ) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting . Although less than half ( 40 % ) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one @-@ quarter ( 20 % ) have administered MM in their practice , most ( 71 % ) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in <unk> Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills , including OMT . It showed that after a 1 @-@ month elective rotation , the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience . 
 = = = Professional attitudes = = = 
 In 1998 , a New York Times article described the increasing numbers , public awareness , and mainstreaming of osteopathic medical physicians , illustrating an increasingly cooperative climate between the D.O. and M.D. professions . 
 In 2005 , during his tenure as president of the American Association of Medical Colleges , Jordan Cohen described a climate of cooperation between D.O. and M.D. practitioners : 
 " We now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs ; are in most instances both licensed by the same licensing boards ; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals ; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other 's medical schools " . 
 Elsewhere , he has remarked that osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMT ) " can be an aid to the physician in fostering a relationship with the patient . " 
 = = = International practice rights = = = 
 Each country has different requirements and procedures for licensing or registering osteopathic physicians and osteopaths . The only osteopathic practitioners that the U.S. Department of Education recognizes as physicians are graduates of osteopathic medical colleges in the United States . Therefore , osteopaths who have trained outside the United States are not eligible for medical licensure in the United States . On the other hand , U.S.-trained DOs are currently able to practice in 45 countries with full medical rights and in several others with restricted rights . 
 The Bureau on International Osteopathic Medical Education and Affairs ( BIOMEA ) is an independent board of the American Osteopathic Association . The BIOMEA monitors the licensing and registration practices of physicians in countries outside of the United States and advances the recognition of American @-@ trained DOs . Towards this end , the BIOMEA works with international health organizations like the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) as well as other groups . 
 The procedure by which countries consider granting physician licensure to foreigners varies widely . For U.S. trained physicians , the ability to qualify for " unlimited practice rights " also varies according to one 's degree , M.D. or D.O. Many countries recognize U.S.-trained MDs as applicants for licensure , granting successful applicants " unlimited " practice rights . The American Osteopathic Association has lobbied the governments of other countries to recognize U.S.-trained DOs similarly to their M.D. counterparts , with some success . 
 In over 65 countries , U.S.-trained DOs have unlimited practice rights . In 2005 , after one year of deliberations , the General Medical Council announced that U.S.-trained DOs will be accepted for full medical practice rights in the United Kingdom . According to Josh Kerr of the AOA , " some countries don ’ t understand the differences in training between an osteopathic physician and an osteopath . " The American Medical Student Association strongly advocates for U.S.-trained D.O. international practice rights " equal to that " of M.D. qualified physicians . 
 = = = Osteopathic medicine and primary care = = = 
 Osteopathic physicians have historically entered primary care fields at a higher rate than their M.D. counterparts . Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine . However , the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields , like that of their M.D. peers , is declining . Currently , only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency ( the largest primary care field ) . In 2004 , only 32 % of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field ; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50 % .

 Another area of criticism has been the relative lack of research and lesser emphasis on scientific inquiry at D.O. schools in comparison with M.D. schools .

 = = = Identity crisis = = = 
 There is currently a debate within the osteopathic community over the feasibility of maintaining osteopathic medicine as a distinct entity within U.S. health care . JD Howell , author of The Paradox of Osteopathy , notes claims of a " fundamental yet ineffable difference " between MD and DO qualified physicians are based on practices such as " preventive medicine and seeing patients in a sociological context " that are " widely encountered not only in osteopathic medicine but also in allopathic medicine . " Studies have confirmed the lack of any " philosophic concept or resultant practice behavior " that would distinguish a D.O. from an M.D. Howell summarizes the questions framing the debate over the future of osteopathic distinctiveness thus : 
 If osteopathy has become the functional equivalent of <unk> [ meaning the MD profession ] , what is the justification for its continued existence ? And if there is value in therapy that is uniquely osteopathic , why should its use be limited to osteopaths ? 
 = = = = Rapid expansion = = = = 
 As the number of osteopathic schools has increased , the debate over distinctiveness has often seen the leadership of the American Osteopathic Association at odds with the community of osteopathic physicians . 
 within the osteopathic community , the growth is drawing attention to the identity crisis faced by [ the profession ] . While osteopathic leaders emphasize osteopaths ' unique identity , many osteopaths would rather not draw attention to their uniqueness . 
 The rapid expansion has raised concerns about the number of available faculty at osteopathic schools and the role that those faculty play in maintaining the integrity of the academic program of the schools . Norman <unk> , author of the leading text on the history of osteopathic medicine , recently published , 
 DO schools are currently expanding their class sizes much more quickly than are their MD counterparts . Unlike MD colleges , where it is widely known that academic faculty members — fearing dilution of quality as well as the prospect of an increased teaching workload — constitute a powerful inhibiting force to expand the class size , osteopathic faculty at private osteopathic schools have traditionally had little or no input on such matters . Instead , these decisions are almost exclusively the responsibility of college administrators and their boards of trustees , who look at such expansion from an entrepreneurial as well as an educational perspective . Osteopathic medical schools can keep the cost of student body expansion relatively low compared with that of MD institutions . Although the standards of the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation ensure that there will be enough desks and lab spaces to accommodate all new students , they do not mandate that an osteopathic college must bear the expense of maintaining a high full @-@ time @-@ faculty : student ratio . 
 The president of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine commented on the current climate of crisis within the profession . 
 The simultaneous movement away from osteopathic medicine ’ s traditionally separate training and practice systems , when coupled with its rapid growth , has created a sense of crisis as to its future . The rapid rate of growth has raised questions as to the availability of clinical and basic science faculty and clinical resources to accommodate the increasing load of students . 
 = Foramen spinosum = 
 The foramen spinosum is one of two foramina located in the base of the human skull , on the sphenoid bone . It is situated just anterior to the spine of the sphenoid bone , and just lateral to the foramen ovale . The middle meningeal artery , middle meningeal vein , and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve pass through the foramen . 
 The foramen spinosum is often used as a landmark in neurosurgery , due to its close relations with other cranial foramina . It was first described by Jakob Benignus Winslow in the 18th century . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The foramen spinosum is a foramen through the sphenoid bone situated in the middle cranial fossa . It is one of two foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone . The foramen ovale is one of these two cranial foramina , situated directly anterior and medial to the foramen spinosum . The spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the foramen . Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular fossa , and posterior is the Eustachian tube . 
 = = = Variation = = = 
 The foramen spinosum varies in size and location . The foramen is rarely absent , usually unilaterally , in which case the middle meningeal artery enters the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale . It may be incomplete , which may occur in almost half of the population . Conversely , in a minority of cases ( less than 1 % ) , it may also be duplicated , particularly when the middle meningeal artery is also duplicated . 
 The foramen may pass through the sphenoid bone at the apex of the spinous process , or along its medial surface .

 = Blue wildebeest = 
 The blue wildebeest ( Connochaetes taurinus ) , also called the common wildebeest , white @-@ bearded wildebeest or brindled gnu , is a large antelope and one of the two species of wildebeest . It is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae and has a close taxonomic relationship with the black wildebeest . The blue wildebeest is known to have five subspecies . This broad @-@ shouldered antelope has a muscular , front @-@ heavy appearance , with a distinctive robust muzzle . Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown , and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months . The adults ' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish @-@ brown . Both sexes possess a pair of large curved horns . 
 The blue wildebeest is a herbivore , feeding primarily on the short grasses . It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations , the animals being fast runners and extremely wary . The mating season begins at the end of the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months . The calf remains with its mother for eight months , after which time it joins a juvenile herd . Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush @-@ covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa , thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid . Each year , some East African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long @-@ distance migration , seemingly timed to coincide with local patterns of rainfall and grass growth . 
 The blue wildebeest is native to Angola , Botswana , Kenya , Mozambique , South Africa , Swaziland , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe . Today it is extinct in Malawi , but has been successfully reintroduced in Namibia . The southern limit of the blue wildebeest range is the Orange River , while the western limit is bounded by Lake Victoria and Mt Kenya . The blue wildebeest is widespread and is being introduced into private game farms , reserves and <unk> . For this reason , the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern . The population has been estimated to be around one and a half million and the population trend is stable . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The blue wildebeest was first described by English naturalist William John Burchell in 1823 and he gave it the scientific name Connochaetes taurinus . It shares the genus Connochaetes with the black wildebeest ( C. gnou ) , and is placed in the family Bovidae , ruminant animals with cloven hooves . The generic name Connochaetes derives from the Greek words <unk> , <unk> , " beard " , and <unk> , <unk> , " flowing hair " , " mane " . The specific name taurinus originates from the Greek word tauros , which means a bull or bullock . The common name " blue wildebeest " refers to the conspicuous , silvery @-@ blue sheen of the coat , while the alternative name " gnu " originates from the name for these animals used by the <unk> people , a native pastoralist tribe of southwestern Africa . 
 Though the blue and black wildebeest are currently classified in the same genus , the former was previously placed in a separate genus , Gorgon . In a study of the mitotic chromosomes and mtDNA which was undertaken to understand more of the evolutionary relationships between the two species , it was found that the two had a close phylogenetic relationship and had diverged about a million years ago . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 C. taurinus has five subspecies : 
 C. t. <unk> ( Thomas , 1912 ; Eastern white @-@ bearded wildebeest ) , is found in the Gregory Rift Valley ( south of the equator ) . Its range extends from northern Tanzania to central Kenya . 
 C. t. <unk> ( Blaine , 1914 ; Cookson 's wildebeest ) , is restricted to the Luangwa Valley in Zambia . Sometimes these animals may wander into the plateau region of central Malawi . 
 C. t. johnstoni ( Sclater , 1896 ; Nyassaland wildebeest ) , occurs from Mozambique ( north of the Zambezi river ) to east @-@ central Tanzania . This subspecies is now extinct in Malawi . 
 C. t. <unk> ( Heller , 1913 ; Western white @-@ bearded wildebeest ) , is found in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya . Its range extends from the west of the Gregory Rift Valley to Speke Bay on Lake Victoria . 
 C. t. taurinus ( Burchell , 1823 ; Blue wildebeest , common wildebeest or brindled gnu ) is found in southern Africa . Its range extends from Namibia and South Africa to Mozambique ( north of the Orange River ) and from southwestern Zambia ( south of the Zambezi river ) to southern Angola . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 The blue wildebeest is known to hybridise with the black wildebeest . The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation , however it may occur when both species are confined within the same area , and the offspring is usually fertile . A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had congenital abnormalities relating to their teeth , horns and the <unk> bones of the skull . Another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents . In some hybrid animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused . 
 = = Genetics and evolution = = 
 The diploid number of chromosomes in the blue wildebeest is 58 . Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest . In the female , all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes were found to be acrocentric . <unk> were studied in the male 's chromosomes , and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well , similar to those in the female both in size and <unk> the rest were acrocentric . The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one . 
 This species of wildebeest seems to have evolved around 2 @.@ 5 million years ago . The black wildebeest is believed to have diverged from the blue wildebeest to become a distinct species around a million years ago , in the mid to late Pleistocene . Fossil evidence suggests that the blue wildebeest were quite common in the Cradle of Humankind in the past . Apart from eastern Africa , fossils are commonly found in <unk> , Cornelia and Florisbad . 
 = = Description = = 
 The blue wildebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism , with males being larger and darker than females . The blue wildebeest is typically between 170 – 240 cm ( 67 – 94 in ) in head @-@ and @-@ body length . The average height of the species is 115 – 145 cm ( 45 – 57 in ) . While males weigh up to 290 kg ( 640 lb ) , females seldom exceed 260 kg ( 570 lb ) . A characteristic feature is the long , black tail , which is around 60 – 100 cm ( 24 – 39 in ) in length . All features and markings of this species are bilaterally symmetrical for both sexes . The average life span is 20 years in the wild , and 21 years in captivity . The oldest known captive individual lived for 24 @.@ 3 years . 
 = = = Colouration = = = 
 This broad @-@ shouldered antelope has a muscular , front @-@ heavy appearance , with a distinctive robust muzzle . Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown , and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months . The adults ' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish @-@ brown . The back and flanks are slightly lighter than the ventral surface and underparts . Dark brown vertical stripes mark the area between the neck and the back of the ribcage , thus giving it the name " brindled gnu " . The manes of both sexes appear long , stiff , thick and jet black , the same colour as the tail and face as well . While the manes of the western and eastern white @-@ bearded wildebeest are lank , those of the Nyassaland wildebeest and common wildebeest stick up . Scent glands , which secrete a clear oil , are present in the forefeet and are larger in males than females . 
 In terms of skull length , the smallest subspecies of the blue wildebeest is the western white @-@ bearded wildebeest . It is also the darkest subspecies , the eastern white @-@ bearded wildebeest being the lightest race . Both these subspecies possess a creamy white beard , whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland wildebeest and the common wildebeest . The longest muzzles are found in the Nyassaland wildebeest , and the shortest in female western white @-@ bearded wildebeest . 
 = = = Horns = = = 
 Both sexes possess a pair of large horns which are shaped like parentheses . These extend outward to the side , and then curve upward and inward . In the males , the horns can be 83 cm ( 33 in ) long , while the horns of the females are 30 – 40 cm ( 12 – 16 in ) long . Despite being an antelope , the blue wildebeest possesses various bovine characteristics . For instance , the horns resemble those of the female African buffalo . Further , the heavy build and disproportionately large forequarters give it a bovine appearance . 
 = = = Diseases and parasites = = = 
 The blue wildebeest is susceptible to foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease , anthrax , sarcoptic mange and hoof gangrene . The herpesvirus was first isolated from the blue wildebeest in 1960 by veterinary scientist Walter Plowright . Although the causes of death will vary from year to year , in one drought in Botswana , young calves and aged females were the most likely to die . On another occasion it was estimated that 47 % of deaths were caused by disease , 37 % were due to predation and the remainder were the result of accidents . 
 The animal can be host to a number of different parasites . In one study , blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode , one trematode , larvae of five <unk> flies , three species of lice , seven ixodid tick species , one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm . Of these , most were more prevalent at some times of the year than others . Generally , the larvae of <unk> and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest , and sometimes migrate to the brain . Compared to some other bovids , blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 The blue wildebeest is mostly active during the morning and the late afternoon , with the hottest hours of the day being spent in rest . These extremely agile and wary animals can run at speeds of up to 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) , waving their tails and tossing their heads . An analysis of the activity of blue wildebeest at the Serengeti National Park showed that the animals devoted over half of their total time to rest , 33 % to grazing , 12 % to moving about ( mostly walking ) and a little to social interactions . However , there were variations among different age and sex groups . 
 The wildebeest usually rest close to others of their kind and move about in loose aggregations . Males form bachelor herds , and these can be distinguished from juvenile groups by the lower amount of activity and the spacing between the animals . Around 90 % of the male calves join the bachelor herds before the next mating season . Bulls become territorial at the age of four or five years , and become very noisy ( most notably in the western white @-@ bearded wildebeest ) and active . The bulls tolerate being close to each other and a square kilometre of plain can accommodate 270 bulls . Most territories are of a temporary nature and fewer than a half of the male population hold permanent territories . In general , blue wildebeest rest in groups of a few to thousands at night , with a minimum distance of 1 – 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) between individuals ( though mothers and calves may remain in contact ) . They are a major prey item for lions , hyenas , and crocodiles . 
 Bulls mark the boundaries of their territories with heaps of dung and with secretions from their scent glands . The territories are advertised by their behaviour as well as by the physical marking . Body language used by a territorial male includes standing tall with an erect posture , profuse ground pawing and <unk> , frequent defecation , rolling and bellowing , the sound " ga @-@ noo " being produced . When competing over territory , males grunt loudly , paw the ground , make thrusting motion with their horns , and perform other displays of aggression . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The blue wildebeest is a herbivore , feeding primarily on the short grasses which commonly grow on light , and alkaline soils that are found in savanna grasslands and on plains . The animal 's broad mouth is adapted for eating large quantities of short grass and it feeds both during the day and night . When grass is scarce , it will also eat the foliage of shrubs and trees . Wildebeest commonly associate with plains zebras as the latter eat the upper , less nutritious grass canopy , exposing the lower , greener material which the wildebeest prefer . Whenever possible , the wildebeest likes to drink twice daily and due to its regular requirement for water , it usually inhabits moist grasslands and areas with available water sources . Despite this , it can also survive in the arid Kalahari desert , where it obtains sufficient water from melons and water @-@ storing roots and tubers . 
 In a study of the dietary habits of the wildebeest , the animals were found to be feeding on the three dominant grasses of the area , namely : Themeda triandra , Digitaria <unk> and <unk> <unk> . The time spent grazing increased by about 100 % during the dry season . Though the choice of diet remained the same in both the dry and the wet season , the animals were more selective during the latter . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Male blue wildebeest become sexually mature at about two years of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished . Nevertheless , most females do not start to breed until a year later . The mating season , which lasts for about three weeks , coincides with the end of the rainy season . This means that the animals are in good condition , having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth , and the conception rate is often as high as 95 % . The mating season , or rut , typically begins on the night of a full moon , suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding . At this time , testosterone production peaks in males , resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour . The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus . 
 As they stake out their territories and compete for females , males exhibit rivalry . When they clash , they face up to each other with bent knees and exchange horn thrusts . Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow , snort and dig their horns into the ground . Once dominance has been established , each male attempts to lure the female into his domain . During courtship , urination and low @-@ stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female . A receptive female holds her tail to one side and stands still while copulation takes place . Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute . The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time , the female keeps close to the male , often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis . While in season , a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males . 
 The gestation period is about eight and a half months and between 80 and 90 % of the calves are born within a three @-@ week time period . Female wildebeest give birth in the middle of a herd rather than alone , and typically in the middle of the day . This allows time for the newborn to become steady on its feet before night falls and the predators become more active . Calves weigh about 19 kg ( 42 lb ) at birth , and can usually stand on their own within a few minutes of birth . To escape predation , calves remain close to their mothers for a significant time , and may continue suckling until the next year 's calf is nearly due . Some calves leave their mother at about eight months and form herds with other juveniles . In large female herds , 80 % of the wildebeest offspring survive the first month , compared to a 50 % survival rate in smaller herds . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The blue wildebeest is native to Kenya , Tanzania , Botswana , Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , South Africa , Swaziland and Angola . Today it is extinct in Malawi , but has been successfully reintroduced into Namibia . 
 Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush @-@ covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa , thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid . They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains . Trees such as Brachystegia and Combretum are common in these areas . Blue wildebeest can tolerate arid regions as long as a potable water supply is available , normally within about 15 – 25 km ( 9 @.@ 3 – 15 @.@ 5 mi ) distance . The southern limit of the blue wildebeest stops at the Orange River , while the western limit is bounded by Lake Victoria and Mt Kenya . The range does not include montane or temperate grasslands . These wildebeest are rarely found at altitudes in excess of 1 @,@ 800 – 2 @,@ 100 m ( 5 @,@ 900 – 6 @,@ 900 ft ) . With the exception of a small population of Cookson 's wildebeest that occurs in the Luangwa Valley ( Zambia ) , the wildebeest is absent in the wetter parts of the southern savanna country , and particularly is not present in miombo woodlands . 
 Each year , some East African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long @-@ distance migration , seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth . The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year . At the end of the rainy season , they migrate to dry @-@ season areas in response to a lack of drinking water . When the rainy season begins again a few months later , the animals trek back to their wet @-@ season range . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 The blue wildebeest is preyed on by lions , leopards , African wild dogs and hyenas and predation is the main cause of death . They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers . Major human @-@ related factors affecting populations include large @-@ scale deforestation , the drying up of water sources , the expansion of settlements and poaching . Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll . The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry @-@ season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts . A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80 % from about 119 @,@ 000 individuals in 1977 to around 22 @,@ 000 twenty years later . The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture , which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges . 
 The total number of blue wildebeest is estimated to be around 1 @,@ 550 @,@ 000 . The population trend overall is stable and the numbers in the Serengeti National Park ( Tanzania ) have increased to about 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 . The population density ranges from 0 @.@ 15 / km2 in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35 / km2 in Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park where they are most plentiful . Blue wildebeest have also been introduced into a number of private game farms , reserves and conservancy areas . For these reasons , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern . However , the numbers of the eastern white @-@ bearded wildebeest ( C. t. <unk> ) have seen a steep decline in numbers to a current level of probably 6 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 animals and this is causing some concern . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 As one of the major herbivores of southern and eastern Africa , the blue wildebeest plays an important role in the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion . It is one of the animals that draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region . Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat , the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse , dry and rather hard . 
 However , blue wildebeest can also affect human beings negatively . They can compete with domestic livestock for grazing and water and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest to cattle and cause epidemics among animals . They can also spread ticks , lungworms , tapeworms , flies and <unk> flukes . 
 An ancient carved slab of slate depicting an animal very similar to the blue wildebeest has been discovered . Dating back to around 3000 BC , it was found in <unk> ( Nekhen ) , which used to be the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at that time . This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians . 
 = Thriller ( Michael Jackson album ) = 
 Thriller is the sixth studio album by American singer Michael Jackson . It was released by Epic Records on November 30 , 1982 , as the follow @-@ up to Jackson 's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off the Wall . Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off the Wall , including pop , post @-@ disco , rock and funk . Recording sessions took place on April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles with a production budget of $ 750 @,@ 000 , assisted by producer Quincy Jones . 
 Of the album 's nine tracks , four were written by Jackson . Seven singles were released from the album , all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Three of the singles had music videos released . " Baby Be Mine " and " The Lady in My Life " were the only tracks that were not released as singles . In just over a year , Thriller became — and currently remains — the best @-@ selling album of all time , with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide according to various sources . In the United States , it is the best @-@ selling album and has become the first album ever to be certified 32 times multi @-@ platinum for 32 million album @-@ equivalent units . The album won a record @-@ breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984 , including for Album of the Year . 
 Thriller enabled Jackson to break down racial barriers in pop music via his appearances on MTV and meeting with President of the United States Ronald Reagan at the White House . The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools — the videos for " Thriller " , " Billie Jean " and " Beat It " all received regular rotation on MTV . In 2001 , a special edition issue of the album was released , which contains additional audio interviews , demo recordings and the song " Someone in the Dark " , which was a Grammy @-@ winning track from the E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial storybook . In 2008 , the album was reissued again as Thriller 25 , containing re @-@ mixes that feature contemporary artists , a previously unreleased song and a DVD , which features the short films from the album and the Motown 25 performance of " Billie Jean " . That same year the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame along with Jackson 's Off The Wall LP . 
 In 2012 , Slant Magazine listed Thriller at number one on its list of " Best Albums of the 1980s " . The album was ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003 , and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in its " Definitive 200 " albums of all time . The Thriller album was included in the Library of Congress ' National Recording Registry of culturally significant recordings and the Thriller video was included in the National Film Preservation Board 's National Film Registry of " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant films " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Jackson 's previous album Off the Wall ( 1979 ) received strong critical acclaim and was also a commercial success , eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide . The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for the singer , a time of increasing independence . The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy ; Jackson explained , " Even at home , I 'm lonely . I sit in my room sometimes and cry . It 's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night , just hoping to find someone to talk to . But I just end up coming home . " When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979 , he hired John Branca as his manager . 
 Jackson confided in Branca that he wanted to be the biggest star in show business and " the wealthiest " . The singer was upset about what he perceived to be the under @-@ performance of Off the Wall , stating , " It was totally unfair that it didn 't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again . " He also felt undervalued by the music industry ; in 1980 when Jackson asked the publicist of Rolling Stone if they would be interested in doing a cover story on him , the publicist declined , to which Jackson responded , " I 've been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn 't sell copies ... Just wait . Someday those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview . Maybe I 'll give them one , and maybe I won 't . "

 Jackson reunited with Off the Wall producer Quincy Jones to record his sixth studio album ( his second under the Epic label ) . The pair worked together on 30 songs , nine of which were eventually included . Thriller was recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles , California , with a production budget of $ 750 @,@ 000 . The recording for Thriller commenced on April 14 , 1982 at 12 : 00 noon with Jackson and Paul McCartney recording " The Girl Is Mine " and the album was completed with the final day of mixing on November 8 , 1982 . Several members of the band Toto were also involved in the album 's recording and production . Jackson wrote four songs for the record : " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , " The Girl Is Mine " , " Beat It " and " Billie Jean " . Unlike many artists , Jackson did not write these songs on paper . Instead , he would dictate into a sound recorder ; when recording he would sing from memory . 
 The relationship between Jackson and Jones became strained during the album 's recording . Jackson spent much of his time rehearsing dance steps alone . When the album 's nine songs were completed , both Jones and Jackson were unhappy with the result and remixed every song , spending a week on each . 
 Jackson was inspired to create an album where " every song was a killer " and developed Thriller with that in mind . Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album . Jones discussed " Billie Jean " and why it was so personal to Jackson , who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans . Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened ; however , Jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance . The ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the disco @-@ heavy Off the Wall . Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song " Beat It " . Eventually , they found Steve Lukather of Toto to play the rhythm @-@ guitar parts and Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen to play the solo . 
 When Rod Temperton wrote the song " Thriller " , he originally wanted to call it " Starlight " or " Midnight Man " , but settled on " Thriller " because he felt the name had merchandising potential . Always wanting a notable person to recite the closing lyrics , Jones brought in actor Vincent Price who was an acquaintance of Jones ' wife , who completed his part in just two takes . Temperton wrote the spoken portion in a taxi on the way to the recording studio . Jones and Temperton said that some recordings were left off the final cut because they did not have the " edginess " of other album tracks . 
 Songs recorded by Jackson for consideration included " Carousel " ( written by Michael <unk> ) , " Got the Hots " ( written by Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones ) , " Nite Line " ( written by Glen Ballard ) , " Trouble " ( aka " She 's Trouble " , written by Terry Britten , Bill Livsey and Sue Shifrin ) and " Hot Street " ( written by Rod Temperton and aka " Slapstick " ) . Jackson also cut a version of " Starlight " . Demos of all these songs exist and have leaked onto the internet . " Carousel " , " Got the Hots " and " Hot Street " were completed , but left off the final version of the album . A short clip of " Carousel " appeared as a bonus track on the 2001 reissue of the album ; the full version was later released on iTunes in 2013 as part of The Ultimate Fan Extras Collection . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Thriller explores different music genres , including pop , post @-@ disco , rock and funk . According to Steve Huey of AllMusic , it refined the strengths of Jackson 's previous album Off the Wall ; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive , while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful . The album includes the ballads " The Lady in My Life " , " Human Nature " and " The Girl Is Mine " ; the funk pieces " Billie Jean " and " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " ; and the disco set " Baby Be Mine " and " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " and has a similar sound to the material on Off the Wall . " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " is accompanied by a bass and percussion background and the song 's centerpiece , a climaxing African @-@ inspired chant ( often misidentified as Swahili , but actually syllables based on Duala ) , gave the song an international flavor . " The Girl Is Mine " tells of two friends ' fight over a woman , arguing over who loves her more and concludes with a spoken rap . The album 's songs have a tempo ranging from 80 beats per minute on " The Girl is Mine " , to 138 on " Beat It " . 
 Despite the light pop flavor of these two records , Thriller , more so than Off the Wall , displayed foreshadowings of the contradictory thematic elements that would come to characterize Jackson 's subsequent works . With Thriller , Jackson would begin his association with the subliminal motif of paranoia and darker themes , including supernatural imagery in the album 's title track . This is evident on the songs " Billie Jean " , " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " and " Thriller " . In " Billie Jean " , Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers ; in " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " he argues against gossips and the media . In the former song , Jones had Jackson sing vocal overdubs through a six @-@ foot @-@ long cardboard tube and brought in jazz saxophonist Tom Scott to play a rare instrument , the <unk> , a wind @-@ controlled analog synthesizer . Bassist Louis Johnson ran through his part on a Yamaha bass guitar . The song opens with a long bass @-@ and @-@ drums introduction . In the song " Thriller " , sound effects such as creaking door , thunder , feet walking on wooden planks , winds and howling dogs can be heard . 
 The anti @-@ gang @-@ violence " Beat It " became a homage to West Side Story and was Jackson 's first successful rock cross @-@ over piece . Jackson later said of " Beat It " , " the point is no one has to be the tough guy , you can walk away from a fight and still be a man . You don 't have to die to prove you 're a man " . " Human Nature " , co @-@ written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto , is moody and introspective , as conveyed in lyrics such as , " Looking out , across the morning , the City 's heart begins to beat , reaching out , I touch her shoulder , I 'm dreaming of the street " . 
 By the late 1970s , Jackson 's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded ; AllMusic described him as a " blindingly gifted vocalist " . Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the " breathless , dreamy stutter " of Stevie Wonder . Their analysis was also that " Jackson 's feathery @-@ timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful . It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that 's used very daringly " . With the release of Thriller , Jackson could sing low — down to a basso low C — but he preferred to sing higher because pop tenors have more range to create style . Rolling Stone was of the opinion that Jackson was now singing in a " fully adult voice " that was " tinged by sadness " . " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " , credited to James Ingram and Quincy Jones and " The Lady in My Life " by Rod Temperton , both gave the album a stronger R & B direction ; the latter song was described as " the closest Jackson has come to crooning a sexy , soulful ballad after his Motown years " by Taraborrelli . The singer had already adopted a " vocal hiccup " which he continued to implement in Thriller . The purpose of the hiccup — somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping — is to help promote a certain emotion , be it excitement , sadness or fear . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Thriller was released on November 30 , 1982 , and sold one million copies worldwide per week at its peak . Seven singles were released from the album , including " The Girl Is Mine " — which was seen as a poor choice for the lead release and led some to believe that the album would be a disappointment and to suggestions that Jackson was bowing to a white audience . " The Girl Is Mine " was followed by the hit single " Billie Jean " , which made Thriller a chart @-@ topper . Success continued with the single " Beat It " , which featured guitarists Eddie Van Halen and Steve Lukather . The album 's title track was released as a single and also became a hit internationally . 
 Thriller was well received by most critics . Christopher Connelly in a January 1983 review in Rolling Stone gave it four out of five stars and described it as " a zesty LP " with a " harrowing , dark message " . Comparing the songs on the album with the life challenges that the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Jackson had faced since Off the Wall , Connelly remarks that he has " dropped the boyish falsetto " and is facing his " challenges head @-@ on " with " a feisty determination " and " a full , adult voice " . John Rockwell in a December 1982 review in The New York Times also commented on Jackson 's age , comparing his youth with his experience as an entertainer , feeling that perhaps he is a " sometimes too practiced ... performer " , that at times Quincy Jones may " <unk> his individuality " with his " slightly anonymous production " and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind " layers of impenetrable , gauzy veils " . The bulk of Rockwell 's review concentrated on how he felt that the album was helping breach " the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music " , especially as " white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to pretend he isn 't black after all " . He feels that Thriller is " a wonderful pop record , the latest statement by one of the great singers in popular music today " and that there are " hits here , too , lots of them " . 
 In his consumer guide for The Village Voice , Robert Christgau gave the album an A – rating and commented that " this is virtually a hits @-@ plus @-@ filler job , but at such a high level it 's almost classic anyway " . He later revised it to an A , and commented in retrospect , " what we couldn 't know is how brilliantly every hit but ' P.Y.T. ' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure . " A year after the album 's release , Time summed up the three main singles from the album , saying , " The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly , beating in time to the tough strut of " Billie Jean " , the asphalt aria of " Beat It " , the supremely cool chills of " Thriller " . In 1989 , the Toronto Star music critics took to look over the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years to include in a list based on " commercial impact to social import , to strictly musical merit . " Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list , where it was referred to as his " master work " and that " commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson 's artistic accomplishments on Thriller , and that 's a pity . It was a record for the times , brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world , a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat , yet made room for serious reflection " 
 The album won a record @-@ breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984 , including Album of the Year . Jackson won seven of the Grammys for the album while the eighth Grammy went to Bruce Swedien . That same year , Jackson won eight American Music Awards , the Special Award of Merit and three MTV Video Music Awards . Thriller was recognized as the world 's best @-@ selling album on February 7 , 1984 , when it was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records . It is one of four albums to be the best @-@ seller of two years ( 1983 – 1984 ) in the US . 
 On December 16 , 2015 , Thriller was certified 30 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , for shipments of at least 30 million units in the US . After the inclusion of streaming and tracks sales into the RIAA album awards in 2016 , Thriller was re @-@ certified 32 × platinum for a total of 32 million album @-@ equivalent units . The album topped the charts in many countries , sold 4 @.@ 2 million copies in the UK , 2 @.@ 5 million in Japan , and was certified 15 × Platinum in Australia . Still popular today , Thriller sells an estimated 130 @,@ 000 copies in the US per year ; it reached number two in the US Catalog charts in February 2003 and number 39 in the UK in March 2007 .

 Blender described Jackson as the " late 20th century 's preeminent pop icon " , while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a " musical phenomenon " and that " in the world of pop music , there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else " . Jackson changed the way the industry functioned : both as an artistic persona and as a financial , profitable entity . His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point : approximately $ 2 for each album sold . As a result , Jackson earned record @-@ breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary , The Making of Michael Jackson 's Thriller , produced by Jackson and John Landis . Funded by MTV , the film sold over 350 @,@ 000 copies in its first few months . In a market then driven by singles , Thriller raised the significance of albums , yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album . The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll , that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $ 12 . Thriller retains a position in American culture ; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains , " At some point , Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item — like a magazine , a toy , tickets to a hit movie — and started selling like a household staple " . 
 At the time of the album 's release , a press statement from Gil Friesen , the then President of A & M Records , read that , " The whole industry has a stake in this success " . Time magazine speculated that " the fallout from Thriller has given the [ music ] business its best years since the heady days of 1978 , when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $ 4 @.@ 1 billion " . Time summed up Thriller 's impact as a " restoration of confidence " for an industry bordering on " the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop " . The publication described Jackson 's influence at that point as , " Star of records , radio , rock video . A one @-@ man rescue team for the music business . A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade . A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street . A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too " . 
 When Thriller and " Billie Jean " were searching to reach their market demographic , MTV and cable TV had a smaller market share than the much larger reach of broadcast television stations in the United States . A national broadcast TV audience on ABC , NBC and CBS affiliate stations , as well as major independent TV stations , was desired by CBS / Epic Records to promote Thriller . The national broadcast TV premiere of the Thriller album 's first video , " Billie Jean " , was during the week of Halloween in October 1984 and was the idea of Video Concert Hall executive producers Charles Henderson and Jerry Crowe . Video Concert Hall , the first nationwide music video TV network , taped the one @-@ hour special in Hollywood and Atlanta , where the TV studios of Video Concert Hall were located . The Thriller TV special was hosted by Thriller video co @-@ star Vincent Price , distributed by Henderson @-@ Crowe <unk> , Inc. and aired in the top 20 TV markets and much of the United States , including TV stations WNEW ( New York ) , <unk> ( Chicago ) , KTTV ( Los Angeles ) , <unk> ( Miami ) , <unk> ( Boston ) and WXIA ( Atlanta ) , for a total of 150 TV stations . 
 From the moment Thriller was released , it set the standard for the music industry : artists , record labels , producers , marketers and even choreographers . The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one — not only in Jackson 's career , but also in the history of pop music . Epic Records ' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs . John Landis 's production of a mini @-@ movie , rather than the usual short music video , would raise the bar for other directors and producers . 
 = = = Music videos and racial equality = = = 
 Before the success of Thriller , many felt Jackson had struggled to get MTV airing because he was black . In an effort to attain air time for Jackson , CBS Records President Walter <unk> pressured MTV and declared , " I 'm not going to give you any more videos and I 'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don 't want to play music by a black guy . " 
 His position persuaded MTV to begin airing " Billie Jean " and later " Beat It " , ( along with Prince 's " Little Red Corvette " ) which led to a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition . MTV denies claims of racism in their broadcasting . The popularity of his videos , such as " Beat It " and " Billie Jean " , helped to place the young channel " on the map " and MTV 's focus shifted in favor of pop and R & B. Jackson transformed the medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through the use of complex story lines , dance routines , special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities . When the 14 @-@ minute @-@ long Thriller video aired , MTV ran it twice an hour to meet demand . The short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named the best music video ever . The popularity of the video sent the album back to number one in the album chart , but Jackson 's label did not support the release of the third music video from the album . They were already pleased with its success , so Jackson convinced MTV to fund the project . Author , music critic and journalist Nelson George wrote in 2004 , " It 's difficult to hear the songs from Thriller and disengage them from the videos . For most of us the images define the songs . In fact it could be argued that Michael is the first artist of the MTV age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery " . Short films like Thriller largely remained unique to Jackson , while the group dance sequence in " Beat It " has been frequently imitated . The choreography in Thriller has become a part of global pop culture , replicated everywhere from Bollywood to prisons in the Philippines . 
 For a black artist in the 1980s to that point , Jackson 's success was unprecedented . According to The Washington Post , Thriller paved the way for other African @-@ American artists to achieve mainstream recognition , such as Prince . " The Girl Is Mine " was credited for getting interracial love on the radio . Time noted , " Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles . He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley . He just may be the most popular black singer ever " . 
 = = = Contemporary appeal = = = 
 Today , Thriller is still viewed in a positive light by critics some three decades later . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album the maximum five stars and wrote that the record had something to interest everyone . He believed it showcased harder funk and hard rock while remaining " undeniably fun " . He went on to compliment " Billie Jean " and " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " and said , " The record 's two best songs : ' Billie Jean , ... and the delirious ' Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' ' , the freshest funk on the album [ but ] the most claustrophobic , scariest track Jackson ever recorded . " Erlewine gave the opinion that it was an improvement on the artist 's previous album , although he was critical of the title track , describing it as " ridiculous " and as having the effect of " arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum " . Slant Magazine gave the album five stars and , like the AllMusic review and the original Rolling Stone review , paid compliment to the lyrics of " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " . Giving it five stars in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , Rolling Stone journalist Jon Pareles commented that Jackson " doubled his ambitions and multiplied his audience " with the album and wrote of its legacy , " Thriller had <unk> help in becoming the best @-@ selling <unk> album of all time : Jackson 's dancing feet and dazzling stage presence , amplified by the newfound promotional reach of music video and the Reagan era 's embrace of glossy celebrity . But especially in the album 's seven hit singles ( out of nine songs ) , the music stands on its own . " 
 Culture critic Nelson George wrote that Jackson " has educated R. Kelly , Usher , Justin Timberlake and countless others with Thriller as a textbook " . As a sign of the album 's longevity , in 2003 Thriller was ranked at number 20 on the Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three of the " Definitive 200 " albums of all time . In 2008 , 25 years after its release , the record was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and , a few weeks later , was among 25 recordings preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry as " culturally significant " . In 2009 , music critics for MTV Base and VH1 both listed Thriller as the best album released since 1981 . Thriller , along with other critic favorites , were then polled by the public . 40 @,@ 000 people found Thriller to be the Best Album of all time by MTV Generation , gaining a third of all votes .

 Thriller was reissued on October 16 , 2001 , in an expanded set titled Thriller : Special Edition . The original tracks were remastered and the album included a new booklet and bonus material , including the songs " Someone in the Dark " , " Carousel " and Jackson 's original " Billie Jean " demo , as well as audio interviews with Jones and Temperton discussing the recording of the album . Sony also hired sound engineer and mixer Mick Guzauski to work with Jackson on creating 5 @.@ 1 @-@ channel surround sound mixes of Thriller , as well as all his other albums , for release on the then @-@ new Super Audio CD format . Despite numerous <unk> , the artist never approved any of the mixes . Consequently , Thriller was issued on SACD only in a stereo version . 
 In February 2008 , Epic Records released Thriller 25 ; Jackson served as executive producer . Thriller 25 appeared on CD , USB and vinyl with seven bonus tracks , a new song called " For All Time " , a snippet of Vincent Price 's voice @-@ over and five remixes featuring American artists Fergie , will.i.am , Kanye West and Akon . It also included a DVD featuring three music videos , the Motown 25 " Billie Jean " performance and a booklet with a message from Jackson . The ballad " For All Time " supposedly dates from 1982 , but is often credited as being from Dangerous sessions . Two singles were released from the reissue : " The Girl Is Mine 2008 " and " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' 2008 " . 
 Thriller 25 was a commercial success and did particularly well as a reissue . It peaked at number one in eight countries and Europe . It peaked at number two in the US , number three in the UK and reached the top 10 in over 30 national charts . It was certified Gold in 11 countries including the UK , received a 2 × Gold certification in France and received platinum certification in Poland . In the United States , Thriller 25 was the second best @-@ selling album of its release week , selling one hundred and sixty six thousand copies , just fourteen thousand short of reaching the number one position . It was ineligible for the Billboard 200 chart as a re @-@ release but entered the Pop Catalog Charts at number one ( where it stayed for ten non @-@ consecutive weeks ) , with the best sales on that chart since December 1996 . With the arrival of Halloween that November , Thriller 25 spent an eleventh non @-@ consecutive week atop the US catalog chart . This brought US sales of the album to 688 @,@ 000 copies , making it the best @-@ selling catalog album of 2008 . This was Jackson 's best launch since Invincible in 2001 , selling three million copies worldwide in 12 weeks . 
 After Jackson 's death in June 2009 , Thriller set additional records . It sold more than 100 @,@ 000 copies , placing it at number two on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart . Songs from Thriller also helped Jackson become the first artist to sell more than one million song downloads in a week . According to Nielsen SoundScan , Thriller was the 14th best @-@ selling album of 2009 in the United States , with 1 @.@ 27 million copies sold . 
 For one week beginning November 20 , 2015 , Google Play Music offered a free copy of the album to its users in the U.S. It is called Thriller ( Google Play Exclusive Version ) . It adds a tenth track to the original , Billie Jean ( Home Demo from 1981 ) . To date , Thriller remains the best @-@ selling album of all time , selling over 65 million copies worldwide .

 = Tropical Storm Wukong ( 2006 ) = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Wukong was a slow moving tropical cyclone which produced torrential rains over Japan . The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season , Wukong developed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean . On August 13 , both the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the depression as a tropical storm . The storm traveled along a curving path south of Japan , absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August 15 before turning towards the west . Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August 17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū . The cyclone remained over land for about 24 hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan . The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August 21 . Due to the slow movement of the storm , it produced heavy rains , peaking at 516 mm ( 20 @.@ 3 in ) . Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 12 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began monitoring a tropical depression located to the south of Chichi @-@ jima island . The depression formed within a monsoonal gyre which also spawned Tropical Storm Sonamu . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression 11W several hours after the JMA while the system was located about 140 km ( 85 mi ) south of Iwo Jima . The depression gradually strengthened as it moved towards the northwest . Early on August 13 , it was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Wukong ; a name which was contributed by China . The names means " the king of the monkeys " and was featured in the novel Journey to the West . The storm slowed significantly as a ridge built eastward over Japan . On August 14 , Wukong turned towards the northeast and reached its peak intensity with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) as a severe tropical storm . 
 At the same time , the JTWC assessed Wukong to have reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . The next day , the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu . Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu later in the day before turning towards the west . On August 16 , the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan . Wukong made landfall late on August 17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū . As the storm made landfall , the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . The cyclone slowly traveled across land , entering the Sea of Japan about 24 hours after landfall . Several hours after entering the Sea of Japan , the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression . The depression persisted for two more days before dissipating near the Russian coastline .

 According to Japanese weather officials , heavy rain , flood , storm and high wave warnings were put into effect for all of Kyūshū and adjacent areas in Honshū . The two largest air carriers in Japan , Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways , cancelled at least 36 domestic flights ahead of the storm . Several of the largest oil refineries halted oil product shipments from three refineries . Kyushu Railways postponed services on five lines , one of which crossed the entire prefecture . Long distance ferries were also shut down . Iwakuni , Yamaguchi was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 and Sasebo , Nagasaki was placed under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness Storm Watch . 
 Wukong produced torrential rains over Japan , peaking at 516 mm ( 20 @.@ 3 in ) in <unk> , Miyazaki Prefecture . Flooding in Kyūshū and the Yamaguchi Prefecture caused the evacuation of about 300 households . At least 200 residences were left without power in Kyūshū . Two people were killed by rough seas produced by Wukong , and three others were injured in storm @-@ related accidents . A total of seven landslides occurred , one of which damaged several homes . As the storm brushed the Korean Peninsula , it produced heavy rains , but caused no known damage . 
 = First Test , 1948 Ashes series = 
 The First Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five Tests in a cricket series between Australia and England . The match was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham from 10 to 15 June with a rest day on 13 June . Australia won the match by eight wickets to take a 1 – 0 series lead . 
 The Australians started the match as firm favourites , having won the previous series against England 3 – 0 ; in the lead @-@ up to the 1948 series , they had won 10 of their 12 tour matches in England , mostly by large margins . This included a crushing innings defeat in a match over the Marylebone Cricket Club — a team consisting almost entirely of Test @-@ capped and current England players . England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a cloudy day . After the first morning was interrupted by inclement weather , the Australian fast bowlers quickly made inroads into the English batting . Despite the loss of leading Australian paceman Ray Lindwall with a groin injury , the hosts had difficulty against his colleagues and fell to be 74 runs for the loss of eight wickets ( 74 / 8 ) . However , a rearguard action by tail @-@ enders Alec Bedser and Jim Laker saw England reach 165 , Bill Johnston taking five wickets for 36 runs ( 5 / 36 ) for Australia , while compatriot Keith Miller took 3 / 38 . Laker top @-@ scored for the hosts with 63 . The tourists then reached 17 without loss by stumps . 
 On the second day , Yardley attempted to slow the Australian batsmen by employing leg theory , a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack . As England had batted poorly in the first innings , allowing Australia to take the lead quickly , the home team sought to slow the tourists ' momentum and force a drawn match . Despite the tactics , Australia reached 293 / 4 at the end of the day 's play , captain Donald Bradman having registered his 28th Test century . Although Bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at England 's stifling tactics , they remained patient as there was still much time left in the match for them to convert their dominance into a victory . The next morning , Bradman departed for 138 , the first in a series of dismissals in the leg trap , but his vice @-@ captain Lindsay Hassett continued , making 137 and putting on a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509 , giving them a 344 @-@ run first innings lead . Laker was the leading bowler , taking 4 / 138 . England reached 121 / 2 by stumps on the third day , which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to Miller , who bowled a large amount of bouncers at Len Hutton and Denis Compton . 
 After the rest day , play resumed in poor visibility , with frequent interruptions due to rain and bad light . England 's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall 's absence , which forced his fellow bowlers to bear a greater workload . Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154 , with England one run ahead at the close of play , on 345 / 6 . Compton 's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the lower order could bat for a large part of the final day . The next day , Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441 , with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps . Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets . Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets ; opener Sid Barnes made his second half @-@ century for the match in the pursuit . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first @-@ class matches since arriving in England and starting their campaign in late @-@ April , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . One of the drawn matches , against Lancashire , was rain @-@ affected , with the first day washed out entirely . 
 One of the tour matches was against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , which fielded a team composed almost entirely of Test players . In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests , Australia fielded their full @-@ strength team and won by an innings . The difference in Australia 's team for the First Test was the omission of leg spinner Colin McCool , who had been struggling from a torn callus on his spinning finger , which prevented him from bowling long spells . It was thought that Bradman would play another leg spinner — Doug Ring — in McCool 's place , but the Australian captain changed his mind on the first morning when rain was forecast . Bill Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket . In previous rain @-@ affected matches on the tour , Johnston had been highly effective , taking match figures of 10 / 40 and 11 / 117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively . Bill Brown , the reserve opener , played out of position in the middle @-@ order , as he had against Worcestershire and the MCC . Aside from Brown and Johnston 's inclusion , Australia 's team was the same as that which started the previous Ashes series in 1946 – 47 , which they won 3 – 0 . 
 England lost their leg spinner Doug Wright before the match to lumbago , so the off spin of Jim Laker was brought in at late notice . Laker had struggled when he had played for Surrey and the MCC against Australia in the lead @-@ up matches , taking 1 / 137 and 3 / 127 respectively . In the MCC match , the Australians had attacked him , taking nine sixes from his bowling in one 82 @-@ minute passage of play . Of the team that took to the field for the MCC , Len Hutton , Bill Edrich , Denis Compton , captain Norman Yardley , Laker and Jack Young were also selected for the First Test . Hutton scored 52 and 64 in the MCC match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings . Young had bowled 55 @.@ 2 overs in Australia 's only innings , taking 4 / 155 . Opener Jack Robertson was left out after scoring six and a duck , and Cyril Washbrook , who had played against Australia in the 1946 – 47 series , partnered Hutton . Joe Hardstaff junior had scored 107 for Nottinghamshire , the only century made against Australia in the lead @-@ up matches , earning himself Test selection . <unk> Alec Bedser did not play in the MCC match , but had been a regular during England 's last series against Australia in 1946 – 47 , and had taken 4 / 104 for Surrey in their match against the tourists . Godfrey Evans , who kept wickets in the previous Ashes series , also gained Test selection . According to former England bowler Bill Bowes , England went into the match with the intention of securing a draw through the selection of defensive bowlers . The home team 's bowlers would tie down the Australians , forcing the batsmen to take risks to score runs and thereby increasing the chances of dismissal ; however , if rain produced a sticky wicket , the England attack might be able to dismiss Australia relatively easily . As such , England filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers , Laker , Bedser and Young , and relied on Yardley , Edrich and Charlie Barnett to support them with their occasion seam bowling . It was speculated that England would use only two specialist bowlers ; the all @-@ rounder George Pope was in the squad and it was thought he would be used in place of one of the bowlers , but in the end , he was omitted , as was Reg Simpson . The latter had made 74 and 70 for Nottinghamshire against Australia and had impressed observers with his display , and was made twelfth man . 
 Before the start of the match , much of the attention was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain . In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests , Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain @-@ affected pitches . In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory . It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance , especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came . The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II .

 England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat despite the dull light ; Trent Bridge had reputation for being favourable to batsmen , and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938 , four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658 , before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself . The first innings set the pattern of the series as the English top order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather , and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton had to deal with the contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall — with a low , somewhat round @-@ arm action — and Miller , who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery . In the first two overs , the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start . Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace , and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings . Gradually , the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace . Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over , but it bounced before reaching a fielder . In his second over , Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9 / 1 . The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot . The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball , thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad . 
 During the lunch interval , heavy rain fell , before the sun began to dry the pitch , making the ball skid through upon England 's resumption at 13 / 1 . Miller beat Washbrook 's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption , but was unable to extract an edge . Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to first slip , where Ian Johnson got both hands to the ball above his head , but failed to hold on . Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20 @-@ minute passage of play during which England was unable to score . The next ball from Lindwall , Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on the line of leg stump . It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking , attracting substantial criticism . Washbrook 's fall left England at 15 / 2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich . Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four , which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction . Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46 . Likewise , Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets . During this period Brown made a series of one @-@ handed run @-@ saving stops in the field . The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result , the playing surface did not offer much bounce . 
 Bradman then made a double change and brought on the two left @-@ arm pacemen , Bill Johnston and Ernie Toshack . In his first over , Johnston bowled Edrich with a delivery that knocked the off stump out of the ground as the batsman leaned forward on the front foot . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff for a duck , caught by Miller in slips after attempting a cut . Wisden described the catch as " dazzling " . Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine as he caught the ball heels over head . O 'Reilly said : " Johnston had trimmed and embroidered the efforts of his opening bowlers and had swung the fortunes of the game completely in Australia 's favour " . 
 Bradman then decided to bring Miller back in place of Toshack . Two runs later , Compton was bowled attempting a leg sweep against Miller , his leg stump knocked out of the ground as he moved across his wickets . Five English wickets had fallen with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play ; three batsmen had been dismissed in just ten minutes . O 'Reilly said " There was nothing whatsoever to suggest that the pitch had been instrumental in the English debacle . It was purely and simply an exhilarating display of splendid bowling fit to be classed with any match @-@ winning bowling performance in the story of Test cricket . " 
 The collapse left Barnett and captain Yardley as the new men at the crease . Both players attacked the bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs . Soon after , Lindwall was forced to leave the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot . This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60 / 6 , and he attempted to disrupt the Australians ' line and length by counter @-@ attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket . He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four , and was then given two lives . He hit Johnston hard to cover , but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary . The second chance of a catch went through Bradman 's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen . However , the missed opportunities cost the tourists little ; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris . Without further addition to the score , Toshack trapped Yardley , who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs , leg before wicket ( lbw ) with a ball that straightened after pitching , leaving the score at 74 / 8 . 
 England was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge , worse than the 112 made by England against Warwick Armstrong 's Australians in 1921 . However , a late fightback averted the unwanted record . Laker and Bedser , both from Surrey , joined forces and scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Laker 's innings was highlighted by hooking and driving , while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket , much to the delight of the Nottingham crowd , who had appeared to have become depressed by the collapse of England 's batsmen . At first , Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership between the two bowlers from Surrey — it was thought the Australian captain may have been happy for England to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards the end of the afternoon , but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable . O 'Reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in Surrey — The Oval — had a reputation for being batsman @-@ friendly , and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had the benefit of consistently favourable conditions , then they should also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with the willow . According to English commentator John Arlott , the playing surface was easier for batting than it had been at the start of the day , " but the difference was not such as to cause hesitation in the best batsmen in England " . 
 Eventually , Australia was forced to take the second new ball , and Bedser was finally removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top @-@ scored with 63 in 101 minutes , with six boundaries , having reached his first 50 in only 60 minutes . O 'Reilly said " There was nothing about his batting to suggest that luck was going his way or that he was short of batting experience . " Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with his accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch , while Lindwall and Toshack took one wicket each . Spin was not used in abundance , as Johnson bowled five overs and Morris three . Following England 's struggles in the first innings , many pundits criticised Yardley 's decision to bat first . 
 Australia had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play . Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings , which was a wide by Edrich . Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire Frank Chester in a casual tone " Eh , the light ! " , which allegedly shocked the arbiter . During the previous Ashes series in Australia , Barnes had continuously made time @-@ wasting appeals against the light , which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal ; if this was declined it would be up to the umpires to offer an adjournment . Despite the appeal against the light , the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich 's bowling , scoring 11 runs from his two overs . Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball bowling of Edrich and Bedser . They reached stumps at 17 without loss , with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six . Barnes had been fortunate , edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon , and Yardley 's decision to place his bowlers Young and Bedser in that region raised surprise ; bowlers tend to lack the agility and reflexes needed for such positions . At this stage , following their tail @-@ end resistance , England were in a good position with runs on the board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket , forcing the Australians to bat in hostile conditions the following day . 
 = = 11 June : Day Two = = 
 Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted the players on the second day . After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon , Edrich was relieved of the new ball , which was given to Barnett , who accompanied Bedser . Both bowlers swung the ball into the right @-@ handed Barnes and away from the left @-@ handed Morris . Not a frontline bowler , Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace , and the Australians wanted to make a safe start , so they decided to play him watchfully . This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them . 
 Barnes batted assuredly , while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease . At one stage , Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes . Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the umpire failed to evade a drive from Morris and stopped it with his foot . Barnes picked the ball off the ground and handed it to the bowler , prompting a finger @-@ wagging from Chester , to which Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball . Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from Bedser and edged it to wicket @-@ keeper Evans , who dropped the catch . The batsman recomposed himself and hit Young 's first ball — a full toss — for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss . After the wayward start , Young began to bowl with consistent accuracy . 
 Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting . Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away , but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad , and the ball rebounded onto the stumps . Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field , employing leg theory to slow the scoring . The English leader packed the leg side with fielders , including two short legs , and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump . Bradman almost inside @-@ edged the second ball onto his stumps , before defending uneasily for a period . With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end , Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting . The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career , and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself . At the other end , Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder . Now aged 40 , Bradman 's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past . Barnes then reached his half @-@ century after 135 minutes , pulling Barnett for four , and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting . At the adjournment , the tourists were 104 / 1 . 
 The score had progressed to 121 when Barnes tried to cut Laker , but only edged it onto the thigh of wicket @-@ keeper Evans . The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one @-@ handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62 . Umpire Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into the ground before Evans took the catch , and consulted with Chester , who had been standing at point on the other side of the field , before ruling the batsman out . Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck in Laker 's next over without further addition to Australia 's total . He failed to pick Laker 's arm ball , which drifted away and went straight on instead of turning inwards , thereby clipping the outside edge of his bat . The ball flew to slip where Edrich completed the catch . The hard @-@ hitting Miller had come in at No. 4 , a position usually occupied by vice @-@ captain Lindsay Hassett , a more sedate batsman , indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack , but the change in batting order failed . 
 Laker to this point had taken 3 / 22 from 12 @.@ 4 overs , having also top @-@ scored in the first innings . All the while , Australia had been scoring slowly , as they would for most of the day . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in the middle order , but Bradman brought him in ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to starting his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball . The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball to attack the spinners , hitting them through the off side . Yardley removed Laker — who was bowling effectively — from the attack and took the second new ball , bringing back Bedser and Edrich . However , this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes , and in the first 40 minutes after lunch , 43 runs were added . Yardley brought back his two spinners , and Australia passed England 's total before the English captain brought himself on to bowl , trapping Brown — who was attempting to push the ball to mid @-@ on — lbw with an off cutter in his first over . This ended a 64 @-@ run stand in 58 minutes and Hassett came in at 185 / 4 . The Australian vice @-@ captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from Bedser into the air , narrowly evading the grasp of Evans . Following the departure of Brown , the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once . 
 Yardley continued to employ a leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump . During one over , Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England 's tactics . During the 15 minutes before tea , the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd . Bradman reached tea on 78 , and 55 minutes after the resumption of play , he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes . It was his 28th Test century , and his 18th in Ashes Tests . The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate , and it was one of Bradman 's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets . Nevertheless , Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings , and patiently scored most of his runs between mid @-@ off and mid @-@ on , often from the back foot . After Bradman had reached his milestone , many of the spectators began to leave the ground , content with what they had seen . 
 Bradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130 . Hassett also batted patiently , with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30 . Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss , ending at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 , with Hassett on 41 . Young had bowled 32 overs to a leg side field , conceding only 53 runs . Fingleton described the afternoon day 's play as a " very shrewd display of tactics " and said that although the proceedings and the progress of the Australian batsmen had been slow , they were " never ... dull " . He added : " Bradman was on top by virtue of the facts that his side was well ahead of England , his own score was 130 and he was also unconquered . " However , O 'Reilly disagreed and said the Australians had not made enough progress as they should or could have . He said the batsmen failed to capitalise on the fatigue of the bowlers late in the day by not going on the attack in search of quick runs , instead of their " monotonously dull " strategy of patient attrition . O 'Reilly claimed that in containing the opposition batsmen , the English attack had " shared the honours of the day with — if they did not actually steal them from — Bradman . " Bradman and Hassett had made physical gestures indicating their displeasure at England 's tactics , but O 'Reilly felt Yardley had no choice after his team had squandered the initiative with their poor batting , and claimed it was up to the Australians to turn their advantage into a decisive , match @-@ winning position . Arlott disagreed with O 'Reilly , and said Australia " had time to build ... without risk or hurry on a gentle and accommodating ... wicket . Given a winning opportunity , it is characteristic of the Australians that they will never dissipate it by over @-@ anxiety or by carelessness . " 
 After the day 's play , O 'Reilly — a former teammate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist — consulted Bedser on his use of leg theory . During his career O 'Reilly had often attacked leg stump , and had devised a plan to ensnare Bradman . 
 = = 12 June : Day Three = = 
 On the third morning , amid sunshine , Bradman resumed on 130 , before progressing to 132 and becoming the first player to pass 1 @,@ 000 runs for the English season . The Australian captain was not aware of the reason for the spontaneous crowd applause until being notified by wicket @-@ keeper Evans . 
 Bedser was bowling and he soon implemented O 'Reilly 's plans . Hutton was moved from leg slip to a squarer position at short fine leg , around 11 metres from the bat . Two short legs and a mid @-@ on were put in place . Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary , but on the next ball , his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an inswinger from Bedser straight to Hutton at short fine leg , who caught the ball without having to move . Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as Johnson walked in to replace him with Australia at 305 / 5 , Bedser waved to O 'Reilly in the press box . When former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton — a teammate of both Bradman and O 'Reilly who was also working as a journalist — reported what his colleague had done , there was some debate as to whether O 'Reilly 's actions were treacherous . 
 Johnson made 21 , including an edge over the slips cordon , before being bowled by Laker . He inside edged the ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps . At the same time , Yardley pinned Hassett down with more leg theory . Laker bowled with one slip , while Young had none and had all of his fielders evenly spread in a circular formation . Tallon came in and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left @-@ arm orthodox spin of Young . The scoring was very slow during this passage of play — Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26 @-@ over spell conceded only 14 runs . Hassett conducted himself in a humorous way , and Arlott said : " only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable " . He mainly scored from deflections and was for the most part prepared to take his time . 
 The injured Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 without a runner to join Hassett , and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty . Hassett , who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day , swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match . The Australian vice @-@ captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94 . The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed . 
 After the break , Hassett reached his century after 305 minutes of batting , his first in Tests in England . He then accelerated , adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser , having struck 20 fours and a six . The dismissal ended an eighth @-@ wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall , who was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later , having scored 42 with seven fours . Australia 's last @-@ wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes , batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner , before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344 @-@ run lead . Australia had batted for 216 @.@ 2 overs , the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners ; Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44 @.@ 2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . The part @-@ time seam bowlers , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley , bowled 18 , 17 and 17 overs respectively . Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining . Yardley 's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience . 
 England thus started their second innings still 344 runs in arrears . Although Lindwall was able to run between the wickets , he did not take to the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey took his place . Fingleton called Harvey " by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides " . Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field , but did not formally object to Harvey 's presence on the field . O 'Reilly said Lindwall had demonstrated his mobility during his innings , was in no way " incapacitated " and that the English captain " must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far " when no substitute was justified . O 'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution , agreeing with Fingleton 's judgement of Harvey was the tourists ' best fielder by far . Arlott went further , calling Harvey the best fielder in the world . 
 Four of the first five runs were leg byes ; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top @-@ edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon . The batsman was displeased with the umpire 's decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt , indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat . Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle , he defiantly held up his end of the pitch . After scoring 13 from 43 minutes , Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson . He did not read the arm ball , which went straight on and took the outside edge , leaving England 39 / 2 . Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton . The latter , coming in upon the fall of Edrich , ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run . He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson when he was on eight . Compton appeared ready to walk off , but umpire Chester declined the appeal , much to his surprise . England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing , Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources . The part @-@ time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest , and Miller resumed bowling late in the day , delivering slow off spin to conserve energy . Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely , using their placement to bisect the gaps between the fielders . The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point . 
 Hutton then leg glanced Miller , before cover driving and square cutting him in another over . All three shots went for four and he reached his fifty in 110 minutes . Miller responded to the spate of boundaries with a series of bouncers , including five in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short @-@ pitched barrage , including shouts of " Bodyline " . The original practitioners of Bodyline , Harold Larwood and Bill Voce , were both from Nottinghamshire and played at Trent Bridge , and were later excluded from selection for England after being blamed for the ill @-@ feeling caused by Bodyline . The Nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that Miller was able to do something they saw to be equivalent . For his part , Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it , grinning and flicking his hair . However , Hutton had the last word , glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day . England were 121 / 2 , with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively . Miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off the field , and the crowded surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room . O 'Reilly defended Miller 's use of short @-@ pitched deliveries , pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed the batsman the opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try ; in contrast the packed Bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal . 
 = = 14 June : Day Four = = 
 The third day was followed by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning , a Monday , with England still 223 runs in arrears . Before the start of play , the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club ( NCCC ) secretary , H. A. Brown , broadcast an appeal to the gallery over the public address system to refrain from their heckling of Miller . 
 Let us keep Nottingham a place where Test matches can continue to be played . On Saturday the Australian , Miller , was booed and there was much subsequent publicity in the press . These Australians are great sportsmen . They stood by the Empire in the war and we should always be pleased to greet them . Let us show them how really pleased we are and give them a warmhearted greeting this morning . 
 The crowd responded by clapping as the Australians took to the field . The chairman of the NCCC reportedly apologised to Bradman in private for the crowd reaction to Miller . 
 As the new ball was due soon after the start of the play , Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller . In his first over , Johnson extracted sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump ; not expecting much spin , Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads , but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw . Otherwise , Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated , although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly . Despite this , Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day as soon as it was available . Mindful of recent events , Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning . In the overcast conditions , Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball ; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps . At the other end , Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways . Meanwhile , Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling . After half an hour of play , an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead . The rejection of the appeal made little difference , as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending the 111 @-@ run partnership at 150 / 3 . Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours , and as in the first innings , he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat , resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps . The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff , and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery , and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings . However , this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped . It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near @-@ misses . He played and missed at one ball , inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs . Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter , especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump , and the poor visibility further hindered him . 
 At 12 : 35 , bad light stopped proceedings , and after two inspections the umpires resumed play , although Arlott claimed that visibility was " barely more than a half candle @-@ power better " . Hardstaff then batted aggressively , walking towards the bowling and hitting three cover drives for four from Miller and Johnston , in one period in which he outscored Compton 23 to four . He then edged through slips for another boundary before Compton swept Toshack to the fence . In the final over before the lunch break , Hardstaff square drove Johnston for four off the back foot and England adjourned at 191 / 3 with Compton on 63 and Hardstaff 31 , still 153 in arrears . During the session , Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row in an attempt to pressure the Englishmen , while Toshack bowled defensively from the other end . 
 After lunch , the light was again poor , but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment . Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead , so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket , Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface . Bradman anticipated rain , so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England 's progress in the hope that the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised . As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman , the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen . In foggy and misty conditions , Hardstaff brought up England 's 200 with a strongly @-@ hit hook that almost hit Barnes . Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack , prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions . Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line . 
 The innings was interrupted by bad light and upon the resumption of proceedings , poor visibility intervened for a second time with Compton on 97 . After 55 minutes of delay , the umpires called the players back onto the field . Wisden said : " rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day . " Fingleton said the conditions were " pitiable " and lamented the " utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting the ball " . O 'Reilly said it was " without doubt the worst light " under which he had seen a first @-@ class match proceed . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge by hitting a single to square leg , a " lovely century of stroke @-@ play and patience " according to Fingleton . The innings had taken 227 minutes and included 12 fours , and Compton had regularly hit the ball in the middle of his bat despite the poor visibility , which meant the batsmen could not see the ball once it was close to the boundary . O 'Reilly described the innings as " one of the greatest batting efforts in the story of Anglo @-@ Australian Tests " , adding that " his hundred runs was but a poor measure by which to estimate the value of his magnificent innings " , deeming Compton 's innings equivalent to a double century under normal conditions . Arlott said " In its manner , its style and its context it must rank with any innings he has ever played ... his innings will remain a Test classic . " 
 Soon after , Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller , but Johnson spilled the catch . Hardstaff fell for 43 , lofting Toshack to Hassett on the leg side , having put on 93 with Compton . The ball looped up in the air and travelled half @-@ way to the square leg boundary , but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog . Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller , who completed a difficult catch in slips . Yardley came out to bat at 264 / 5 and Compton drove Miller square for four , provoking the bowler 's first bouncer of the day . Compton hooked it away for two and Miller 's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton 's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd . Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman . Compton and Yardley put on a 57 @-@ run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead of Australia , with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10 . During the day , Johnston bowled the most overs , 30 .

 Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , the latter being the more aggressive , and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes after the start of play . At the time , it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw . After half an hour of stoppages , play resumed and Evans attacked , hitting two fours in quick succession . England 's wicket @-@ keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently , but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted . For his part , Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain , while Evans continued to attack the bowling . The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day , but were turned down . Australia took the new ball , but the home team 's batsmen continued to proceed steadily , Evans being particularly aggressive . After a second interruption for poor light , this time for ten minutes , play resumed , and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405 / 6 . 
 Miller bowled a fast and very short bouncer at Compton , who moved into position to hook before changing his mind and attempting to evade the ball . He lost balance and threw his legs apart , trying to avoid stepping onto his stumps . However , he was unsuccessful and was out hit wicket for 184 , having batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden said : " No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first @-@ class attack in such trying circumstances . " Fingleton said it was " a most depressing end to an innings that will live always " . O 'Reilly described it as " an unsavoury ending to one of the greatest fighting knocks in Test history " . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the English tail and Australia quickly finished off the rest of the batsmen in 36 minutes . Miller bowled Laker — who played outside the line of the ball — for four , Evans reached 50 and was caught behind from Johnston , who then castled Young for nine . England were all out for 441 after 183 overs , leaving Australia a target of 98 in three hours . Lindwall 's absence throughout the England innings meant the remaining four Australian frontline bowlers had bowled more than 32 overs each — Johnston delivered 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Toshack and Johnson took a wicket each from 33 and 42 overs respectively . 
 Australia progressed quickly at the start of the chase . Barnes took 13 runs , including three boundaries , from the opening over , bowled by Bedser , while Morris again lacked fluency . However , Barnes continued to score quickly , and 24 runs came from the first four overs . Yardley tried to stop the run @-@ scoring by bringing on Young , but Morris hit him for four and the bowler was promptly taken off . The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine ; after bowling several balls that moved away , Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger . Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off , and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch . Bradman came to the crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the mark . From the 10th ball he faced , the Australian skipper was out for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser 's leg trap . Bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by the same trap in consecutive innings , and his departure left Australia at 48 / 2 . It was the first time in four tours to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test . 
 Upon Bradman 's dismissal , dark clouds began to close in on the ground , and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England . However , it never came , and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes . The pair attacked , Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries , and later pulling another ball in the air for another four . Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch , but the ball was dropped . The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries , having been prolific on the square cut . He tied the scores with a swept boundary , and having taken a stump as souvenir , ran off the ground believing the match was over . Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The First Test was a continuation of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia 's pacemen . Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match , and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat . Apart from Hardstaff , none of the remaining batsmen passed 25 . Wisden 's verdict was that England fought back very well , but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day . Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw , and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to <unk> defeat . However , he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued . 
 Australia 's success came at a cost , with Lindwall injured and unable to bowl in the lead @-@ up to the Second Test , missing the intervening matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire . The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall 's breaking down mid @-@ Test generated severe back pain , and he was still not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at Lord 's . Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord 's Test . Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall 's fitness , but the bowler 's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat , allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury . Miller also played , but still nursing his back , was unfit to bowl . 
 Content with their convincing win at Trent Bridge , Australia made no changes to their team , while England made three , omitting Barnett , Hardstaff and Young due to a combination of injury and poor form . Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test . Despite his injury , Lindwall played a key role in a heavy 409 @-@ run Australian victory , taking eight wickets . His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton , who performed poorly at Lord 's , for the Third Test . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short @-@ pitched bowling . This decision pleased the Australians , who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat . 
 On the field , the Australians continued to flourish . The Third Test was a rain @-@ affected draw , and between the First and Fourth Tests , they won four of their five county matches , drawing the other . On the final day of the Fourth Test , Australia 's batsmen set a world Test cricket record by scoring 404 to win the match , thereby taking a series @-@ winning 3 – 0 lead . 
 After the historic win in the Fourth Test , Australia had five tour matches before the final Test . They won three while two ended in rain @-@ curtailed draws . Australia then completed the series with an innings victory in the Fifth Test at The Oval to complete a 4 – 0 result . The Fifth Test was the last international match of the tour , and the tourists had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman 's aim of going through the English season undefeated . Apart from two washed @-@ out matches , Bradman 's men had little difficulty , winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings . They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated , earning themselves the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 = Periodic table = 
 The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements , ordered by their atomic number ( number of protons ) , electron configurations , and recurring chemical properties . This ordering shows periodic trends , such as elements with similar behavior in the same column . It also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties . In general , within one row ( period ) the elements are metals on the left , and non @-@ metals on the right . 
 The rows of the table are called periods ; the columns are called groups . Six groups ( columns ) have names as well as numbers : for example , group 17 elements are the halogens ; and group 18 , the noble gases . The periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements , and predict the properties of new elements yet to be discovered or synthesized . The periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior , and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences . 
 Dmitri Mendeleev published in 1869 the first widely recognized periodic table . He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then @-@ known elements . Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then @-@ unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table . Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered . Mendeleev 's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior . 
 All elements from atomic numbers 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) have been discovered or synthesized , with the most recent additions ( elements 113 , 115 , 117 , and 118 ) being confirmed by the IUPAC on December 30 , 2015 . The first 94 elements exist naturally , although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature . Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors . Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued . Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Each chemical element has a unique atomic number ( Z ) representing the number of protons in its nucleus . Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms , with these variants being referred to as isotopes . For example , carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes : all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well , but about one per cent have seven neutrons , and a very small fraction have eight neutrons . Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table ; they are always grouped together under a single element . Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes , where such masses are shown , listed in parentheses . 
 In the standard periodic table , the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number ( the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom ) . A new row ( period ) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron . Columns ( groups ) are determined by the electron configuration of the atom ; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns ( e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p @-@ subshell ) . Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table , although in the f @-@ block , and to some respect in the d @-@ block , the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties , as well . Thus , it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it . 
 As of 2016 , the periodic table has 118 confirmed elements , from element 1 ( hydrogen ) to 118 ( ununoctium ) . Elements 113 , 115 , 117 and 118 were officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) in December 2015 . Their proposed names , nihonium ( Nh ) , moscovium ( Mc ) , tennessine ( Ts ) and oganesson ( Og ) respectively , were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 . These names will not be formally approved until after the five @-@ month public comment period ends in November 2016 . Until then , they are formally identified by their atomic number ( e.g. , " element 113 " ) , or by their provisional systematic name ( " ununtrium " , symbol " Uut " ) . 
 The first 94 elements occur naturally ; the remaining 24 , americium to ununoctium ( 95 – 118 ) occur only when synthesised in laboratories . Of the 94 naturally occurring elements , 84 are primordial and 10 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements . No element heavier than einsteinium ( element 99 ) has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form , nor has astatine ( element 85 ) ; francium ( element 87 ) has been only photographed in the form of light emitted from microscopic quantities ( 300 @,@ 000 atoms ) . 
 = = Grouping methods = = 
 = = = Groups = = = 
 A group or family is a vertical column in the periodic table . Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks , explained below . Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell . Consequently , elements in the same group tend to have a shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number . However , in some parts of the periodic table , such as the d @-@ block and the f @-@ block , horizontal similarities can be as important as , or more pronounced than , vertical similarities . 
 Under an international naming convention , the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column ( the alkali metals ) to the rightmost column ( the noble gases ) . Previously , they were known by roman numerals . In America , the roman numerals were followed by either an " A " if the group was in the s- or p @-@ block , or a " B " if the group was in the d @-@ block . The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today 's naming convention ( e.g. the group 4 elements were group IVB , and the group 14 elements were group IVA ) . In Europe , the lettering was similar , except that " A " was used if the group was before group 10 , and " B " was used for groups including and after group 10 . In addition , groups 8 , 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple @-@ sized group , known collectively in both notations as group VIII . In 1988 , the new IUPAC naming system was put into use , and the old group names were deprecated . 
 Some of these groups have been given trivial ( unsystematic ) names , as seen in the table below , although some are rarely used . Groups 3 – 10 have no trivial names and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group ( such as " the scandium group " for Group 3 ) , since they display fewer similarities and / or vertical trends . 
 Elements in the same group tend to show patterns in atomic radius , ionization energy , and electronegativity . From top to bottom in a group , the atomic radii of the elements increase . Since there are more filled energy levels , valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus . From the top , each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound . Similarly , a group has a top to bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus . There are exceptions to these trends , however , an example of which occurs in group 11 where electronegativity increases farther down the group . 
 = = = Periods = = = 
 A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table . Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends , there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends , such as the f @-@ block , where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements . 
 Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius , ionization energy , electron affinity , and electronegativity . Moving left to right across a period , atomic radius usually decreases . This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron , which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus . This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period . The more tightly bound an element is , the more energy is required to remove an electron . Electronegativity increases in the same manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus . Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period . Metals ( left side of a period ) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals ( right side of a period ) , with the exception of the noble gases . 
 = = = Blocks = = = 
 Specific regions of the periodic table can be referred to as blocks in recognition of the sequence in which the electron shells of the elements are filled . Each block is named according to the subshell in which the " last " electron notionally resides . The s @-@ block comprises the first two groups ( alkali metals and alkaline earth metals ) as well as hydrogen and helium . The p @-@ block comprises the last six groups , which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC group numbering ( 3A to 8A in American group numbering ) and contains , among other elements , all of the metalloids . The d @-@ block comprises groups 3 to 12 ( or 3B to 2B in American group numbering ) and contains all of the transition metals . The f @-@ block , often offset below the rest of the periodic table , has no group numbers and comprises lanthanides and actinides . 
 = = = Metals , metalloids and nonmetals = = = 
 According to their shared physical and chemical properties , the elements can be classified into the major categories of metals , metalloids and nonmetals . Metals are generally shiny , highly conducting solids that form alloys with one another and salt @-@ like ionic compounds with nonmetals ( other than the noble gases ) . The majority of nonmetals are colored or colorless insulating gases ; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding . In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids , which have intermediate or mixed properties . 
 Metal and nonmetals can be further classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non @-@ metallic properties , when going left to right in the rows . The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals , through the less reactive alkaline earth metals , lanthanides and actinides , via the archetypal transition metals , and ending in the physically and chemically weak post @-@ transition metals . The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals , which , being nearest to the metalloids , show some incipient metallic character ; the diatomic nonmetals , which are essentially nonmetallic ; and the monatomic noble gases , which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert . Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals , which are subsets ( in this example ) of the transition metals , are also known and occasionally denoted . 
 Placing the elements into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect . There is a spectrum of properties within each category and it is not hard to find overlaps at the boundaries , as is the case with most classification schemes . Beryllium , for example , is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post transition metal . Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal . Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into mineralogical occurrence categories , or crystalline structures . <unk> the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties , such as the metals and the nonmetals , or the gaseous elements . 
 = = Periodic trends = = 
 = = = Electron configuration = = = 
 The electron configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity . The electrons occupy a series of electron shells ( numbered shell 1 , shell 2 , and so on ) . Each shell consists of one or more subshells ( named s , p , d , f and g ) . As atomic number increases , electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule , as shown in the diagram . The electron configuration for neon , for example , is 1s2 2s2 <unk> . With an atomic number of ten , neon has two electrons in the first shell , and eight electrons in the second shell — two in the s subshell and six in the p subshell . In periodic table terms , the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period , these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals . 
 Since the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration , the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour , some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii , ionization energy and electron affinity . It is this periodicity of properties , manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed , that led to the establishment of the periodic law ( the properties of the elements recur at varying intervals ) and the formulation of the first periodic tables . 
 = = = Atomic radii = = = 
 Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table . For instance , the radii generally decrease along each period of the table , from the alkali metals to the noble gases ; and increase down each group . The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period . These trends of the atomic radii ( and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements ) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom ; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory . 
 The electrons in the 4f @-@ subshell , which is progressively filled from cerium ( element 58 ) to ytterbium ( element 70 ) , are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub @-@ shells further out . The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them . Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius ( and chemistry ) as zirconium , and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium , and so forth . This is known as the lanthanide contraction . The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum ( element 78 ) , after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect . The d @-@ block contraction , which is a similar effect between the d @-@ block and p @-@ block , is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause . 
 = = = Ionization energy = = = 
 The first ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove one electron from an atom , the second ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom , and so on . For a given atom , successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization . For magnesium as an example , the first ionization energy is 738 kJ / mol and the second is 1450 kJ / mol . Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction ; thus , their removal requires increasingly more energy . Ionization energy becomes greater up and to the right of the periodic table . 
 Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas ( complete electron shell ) configuration . For magnesium again , the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons , and the third ionization energy is a much larger <unk> kJ / mol , for the removal of a 2p electron from the very stable neon @-@ like configuration of Mg2 + . Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third @-@ row atoms . 
 = = = Electronegativity = = = 
 Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons . An atom 's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus . The higher its electronegativity , the more an element attracts electrons . It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932 . In general , electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period , and decreases on descending a group . Hence , fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements , while caesium is the least , at least of those elements for which substantial data is available . 
 There are some exceptions to this general rule . Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d @-@ block contraction . Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d @-@ electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge , and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity . The anomalously high electronegativity of lead , particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth , appears to be an artifact of data selection ( and data availability ) — methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements . 
 = = = Electron affinity = = = 
 The electron affinity of an atom is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion . Although electron affinity varies greatly , some patterns emerge . Generally , nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals . Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron . The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively , so they may or may not have slightly negative values . 
 Electron affinity generally increases across a period . This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom ; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable . 
 A trend of decreasing electron affinity going down groups would be expected . The additional electron will be entering an orbital farther away from the nucleus . As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added . However , in going down a group , around one @-@ third of elements are anomalous , with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter <unk> . Largely , this is due to the poor shielding by d and f electrons . A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms . 
 = = = Metallic character = = = 
 The lower the values of ionization energy , electronegativity and electron affinity , the more metallic character the element has . Conversely , nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties . Given the periodic trends of these three properties , metallic character tends to decrease going across a period ( or row ) and , with some irregularities ( mostly ) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons , and relativistic effects , tends to increase going down a group ( or column or family ) . Thus , the most metallic elements ( such as caesium and francium ) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements ( oxygen , fluorine , chlorine ) at the top right . The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair @-@ shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables , and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line , or elements adjacent to those elements , as metalloids .

 = = = First <unk> attempts = = = 
 In 1789 , Antoine Lavoisier published a list of 33 chemical elements , grouping them into gases , metals , nonmetals , and earths . Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme . In 1829 , Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed that many of the elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties . Lithium , sodium , and potassium , for example , were grouped together in a triad as soft , reactive metals . Döbereiner also observed that , when arranged by atomic weight , the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third ; this became known as the Law of Triads . German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system , and by 1843 he had identified ten triads , three groups of four , and one group of five . Jean @-@ Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals . Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements , they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all . 
 In 1857 , German chemist August Kekulé observed that carbon often has four other atoms bonded to it . Methane , for example , has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms . This concept eventually became known as valency ; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms . 
 In 1862 , Alexandre @-@ Emile <unk> de <unk> , a French geologist , published an early form of periodic table , which he called the telluric helix or screw . He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements . With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight , de <unk> showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals . His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements . His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram ; as a result , it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev . 
 In 1864 , Julius Lothar Meyer , a German chemist , published a table with 44 elements arranged by valency . The table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same valency . Concurrently , William Odling ( an English chemist ) published an arrangement of 57 elements , ordered on the basis of their atomic weights . With some irregularities and gaps , he noticed what appeared to be a periodicity of atomic weights among the elements and that this accorded with " their usually received groupings " . Odling alluded to the idea of a periodic law but did not pursue it . He subsequently proposed ( in 1870 ) a valence @-@ based classification of the elements . 
 English chemist John Newlands produced a series of papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight , similar physical and chemical properties recurred at intervals of eight ; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music . This so termed Law of <unk> , however , was ridiculed by Newlands ' contemporaries , and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work . Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements and used it to predict the existence of missing elements , such as germanium . The Chemical Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev . 
 In 1867 , Gustavus Hinrichs , a Danish born academic chemist based in America , published a spiral periodic system based on atomic spectra and weights , and chemical similarities . His work was regarded as idiosyncratic , ostentatious and labyrinthine and this may have militated against its recognition and acceptance . 
 = = = Mendeleev 's table = = = 
 Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870 , respectively . Mendeleev 's table was his first published version ; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his ( Meyer 's ) table of 1864 . They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat . 
 The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev 's table came from two decisions he made . The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered . Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so , but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements , such as gallium and germanium . The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements , such as tellurium and iodine , to better classify them into chemical families . Later in 1913 , Henry Moseley determined experimental values of the nuclear charge or atomic number of each element , and showed that Mendeleev 's ordering actually corresponds to the order of increasing atomic number . 
 The significance of atomic numbers to the organization of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood . Mendeleev 's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements , information <unk> to fair precision in his time . Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to ( as noted ) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known . Substitution of atomic numbers , once understood , gave a definitive , integer @-@ based sequence for the elements , and Moseley predicted ( in 1913 ) that the only elements still missing between aluminium ( Z = 13 ) and gold ( Z = 79 ) were Z = 43 , 61 , 72 and 75 , all of which were later discovered .

 In 1871 , Mendeleev published his periodic table in a new form , with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows , and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element 's oxidation state . He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing , but should exist . These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements . It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was francium ( referred to by Mendeleev as eka @-@ caesium ) in 1939 . However , plutonium , produced synthetically in 1940 , was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring primordial element in 1971 . 
 The popular periodic table layout , also known as the common or standard form ( as shown at various other points in this article ) , is attributable to Horace Groves Deming . In 1923 , Deming , an American chemist , published short ( Mendeleev style ) and medium ( 18 @-@ column ) form periodic tables . Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming 's 18 @-@ column medium table , in 1928 , which was widely circulated in American schools . By the 1930s Deming 's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry . It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent @-@ Welch Scientific Company . 
 With the development of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms , it became apparent that each period ( row ) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons . Larger atoms have more electron sub @-@ shells , so later tables have required progressively longer periods . 
 In 1945 , Glenn Seaborg , an American scientist , made the suggestion that the actinide elements , like the lanthanides , were filling an f sub @-@ level . Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d @-@ block row . Seaborg 's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career . As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute , he published anyway . Seaborg 's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently went on to win the 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements . 
 Although minute quantities of some transuranic elements occur naturally , they were all first discovered in laboratories . Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly , the first of these being neptunium , synthesized in 1939 . Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly , they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced . There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements , requiring independent review to determine which party has priority , and hence naming rights . The most recently accepted and named elements are flerovium ( element 114 ) and livermorium ( element 116 ) , both named on 31 May 2012 . In 2010 , a joint Russia – US collaboration at Dubna , Moscow Oblast , Russia , claimed to have synthesized six atoms of ununseptium ( element 117 ) , making it the most recently claimed discovery . 
 On December 30 , 2015 , elements 113 , 115 , 117 , and 118 were formally recognized by IUPAC , completing the seventh row of the periodic table . Official names and symbols for each of these elements , which will replace temporary designations such as ununpentium ( Uup ) in the case of element 115 , are expected to be announced later in 2016 . On June 8 , 2016 , IUPAC announced the proposed names for each element . <unk> ( Nh ) is the proposed name for element 113 due to its discovery at RIKEN in Japan . It will be the first element to be named after a location in East Asia . Element 115 has the proposed name of moscovium ( Mc ) after the location of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow , Russia . Element 117 has the proposed name of tennessine ( Ts ) , referencing the state of Tennessee in the United States which is home to Oak Ridge National Laboratory . Lastly , element 118 has the proposed name of oganesson ( Og ) , after in honour of the Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian who led the team that synthesized it . 
 = = Different periodic tables = = 
 = = = Group 3 constitution variants = = = 
 There are three main variants of periodic table , each differing as to the constitution of group 3 . Scandium and yttrium are uniformly shown as the first two members of this group ; the differences hinge on the identity of the remaining members . 
 Group 3 is Sc , Y , and La , Ac . Lanthanum ( La ) and actinium ( Ac ) occupy the two positions below yttrium . This variant is the most common . It emphasizes similarities in periodic trends going down groups 1 , 2 and 3 , at the expense of discontinuities in periodic trends between groups 3 and 4 and fragmenting the lanthanides and actinides . 
 Group 3 is Sc , Y , and Lu , Lr . Lutetium ( Lu ) and lawrencium ( Lr ) occupy the two positions below yttrium . This variant retains a 14 @-@ column wide f @-@ block while fragmenting the lanthanides and actinides . It emphasizes similarities in periodic trends between group 3 and the following groups at the expense of discontinuities in periodic trends between groups 2 and 3 . 
 Group 3 is Sc , Y , and 15 lanthanides and 15 actinides . The two positions below yttrium contain the lanthanides and the actinides ( possibly by footnote markers ) . This variant emphasizes similarities in the chemistry of the 15 lanthanide elements ( La – Lu ) , at the expense of ambiguity as to which elements occupy the two group 3 positions below yttrium , and seemingly a 15 @-@ column wide f block ( there can only be 14 elements in any row of the f block ) . 
 The three variants originate from historical difficulties in placing the lanthanides in the periodic table , and arguments as to where the f block elements start and end . It has been claimed that such arguments are proof that , " it is a mistake to break the [ periodic ] system into sharply delimited blocks " . Equally , some versions of the two markers table have been criticized for implying that all 15 lanthanides occupy the single box or place below yttrium , in breach of the basic principle of one place , one element . The controversy over which two elements occupy the Group 3 positions below scandium and yttrium is further discussed in the Open questions and controversies section of this article . 
 The Lu and Lr table is shown in the lead and overview section of this article . When compared to the La and Ac variant , there are fewer apparent exceptions to the regular filling of the 4f orbitals among the subsequent members of the series . Unlike the two markers variant , there is no ambiguity on the composition of group 3 . 
 = = = Periodic tables by different structure = = = 
 Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev 's table in 1869 it has been estimated that around 700 different periodic table versions were published . As well as numerous rectangular variations , other periodic table formats have been shaped , for example , like a circle , cube , cylinder , building , spiral , lemniscate , octagonal prism , pyramid , sphere , or triangle . Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables . 
 The modern periodic table is sometimes expanded into its long or 32 @-@ column form by reinstating the footnoted f @-@ block elements into their natural position between the s- and d @-@ blocks . Unlike the 18 @-@ column form this arrangement results in " no interruptions to the sequence [ of ] increasing atomic numbers " . The relationship of the f @-@ block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see . Jensen advocates a form of table with 32 columns on the grounds that the lanthanides and actinides are otherwise relegated in the minds of students as dull , unimportant elements that can be quarantined and ignored . Despite these advantages the 32 @-@ column form is generally avoided by editors on account of its undue rectangular ratio ( compared to a book page ratio ) . 
 A popular alternative structure is that of Theodor <unk> ( 1960 ) . The elements are arranged in a continuous spiral , with hydrogen at the center and the transition metals , lanthanides , and actinides occupying peninsulas . 
 Most periodic tables are two @-@ dimensional ; however , three @-@ dimensional tables are known to as far back as at least 1862 ( pre @-@ dating Mendeleev 's two @-@ dimensional table of 1869 ) . More recent examples include <unk> ' Periodic Classification ( 1925 ) , <unk> 's <unk> System ( 1949 ) , Giguère 's Periodic helix ( 1965 ) and Dufour 's Periodic Tree ( 1996 ) . Going one further , Stowe 's Physicist 's Periodic Table ( 1989 ) has been described as being four @-@ dimensional ( having three spatial dimensions and one color dimension ) . 
 The various forms of periodic tables can be thought of as lying on a chemistry – physics continuum . Towards the chemistry end of the continuum can be found , as an example , Rayner @-@ Canham 's " unruly " Inorganic Chemist 's Periodic Table ( 2002 ) , which emphasizes trends and patterns , and unusual chemical relationships and properties . Near the physics end of the continuum is Janet 's Left @-@ Step Periodic Table ( 1928 ) . This has a structure that shows a closer connection to the order of electron @-@ shell filling and , by association , quantum mechanics . A somewhat similar approach has been taken by Alper , albeit criticized by Scerri as disregarding the need to display chemical and physical periodicity . Somewhere in the middle of the continuum is the ubiquitous common or standard form of periodic table . This is regarded as better expressing empirical trends in physical state , electrical and thermal conductivity , and oxidation numbers , and other properties easily inferred from traditional techniques of the chemical laboratory . 
 = = Open questions and controversies = = 
 = = = Elements with unknown chemical properties = = = 
 Although all elements up to ununoctium have been discovered , of the elements above hassium ( element 108 ) , only copernicium ( element 112 ) and flerovium ( element 114 ) have known chemical properties . The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation , due to relativistic effects ; for example , flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble @-@ gas @-@ like properties , even though it is currently placed in the carbon group . More recent experiments have suggested , however , that flerovium behaves chemically like lead , as expected from its periodic table position . 
 = = = Further periodic table extensions = = = 
 It is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as period 8 , or require further adaptations or adjustments . Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly , so that it would include a two @-@ element s @-@ block for elements 119 and 120 , a new g @-@ block for the next 18 elements , and 30 additional elements continuing the current f- , d- , and p @-@ blocks . More recently , physicists such as Pekka <unk> have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule , which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table . 
 = = = Element with the highest possible atomic number = = = 
 The number of possible elements is not known . A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911 , and based on the arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row , was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256 ± ( which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern @-@ day terms ) did not exist . A higher — more recent — estimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability , which is expected to center around element 126 , as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines . Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include at element 128 by John Emsley , at element 137 by Richard Feynman , and at element 155 by Albert <unk> . 
 Bohr model 
 The Bohr model exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137 , as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than c , the speed of light . Hence the non @-@ relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element . 
 Relativistic Dirac equation 
 The relativistic Dirac equation has problems for elements with more than 137 protons . For such elements , the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound , and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra , as in the Klein paradox . More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons . For heavier elements , if the innermost orbital ( 1s ) is not filled , the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum , resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron ; however , this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled , so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table . 
 = = = Placement of hydrogen and helium = = = 
 Simply following electron configurations , hydrogen ( electronic configuration <unk> ) and helium ( 1s2 ) should be placed in groups 1 and 2 , above lithium ( [ He ] <unk> ) and beryllium ( [ He ] 2s2 ) . However , such placing is rarely used outside of the context of electron configurations : When the noble gases ( then called " inert gases " ) were first discovered around 1900 , they were known as " group 0 " , reflecting no chemical reactivity of these elements known at that point , and helium was placed on the top that group , as it did share the extreme chemical inertness seen throughout the group . As the group changed its formal number , many authors continued to assign helium directly above neon , in group 18 ; one of the examples of such placing is the current IUPAC table . 
 Hydrogen 's chemical properties are not very close to those of the alkali metals , which occupy group 1 , and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere : one of the most common alternatives is in group 17 ; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non @-@ metallic chemistry of hydrogen , and that of fluorine ( the element placed on the top of group 17 ) is strictly univalent and non @-@ metallic . Sometimes , to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens , it may be shown in two columns simultaneously . Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14 : placed that way , it fits well into the trend of increasing trends of ionization potential values and electron affinity values , and is not too stray from the electronegativity trend . Finally , hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group ; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group : unlike hydrogen , the other group 1 elements show extremely metallic behavior ; the group 17 elements commonly form salts ( hence the term " halogen " ) ; elements of any other group show some <unk> chemistry . The other period 1 element , helium , is sometimes placed separately from any group as well . The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases ( even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon ) is that in its closed electron shell , helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital , while the rest of the noble gases have eight . 
 = = = Groups included in the transition metals = = = 
 The definition of a transition metal , as given by IUPAC , is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub @-@ shell , or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub @-@ shell . By this definition all of the elements in groups 3 – 11 are transition metals . The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12 , comprising zinc , cadmium and mercury , from the transition metals category . 
 Some chemists treat the categories " d @-@ block elements " and " transition metals " interchangeably , thereby including groups 3 – 12 among the transition metals . In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding . The recent discovery that mercury can use its d electrons in the formation of mercury ( IV ) fluoride ( HgF4 ) has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal . Other commentators , such as Jensen , have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF4 can occur only under highly abnormal conditions . As such , mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term . 
 Still other chemists further exclude the group 3 elements from the definition of a transition metal . They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry . In this case , only groups 4 – 11 are regarded as transition metals . 
 = = = Period 6 and 7 elements in group 3 = = = 
 Although scandium and yttrium are always the first two elements in group 3 the identity of the next two elements is not settled . They are either lanthanum and actinium ; or lutetium and lawrencium . Physical and chemical arguments have been made in support of the latter arrangement but not all authors have been convinced . Most working chemists are not aware there is any controversy . In December 2015 an IUPAC project was established to make a recommendation on the matter . 
 Lanthanum and actinium are traditionally depicted as the remaining group 3 members . It has been suggested that this layout originated in the 1940s , with the appearance of periodic tables relying on the electron configurations of the elements and the notion of the differentiating electron . The configurations of caesium , barium and lanthanum are [ Xe ] <unk> , [ Xe ] <unk> and [ Xe ] 5d16s2 . Lanthanum thus has a 5d differentiating electron and this establishes " it in group 3 as the first member of the d @-@ block for period 6 " . A consistent set of electron configurations is then seen in group 3 : scandium [ Ar ] <unk> , yttrium [ Kr ] <unk> and lanthanum [ Xe ] 5d16s2 . Still in period 6 , ytterbium was assigned an electron configuration of [ Xe ] <unk> and lutetium [ Xe ] 4f145d16s2 , " resulting in a 4f differentiating electron for lutetium and firmly establishing it as the last member of the f @-@ block for period 6 " . Matthias described the placement of lanthanum under yttrium as , " a mistake in the periodic system — unfortunately mostly propagated by the Welsh [ Sargent @-@ Welch ] Company … and … everybody copied it " . Lavelle further argued for the retention of lanthanum under yttrium given several well @-@ known reference books featured periodic tables with such an arrangement . 
 In other tables , lutetium and lawrencium are the remaining group 3 members . Early techniques for chemically separating scandium , yttrium and lutetium relied on the fact that these elements occurred together in the so @-@ called " yttrium group " whereas La and Ac occurred together in the " cerium group " . Accordingly , lutetium rather than lanthanum was assigned to group 3 by some chemists in the 1920s and 30s . Later spectroscopic work found that the electron configuration of ytterbium was in fact [ Xe ] <unk> . This meant that ytterbium and lutetium — the latter with [ Xe ] 4f145d16s2 — both had 14 f @-@ electrons , " resulting in a d- rather than an f- differentiating electron " for lutetium and making it an " equally valid candidate " with [ Xe ] 5d16s2 lanthanum , for the group 3 periodic table position below yttrium . Several physicists in the 1950s and 60s opted for lutetium , in light of a comparison of several of its physical properties with those of lanthanum . This arrangement , in which lanthanum is the first member of the f @-@ block , is disputed by some authors since lanthanum lacks any f @-@ electrons . However , it has been argued that this is not valid concern given other periodic table anomalies — thorium , for example , has no f @-@ electrons yet is part of the f @-@ block . As for lawrencium , its electron configuration was confirmed in 2015 as [ Rn ] <unk> . Such a configuration represents another periodic table anomaly , regardless of whether lawrencium is located in the f @-@ block or the d @-@ block , as the only potentially applicable p @-@ block position has been reserved for ununtrium with its predicted electron configuration of [ Rn ] <unk> . 
 = = = Optimal form = = = 
 The many different forms of periodic table have prompted the question of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table . The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth , effectively hard @-@ wired into the universe , or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation , contingent upon the circumstances , beliefs and predilections of human observers . An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium , and the composition of group 3 . Such an underlying truth , if it exists , is thought to have not yet been discovered . In its absence , the many different forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity , each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects , properties , perspectives and relationships of and among the elements . The ubiquity of the standard or medium @-@ long periodic table is thought to be a result of this layout having a good balance of features in terms of ease of construction and size , and its depiction of atomic order and periodic trends .

 " He Loves to Fly " , also known as " He Loves to Fly and He D 'ohs " , is the season premiere of The Simpsons ’ nineteenth season and first aired on September 23 , 2007 . It was the first episode to air after the release of The Simpsons Movie on July 27 , 2007 . Homer gets to fly in Mr. Burns 's private jet and likes it so much that he decides never to fly commercial again . He tries to find a job that involves flying in a corporate jet , and hires a life coach named Colby Kraus to assist him with his goal . It was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Mark Kirkland , while Lionel Richie guest stars as himself and Stephen Colbert guests as the voice of Colby Kraus . The episode averaged 9 @.@ 7 million viewers and a 4 @.@ 7 overnight Nielsen rating and a 12 percent audience share , making the highest rated episode of The Simpsons since " The Wife Aquatic " , which aired January 7 , 2007 .

 While on a shopping trip to the Springfield Mall , Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it ( Fearing Ralph might take it ) and falls in . The rushing water nearly drowns him , but Homer arrives and pulls him out of the water , saving Mr. Burns 's life . To reward him , Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner . Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza , so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane . On the plane , Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie . Homer has the time of his life in Chicago , but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane . Back in Springfield , Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed . Marge , pitying for Homer , decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus ( Stephen Colbert ) , who will help with Homer 's dream . Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move . At the bowling alley and after watching Homer 's daily habits for a few days , Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing . He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does . The bowling shoes work , Homer becomes a new man , and as a result he receives numerous new job offers . Homer decides to only go for an interview at <unk> 's Choice Copper <unk> because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job , however , the Rich Texan does not hire him . 
 Homer decides not to tell his family and pretends to go to work every day , although he is actually just going to the local Krusty Burger . The next day , Bart 's class stops at the Krusty Burger after a field trip and Bart is shocked to discover Homer sitting at a booth alone . Homer comes clean and explains to Bart that his job interview did not go so well when his interviewer , the Rich Texan , discovered that Homer knows nothing about copper tubing . Bart convinces Homer that he should tell Marge what has happened and Homer calls her from a pay phone . But when Homer hears Marge ’ s happy voice he cannot bring himself to disappoint her and tell her the truth about his " new " job . Instead he concocts a story about him having to fly on the " company " jet for work and instructs Marge to meet him at the airport in an hour . Homer pays a Marine to fly him into the air , so he can tell Marge up in the air with luxury so she would not get upset . Once in the air , Marge cannot believe all the luxuries the private jet has to offer . Homer sits Marge down to tell her the truth , but just before he can , the plane endures turbulence . Homer and Marge head into the cockpit to see what the problem is , only to discover that the pilot had passed out . Homer shoves the pilot aside and takes hold of the jet ’ s controls . As the jet is about to hit the ocean , Marge pulls the jet 's yoke up giving the jet altitude . Marge pulls out her cell phone and calls Colby Kraus and frantically asks for his guidance . Thanks to Colby 's motivation , Homer manages to land the plane safely on the ground , however , his attempt to taxi back to the terminal fails and the plane falls into the ocean . After being airlifted out of the plane , Homer explains to Marge that flying in private jets is simply too dangerous and that he plans to go back to work at the Power Plant .

 This was the first new episode to air following the release of The Simpsons Movie , and the episode 's opening sequence is a callback to the film . Bart writes " I will not wait 20 years to make another movie " on the chalkboard and skateboards through Springfield , which is still recovering from the dome incident . Several movie characters reappear , including president Schwarzenegger , the Multi @-@ Eyed Squirrel , Colin , Russ Cargill , and the Medicine Woman . We also see that the Simpsons house is still under construction and the silo is strapped to Homer 's car . Plopper the pig is also featured for the first time in the series , during the couch gag and Homer refers to him as " my summer love . "

 When asked to appear on the show , Stephen Colbert believed that he was merely going to an audition , but was " thrilled " when the production staff told him he actually had a part in the episode . Colbert was pleased that his character was named Colby and that his appearance was similar to that of his own , although he had not expected the animators to retain his glasses for the design . He based his performance on Tony Robbins , and described the recording sessions as " the hardest job . "

 While in Chicago , Mr. Burns and Homer walk into a salon called " Ferris Bueller 's Day of Beauty " in a reference to Ferris Bueller 's Day Off . When they exit the salon , they are dressed as Ferris ( Burns ) and his friend Cameron ( Homer ) , respectively . Lionel Richie sings " Say You , Say Me " on the flight . He makes it about beer at Homer 's requests . The two titles , when changed , are " Hey You , Beer Me " and " Beer Beer , Beer Beer , " the latter of which Homer forgets the words to . Mr. Burns and Homer catch a show at the real @-@ life Second City Theater . Both Dan Castellaneta and guest star Stephen Colbert were members of Second City early in their careers . 
 Throughout the episode , in scenes where Homer is coping with his loneliness and sorrow , " Clair de Lune " , the third movement of Claude Debussy Suite <unk> , plays as the background music .

However , the ratings were down 13 % from last season 's premiere , " The Mook , the Chef , the Wife and Her Homer " , which had a 5 @.@ 3 Nielsen rating , but did better than the eighteenth season 's average of 4 @.@ 1 . Combined with the King of the Hill episode " Suite Smells of Excess " , the show finished second in the 8 PM hour , trailing NBC 's Sunday Night Football , but achieving higher ratings than the second hour of ABC 's Extreme Makeover : Home Edition and CBS 's Power of 10 . For the overall Sunday night primetime averages , FOX finished third behind NBC and CBS , with an average 10 @.@ 5 million viewers and a 4 @.@ 9 rating . 
 Brian Tallerico of UGO gave the episode a mixed review ( a C ) , expressing disappointment after the well received The Simpsons Movie . He felt the writers went " right back to their old clichés and sadly repetitive jokes " . He did praise the altered opening sequence . Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode 5 / 10 , praising the opening sequence but found most of the episode mediocre , especially Stephen Colbert 's appearance . Nonetheless , " even a mediocre episode will have a few comic gems hidden inside . The time spent in Chicago is quite enjoyable , including a great Ferris Bueller sight gag , and life coach Colby delivers a zinger of a line comparing Homer 's attitude to that of the United States of America . " Richard Keller of TV Squad praised the episode , saying " after watching so many recent ones where Homer seemed like a barely functioning mental patient , I wasn 't used to a Homer that was actually fairly normal . " Al Jean , the current executive producer of The Simpsons , has called the episode one of his personal favorites . Prefix Mag 's Andrew Martin named Lionel Richie his ninth favorite musical guest on The Simpsons out of a list of ten . 
 = Imperial War Museum = 
 Imperial War Museums ( IWM ) is a British national museum organisation with branches at five locations in England , three of which are in London . Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917 , the museum was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of Britain and its Empire during the First World War . The museum 's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 . As of 2012 , the museum aims ' to provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and " wartime experience " ' . 
 Originally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill , the museum opened to the public in 1920 . In 1924 the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington , and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark . The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference , but in the post @-@ war period the museum entered a period of decline . The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building , now referred to as Imperial War Museum London , which serves as the organisation 's corporate headquarters . During the 1970s the museum began to expand onto other sites . The first , in 1976 , was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as IWM Duxford . In 1978 the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum , having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust . In 1984 the Cabinet War Rooms , an underground wartime command centre , was opened to the public . From the 1980s onwards the museum 's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion @-@ pound redevelopments , completed in 2000 . Finally , 2002 saw the opening of IWM North in Trafford , Greater Manchester , the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England . In 2011 the museum rebranded itself as IWM , standing for ' Imperial War Museums ' . 
 The museum 's collections include archives of personal and official documents , photographs , film and video material , and oral history recordings ; an extensive library , a large art collection , and examples of military vehicles and aircraft , equipment and other artefacts . 
 The museum is funded by government grants , charitable donations and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing , licensing , and publishing . Admission is free to IWM London and IWM North , but an admission fee is levied at the other branches . The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non @-@ departmental public body under the Department for Culture , Media and Sport . As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards . Since October 2008 , the museum 's Director General has been Diane Lees .

 On 27 February 1917 Sir Alfred Mond , a Liberal MP and First Commissioner of Works , wrote to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum . This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in The Times on 26 March . A committee was established , chaired by Mond , to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum . 
 This National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain 's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army , the Navy , the production of munitions , and women 's war work . There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics . Sir Martin Conway , the Museum 's first Director General , said that exhibits must ' be <unk> by contributions expressive of the action , the experiences , the valour and the endurance of individuals ' . The museum 's first curator and secretary was Charles <unk> , who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London . In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum 's growing collection . While in France he met French government ministers , and Field Marshal Haig , who reportedly took great interest in his work . In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum . 
 The museum was opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920 . During the opening ceremony , Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on behalf of the committee , saying that ' it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war , however obscurely , would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made ' and that the museum ' was not a monument of military glory , but a record of toil and sacrifice ' . Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum . To reflect the museum 's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India , South Africa , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . While the Act was being debated , some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would ' refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War ' . On the August Bank Holiday 1920 , the first public holiday since the museum 's opening , 94 @,@ 179 visitors were received , and by November 1921 , 2 @,@ 290 @,@ 719 had visited the museum . 
 = = = Relocation 1924 – 1936 = = = 
 In 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building ( demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College ) in South Kensington . While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums , the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark . 
 The building , designed by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital 's relocation to Beckenham in Kent . The site was owned by Lord Rothermere , who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London . Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park , after Lord Rothermere 's mother . Sir Martin Conway described the building as ' ... a fine building , really quite noble building , with a great portico , a distinguishing dome , and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required . This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably , and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear ' . The ' distinguishing dome ' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital 's chapel . The museum was reopened by the Duke of York ( later King George VI ) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936 . 
 = = = Second World War and after : 1939 – 1966 = = = 
 With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict . In November 1939 , during the so @-@ called ' Phoney War ' , the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production The First Days , in which children are seen playing on some of the museum 's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War . With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May / June 1940 , however , the British Army 's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum 's artillery pieces return to military service . The museum 's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard , while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply . The museum refused , however , to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance ( which had fired Britain 's first shot of the First World War ) or a gun served by Victoria Cross @-@ winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell . The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz . On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery . A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane , which had flown at the Battle of Jutland , was destroyed . While closed to the public the museum 's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort , such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles , a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school . In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition , the first since the end of the war in August , which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department . These included the submarine fuel pipeline <unk> , the fog dispersal method FIDO , and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier . However , due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits , the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal . The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946 . A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949 . 
 In 1953 , with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved . However , despite this expansion of remit , the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum . Dr Noble Frankland , the museum 's Director from 1960 to 1982 , described the museum 's galleries in 1955 as appearing ' dingy and neglected [ and in a ] dismal state of decay ' the museum 's ' numerous stunning exhibits ' notwithstanding . 
 = = = Redevelopment and expansion : 1966 – 2012 = = = 
 In 1966 the Museum 's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities , the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site . The development also included a purpose @-@ built cinema . In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15 @-@ inch naval guns . One had been mounted on the Royal Navy 's HMS Ramillies and the other on both HMS Resolution and HMS Roberts . Both had been fired in action during the Second World War . They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968 . The acquisition of these guns , representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships , led the museum to seek to acquire a 6 @-@ inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers . This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Belfast , which became a branch of the museum in 1978 . 
 Later in 1968 on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an arsonist , Timothy John Daly , who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children . He caused damage valued at approximately £ 200 @,@ 000 , not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents . On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison . 
 In 1969 RAF Duxford , a Royal Air Force fighter airfield in Cambridgeshire was declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence . Needing further space , the museum duly requested permission to use part of the site as temporary storage . The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford , now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford became the museum 's first branch . Also during the 1970s the government raised the possibility of the museum taking over the historic Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall . The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS Belfast , but agreed in 1982 . 
 By 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building 's exhibition space , provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections , and improve facilities for visitors . The following year , in April 1984 , the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum . 
 The first phase of the works to the Southwark building started in 1986 and were completed in 1989 , during which time the museum was closed to the public . The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital 's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery . This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor ( to support the weight of very heavy exhibits ) , a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony . Into this space were placed tanks , artillery pieces , vehicles , ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War . For some years the museum was marketed as ' The new Imperial War Museum ' . This atrium , with its concentration of military hardware , has been described as ' the biggest boys ' bedroom in London ' . This first phase cost £ 16 @.@ 7 million ( of which £ 12 million was provided by the government ) and the museum was reopened by The Queen on 29 June 1989 . 
 In September 1992 the museum was the target of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions . Two incendiary devices were found in a basement gallery , but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade , and caused only minor damage . 
 The second stage of the redevelopment of the Southwark building , during which the museum remained open to the public , was completed in 1994 . During the 1990s , while these works were going on , the museum was also seeking to open a branch in the north of England . Seventy @-@ one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum , Imperial War Museum North , in Trafford , Greater Manchester . 
 The following year , 2000 , the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed . The development included the installation of the museum 's Holocaust Exhibition which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000 . This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum ; its development had taken five years at a cost of £ 5 million . Two years later , in July 2002 , Imperial War Museum North was opened . 
 Between 2004 – 2010 the museum was a partner in a national learning project entitled ' Their Past Your Future ' ( <unk> ) , part of the Big Lottery Fund 's Veterans Reunited programme to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War . A partnership between the IWM , the Museums , Libraries and Archives Council , and Scottish , Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities , phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people , overseas educational visits and further activities run by local authorities . A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit ; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media , and a professional development scheme for educators . A digital archive of the project , online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced . 
 In October 2011 the museum rebranded itself as Imperial War Museums , the initials IWM forming the basis of a new corporate logo . 
 In September 2011 the museum secured funding from <unk> , the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Arts Council England to develop ' social interpretation ' systems to allow visitors to comment on , collect , and share museum objects via social media . These systems were incorporated in ' A Family in Wartime ' an exhibition at IWM London depicting British family life during the Second World War , which opened in April 2012 . 
 = = = First World War centenary : 2014 = = = 
 In August 2009 the Museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation . Chaired by Jonathon Harmsworth the foundation was charged with raising funds to support the redevelopment of Imperial War Museum London 's permanent galleries . In December 2010 plans were announced to redevelop IWM London 's First World War gallery in time for the conflict 's centenary in 2014 , and Prince William , Duke of Cambridge became the foundation 's patron . In a speech at IWM London on 11 October 2012 , Prime Minister David Cameron announced an additional £ 5 million of government funding to support the museum 's redevelopment , as part of funding arrangements to facilitate national centenary commemorations . The £ 40 million redevelopment , designed by Foster and Partners , provides new gallery spaces dedicated to the history of the First World War , a new central hall , easier navigation and improved visitor facilities , access and circulation . In preparation for building work , a number of galleries were closed during September 2012 , and by December 2012 over sixty large objects had been removed from the IWM London atrium for conservation at Duxford . To allow building work to go ahead , IWM London closed to the public on 2 January 2013 . The museum partially reopened on 29 July 2013 . 
 IWM London was formally reopened on 17 July 2014 by Prince William , Duke of Cambridge . 
 = = Branches = = 
 From the 1970s onwards the Imperial War Museum began to expand onto other sites . The first branch , Imperial War Museum Duxford opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976 . HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum in 1978 . The Cabinet War Rooms opened in 1984 , and Imperial War Museum North in 2002 . 
 = = = Imperial War Museum London = = = 
 = = = = Architecture and layout = = = = 
 The museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936 . The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor , James Lewis , from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects , and construction completed in October 1814 . The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys , parallel to Lambeth Road , with a central entrance under a portico . 
 The building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke . In order to provide more space , he added blocks at either end of the frontage , and galleried wings on either side of the central portion . He also added a small single @-@ storey lodge , still in existence , at the Lambeth Road gate . Later , between 1844 – 46 , the central cupola was replaced with a copper @-@ clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath . The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site . 
 The building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930 . After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere , the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion ( with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall ) and Smirke 's later wings . When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery , with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery . The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre . The first floor comprised further art galleries ( including rooms dedicated to William Orpen and John Lavery ) , a gallery on women 's war work , and exhibits relating to transport and signals . The first floor also housed the museum 's photograph collection . The second floor housed the museum 's library in its west wing , and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings . This division of exhibits by service , and by civil or military activity , persisted until a wide @-@ ranging <unk> of the galleries from the 1960s onwards . In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status . 
 The original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices . The 1966 extension houses the library , art store , and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors . The first stage created 8 @,@ 000 m2 of gallery space of which 4 @,@ 600 m2 was new , and the second provided a further 1 @,@ 600 m2 . The final phase , the Southwest Infill , was partly funded by a £ 12 @.@ 6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided <unk> of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors . Before the 2013 @-@ 14 redevelopment , the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars , and of conflicts after 1945 . The ground floor comprised the atrium , cinema , temporary exhibition spaces , and visitor facilities . The first floor included the atrium mezzanine , education facilities , and a permanent gallery , Secret War , exploring special forces , espionage and covert operations . The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony , two art galleries , a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition . The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition , and the fourth floor , a vaulted roof space , accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery . Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum 's Victoria Cross ( VC ) and George Cross collection , alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft , 241 medals in total . 
 = = = = All Saints Annexe = = = = 
 In 1989 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe , a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square . The 1867 building , which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park , was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman , then later used as a hospital . It houses the museum 's photographic , film and sound archives , and offices . 
 = = = Imperial War Museum Duxford = = = 
 Imperial War Museum Duxford , near the village of Duxford in Cambridgeshire , is Britain 's largest aviation museum . Duxford houses the museum 's large exhibits , including nearly 200 aircraft , military vehicles , artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings . The site also provides storage space for the museum 's collections of film , photographs , documents , books and artefacts . The site accommodates a number of British Army regimental museums , including those of the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Anglian Regiment . 
 Based on the historic Duxford Aerodrome , the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) during the First World War . During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany . Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961 . Many of Duxford 's original buildings , such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain , are still in use . A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status . The site also features a number of purpose @-@ built exhibition buildings , such as the Stirling Prize @-@ winning American Air Museum , designed by Sir Norman Foster . The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies , and hosts regular air shows . The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society , a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history . 
 = = = HMS Belfast = = = 
 HMS Belfast , a Town class cruiser , was launched in 1938 and served throughout the Second World War , participating in the December 1943 Battle of North Cape and firing some of the first shots of Operation Overlord , the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 . She saw further combat in the Korean War . Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963 , in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve Belfast as a museum ship . A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum , the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established , and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical . In 1971 the government decided against preservation , prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation . The Trust was successful in its efforts , and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971 . Brought to London , she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London . Opened to the public in October 1971 Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978 , being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science , Shirley Williams , as ' a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology ' . In service for 24 years HMS Belfast was in Frankland 's opinion , capable of representing ' a whole generation of [ historical evidence ] ' . 
 = = = Churchill War Rooms = = = 
 The Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War . Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster , the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan . Their historical value was recognised early on , and the public were able to visit by appointment . However , the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4 @,@ 500 of 30 – 40 @,@ 000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted . The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982 , a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , an admirer of Britain 's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984 . In 2003 a further suite of rooms , used as accommodation by Churchill , his wife and close associates , were added to the museum . The restoration of these rooms , which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage , cost £ 7 @.@ 5 million . In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms , with 850 m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill 's life . The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £ 6 million . The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material , particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre , via an ' electronic filing cabinet ' . The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010 . 
 = = = Imperial War Museum North = = = 
 The Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford , Greater Manchester in 2002 . It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England , and the first to be purpose @-@ built as a museum . Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind , Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain . Libeskind ’ s building , overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays , was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled . These shards , representing earth , air and water , give the building its shape . Originally budgeted at £ 40 million , the museum was eventually completed for £ 28 @.@ 5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming . The museum was funded by local , national and European development agencies , by private donations and by Peel Holdings , a local transport and property company which contributed £ 12 @.@ 5 million . 
 The museum 's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions . These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery 's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in ' silos ' within the space . The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation , the Big Picture . The main gallery , described as cavernous and dramatic , includes objects such as a Russian T @-@ 34 tank , a United States Marine Corps AV @-@ 8A Harrier jet , and a British 13 @-@ pounder field gun which fired the British Army 's first shot of the First World War . The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions , mounted in a separate gallery . 
 = = Collections = = 
 The Imperial War Museum 's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee . The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland 's reorganisation of the museum . The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records ( now the Sound Archive ) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War . The museum maintains an online database of its collections .

 = = Governance = = 
 The Imperial War Museum is an executive non @-@ departmental public body under the Department for Culture , Media and Sport , from which it receives financial support in the form of a grant @-@ in @-@ aid . The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees , originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 , later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation . The board comprises a president ( currently Prince Edward , Duke of Kent ) who is appointed by the sovereign , and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister , and the Foreign , Defence , and Culture Secretaries . Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed ex officio by their respective governments . As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant @-@ General Sir John <unk> . Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland @-@ Martin ( 1967 – 77 ) , Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy ( trustee 1971 – 78 , Chairman 1978 – 89 ) . During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford , and was chairman during the planning of Duxford 's American Air Museum , which opened in 1997 . 
 The museum 's Director @-@ General is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer . Since 1917 the museum has had six directors . The first was Sir Martin Conway , a noted art historian , mountaineer and explorer . He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas , and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904 . Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937 , when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley . Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917 . He later became acquainted with Charles <unk> , who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum 's poster collection . Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland . Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command , winning a Distinguished Flying Cross . While a Cabinet Office official historian he co @-@ authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany . Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts . In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford , who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968 . Upon Crawford 's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees , previously Director of the V & A Museum of Childhood . She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum . 
 = Michael Dokeianos = 
 Michael Dokeianos ( Greek : Μιχαήλ <unk> ) , erroneously called <unk> by some modern writers , was a Byzantine nobleman and military leader , who married into the Komnenos family . He was active in Sicily under George Maniakes before going to Southern Italy as Catepan of Italy in 1040 – 41 . He was recalled after being twice defeated in battle during the Lombard @-@ Norman revolt of 1041 , a decisive moment in the eventual Norman conquest of southern Italy . He is next recorded in 1050 , fighting against a Pecheneg raid in Thrace . He was captured during battle but managed to maim the Pecheneg leader , after which he was put to death and mutilated . 
 = = Biography = = 
 The family name of Dokeianos is considered to derive from Dok [ e ] ia in the Armeniac Theme . The family only came into prominence in the mid @-@ 11th century , with Michael one of the first to be mentioned . He is generally considered as the Dokeianos who married an unnamed daughter of Manuel Erotikos Komnenos and sister of the future emperor Isaac I Komnenos ( reigned 1057 – 59 ) , probably ca . 1030 . Together , they had a son , Theodore Dokeianos . According to John Skylitzes , Michael Dokeianos was a simple man and not suited for command , and according to Konstantinos Varzos he owed his rise to high office to his family ties with the Komnenoi . It is known that he was wealthy , and possessed estates in Paphlagonia , possibly adjacent or part of the Komnenos family estates in the same region . 
 = = = In Italy = = = 
 Michael Dokeianos is first mentioned in 1040 , as protospatharios and doux , when he was sent to southern Italy to assume command of the local Byzantine province as Catepan of Italy . Prior to that , he was apparently a member of George Maniakes ' expeditionary force sent to conquer Sicily in 1038 . Dokeianos arrived in the mainland in November 1040 , and the situation he found was critical : his predecessor Nikephoros Dokeianos , probably a relative , had been killed in January at Ascoli in a mutiny of his troops , which was followed by a revolt in Taranto and the capture of the capital , Bari , by <unk> , son of the Lombard leader <unk> . Dokeianos hanged or blinded the ringleaders of the various revolts , but he failed to address the underlying cause , the widespread resentment at the oppressive taxation imposed by the Empire as part of the preparations for the Sicilian expedition under Maniakes . Dokeianos also offered the rule of strategic fortress of Melfi to the Milanese mercenary Arduin , with the title of <unk> . Arduin had served under previous Byzantine commanders as part of a Norman contingent , but had been flogged in a dispute about the distribution of booty taken from the Muslims in Sicily ( William of Apulia claims this was done by Dokeianos , but it is possible that it was done by one of his predecessors , perhaps George Maniakes ) . Arduin 's grudge against the Byzantines now bore fruit . He sought the aid of the Normans who had been established at nearby Aversa since 1030 , and received a contingent of 300 men , upon a promise to share his gains equally with them . Thus in March 1041 he and his men seized Melfi . The inhabitants initially opposed him , but eventually were won over by Arduin . 
 The rebels quickly extended their control over the neighbouring towns of Venosa , Ascoli , and <unk> . Dokeianos , who had just reimposed order in Bari and the surrounding region , marched to meet them with a hastily assembled and incomplete force : most of the imperial army was still in Sicily , so that Skylitzes writes that Dokeianos only took the Opsician and part of the Thracesian contingents with him , while other sources also add that his army comprised elements of the Varangian Guard . The two armies met at the <unk> river , where Dokeianos was defeated in a battle fought on 17 March . The rebels then moved south towards the coast , and on 4 May defeated another Byzantine force under Dokeianos in another battle near Cannae , a field that had served as the site for the famous battle of 216 BC and the first Norman engagement in southern Italy in 1018 . The Annales <unk> claims , with obvious exaggeration , that 2 @,@ 000 Normans defeated 18 @,@ 000 Byzantines , but whatever the true numbers it does appear that the Byzantines considerably outnumbered the rebel forces . Dokeianos himself fell from his horse during the battle and was almost captured , until rescued by a squire . In the aftermath of the battle , both sides remained quiescent . The Lombards and Normans were probably exhausted and may have suffered heavy casualties , while the Byzantines regrouped : Dokeianos was recalled and replaced by <unk> Boioannes , while the garrisons in Sicily were withdrawn to the Italian mainland to face the rebel threat . 
 The withdrawal of the imperial forces from Sicily resulted in the rapid collapse of the imperial position there . Under Maniakes , the Byzantines had conquered the eastern portion of the island , but by 1042 , only Messina remained in Byzantine hands . On the mainland , Boioannes did not fare better than his predecessor , as he was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of <unk> in September . This succession of defeats signalled the beginning of the end for Byzantine rule in southern Italy , a process which was completed three decades later with the fall of Bari to the Normans under Robert Guiscard .

 Dokeianos re @-@ appears in 1050 , when he held the titles of patrikios and <unk> , as part of an imperial expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace . The imperial commander @-@ in @-@ chief , the eunuch <unk> Constantine , a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX ( r . 1042 – 55 ) , listened to his advice on fortifying the army 's encampment , but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople , he refused to heed the opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to wait and attack the Pechenegs on their return journey , and instead marched to meet them in the open field of <unk> <unk> , resulting in a devastating defeat : Arianites fell , while Dokeianos was taken prisoner . As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader , however , Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader , cutting off one of his arms , whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and , according to Michael <unk> , opened his belly , cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it . 
 = Sea of Japan naming dispute = 
 The international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan , North Korea , Russia , and South Korea is disputed . In 1992 , objections to the name Sea of Japan were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names . The Japanese government supports the use of the name " Sea of Japan " , while South Korea supports the name " East Sea " , and North Korea supports the name " East Sea of Korea " . Currently , most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan ( or equivalent translation ) by itself , or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea , often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name . The International Hydrographic Organization , the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world , in 2012 decided not to change the current single name " Sea of Japan " rejecting South Korea 's request to use " East Sea " together with " Sea of Japan " . 
 The involved countries ( especially Japan and South Korea ) have advanced a variety of arguments to support their preferred name ( s ) . Many of the arguments revolve around determining when the name Sea of Japan became the common name . South Korea argues that historically the more common name was East Sea , Sea of Korea , or another similar variant . South Korea further argues that the name Sea of Japan did not become common until Korea was under Japanese rule , at which time it had no ability to influence international affairs . Japan argues that the name Sea of Japan has been the most common international name since at least the beginning of the 19th century , long before its annexation of Korea . Both sides have conducted studies of antiquarian maps , but the two countries have produced divergent research results . Additional arguments have been raised regarding the underlying geography of the sea as well as potential problems regarding the ambiguity of one name or the other . 
 = = Arguments = = 
 Both sides in the dispute have put forward a number of arguments to support their claims . 
 = = = Arguments based on historical maps = = = 
 = = = = Arguments from South Korea = = = = 
 According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for South Korea , the name Donghae ( <unk> , literally East Sea ) has been used in Korea for over 2 @,@ 000 years , including in History of the Three Kingdoms ( <unk> , 1145 ) , the monument of King <unk> , and " Map of Eight Provinces of Korea " ( <unk> , 1530 ) . The first documented map to name the area the Sea of Japan was the world map drawn by the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci in China ( 1602 ) named <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) . No Japanese record published up to the late @-@ 18th century indicated any name for the body of water . Furthermore , South Korea has pointed out that a few 19th @-@ century Japanese maps referred to the sea as <unk> ( <unk> , literally Sea of Joseon ) , including the " Simplified Map of Japan 's Periphery " ( <unk> , 1809 ) and " New World Map " ( <unk> , 1844 ) . South Korea argues there was no standard name prior to Japan 's military expansion in the region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Additionally , it specifically states that the name Sea of Japan was not widely used , even in Japan , as late as the mid 19th century . Thus , South Korea argues that the current name reflects active promotion by Japan during a time when Korea could not represent its interests internationally . 
 = = = = Arguments from Japan = = = = 
 The Japanese government claims that the name Sea of Japan was internationally used since the 17th century and established by the early 19th century , during a period in which Japan was under an isolationist policy ( Sakoku ) of the Tokugawa shogunate , which restricted cultural exchange and commerce with foreign countries except China and the Netherlands until 1854 . Accordingly , they state , Japan could not have , at that time , had an influence on the international community regarding the naming of the sea . 
 The invention of the marine chronometer in the late 18th century enabled Western explorers , such as Jean @-@ François de Galaup from France , William Robert Broughton from Britain , and Adam Johann von Krusenstern ( Ivan Fyodorovich <unk> ) from Russia , to measure time and longitudes on the sea precisely and map the detailed shape of the Sea of Japan . Krusenstern was an admiral and explorer , who led the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe . According to Japanese records , it was Krusenstern who popularized the name " Mer du Japon " ( Sea of Japan ) in the West . In his work " Reise um die Welt in den Jahren " ( 1812 ) , he wrote , " People also call this sea area the Sea of Korea , but because only a small part of this sea touches the Korean coast , it is better to name it the Sea of Japan . " The original book was published in St. Petersburg in German and Russian , translated into Dutch , French , Swedish , Italian and English , and distributed widely among Europe . As a result , the international name of the sea changed from no name to the Sea of Japan , on the maps drawn by countries other than Japan or Korea during the 17th to 20th centuries . Thus , the Japanese side argues that the South Koreans misunderstand the history of the name . 
 = = = = Surveys of antiquarian maps = = = = 
 To provide evidence for the date when Sea of Japan came to be used internationally , both South Korea and Japan have undertaken surveys of various historical maps . 
 In 2004 , South Korea surveyed ancient maps archived in the British Library , the Cambridge University Library , the University of Southern California ( USC ) East Asian Map Collection , the U.S. Library of Congress , the National Library of Russia , and the French National Library examined 762 maps . They found that 440 maps had used Sea of Korea ( Corea ) , Oriental Sea / East Sea , 122 had used Sea of Japan , and 200 had used other terms . In the French language , the word orientale includes both the meaning of " eastern " related to compass direction and the meaning of " oriental " , the Asiatic region . The same ambiguity is present in the Russian language , with both " eastern " and " oriental " indicated by one word . 
 From 2003 to 2008 , Japan conducted a number of surveys of different collections . In 2010 , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MOFA ) published their conclusions ; they found that among 1 @,@ 332 maps from the Berlin Library , 279 used Sea of Korea , Oriental Sea , or East Sea ( or some combination thereof ) , 579 used Sea of Japan exclusively , 47 used China Sea ( with or without other names ) , 33 used another term , and 384 used no term . MOFA said the Struck collection ( a collection of antiquarian maps owned by a European map collector ) showed that out of 79 maps , 35 used Sea of Japan , 9 used the Sea of Korea , 2 used Oriental Sea , and 33 were unmarked . MOFA reported that among four Russian libraries and document archives holding 51 maps , 29 used Sea of Japan , 8 used Sea of Korea , 1 used Korea Strait , 1 used East Sea , 1 used Sea of China , and 11 used no name . MOFA said that 1 @,@ 213 maps from the U.S. Library of Congress , ones that gave a name for this body of water , showed that 87 percent used Sea of Japan , 8 percent used Sea of Korea , 5 percent used other terms , and none used Oriental Sea or East Sea . Similarly , MOFA said that 58 maps from the British Library and the University of Cambridge showed 86 percent used Sea of Japan , 14 percent used Sea of Korea , and none used Oriental Sea , East Sea , or other terms . MOFA said that they looked at 1 @,@ 485 maps in the French National Library . They reported that 95 percent of 215 French maps used Sea of Japan . 
 In November 2007 , the National Geographic Information Institute of South Korea published a report on a survey of 400 ancient maps . According to the report , nine maps used East Sea for the water currently called Sea of Japan , while 31 maps used East Sea for the water currently called East China Sea . The number of maps used Sea of Japan is not disclosed . Furthermore , the report says " In the late 18th century ( 1790 – 1830 ) the name Sea of Japan emerged . From the 19th century ( 1830 onward ) , there was a rapid increase in the use of the name Sea of Japan . " Japan stated , " This clearly shows the fallacy of the ROK 's assertion that the name Sea of Japan was the result of the Japanese policy of expansionism and colonial rule , and can be interpreted as affirming that the name Sea of Japan was in widespread use well before Japan 's colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula " . 
 = = = Geographical arguments = = = 
 Japan argues that , the name Sea of Japan has been and should be used because the marginal sea is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Japanese Archipelago . Korea argues that the adjective " East " describes its geographical position east of the Asian continent , although it is west of Japan and south of Russia . It states that this is analogous to the North Sea , which lies north of the European continent , but west of Scandinavian countries and east of Great Britain . However Koreans call the sea on their east side the East Sea ( <unk> , Donghae ) , on their south side the South Sea ( <unk> , <unk> ) , and on their west side the West Sea ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 = = = Arguments relating to ambiguity = = = 
 The Japanese Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japanese Coast Guard has claimed that the name East Sea is confusing and unsuitable as an international geographic name , because the local name for a variety of seas can be translated into English as East Sea . Examples include Dōng Hǎi ( <unk> ) , the Chinese name for the East China Sea ; <unk> Đông , the Vietnamese name for the South China Sea ; and the Baltic Sea , which means East Sea in several European languages such as German ( Ostsee ) , Swedish ( <unk> ) and Finnish ( <unk> ) . East Sea is officially used as an English name for the water by the Government of Vietnam . Thus the Government of Vietnam uses East Sea for South China Sea in its English publications . Also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China uses East Sea for East China Sea in its English publications . In addition , East Sea ( <unk> , Tōkai ) is not the Sea of Japan but the Pacific Ocean in the Japanese context . The regions on the east coast of Japan were named accordingly as the Tōkaidō region and the Tōkai region . The Japanese government is concerned that the name change could set a bad precedent and cause more naming disputes worldwide . 
 = = Position of international bodies = = 
 The main two international organizations which have been involved in the naming dispute are the International Hydrographic Organization and the United Nations . 
 = = = International Hydrographic Organization = = = 
 The International Hydrographic Organization is an organization that coordinates with member countries over hydrographic issues . One of the organization 's functions is to help set international standards on the naming and delineation of nautical regions . In 1929 , the organization ( then called the International Hydrographic Bureau ) published " IHO Special Publication 23 " ( IHO SP 23 ) , which established the name of the sea as Sea of Japan ; however , at that time , Korea could not participate in the IHO because it was under Japanese rule . South Korea officially joined the IHO in 1957 . 
 In 1974 , IHO released Technical Resolution <unk> This resolution stated that : 
 It is recommended that where two or more countries share a given geographical feature ( such as a bay , a strait , channel or archipelago ) under different names , they should endeavor to reach agreement on a single name for the feature concerned . If they have different official languages and cannot agree on a common name form , it is recommended that the name forms of each of the languages in question should be accepted for charts and publications unless technical reasons prevent this practice on small scale charts . 
 South Korea has argued that this resolution is relevant to the debate about the Sea of Japan and implies that both names should be used ; Japan , however , argues that the resolution does not apply to the Sea of Japan , because it does not specify this body of water and only applies to geographical features for which sovereignty is shared between two or more countries . 
 The IHO agreed to conduct a survey of available evidence in 2011 . Previously , South Korea had been pushing the IHO to recommend only using the term East Sea , but announced on 2 May 2011 , that it now preferred the gradual approach of using both names now , and eventually dropping the Sea of Japan name . 
 On 26 April 2012 , the IHO announced that it had decided to use only " Sea of Japan " in its governing publication Limits of Oceans and Seas and rejected the alternative use of " East Sea " as proposed by South Korea . According to the South Korean government , the organization will again discuss the issue of the name when it reconvenes in 2017 . 
 = = = United Nations = = = 
 While the United Nations has never directly addressed the issue of establishing an official , standardized name for the sea , several resolutions and statements by the UN have had relevance to the topic . Japan joined the United Nations in 1956 , while South and North Korea both joined in 1991 . 
 In 1977 , the third U.N. Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names ( UNCSGN ) adopted Resolution III / 20 , entitled " Names of Features beyond a Single Sovereignty " . The resolution recommended that " when countries sharing a given geographical feature do not agree on a common name , it should be a general rule of cartography that the name used by each of the countries concerned will be accepted . A policy of accepting only one or some of such names while excluding the rest would be inconsistent as well as inexpedient in practice . " As with IHO Technical Resolution <unk> , South Korea and Japan disagree about whether or not this policy applies to the Sea of Japan . 
 In 1992 , during the 1992 Sixth UNCSGN , the South Korean government , in their first time participating in UNCSGN , requested that the name of the sea be determined through consultation , which the North Korean representative concurred with . The Japanese representative stated that the name of the Sea of Japan had already been accepted worldwide and that any change would introduce confusion . The conference recommended that the parties work together on the issue outside of the conference . 
 In 1998 , South Korea raised the issue again at the Seventh UNCSGN . Japan , however , opposed the method by which the South Korean government proposed the issue , arguing that they had not followed the proper procedure for doing so . Following some debate , South Korea withdrew the issue , and instead recommended that the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names work so that a resolution could be submitted to the Eighth <unk> conference . The president of the conference urged that Japan , South Korea , and North Korea work towards a mutually acceptable agreement . 
 At the Eighth UNCSGN in 2002 , South Korea and Japan presented a number of papers to the conference regarding their positions on the naming issue . South Korea asked for a resolution to adjudicate the name , while Japan asked that the name be decided through resolution outside of the conference . No resolution was passed , and the Committee again urged the countries to develop a mutually agreeable solution . The chairman further noted that standardization could only occur after consensus had been reached . The same situation occurred at the Ninth conference in 2007 . South Korea and North Korea both proposed a resolution by the UNCSGN , while Japan expressed a desire to settle the matter outside of the conference , and the Committee urged the members to seek a mutual agreement . 
 On 23 April 2004 , the United Nations affirmed in a written document to the Japanese government that it will continue using the name Sea of Japan in its official documents . However , it agreed to leave the topic open for further discussion . In a letter to South Korea , it was explained that the UN was not determining the validity of either name , but wished to use the term most widely used until the parties resolved the disagreement . The letter further stated , " The use of an appellation by the Secretariat based on the practice is without prejudice to any negotiations or agreements between the interested parties and should not be interpreted as advocating or endorsing any party 's position , and can in no way be invoked by any party in support of a particular position in the matter . " 
 On 6 August 2012 , representatives from North and South Korea addressed an assembly at the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names , asking that the names " East Sea " and " Sea of Japan " be used concurrently for the sea . <unk> <unk> , chairman of the conference , responded that the organization had no authority to decide the issue and requested that the involved countries resolve the differences over the name amongst themselves . 
 = = Other countries = = 
 Russia calls this sea " <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> , Japanese Sea ) . Japan believes that Russia played a major role in establishing this name internationally , as mentioned above . Chinese government websites exclusively use the name <unk> ( <unk> , Japan Sea ) . In 2003 , the French Defense Ministry issued nautical maps that included both terms Sea of Japan and East Sea . It reverted to Sea of Japan as a single name in the map issued in 2004 . The United Kingdom and Germany officially use the Sea of Japan . 
 The United States Board on Geographic Names ( BGN ) continues to advocate the use of Sea of Japan without qualification in U.S. government publications . The World Factbook published by the Central Intelligence Agency follows the BGN 's guidance . On 8 August 2011 , a spokesman for the United States Department of State stated that the United States Board on Geographic Names considered the official name of the sea to be " Sea of Japan . " According to Yonhap , the U.S. has officially recommended to the IHO that " Sea of Japan " remain as the official name for the sea . In response to this failure of the South Korean campaign , South Korean foreign minister Kim Sung @-@ hwan suggested advocating other historical names , such as " Sea of Korea " . 
 In 2011 , Virginia state lawmaker David W. Marsden , acting on behalf of Korean @-@ American voters , introduced a bill to the education panel of the Senate of Virginia that would have required public school textbooks to include both " Sea of Japan " and " East Sea " as names . The panel rejected the bill by an 8 – 7 vote on 26 January 2012 . The issue was revisited two years later on 3 February 2014 , with the Education Committee of the Virginia House of Delegates passing legislation to use both " Sea of Japan " and " East Sea " in school textbooks . 
 On 29 June 2012 , Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt M. Campbell affirmed the BGN 's position in his response , published on the White House website , to a We the People petition concerning the usage of " Sea of Japan " , in which he stated , " It is longstanding United States policy to refer to each sea or ocean by a single name . This policy applies to all seas , including those bordered by multiple countries that may each have their own names for such bodies of water . Concerning the body of water between the Japanese archipelago and the Korean peninsula , longstanding U.S. policy is to refer to it as the " Sea of Japan " . He also stated , " We are aware the Republic of Korea refers to the body of water as the ' East Sea , ' and the United States is not asking the Republic of Korea to change its nomenclature . U.S. usage of the ' Sea of Japan ' in no way implies an opinion regarding any issue related to sovereignty . "
