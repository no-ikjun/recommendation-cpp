 The decisive reason for the advance of the bureaucratic organisation has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organisation . 
 While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state , Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a " polar night of icy darkness " , in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned " iron cage " of bureaucratic , rule @-@ based , rational control . In order to counteract bureaucrats , the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians . 
 = = = = Social stratification = = = = 
 Weber also formulated a three @-@ component theory of stratification , with social class , social status and political party as conceptually distinct elements . The three @-@ component theory of stratification is in contrast to Karl Marx simpler theory of social class which ties all social stratification to what people own . In Weber 's theory , issues of honor and prestige are important . This distinction is most clearly described in Weber 's essay " Classes , <unk> , Parties " which was first published in his book Economy and Society . The three components of Weber 's theory are : 
 Social Class which is based on economically determined relationship to the market ( owner , renter , employee etc . ) . 
 Status ( or in German Stand ) which is based on non @-@ economic qualities like honour , prestige and religion . 
 Party which refers to affiliations in the political domain . 
 All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called " life chances " ( opportunities to improve one 's life ) . 
 Weber scholars recognize that it is important to maintain a sharp distinction between the terms " status " and " class , " even though they tend to be used interchangeably in popular usage . 
 = = = Study of the city = = = 
 As part of his overarching effort to understand the unique development of the Western world , Weber produced a detailed general study of the city as the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations , political arrangements , and ideas that eventually came to define the West . This resulted in a monograph titled The City , which was probably compiled from research conducted in 1911 – 1913 , and which was published posthumously in 1921 . In 1924 it was incorporated into the second part of his Economy and Society , as chapter XVI , " The City ( Non @-@ legitimate Domination ) " . 
 According to Weber , the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity , employed in a variety of specialised trades , and physically separated from the surrounding countryside , only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution : 
 The origin of a rational and inner @-@ worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets [ ... ] who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures . This context consisted of the political problems engendered by the bourgeois status @-@ group of the city , without which neither Judaism , nor Christianity , nor the development of Hellenistic thinking are conceivable . 
 Weber argued that Judaism , early Christianity , theology , and later the political party and modern science , were only possible in the urban context that reached a full development in the West alone . He also saw in the history of medieval European cities the rise of a unique form of " non @-@ legitimate domination " that successfully challenged the existing forms of legitimate domination ( traditional , charismatic , and rational @-@ legal ) that had prevailed until then in the Medieval world . This new domination was based on the great economic and military power wielded by the organised community of city @-@ dwellers ( " citizens " ) . 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 Weber regarded himself primarily as a " political economist " , and all of his professorial appointments were in economics , though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern sociology . As an economist , Weber belonged to the " youngest " German historical school of economics . The great differences between that school 's interests and methods on the one hand and those of the neoclassical school ( from which modern mainstream economics largely derives ) on the other , explain why Weber 's influence on economics today is hard to discern . 
 Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism . In earlier texts , Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism and its effects on the current means of productions . This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons . The first and most important , he relates capitalism to Protestantism . This is of course nothing new , since Max Weber did it in the past . However , Korstanje adds , though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism , the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind . In effect , the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone . It was rather <unk> in the core of Norse Culture . Secondly , this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk @-@ prone culture , which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “ Risk Society ” . The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “ economy of salved peoples ” formulated by Weber . 
 = = = = <unk> individualism = = = = 
 Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists , with a strong emphasis on interpreting economic history , Weber 's defence of " methodological individualism " in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by Carl Menger , the founder of the Austrian School of economics , in the context of the academic Methodenstreit ( " debate over methods " ) of the late 19th century . The phrase " methodological individualism " , which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between microeconomics and macroeconomics , was coined by the Austrian @-@ American economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber . According to Weber 's theses , social research cannot be fully inductive or descriptive , because understanding some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and interpret it ; interpretation requires classification according to abstract " ideal ( pure ) types " . This , together with his <unk> argumentation ( see Verstehen ) , can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the " rational economic man " ( homo economicus ) , which is at the heart of modern mainstream economics . 
 = = = = <unk> and psychophysics = = = = 
 Unlike other historicists , Weber also accepted the marginal theory of value ( also called " <unk> " ) and taught it to his students . In 1908 , Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the Weber @-@ Fechner law . Max Weber 's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of psychophysics by Lionel Robbins , George Stigler , and Friedrich Hayek , though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of " behavioral economics " . 
 = = = = Economic history = = = = 
 Weber 's best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development , particularly the relations between religion and capitalism , which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism as well as in his other works on the sociology of religion . He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism ( including rational book @-@ keeping and organisation of formally free labour ) , while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism , which had a different social and political structure based on conquest , slavery , and the coastal city @-@ state . Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society ( 1891 ) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany ( 1892 ) , his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages ( 1889 ) , his critique of Marxism , the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society ( 1922 ) and his General Economic History ( 1923 ) , a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School . 
 Although today Weber is primarily read by sociologists and social philosophers , Weber 's work did have a significant influence on Frank Knight , one of the founders of the neoclassical Chicago school of economics , who translated Weber 's General Economic History into English in 1927 . Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism " from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions , that is , the angle of comparative history in the broad sense " . 
 = = = = Economic calculation = = = = 
 Weber , like his colleague Werner Sombart , regarded economic calculation and especially the double @-@ entry bookkeeping method of business accounting , as one of the most important forms of rationalisation associated with the development of modern capitalism . Weber 's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs . Socialist intellectuals like Otto Neurath had realised that in a completely socialised economy , prices would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in @-@ kind ( rather than monetary ) economic calculation . According to Weber , this type of coordination would be inefficient , especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of imputation ( i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of capital goods ) . Weber wrote that , under full socialism , 
 In order to make possible a rational utilisation of the means of production , a system of in @-@ kind accounting would have to determine " value " – indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the " prices " used in book valuation in modern business accounting . But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular , verified ; whether , for instance , they should vary from one production unit to the next ( on the basis of economic location ) , or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy , on the basis of " social utility " , that is , of ( present and future ) consumption requirements [ ... ] Nothing is gained by assuming that , if only the problem of a non @-@ monetary economy were seriously enough attacked , a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented . The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation . We cannot speak of a rational " planned economy " so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational " plan " . 
 This argument against socialism was made independently , at about the same time , by Ludwig von Mises . Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises , whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918 , and , through Mises , on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century . Friedrich Hayek in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics 's intellectual assault on socialism , as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of " dispersed knowledge " in markets . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The prestige of Max Weber among European social scientists would be difficult to over @-@ estimate . He is widely considered the greatest of German sociologists and ... has become a leading influence in European and American thought . 
 Weber 's most influential work was on economic sociology , political sociology , and the sociology of religion . Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim , he is commonly regarded as one of the founders of modern sociology . But whereas Durkheim , following Comte , worked in the positivist tradition , Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist , hermeneutic , tradition in the social sciences . In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart , Georg Simmel , and Wilhelm Dilthey , who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences . 
 Weber presented sociology as the science of human social action ; action that he separated into traditional , <unk> , value @-@ rational and instrumental . 
 [ Sociology is ] the science whose object is to interpret the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which the action proceeds and the effects which it produces . By " action " in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as subjectively meaningful [ ... ] the meaning to which we refer may be either ( a ) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases , or ( b ) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents , as types , in a pure type constructed in the abstract . In neither case is the " meaning " to be thought of as somehow objectively " correct " or " true " by some metaphysical criterion . This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action , such as sociology and history and any kind of a priori discipline , such as jurisprudence , logic , ethics , or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject @-@ matter " correct " or " valid " meaning . 
 In his own time , however , Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist . The breadth of Weber 's topical interests is apparent in the depth of his social theory : 
 The affinity between capitalism and Protestantism , the religious origins of the Western world , the force of charisma in religion as well as in politics , the all @-@ embracing process of rationalisation and the bureaucratic price of progress , the role of legitimacy and of violence as the offspring of leadership , the " disenchantment " of the modern world together with the never @-@ ending power of religion , the antagonistic relation between intellectualism and eroticism : all these are key concepts which attest to the enduring fascination of Weber 's thinking . 
 Many of Weber 's works famous today were collected , revised and published posthumously . Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills . Parsons in particular imparted to Weber 's works a functionalist , teleological perspective ; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism . 
 Weber has influenced many later social theorists , such as Theodor Adorno , Max Horkheimer , György Lukács and Jürgen Habermas . Different elements of his thought were emphasised by Carl Schmitt , Joseph Schumpeter , Ludwig Lachmann , Leo Strauss , Hans Morgenthau , and Raymond Aron . According to Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises , who had met Weber during his time at the University of Vienna , 
 The early death of this genius was a great disaster for Germany . Had Weber lived longer , the German people of today would be able to look to this example of an " Aryan " who would not be broken by National Socialism . 
 Weber 's friend , the psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher Karl Jaspers , described him as " the greatest German of our era " . Weber 's untimely death felt to Jaspers " as if the German world had lost its heart " . 
 = = Critical responses to Weber = = 
 Weber 's explanations are highly specific to the historical periods he analysed . Others though disagree , pointing out that despite the fact that Weber did write in the early twentieth century , his ideas remain alive and relevant for understanding issues like politics , bureaucracy , and social stratification today . 
 Many scholars , however , have disagreed with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis . For example , the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism did not begin with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy . In Milan , Venice and Florence the small city @-@ state governments led to the development of the earliest forms of capitalism . In the 16th century Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe . Also , the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands , England and New England . It has been pointed out that the Netherlands , which had a Calvinist majority , industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium , which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland . Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter 's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value . 
 = Russian monitor Edinorog = 
 Edinorog ( Russian : <unk> ) was an Uragan @-@ class monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . The design was based on the American Passaic @-@ class monitor , but was modified to suit Russian engines , guns and construction techniques . Spending her entire career with the Baltic Fleet , the ship was only active when the Gulf of Finland was not frozen , but very little is known about her service . She was struck from the Navy List in 1900 , converted into a storage hulk for mines in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 4 . The ship survived World War II and was stricken in 1957 , although her ultimate fate is unknown . 
 = = Description = = 
 Edinorog was 201 feet ( 61 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , with a beam of 46 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 10 @.@ 16 – 10 @.@ 84 feet ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 t ) , and her crew numbered eight officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865 . They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877 . 
 The ship was fitted with a two @-@ cylinder , horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine built by the Baird Works of Saint Petersburg . It drove a single propeller using steam that was provided by two rectangular boilers . Specific information on the output of the ship 's engine has not survived , but it ranged between 340 – 500 indicated horsepower ( 254 – 373 kW ) for all the ships of this class . During Edinorog 's sea trials on 19 June 1865 , she reached a maximum speed of 5 @.@ 75 knots ( 10 @.@ 65 km / h ; 6 @.@ 62 mph ) , the second slowest ship in the class . The ship carried a maximum of 190 long tons ( 190 t ) of coal , which gave her a theoretical endurance of 1 @,@ 440 nmi ( 2 @,@ 670 km ; 1 @,@ 660 mi ) at 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 Edinorog was designed to be armed with a pair of 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading guns purchased from Krupp of Germany and rifled in Russia , but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine @-@ inch smoothbores . These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license @-@ built 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading Rodman guns in 1867 – 68 . The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine @-@ inch rifled guns . 
 All of the wrought @-@ iron armor that was used in the Uragan @-@ class monitors was in 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates , just as in the Passaic @-@ class ships . The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates , of which the three innermost plates extended 42 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) below the waterline . This armor was backed by a wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of 36 inches ( 914 mm ) . The gun turret was protected by eleven layers of armor and the pilothouse above it had eight layers of armor . Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the funnel up to a height of 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) above the deck . Unlike their predecessors , the Uragans were built without deck armor to save weight , but Edinorog was modified for the addition of 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) armor plates after completion , but it is unknown if they were ever fitted . They were , however , manufactured and then placed in storage . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Construction of the ship began on 13 June 1863 by S. G. Kudriavtsev at the state @-@ owned <unk> Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Edinorog was laid down on 1 December 1863 and she was launched on 2 June 1864 . She entered service on 27 July 1865 and cost a total of 1 @,@ 141 @,@ 800 rubles , almost double her contract cost of 600 @,@ 000 rubles . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she , and all of her sister ships except Latnik , made a port visit to Stockholm , Sweden in July – August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich . 
 Sometime after Edinorog was completed , an armored ring , 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and 15 inches ( 381 mm ) tall , was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it . Later , an armored , outward @-@ curving bulwark was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there . Three sponsons were later added , probably during the 1870s , to the upper portion of the turret . Each sponson , one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret , mounted a light gun , probably a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) Engstrem gun , for defense against torpedo boats . A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret , also probably during the 1870s . 
 Little is known about the ship 's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze . Edinorog was reclassified as a coast @-@ defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900 , although she was not stricken until 17 August . The ship was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed Blokshiv No. 4 on 10 July of that year . She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors ( Helsinki ) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk , but she was later returned by the Finns . The ship was redesignated as Blokshiv No. 2 on 1 January 1932 and survived World War II to be renamed BSh @-@ 2 on 16 May 1949 . She was stricken on 27 June 1957 and turned over to the Kronstadt Yacht Club . Her ultimate fate is unknown .

 Tyler Ulis ( born January 5 , 1996 ) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats . At Kentucky in 2015 , he led his team in assists , he made the 2015 SEC All @-@ Freshman Team and led the 2014 – 15 Kentucky team that won its first 38 games before losing to Wisconsin in the final four of the 2015 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . As a sophomore , Ulis was a Consensus first team All @-@ American and earned the Southeastern Conference Men 's Basketball Player of the Year and the Southeastern Conference Men 's Basketball Defensive Player of the Year recognition . 
 He played for Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights , Illinois . He was selected to play in both the 2014 McDonald 's All @-@ American Game and the 2014 Jordan Brand Classic . As a high school junior , he was a first team All @-@ state selection , but he was overlooked by most top scouts until after his junior year of high school due to his height .

Another of his cousins is <unk> Ulis , point guard for Cincinnati Lady Bearcats , who had been a two @-@ time Toledo Blade Player of the Year . 
 = = High school career = = 
 For high school , Ulis moved to Matteson , Illinois , where he lived with his father , James . In Ohio , he had been used to winning a high percentage of his games . When he arrived at Marian Catholic , he started his first game as a freshman against future Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball starting guard Tracy Abrams . He did not initially enjoy team success . As a freshman he was 5 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 60 m ) tall and was being recruited by opposing high schools . He reached 5 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 73 m ) by late in his sophomore year and began being recruited by college basketball teams . By the beginning of his junior season , Marian Catholic was regarded as a serious contender thanks to Ulis . 
 Because of his height , Ulis was overlooked until well into the recruiting process for top basketball schools . He was not highly recruited until his 2013 – 14 senior year of high school . Among schools regarded as high @-@ major programs , only Iowa and DePaul made him offers during his junior year . His other offers were from Dayton , Colorado State , Loyola , Northern Illinois and Oregon State . During his junior season , his stock soared and Marian Catholic started winning . In the March 2013 Illinois High School Association Class 4A sectional round , Marian Catholic vied against Bloom High School and then played Edwardsville High School in the supersectional round . Although Marian lost to a much taller Edwardsville team , it established a school record for wins with a 29 – 4 record and it won its IHSA sectional for the first time . Ulis finished fourth in the Illinois Mr. Basketball balloting behind Jabari Parker , Jahlil Okafor and Malcolm Hill . He was a first team All @-@ state selection by the Chicago Tribune along with Parker , Okafor , Cliff Alexander and Jalen Brunson . 
 By August 8 , 2013 , when he was ranked as the 38th best prospect in the national class of 2014 and its 8th best point guard by ESPN , he had several offers and named Iowa , Kentucky ( although he did not have an offer from them at the time ) , Michigan State and USC as his finalists ( eliminating DePaul , Florida State , Northwestern and Purdue ) . Walton had played for Michigan State . He received an official offer from Kentucky on August 16 . In early September , Ulis announced that he would not take an official visit to USC and had eliminated them from consideration . On September 13 , Ulis committed to Kentucky . Subsequently , Tyus Jones canceled his September 27 – 29 official visit to Kentucky . 
 Ulis entered his senior season as one of the five favorites to win Illinois Mr. Basketball ( along with Okafor , Alexander , Brunson and Keita Bates @-@ Diop ) . On December 7 , 2013 at the UIC Pavilion in the Chicago Elite Classic , Ulis and Marion suffered one of their only two regular season losses to USC @-@ bound guard Jordan McLaughlin and <unk> High School , which was ranked number 6 nationally by USA Today . Ulis had 30 points , 7 assists and 5 rebounds . The January 25 , 2014 , matchup against junior Brunson and Stevenson High School was widely anticipated in the local press as the matchup of the two best point guards in the state . Stevenson won as Brunson had 32 points on 9 @-@ for @-@ 15 field goal shooting and an 11 @-@ for @-@ 14 free throw performance . Ulis had 23 points and 9 assists , including 18 points and 3 assists in the final eight minutes , but was only 5 @-@ for @-@ 20 from the field for the game . Ulis posted a career @-@ high 42 points on February 22 against Lake Forest High School to go along with 6 steals , 6 rebounds and 5 assists . 
 During his senior year , Marian was the number 1 seed in the Thornton sectional of the IHSA Class 4A tournament . On March 11 , Ulis had 40 points to lead Marian past Bloom High School 66 – 45 . In the game , which was a rematch from the prior year , he made his first six shots , all three @-@ pointers . On March 18 , Marian lost its supersectional rematch against Edwardsville in overtime , again falling one game short of reaching the final four in Peoria , Illinois and finishing with a 28 – 3 record . In the game , Ulis , who had 23 points and 4 assists , tied the score with 21 seconds in regulation and with 50 seconds left in overtime . In the April 18 Jordan Brand Classic , Ulis posted 9 points and 9 assists .

 The decision by Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison on whether to enter the 2014 NBA draft would be the determining factor on whether Ulis became an immediate starter or not . Many thought Andrew would be Calipari 's seventh consecutive point guard to declare for the NBA Draft after his freshman season , but that Ulis would likely last much longer at Kentucky . On April 25 , the Harrisons announced that they would be returning to Kentucky .

 = = Plot = = 
 Bob receives a package containing his childhood toys , which consist of nothing more than a scouring pad , a rusted spatula , and a dog @-@ shaped soap bar . The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father 's restaurant , and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood . Worried that he is doing the same to his own children , he fires Tina , Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation . In their place , he hires newly released bank robber Mickey , whom the family had previously befriended , to do various jobs around the restaurant , in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement . 
 Meanwhile , the children find outdoor summer activities unsatisfying and soon grow bored . They later wander into a blueberry farm and meet its elderly owners , the hippie couple Beverly and Cooper , who offer to hire Gene and Louise to " pick weeds " and Tina as a blueberry delivery girl . With the promise of a daily $ 10 salary , the children accept and soon become unsuspecting accomplices in a marijuana delivery business . One night Bob discovers Mickey making a hole in the basement , and Mickey reveals his plan to dig his way into the same bank he previously robbed , believing that the double jeopardy defense will clear him of any crime . Bob explains to Mickey that he can , in fact , be jailed again , and promptly fires him . 
 Bob attempts to rehire his children the next day , explaining that he now realizes that he is a better parent than his distant , alcoholic father , only to discover that they have found other work . A customer of the farm delivery service later walks into the restaurant looking for Tina , leaving behind a box of blueberries . Bob and his wife Linda ( John Roberts ) discover marijuana hidden in the box and set off to find the children , with Mickey leading them to the farm 's location . As they arrive and take back the children , a SWAT team – led by the aforementioned customer , who is actually an undercover DEA agent – shows up and arrests the hippies . The scene cuts to Wagstaff School , where Louise has narrated the episode 's events to her class for her report on how she spent her summer vacation .

 = Temple Sinai ( Oakland , California ) = 
 Temple Sinai ( officially the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland ) is a Reform synagogue located at 2808 Summit Street ( 28th and Webster Streets ) in Oakland , California , United States . Founded in 1875 , it is the oldest Jewish congregation in the East San Francisco Bay region . 
 Its early members included Gertrude Stein and Judah Leon Magnes , who studied at Temple Sinai 's Sabbath school , and Ray Frank , who taught them . Originally traditional , the temple reformed its beliefs and practices under the leadership of Rabbi Marcus Friedlander ( 1893 – 1915 ) . By 1914 , it had become a Classical Reform congregation . That year the current sanctuary was built : a Beaux @-@ Arts structure designed by G. Albert Lansburgh , which is the oldest synagogue building in Oakland . 
 The congregation weathered four major financial crises by 1934 . From then until 2011 , it was led by just three rabbis , William Stern ( 1934 – 1965 ) , Samuel Broude ( 1966 – 1989 ) , and Steven Chester ( 1989 – 2011 ) . 
 In 2006 Temple Sinai embarked on a $ 15 million capital campaign to construct an entirely new synagogue campus adjacent to its current sanctuary . Groundbreaking took place in October 2007 , and by late 2009 the congregation had raised almost $ 12 million towards the construction . As of 2015 , Temple Sinai had nearly 1 @,@ 000 member families . The rabbis were Jacqueline Mates @-@ Muchin and Yoni Regev , and the cantor was Ilene Keys . The synagogue has two emeritus rabbis , Samuel Broude and Steven Chester . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland , Temple Sinai is the oldest synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area . It grew out of Oakland 's Hebrew Benevolent Society , which had been organized in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries — predominantly Polish Jews from Posen . Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue , Oakland 's was unusual in continuing to function independently for a number of years ( the two groups did not merge until 1881 ) . 
 By 1876 , the congregation had purchased land on the south side of 14th and Webster streets ; however , due to a severe recession in California at the time , the congregation did not construct a building until 1878 . The wooden structure , with Moorish Revival elements and onion domes , was completed at a cost of around $ 8 @,@ 000 ( today $ 196 @,@ 000 ) . 
 Services were initially traditional , following the Polish rite . Men and women sat separately , but the <unk> separating them was soon done away with . In 1881 the new president , David Hirschberg , led a campaign to modernize , and convinced a small majority to introduce a number of reforms , including the addition of a mixed choir of Christians and Jews and organ music , and the removal of the requirement for a minyan . Traditionalists — who mostly came from the Hebrew Benevolent Society — objected and withdrew , forming their own Orthodox minyan , which eventually became Oakland 's Congregation Beth Jacob . 
 = = Levy , Sessler eras : 1881 – 1892 = = 
 In 1881 , the congregation hired Oakland 's first rabbi , Meyer Solomon Levy . Born in England in January 1852 and raised there , he was the son of Rabbi Solomon Levy of Borough Synagogue in London . Meyer Solomon Levy had been ordained in England as an Orthodox rabbi before he was twenty , and moved to Australia as a young man . An early supporter of Zionism , he had served as a rabbi in Melbourne before moving to California in 1872 or 1873 , where he served as the rabbi of Temple Emanu @-@ El ( then <unk> <unk> ) in San Jose . Levy was paid $ 100 a month ( today $ 2 @,@ 450 ) , and donated a percentage to the poor . 
 Levy came into conflict with Oakland 's public schools , which refused to excuse Jewish students on High Holy Days . He petitioned that they be excused , but the superintendent and district went even further , and directed teachers not to schedule examinations for those days . Although sensitive to the needs of the members , Levy was more observant than his congregants , which also led to conflict . He accepted the reforms of shortening the Shabbat services , and facing the congregation ( rather than the ark ) during prayer , but he successfully resisted attempts to adopt Isaac Mayer Wise 's 1885 " Minhag America " Prayer @-@ Book . 
 Although traditional in some ways , Levy was progressive in others . " Deeply affected by the enlightened spirit of his day " , according to historian Fred Rosenbaum , he " delivered lectures with titles such as ' Progress of Science ' and , while at the First Hebrew Congregation , he invited Oakland 's Unitarian minister to give a series of talks at the synagogue . Levy in turn was well received at the Unitarian Church , where he spoke on the theory of evolution . " 
 In 1885 , the synagogue burned down , although the Torah scrolls were saved by a congregant who entered the burning building to retrieve them . Levy made prodigious efforts to raise funds for a new building , traveling as far away as Vancouver . The synagogue 's female members also raised significant funds through a " Grand Fair " . Their combined efforts were successful , and by 1886 a new building had been erected at 13th and Clay streets . The structure had " Moorish elements inspired by Isaac Mayer Wise 's Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati " . 
 The tensions between liberal @-@ minded members and the traditional Levy were never resolved , and in 1891 , the rabbi moved to San Francisco 's Congregation Beth Israel . That year the women of the congregation formed the Ladies Auxiliary ( Temple Sisterhood ) , whose initial mandate was to assist the work of the synagogue 's Sunday school , and increase its enrollment . 
 During Levy 's tenure , the synagogue had several congregants who were famous , or would become so . Ray Frank , the first Jewish woman to preach formally from a pulpit in the United States , settled in Oakland around 1885 , and taught Hebrew Bible studies and Jewish history at First Hebrew Congregation 's Sabbath school , where she was superintendent . Her students there in the 1880s included Gertrude Stein , later to become a famous writer , and Judah Leon Magnes , who would become a prominent Reform rabbi . Magnes 's views of the Jewish people were strongly influenced by First Hebrew 's Rabbi Levy , and it was at the building on 13th and Clay that Magnes first began preaching — his bar mitzvah speech of 1890 was quoted at length in The Oakland Tribune . 
 Morris Sessler succeeded Levy as rabbi in 1892 . He had served at Congregation of the Sons of Israel and David in Providence , Rhode Island , from 1887 to 1892 . His tenure lasted only six months , as " his ideas did not harmonize with those of the congregation " . He became rabbi of Congregation Gates of Prayer in New Orleans that same year , where he served until 1904 . 
 = = Friedlander , Franklin eras : 1893 – 1919 = = 
 The congregation hired Marcus Friedlander of Congregation Baith Israel in Brooklyn , New York in 1893 . Soon after he was hired , California experienced another economic downturn , which hurt the finances of members of the congregation . The congregation sold its property at 13th and Clay ( which had become the heart of the business district ) in 1895 , and moved to a less expensive location at the northwest corner of 12th and Castro streets , and renovated the building there in 1896 . Over 500 people , both Jews and non @-@ Jews , were sheltered in the building for days after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . The synagogue had 95 members by 1907 , with annual revenues of $ 6 @,@ 000 ( today $ 152 @,@ 000 ) . 
 Friedlander and former congregation president Abraham Jonas persuaded the congregation to introduce a number of significant reforms in the service : they first adopted the Jastrow prayer book , and later the Reform movement 's Union Prayer Book ( though in a revised , less radical version published specifically for First Hebrew , and authorized by the Central Conference of American Rabbis ) . By 1908 , the congregation had eliminated the second day of Rosh Hashanah , and few men wore head coverings in the service , and by 1914 the congregation had moved completely to the radicalism of " Classical Reform " . 
 In 1910 , First Hebrew bought a lot on Telegraph Avenue at Sycamore Street , near 26th Street , for $ 28 @,@ 000 ( today $ 710 @,@ 000 ) , and sold its property at 12th and Castro for the same amount . The congregation , however , decided not to build there . In 1912 it found a better location , and purchased its current site at 28th and Webster for $ 12 @,@ 050 ( today $ 310 @,@ 000 ) . Groundbreaking took place on October 26 , 1913 , and the building was completed there in 1914 at a cost of $ 100 @,@ 000 ( today $ 2 @.@ 4 million ) . Fourteen thousand dollars ( today $ 340 @,@ 000 ) of the costs were raised by the Ladies Auxiliary , which also purchased a new Austin pipe organ for the sanctuary at a cost of $ 5 @,@ 000 ( today $ 120 @,@ 000 ) . The new building was called " Temple Sinai " , and thereafter the congregation itself became known as " Temple Sinai " , although it retained the official name of " First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland " . 
 Designed by noted American architect G. Albert Lansburgh , the Beaux @-@ Arts structure had six tall stained glass windows , an " elliptical dome " , and an entrance characterized by " graceful Corinthian columns supporting a Greco @-@ Roman portico " . Carved into the entablature above the entrance was the Biblical verse " MY HOUSE SHALL BE <unk> A HOUSE OF <unk> FOR ALL PEOPLE " ( Isaiah 56 : 7 ) . More modest in size than most Beaux @-@ Arts buildings , it nevertheless had features typical of that style , including its " cross @-@ axial composition " . However , it was adorned with " simpler materials such as pressed brick and carved wood " , rather than the usual " florid Classical design elements " . Along with the sanctuary , the building included a social hall and classrooms . It is the only example of Lansburgh 's work in Oakland , and one of about 150 Oakland buildings given an " A " or " Highest Importance " rating by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey , which signifies " outstanding architectural example or extreme historical importance " . The building has a status code of " 3S " in the California Historical Resource Information System database , indicating that it " appears eligible for the National Register of Historic Places " ( NRHP ) . 
 The outbreak of World War I , and the costs of the new mortgage , placed a significant financial strain on the members , and in 1915 they decided to release Friedlander from his contract . Temple Sinai hired Harvey B. Franklin as rabbi in 1917 , but his tenure there was only two years . During his term , the congregational school held classes twice a week , and had 285 students and 8 teachers . Franklin next served at <unk> <unk> in San Jose — the congregation from which Temple Sinai 's first rabbi , Myer Solomon Levy , had come . 
 = = Coffee era : 1921 – 1933 = = 
 After going without a rabbi for another two years , in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee , an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes . Coffee was outspoken , and passionately advocated liberal causes : he supported disarmament , birth control , and separation of church and state , and opposed prohibition , antisemitism , and Tammany Hall . Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein , he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings . He also supported California 's compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and mentally retarded , and eugenicist E. S. Gosney 's advocacy on this issue . 
 Coffee was involved in the California State Prison System , and during his tenure at Temple Sinai he was head of the Jewish Committee of Personal Service , a California @-@ wide organization that " ministered to Jews in state prisons " . In January 1924 , California 's governor appointed Coffee to the State Board of Charities and Corrections , which was responsible for supervising California 's state prisons . 
 In 1931 , Coffee opposed California legislation intended to regulate the kosher food industry and prohibit fraudulent claims that foods were kosher . In a letter to state senator E.H. Christian he stated : 
 ... I am unalterably opposed to this bill because Judaism need not call upon the State to settle its own internal affairs . We are starting a dangerous precedent in California which can only lead to evil consequences . 
 Four years ago you assisted in preventing an increase of " wine rabbis . " The law relative to sacramental wine was properly surrounded , and California Jews do not suffer the disgrace which eastern brethren feel . 
 This will bring a " meat rabbi " into existence . New York state has this kosher law and yet it did not prevent the terrible scandal which was uncovered last month in New York City . Use your best influence to prevent it . 
 If Judaism has not enough inner resources to meet present day conditions , the sooner it passes away the better . 
 Despite Coffee 's opposition , the legislation was enacted . 
 Coffee 's advocacy , and Temple Israel 's financial instability , eventually contributed to his dismissal from Temple Sinai in 1933 ; at the same time that the membership was experiencing financial distress due to the Great Depression , Coffee was advocating higher salaries for government employees . After leaving Temple Sinai , he became chaplain at San Quentin State Prison . 
 = = Stern era : 1934 – 1965 = = 
 In 1934 , Temple Sinai hired William M. Stern ( originally <unk> ) as rabbi . A San Francisco native and son of an Orthodox rabbi , he had been persuaded by Rabbi Martin Meyer of the Reform Congregation Emanu @-@ El to attend Hebrew Union College ( HUC ) , where Stern received his ordination . He served as rabbi at a number of Southern and Midwestern synagogues in the 1920s and early 1930s . 
 Much less formal than his predecessor Coffee , Stern was seen as a poker @-@ playing , cigar @-@ smoking " regular guy " , and he focused on combating the spread of antisemitism . His wife Rae was also very active in the congregation . She taught at the synagogue 's Hebrew school , and led the sisterhood . 
 Although originally anti @-@ Zionist , Stern 's views changed in the 1940s , and by 1942 he was strongly supported Jewish nationalism . When an Oakland branch of the anti @-@ Zionist American Council for Judaism formed in 1944 , Stern opposed its creation , even though many members , including its president , were leading members of Temple Sinai . By 1948 , however , the congregation had also become supportive of Zionism . 
 During Stern 's tenure Temple Sinai expanded its facilities , adding a religious school building , offices , and a chapel in 1947 – 1948 , and moving the main entrance to Summit Street . The main building 's interior was also significantly remodeled , aside from the sanctuary . The congregation also built the Temple House ( called Covenant Hall ) , in 1950 . The following year the synagogue put on an exhibition called " Arts in Action " , " that included sculptors , weavers , filmmakers , <unk> , and others . " The event 's director asked poet , artist and art critic Weldon Kees to jury a show of paintings ; Kees ended up having to find the paintings as well . When the Temple 's board saw the selected works , they did not want display all of them , but acquiesced after " a strong protest " . 
 In 1965 , the congregation bought land in Oakland Hills , anticipating a future move . In December of that year Stern died unexpectedly . Following his death , Temple Sinai held for many years an annual Stern Lecture series in his memory . 
 = = Broude era : 1966 – 1989 = = 
 In 1966 , the congregation hired Samuel Broude as rabbi . A graduate of the University of Chicago , in the late 1940s he had worked in Pasadena at a Reconstructionist synagogue , as a part @-@ time cantor and Hebrew teacher , and then in the early 1950s as cantor of Reform University Synagogue of Los Angeles . After completing his rabbinic training , he became associate rabbi at Congregation Ansche Chesed in Cleveland , where he served under Rabbi Arthur <unk> for six years before coming to Temple Sinai . 
 Like Temple Sinai 's previous rabbis , Broude passionately supported liberal causes , opposing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , and taking part in Civil Rights marches . Although he was a Reform rabbi , he had gone to an Orthodox yeshiva as a boy , and religiously he was in many ways more traditional than his predecessors . He re @-@ introduced ritual into the synagogue , but more contentiously opposed intermarriage . His immediate predecessor , Stern , had officiated at intermarriages " under certain conditions " . Broude initially did so as well , under " extenuating circumstances " ( e.g. if the bride were pregnant ) . His position later hardened , and he refused to perform such marriages under any circumstances . He even refused to allow other rabbis who would be willing to do so officiate at intermarriages at Temple Sinai . The issue eventually came to a congregational vote in 1972 , which supported Broude , although the debate was never completely settled . 
 Broude was , however , not opposed to all religious innovations . Under his leadership , Temple Sinai began holding monthly fine arts performances as part of the Friday night service , in place of the usual sermon . In December 1970 , the Temple 's fine arts committee commissioned an original dance work from Anna Halprin and her multi @-@ racial dance troupe . For the next two months Broude met weekly with Halprin , educating her regarding the Friday night prayers . The completed work , titled <unk> , included a candlelight vigil , and dancers tearing their clothes and shouting questions at Broude that reframed the classic question about God and The Holocaust in terms of the Vietnam War : " How can there be a God if He allows all the suffering of the Vietnam War to continue ? " The performance engendered passionate responses from the congregation ; according to Broude " I don 't know if anyone was neutral . Half thought it was fantastic , half thought it was terrible ! " 
 Broude also argued that the congregation should remain in downtown Oakland , and in 1975 , convinced them to stay . He retired in 1989 , the year the buildings survived the Loma Prieta earthquake . After his retirement from Temple Sinai he remained active , filling in at synagogues mostly in the Bay Area , and teaching . He also wrote an autobiography , and a one @-@ man show based on it called " Listening for the Voice " , which he performed at a number of East Bay synagogues , including , in 2009 , at Temple Sinai . 
 = = Chester era : 1989 – 2011 = = 
 Steven Chester , a graduate of UCLA , and ordained by HUC in 1971 , became rabbi in 1989 . He had previously served as rabbi of Temple Beth Israel in Jackson , Michigan , from 1971 to 1976 , and Temple Israel in Stockton , California , from 1976 to 1989 , where he was also an adjunct professor in the Religious Studies department of the University of the Pacific . Chester added a pre @-@ school and adult education programs to the services offered by the synagogue , and supported the congregation 's return to more traditional practices , including the re @-@ introduction of Hebrew into the service . He also continued his predecessors ' passion for social justice , taking up causes " from advocating for local affordable housing and health care for the disenfranchised to supporting women 's reproductive rights and protesting the genocide in Darfur . " In 2006 , Chester was voted Reader 's Choice for " Minister / Rabbi / Imam with the Biggest Heart " in the East Bay Express . 
 The synagogue survived the Oakland Firestorm of 1991 mostly unscathed , although a number of congregants lost their homes . Membership was over 640 families by 1993 . In 1994 , the congregation again significantly remodeled the interior of the main building , aside from the sanctuary . In December of that year , the building was designated a Historic Property by the City of Oakland . 
 Temple Sinai has had three associate or assistant rabbis since 1998 . Andrea Berlin joined the synagogue as its first assistant rabbi in 1998 , after being ordained at HUC in Cincinnati . From 2006 to 2008 , she also served on the board of the Jewish Family and Children 's Services of the East Bay . Suzanne Singer joined Temple Sinai in 2003 , after graduating from HUC in Los Angeles . Before becoming a rabbi , Singer had for two decades been a producer of television programs and documentaries , winning two Emmy Awards . In 2005 she became interim rabbi of Temple Beth El of Riverside , California , and later its permanent rabbi . Jacqueline Mates @-@ Muchin , a San Francisco native , graduated from HUC in New York in 2002 . After serving as an assistant rabbi in Buffalo , New York , she joined Temple Sinai in 2005 . 
 To accommodate the large number of people attending on the High Holy Days , since 2001 Temple Sinai has held its main High Holy Day services at Oakland 's NRHP @-@ listed Art Deco Paramount Theater . While it still holds smaller High Holy Day services in the sanctuary at 2808 Summit Street , the main services at the Paramount fill the entire 1 @,@ 800 seats on the mezzanine of the theater , and most of the 1 @,@ 200 seats in the balcony . 
 In 2006 , the congregation embarked on a campaign to create a new campus for Temple Sinai , to be located adjacent to the existing sanctuary and social hall . The $ 15 million project included " new offices , a larger chapel , a kitchen upgrade , outdoor sacred space , a new preschool with six classrooms and a 4 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ foot playground ... 10 additional classrooms for <unk> teens and adult education , an art room , library , teen lounge and expanded parking . " The L @-@ shaped two @-@ story school / office building would be 16 @,@ 300 square feet ( 1 @,@ 510 m2 ) , and accommodate approximately 100 children in the pre @-@ school . The 2 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 230 m2 ) chapel , which would hold up to 250 people , would be an addition to the rear of the existing social hall . 
 Groundbreaking took place in October 2007 , with an expected completion in Autumn , 2010 . In order to accommodate the new buildings , the school and chapel built in the late 1940s were razed , along with two office buildings on adjoining lots purchased for the expansion . Nine portable buildings were installed on the campus of Merritt College in Oakland Hills to serve in the interim . As of December 23 , 2009 , Temple Sinai had raised almost $ 12 million from 651 households ( 70 % of the congregation ) . 
 Chester had planned to retire in June 2009 , and the congregation embarked on a search for a new senior rabbi in 2008 . Twenty @-@ three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist , but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration . While the search was progressing , Chester had realized that , due to the 2008 financial crisis , he would have to keep working . After the main candidate withdrew , the synagogue 's president approached Chester , asking if he would stay on for another term , which Chester agreed to do . Chester retired in June 2011 , becoming ( along with Broude ) Rabbi Emeritus .

 = Yes / No ( Glee ) = 
 " Yes / No " is the tenth episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee , and the fifty @-@ fourth overall . Written by Brad Falchuk and directed by Eric Stoltz , the episode aired on Fox in the United States on January 17 , 2012 . It contains the revelation of an elopement , and two marriage proposals , including the proposal by Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) to Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) . 
 Reviews were mixed for the episode . While Will 's actual proposal to Emma was received with more favor than not , the scene where Will asks Finn ( Cory Monteith ) to be his best man was roundly condemned : the notion that Will had no adult friends and would ask one of his students was inconceivable to many . There was acclaim for the subplot featuring Becky 's ( Lauren Potter ) pursuit of Artie ( Kevin McHale ) , and her mental voiceovers by Helen Mirren . 
 The musical performances from the episode were greeted more positively than the episode as a whole . All six numbers were released as singles , and five of them charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100 . Upon its initial airing , this episode was viewed by 7 @.@ 50 million American viewers and received a 3 @.@ 1 / 8 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . The total viewership was up from the previous episode , " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Emma ( Jayma Mays ) wonders whether Will ( Matthew Morrison ) is ever going to propose marriage . She fantasizes about their wedding , and in the fantasy sings " Wedding Bell Blues " . She is mortified to discover that while fantasizing , she inadvertently and publicly asked Will to marry her , and immediately denies having done so . Emboldened nevertheless , Will gives the glee club an assignment : find the perfect song for him to use to propose to Emma . 
 Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) and Sam ( Chord Overstreet ) separately recount their summer relationship to their friends , singing " Summer Nights " . Sam suggests to Mercedes that they get back together , but she reminds Sam she is dating Shane ( LaMarcus Tinker ) . Sam , hoping a varsity letterman jacket will impress her , joins the only sports team still recruiting : synchronized swimming . Later , while Mercedes sings " The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face " with Rachel ( Lea Michele ) , Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) and Santana ( Naya Rivera ) for Will as their proposal suggestion , she mentally pictures Sam rather than Shane , and is distressed . 
 Becky Jackson ( Lauren Potter , with inner voiceover by Helen Mirren ) , decides she wants Artie ( Kevin McHale ) for her boyfriend , and asks him for a date . He later performs for her his idea for Will 's proposal — a sexy mash @-@ up of the songs " Moves Like Jagger " and " Jumpin ' Jack Flash " — but she informs him that their date also includes dinner . The glee club fears Artie will be raising Becky 's hopes , but Artie tells them he had fun on the dinner date , and that they should examine their own prejudices about people with handicaps . However , when Becky tells Artie that she wants to have sex with him , he panics and asks Sue ( Jane Lynch ) for advice on how to break off the relationship . She advises him to treat Becky like anyone else and tell her directly . Becky is disappointed , and is later comforted by Sue . 
 Will asks Finn ( Cory Monteith ) to be his best man , and Finn tells Will that he is considering enlisting in the army . Will has Finn meet with him and Emma , plus his mother Carole ( Romy Rosemont ) and stepfather Burt ( Mike O 'Malley ) , who had not known of his army plans . Finn explains that he feels an obligation to his late father to be a good man and help people . His mother reveals that she hid from him the fact that his father did not die in Iraq , but instead suffered from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder there , was dishonorably discharged , and died in Cincinnati from a drug overdose . The news is devastating to Finn , and he , Rachel and Kurt talk about how the future no longer appears promising . Rachel sings " Without You " to Finn , and the two embrace . 
 Will asks Emma 's parents ( Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey ) for their blessing to marry her , but they refuse as they doubt Emma could handle marriage and having children . Unaware of that discussion , Emma later asks Will about their progress toward marriage , and he also wonders whether she could cope with a family given her obsessive – compulsive disorder . Though distraught , Emma tells Will that her disease is a part of her : he must decide whether they should stay together . Will , realizing that he loves Emma regardless , stages a spectacular marriage proposal — aided by the glee club and synchronized swim team , who sing and perform a water ballet to " We Found Love " — which Emma tearfully accepts . Later , Finn surprises Rachel with a proposal of marriage , complete with an engagement ring , which leaves her speechless .

 " Yes / No " received mixed reviews from critics . Robert Canning of IGN gave it a " good " rating of 7 out of 10 , and noted " hit and miss musical performances , random quirky and funny bits , and storytelling choices that kind of sort of work " . TVLine 's Michael Slezak was more enthusiastic , and said it was the " best episode " of the third season ; he credited both Helen Mirren and " some righteous plot development that stays true to core characters " . Jen Chaney of The Washington Post commented that Glee had " returned to its frequent habit of dropping plots twists on us that come out of nowhere " , and MTV 's Kevin P. Sullivan wrote that the episode 's " promising bright spots couldn 't escape from under the weight of the show 's typical mistakes " . 
 Reviewers were unhappy with most of the marriage storyline that involved Will , though they seemed satisfied with Emma 's portion of it . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a " jackass " throughout and called the storyline " so pathetic and sad " , words echoed by Entertainment Weekly 's Joseph Brannigan Lynch , who wrote , " When Schue told New Directions , ' You guys are my family , ' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents . " John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed , " Will desperately needs to make some grown @-@ up friends " , a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV 's Crystal Bell . Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness : he felt " using the phrase ' it 's hopeless ' in reference to her mental disorder " was too extreme . To James Poniewozik of Time , the episode showed " how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person " . 
 There was broad agreement regarding the scene where Will asks Finn to be his best man : not one reviewer approved . Lynch called it " questionable " and said it crossed a " line of weirdness " , Slezak and TV Guide 's Kate Stanhope felt it was inappropriate , if not unethical , and Bell said the actual request was the episode 's " biggest WTF ? ! moment " . Will 's statement that Finn had taught him " more about being a man " was met with incredulity . Slezak declared " Finn has a lot of growing up to do before he 's really a man " , and Sullivan wrote that since Finn acted " like a petulant man @-@ boy " on the show , Will must have been referring to events in " a season of Glee that didn 't air " . Finn did receive some praise from Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter , however ; she called the sequence where he discovers the truth about his father " one of Cory Monteith 's best scenes yet " , and Slezak described it as " beautifully handled " by Monteith . Finn 's marriage proposal to Rachel at the end of the episode was controversial . Reviewers thought it was a bad idea — Kubicek declared , " No one in high school should get engaged " — but Poniewozik wrote that it " made a lot of sense for Finn " as a character , and VanDerWerff said the scene " worked " for him . 
 Becky 's storyline was acclaimed by most reviewers . Canning called it " exceptional " and " the most emotional and satisfying of the episode " . Poniewozik also praised it , and wrote , " Artie and Becky 's arc , on the other hand , really worked : it was sweet , uncomfortable and messy in the way that Glee does well . " He continued , " it played out as it did not just because of Artie and Becky 's condition but because of what they ’ re like as people " . VanDerWerff said the story was " handled with just the right level of pathos " , and Slezak praised the writers for turning Becky " into a fully realized character , while confronting head @-@ on the dashed hopes and disappointments that can be a reality for a person with Down Syndrome " . Sullivan wrote , " The plot touched on a universal experience , unrequited love , from a very Glee perspective , the treatment of handicapped people as people . It ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed Sue and Becky 's touching dynamic . " Bell liked Sue in this episode , as she was helping the plot , which in turn made her one @-@ liners " added treats rather than overdone cliches " . The use of Helen Mirren to voice Becky 's thoughts was highly praised . Poniewozik called it " the kind of ridiculous @-@ but @-@ weirdly @-@ logical move I love from Glee " , and Lynch said it " was one of the most charming treats this show has offered in a while " . Sullivan wrote that " both actresses turned in great performances that elevated the episode significantly " . Not all reviewers agreed , however : Futterman called Mirren 's vocal cameo " bizarre " , and although Kubicek thought Mirren was " pretty darn hilarious " , he said the " Becky having a crush on Artie " story arc made him feel " as uncomfortable " as the members of New Directions , and stated , " It 's easy to say that everyone should just treat her like they treat everyone else , but actually doing it is somewhat problematic . " 
 The cameo appearance of NeNe Leakes as Coach Roz Washington received plaudits from most reviewers . Poniewozik described her as " pretty damn excellent " , and Votta wrote , " She only has one generally pointless scene but is arguably the best part of the whole episode . " Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal said Leakes " does well " , and Bell stated " she actually wasn 't that bad " . Kubicek , however , while he liked the writing for the character , wrote that Leakes was " an embarrassingly terrible actress " . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The opening number of the show received the most disparate reviews from critics . Kubicek was one of the most enthusiastic about " Summer Nights " , and wrote , " This is the kind of ridiculous , over @-@ the @-@ top , hilariously cheesy stuff I want to see from Glee all the time . " He was also pleased that Rory was given solo lines , and Sugar was " being embraced as a part of the group " . Lynch thought that " Amber Riley and Chord Overstreet harmonize surprisingly wonderfully " , and gave this " easily the most fun number of the episode " an " A − " . Stanhope said that " the energy is infectious and you can feel the sparks between the former pair " , but the performance was " way too much of a copycat " of the original Grease scene , while Flandez said that the two leads " lacked chemistry " and that the number was " inexplicable " . VanDerWerff was similarly unimpressed : " dumb and unnecessary " . Chaney wrote that the number " was a high @-@ energy , cute way for the show to mark its comeback " , but said that Rory " sounded flat " on one of his lines , and Sam " couldn ’ t quite hit " the ending high note in the song , and graded it a " B " . 
 " Wedding Bell Blues " was described by Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle as " the perfect combination of a great song , plot relevance , and Princess Beatrice hat " . Stanhope agreed with him on all three points , and added that it was " a great pick for her vocals " . Slezak described those vocals as " a breath of dewy spring air " and gave the song an " A " , but Lynch thought Emma was not " much of a singer " and gave the number a " B − " , though he said " the curiosity of backup vocals from Coach Beiste and Sue Sylvester made this entirely worthwhile " . Poniewozik characterized the staging of the song as " phoned in " . " The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face " was given an " A " by Lynch and an " A − " by Slezak ; the latter called the vocals " pretty electrifying " . Flandez said the song was " sublime " and complimented the lighting , the mood , and the direction by Eric Stoltz , and VanDerWerff described it as the episode 's " best single number " . While Futterman thought the performers sang with " controlled power " , she felt " singing it dressed in black with tears rolling down " was funereal rather than bridal , and Sullivan called it an " odd song choice " that was made " worse " by " Lea Michele 's cry @-@ singing " . Chaney gave the song her lowest grade of the episode , a " C − " , and characterized it as a " flagrant eye @-@ watering fest " . 
 Flandez called the " propulsive mash @-@ up " of " Moves Like Jagger " and " Jumpin ' Jack Flash " one of the episode 's " highlights " , and Billboard 's Rae Votta said it was " impeccably choreographed by Glee 's often unsung hero Zach Woodlee . " She also lauded Artie 's " Jagger moves while sitting in a chair " and said he " outshines even Mike and Will who dance beside him " . Sullivan described Artie as " consistently awesome " , and Slezak said it was " one of Artie ’ s more appealing musical moments this season " and gave it a " B " . Lynch characterized the song as a " spunky diversion " and gave it a " B + " , but he noted it was " not a good song for marriage proposals by any stretch of the imagination " , a point also made by Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman , who said the number would have " fared much better as a stand @-@ alone performance " . While Chaney liked Will and Mike 's " moves " , she felt there was " far too much quick cutting to shots of Morrison in a tank top " and gave the song a " B – " ; Slezak and VanDerWerff were also critical of these shots . 
 Futterman was impressed that in " Without You " , Glee crafted a " cover to rival the original " , and said it " totally works " . Slezak called it a " vocally stunning reimagining " and gave it an " A − " . Both Lynch and Chaney gave it a " B " , and the latter wrote " I can 't deny that she sang the heck out of it " . Chaney was not so pleased with " We Found Love " , to which she gave a " C " . She wrote that it was " part old Esther Williams movie , part classic ' SNL ' sketch with Harry Shearer and Martin Short and part music video for ' Magic ' by the Cars . In short , it was kind of a train wreck . " However , she and Stanhope , who said it was " way too fast @-@ paced " , were in the minority . Lynch called it " sheer pleasure " and gave it an " A − " , and Slezak was even more enthusiastic with an " A + " grade and described it as a " sublimely , ridiculously , excessively terrific production number " which he placed " in the show 's all @-@ time Top 10 " . VanDerWerff praised the " nice sense of visual spectacle " , and Hankinson called it " really fantastic " and " something different " . Futterman , after she admitted to her " unabashed love " of the song , noted that the show had " found the trifecta of a current song that both fits the overall theme of the show and the characters singing it " .

 = Murray Rothbard = 
 Murray Newton Rothbard ( / <unk> <unk> / ; March 2 , 1926 – January 7 , 1995 ) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School , a revisionist historian , and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern libertarianism . Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho @-@ capitalism , a staunch advocate of historical revisionism , and a central figure in the twentieth @-@ century American libertarian movement . He wrote over twenty books on political theory , revisionist history , economics , and other subjects . Rothbard asserted that all services provided by the " monopoly system of the corporate state " could be provided more efficiently by the private sector and wrote that the state is " the organization of robbery systematized and writ large . " He called fractional reserve banking a form of fraud and opposed central banking . He categorically opposed all military , political , and economic interventionism in the affairs of other nations . According to his protégé Hans @-@ Hermann Hoppe , " There would be no anarcho @-@ capitalist movement to speak of without Rothbard . " 
 Rothbard was a heterodox political economist . Economist Jeff Herbener , who calls Rothbard his friend and " intellectual mentor " , wrote that Rothbard received " only ostracism " from mainstream academia . Rothbard rejected mainstream economic methodologies and instead embraced the <unk> of his most important intellectual precursor , Ludwig von Mises . To promote his economic and political ideas , Rothbard joined Llewellyn H. " Lew " Rockwell , Jr. and Burton Blumert in 1982 to establish the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Alabama .

 Murray Rothbard 's parents were David and Rae Rothbard , Jewish immigrants who had immigrated to the U.S. from Poland and Russia respectively . David Rothbard was a chemist . Rothbard was born in the Bronx , but the family moved to an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , where he attended Birch Wathen , a private school on the Upper East Side . Rothbard later stated that he much preferred Birch Wathen to the " debasing and egalitarian public school system " he had previously attended in the Bronx . 
 Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a " right @-@ winger " ( adherent of the " Old Right " ) among friends and neighbors who were " communists or fellow @-@ travelers . " Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government , free enterprise , private property , and " a determination to rise by one 's own merits " . To Rothbard " all socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent . " 
 He attended Columbia University , where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and , eleven years later , his PhD in economics in 1956 . The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor , Joseph Dorfman , and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation . Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building . It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower 's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard 's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate . Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time . 
 During the 1940s Rothbard became acquainted with Frank <unk> and read widely in libertarian @-@ oriented works by Albert Jay Nock , Garet Garrett , Isabel Paterson , H. L. Mencken and others , as well as Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises In the early 1950s , when Mises was teaching at the Wall Street division of New York University Business School , Rothbard attended Mises ' unofficial seminar . Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises ' book , Human Action . Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund , a group that provided financial backing to promote various " right @-@ wing " ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s . The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain Human Action in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises ' views ; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises 's approval . For ten years , Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund , which designated him a " senior analyst . " As Rothbard continued his work , he enlarged the project . The result was Rothbard 's book Man , Economy , and State , published in 1962 . Upon its publication , Mises praised Rothbard 's work effusively . 
 = = = Marriage , employment , and activism = = = 
 In 1953 , in New York City , he married JoAnn Schumacher ( 1928 – 1999 ) , whom he called Joey . JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser , as well as hostess of his " Rothbard Salon " . They enjoyed a loving marriage , and Rothbard often called her " the indispensable framework " behind his life and achievements . According to Joey , patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage . The Fund collapsed in 1962 , leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions . He was offered a part @-@ time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966 , at age 40 . This institution had no economics department or economics majors , and Rothbard derided its social science department as " Marxist . " However , Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics . 
 Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years , until 1986 . Then 60 years old , Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics , an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman . According to Rothbard 's friend , colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans @-@ Hermann Hoppe , Rothbard led a " fringe existence " in academia , but was able to attract a large number of " students and disciples " through his writings , thereby becoming " the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement . " Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death . Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977 . In 1982 , he co @-@ founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn , Alabama , and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995 . The Institute 's Review of Austrian Economics , a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics , was also founded by Rothbard in 1987 . 
 After Rothbard 's death , Joey reflected on Rothbard 's happiness and bright spirit . " ... he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon . This was important to him . " She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell . " Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment , as they checked in with each other . Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day . " Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God , describing himself as a " mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew . " Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist , Rothbard was critical of the " left @-@ libertarian hostility to religion " . In Rothbard 's later years , many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism , but he never did . The New York Times obituary called Rothbard " an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention . " 
 = = = Conflict with Ayn Rand = = = 
 In 1954 , Rothbard , along with several other attendees of Mises ' seminar , joined the circle of novelist Ayn Rand , the founder of Objectivism . He soon parted from her , writing , among other things , that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed but similar to those of Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas and Herbert Spencer . In 1958 , after the publication of her novel , Atlas Shrugged , Rothbard wrote a " fan letter " to Rand , calling her book " an infinite treasure house , " and " not merely the greatest novel ever written , [ but ] one of the very greatest books ever written , fiction or nonfiction . " He also wrote that " you introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy , " prompting him to learn " the glorious natural rights tradition . " He rejoined her circle for a few months , but soon broke with Rand once more , over various differences , including his defense of anarchism . 
 Later , Rothbard satirized Rand 's acolytes in his play Mozart Was a Red and the essay " The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult . " " Mozart Was a Red " was Rothbard 's unpublished one @-@ act play written as a farce . Rothbard characterized Ayn Rand 's circle as a " dogmatic , personality cult . " His play parodies Rand ( through the character " Carson Sand " ) and her friends , and is set during a visit from Keith Hackley , a fan of Sand 's novel The Brow of Zeus ( a play on Rand 's most famous novel , Atlas Shrugged ) .

 Rothbard was an advocate and practitioner of the Austrian School tradition of his teacher Ludwig von Mises . Like Mises , Rothbard rejected the application of the scientific method to economics , and dismissed econometrics , empirical and statistical analysis , and other tools of mainstream social science as useless for the study of economics . He instead embraced <unk> , the strictly a priori methodology of Mises . <unk> conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical axioms : fixed , unchanging , objective , and discernible through logical reasoning , without the use of any evidence . On the account of Misesian economist Hans @-@ Hermann Hoppe , eschewing the scientific method and empirical evidence distinguishes the Misesian approach " from all other current economic schools " . Mark Skousen of Grantham University and the Foundation for Economic Education , a critic of mainstream economics , praises Rothbard as brilliant , his writing style persuasive , his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous , and his Misesian methodology sound . However , citing Rothbard 's absence of academic publications , Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively " outside the discipline " of mainstream economics and that his work " fell on deaf ears " outside his ideological circles . Paralleling Skousen 's remarks , Hans @-@ Hermann Hoppe laments the fact that all non @-@ Misesian economists dismiss the Misesian approach , which both he and Rothbard embraced , as " dogmatic and unscientific " . 
 Rothbard wrote extensively on Austrian Business Cycle Theory and as part of this approach , strongly opposed central banking , fiat money , and fractional reserve banking and advocated a gold standard and a 100 % reserve requirement for banks . 
 = = = = Polemics against mainstream economics = = = = 
 Rothbard authored a series of scathing polemics against modern mainstream economics . He was critical of Adam Smith , calling him a " shameless plagiarist " who set economics off @-@ track , ultimately leading to the rise of Marxism . Instead , Rothbard praised Smith 's contemporaries ' works , including Richard Cantillon , Anne Turgot , and Condillac for developing the subjective theory of value . In response to Rothbard 's charge that Smith 's The Wealth of Nations was largely plagiarized , David Friedman castigated Rothbard 's scholarship and character , saying that he " was [ either ] deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing " . Tony Endres called Rothbard 's treatment of Adam Smith a " travesty " . 
 Rothbard was equally scathing in his criticism of John Maynard Keynes , labeling Keynes weak on economic theory and a shallow political opportunist . Rothbard also wrote more generally that Keynesian @-@ style governmental regulation of money and credit created a " dismal monetary and banking situation " . He demeaned John Stuart Mill as a " wooly man of mush " , and speculated that Mill 's " soft " personality led his economic thought astray . 
 Rothbard was critical of monetarist economist Milton Friedman . In a polemic entitled " Milton Friedman <unk> " , he maligned Friedman as a " statist " , a " favorite of the establishment " , a friend of and " apologist " for Richard Nixon , and a " pernicious influence " on public policy . Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman 's academic prestige and political influence . Noting that Rothbard has " been nasty to me and my work " , Friedman responded to Rothbard 's criticism by calling him a " cult builder and a <unk> . " 
 In a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute , Rothbard 's protégé and libertarian theorist Hans @-@ Hermann Hoppe wrote that the work Man , Economy , and State " presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics , " and included it among Rothbard 's " almost mind @-@ boggling achievements " . Hoppe lamented that , like his own mentor Ludwig von Mises , Rothbard died without winning the Nobel Prize that Hoppe says Rothbard deserved " twice over . " Though Hoppe acknowledged that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia , he called Rothbard an " intellectual giant , " comparable to Aristotle , Locke and Kant . 
 = = = = Reception of Rothbard 's work = = = = 
 Though he self @-@ identified as an Austrian economist , Rothbard 's methodology was at odds with many other Austrians . In 1956 , Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist Fritz Machlup , stating that Machlup was no <unk> , and calling him instead a " positivist " who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises . Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist Milton Friedman . Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920 's Vienna before each relocated to the United States , and von Mises later urged his American protege , Israel <unk> , to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at Johns Hopkins University . Professors Gabriel J. Zanotti and Nicolas <unk> recently reviewed the controversy stating " Machlup 's interpretation shows that Austrian epistemology is well grounded in post @-@ <unk> epistemology and that most criticisms of Austrian economics based on its <unk> character are misplaced . Furthermore , Machlup 's interpretation provides us with a setting to re @-@ build the academic interaction between Austrians and non @-@ Austrians that was characteristic of the early twentieth century . " 
 According to libertarian economists Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink , Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy ( " ERE " ) can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change . The words ERE had been introduced by von Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of static equilibrium and general equilibrium analysis . Cowen and Fink found " serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses . " With the sole exception of Rothbard , no other economist adopted Mises ' term , and the concept continued to be called " equilibrium analysis . " 
 In an 2011 article critical of Rothbard 's " reflexive opposition " to inflation , The Economist noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the Right . The article contrasted Rothbard 's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of " sophisticated Austrian @-@ school monetary economists such as George <unk> and Larry White , [ who ] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary <unk> position not all that different from Mr Sumner 's " . 
 According to economist Peter <unk> , Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist . In 1988 , <unk> noted that Rothbard " vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians " . 
 = = = Ethics = = = 
 Although Rothbard adopted von Mises ' deductive methodology for his social theory and economics , he parted with Mises on the question of ethics . Specifically , he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective , and opposed utilitarianism in favor of principle @-@ based , natural law reasoning . In defense of his free market views , Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off . Rothbard , on the other hand , concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people , including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs . Therefore , unlike Mises , Rothbard attempted to assert an objective , natural law basis for the free market . He called this principle " self @-@ ownership , " loosely basing the idea on the writings of John Locke and also borrowing concepts from classical liberalism and the anti @-@ imperialism of the Old Right . 
 Rothbard accepted the Labor theory of property , but rejected the Lockean proviso , arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally , and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift . 
 Rothbard was a strong critic of egalitarianism . The title essay of Rothbard 's 1974 book Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays held , " Equality is not in the natural order of things , and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect ( except before the law ) is certain to have disastrous consequences . " In it , Rothbard wrote , " At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality ; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will . " 
 Commenting on Rothbard 's ideas , Noam Chomsky says that they are " not worth talking about " and " not really serious " . 
 = = = Anarcho @-@ capitalism = = = 
 Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to " anarcho @-@ capitalism . " The first person to use the term , however , was Murray Rothbard , who in the mid @-@ 20th century synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics , classical liberalism , and 19th @-@ century American individualist anarchists . According to Llewellyn Rockwell , Rothbard is the " conscience " of all the various strains of libertarian anarchism , whose contemporary advocates are former " colleagues " of Rothbard personally inspired by his example . 
 During his years at graduate school in the late 1940s , Murray Rothbard considered whether a strict laissez @-@ faire policy would require that private police agencies replace government protective services . He visited Baldy Harper , a founder of the Foundation for Economic Education , who doubted the need for any government whatsoever . During this period , Rothbard was influenced by nineteenth @-@ century American individualist anarchists , like Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker , and the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari who wrote about how such a system could work . Thus he " combined the laissez @-@ faire economics of Mises with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state " from individualist anarchists . In an unpublished memo written around 1949 Rothbard concluded that in order to believe in laissez @-@ faire one must also embrace anarchism . 
 Rothbard began to consider himself a private property anarchist in 1950 and later began to use " anarcho @-@ capitalist " to describe his political ideology . In his anarcho @-@ capitalist model , a system of protection agencies compete in a free market and are voluntarily supported by consumers who choose to use their protective and judicial services . Anarcho @-@ capitalism would mean the end of the state monopoly on force . 
 In Man , Economy , and State , Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention in three categories : " autistic intervention " , which is interference with private non @-@ economic activities ; " binary intervention " , which is forced exchange between individuals and the state ; and " triangular intervention " , which is state @-@ mandated exchange between individuals . According to Sanford Ikeda , Rothbard 's typology " eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises 's original formulation . " Rothbard writes in Power and Market that the role of the economist in a free market is limited but is much larger in a government that solicits economic policy recommendations . Rothbard argues that self @-@ interest therefore prejudices the views of many economists in favor of increased government intervention . 
 = = = Race , gender and civil rights = = = 
 Michael O 'Malley , Associate Professor of History at George Mason University , characterizes Rothbard 's " overall tone regard [ ing ] " the Civil Rights Movement and the women 's suffrage movement to be " contemptuous and hostile " . Rothbard vilified women 's rights activists , attributing the growth of the welfare state to politically active spinsters " whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of health and heart " . Rothbard had pointed out in his ' Origins of the Welfare State ' that progressives had evolved from elitist Gilded Age pietist Protestants that wanted to bring a secularized version of millennialism under a welfare state , which was spearheaded by a " shock troop of Yankee protestant and Jewish women and lesbian spinsters . " 
 Rothbard called for the elimination of " the entire ' civil rights ' structure " stating that it " tramples on the property rights of every American . " He consistently favored repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act , including Title VII regarded employment discrimination and called for overturning the Brown v. Board of Education decision on the grounds that forced integration of schools was aggressive . Rothbard also urged the ( state ) police to crack down on " street criminals " , writing that " cops must be unleashed " and " allowed to administer instant punishment , subject of course to liability when they are in error " . He also advocated that the police " clear the streets of bums and vagrants " , and quipped " who cares ? , " in response to the question of where these people would go after being removed from public property . 
 Rothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement . He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a " great black leader " and integrationist Martin Luther King to be favored by whites because he " was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution . " Rothbard praised Malcolm X for " acting white " through use of his intellect and wit , and contrasted him favorably with the " fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style , " Dr. " King " . But while he compared Malcolm X 's black nationalism favorably to King 's <unk> , and for a time praised black nationalism , in 1993 he rejected the vision of a " separate black nation " , asking " does anyone really believe that ... New Africa would be content to strike out on its own , with no massive " foreign aid " from the U.S.A. ? " Rothbard also suggested that opposition to King , whom he demeaned as a " coercive integrationist " , should be a litmus test for members of his " <unk> " political movement . 
 = = = = Race and intelligence = = = = 
 Political scientist Jean <unk> commented on Rothbard 's " praise " of the argument , made in Richard <unk> and Charles Murray 's book The Bell Curve , that blacks tend to score , on average , lower than whites on IQ tests . <unk> noted that Rothbard 's remark on intellectual and " temperamental " differences between races are “ self @-@ evident ” . 
 = = = Opposition to war = = = 
 Like Randolph Bourne , Rothbard believed that " war is the health of the state . " According to David Gordon , this was the reason for Rothbard 's opposition to aggressive foreign policy . Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowledge of how government had led citizens into earlier wars was important . Two essays expanded on these views " War , Peace , and the State " and " The Anatomy of the State . " Rothbard used insights of Vilfredo Pareto , Gaetano <unk> , and Robert Michels to build a model of state personnel , goals , and ideology . In an obituary for his friend historical revisionist Harry Elmer Barnes , Rothbard wrote : 
 Our entry into World War II was the crucial act in <unk> a permanent militarization upon the economy and society , in bringing to the country a permanent garrison state , an overweening military @-@ industrial complex , a permanent system of conscription . It was the crucial act in creating a mixed economy run by Big Government , a system of state monopoly capitalism run by the central government in collaboration with Big Business and Big Unionism . 
 Rothbard 's colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war : " the American Revolution and the War for Southern Independence , as viewed from the Confederate side . " Rothbard condemned the " Northern war against slavery " , saying it was inspired by " fanatical " religious faith and characterized by " a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions , to commit mayhem and mass murder , to plunder and loot and destroy , all in the name of high moral principle " . He celebrated Jefferson Davis , Robert E. Lee , and other prominent Confederates as heroes while denouncing Abraham Lincoln , Ulysses S. Grant and other Union leaders for " open [ ing ] the Pandora 's Box of genocide and the extermination of civilians " in their war against the South . 
 = = = Middle East conflict = = = 
 Rothbard 's The Libertarian Forum blamed the Middle East conflict on Israeli aggression " fueled by American arms and money . " Rothbard warned that the mid @-@ East conflict would draw the U.S. into a world war . He was anti @-@ Zionist and opposed U.S. involvement in the Middle East . Rothbard criticized the Camp David Accords for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel 's 1982 invasion of Lebanon . In his essay , " War Guilt in the Middle East , " Rothbard states that Israel refused " to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them . " He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict , saying : 
 On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs , who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries ; and on the other , there are a group of external fanatics , who come from all over the world , and who claim the entire land area as " given " to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past . There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties . There can be no genuine settlement , no " peace " in the face of this irrepressible conflict ; there can only be either a war to the death , or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one . That is the harsh reality of the Middle East . 
 = = = Historical revisionism = = = 
 Rothbard embraced " historical revisionism " as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt " court intellectuals " over mainstream historical narratives . Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of " the state " in exchange for " power , prestige , and loot " from the state . Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as " penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals , and to present to the public the true history " . He was influenced by and a champion of the historian Harry Elmer Barnes , a Holocaust denier . Rothbard endorsed Barnes 's revisionism on World War II , favorably citing his view that " the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II " . In addition to broadly supporting his historical views , Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists . 
 Rothbard 's endorsing of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism from within the political right . Kevin D. Williamson wrote an opinion piece published by National Review which condemned Rothbard for " making common cause with the ' revisionist ' historians of the Third Reich " , a term he used to describe American Holocaust deniers associated with Rothbard , such as James J. Martin of the Institute for Historical Review . The piece also characterized " Rothbard and his faction " as being " <unk> indulgent " of Holocaust denial , the view which " specifically denies that the Holocaust actually happened or holds that it was in some way exaggerated " . 
 In an article for Rothbard 's 50th birthday , Rothbard 's friend and Buffalo State College historian Ralph <unk> stated that Rothbard " is the main reason that revisionism has become a crucial part of the whole libertarian position . " 
 = = = Children 's rights and parental obligations = = = 
 In the Ethics of Liberty , Rothbard explores issues regarding children 's rights in terms of self @-@ ownership and contract . These include support for a woman 's right to abortion , condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children , and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children . He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so . He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a " flourishing free market in children " . He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces , while " superficially monstrous " , will benefit " everyone " involved in the market : " the natural parents , the children , and the foster parents purchasing " . 
 In Rothbard 's view of parenthood , " the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed , clothe , or educate his children , since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights . " Thus , Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation , and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect . However , according to Rothbard , " the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children " . In a fully libertarian society , he wrote , " the existence of a free baby market will bring such ' neglect ' down to a minimum " . 
 Economist Gene Callahan of Cardiff University , formerly a scholar at the Rothbard @-@ affiliated Mises Institute , observes that Rothbard allows " the logical elegance of his legal theory " to " trump any arguments based on the moral <unk> of a parent idly watching her six @-@ month @-@ old child slowly starve to death in its crib . " 
 = = = <unk> theory of criminal justice = = = 
 Rothbard consistently advocated for abolition of the subpoena power , court attendance , contempt of court powers , coerced testimony of witnesses , compulsory jury duty , and the bail system , arguing that all these functions of the judiciary were violations of natural rights and American common law . He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted he or she should not be held in prison or jails , writing " except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red @-@ handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists , it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction , let alone before trial . And even when someone is caught red @-@ handed , there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest : subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else . If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law , then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression . The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him , and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction — all should be subject to the universal law . " Rothbard argued that police who make wrongful arrests or indictments should be charged with kidnapping . In The Ethics of Liberty , Rothbard advocates for a " frankly retributive theory of punishment " or a system of " a tooth ( or two teeth ) for a tooth " . Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional , stating that " the criminal , or invader , loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his " . Applying his retributive theory , Rothbard states that a thief " must pay double the extent of theft " . Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $ 15 @,@ 000 , and says he not only would have to return the stolen money , but also provide the victim an additional $ 15 @,@ 000 , money to which the thief has forfeited his right . The thief would be " put in a [ temporary ] state of enslavement to his victim " if he is unable to pay him immediately . Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals , although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished . 
 = = = = Torture of criminal suspects = = = = 
 In chapter twelve of Ethics , Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police . He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects , including accused murderers , for information related to their alleged crime . Writes Rothbard , " Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information ( not to wring a confession , since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid ) . If the suspect turns out to be guilty , then the police should be exonerated , for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return ; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent . But if the suspect is not convicted , then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man , and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault " . Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong , no matter who the victim . Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard 's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect , after having tortured him or her . 
 = = = Science and scientism = = = 
 In an essay condemning " scientism in the study of man " , Rothbard rejected the application of causal determinism to human beings , arguing that the actions of human beings , as opposed to those of everything else in nature , are not determined by prior causes but by " free will " . He argued that " determinism as applied to man , is a self @-@ contradictory thesis , since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will . " Rothbard opposed what he considered the <unk> of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics , history , ethics , and political science to create a " science of liberty . " Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho @-@ capitalist position in two of his books : For a New Liberty , published in 1973 , and The Ethics of Liberty , published in 1982 . In his Power and Market ( 1970 ) , Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function . 
 = = Political activism = = 
 As a young man , Rothbard considered himself part of the Old Right , an anti @-@ statist and anti @-@ interventionist branch of the Republican Party . In the 1948 presidential election , Rothbard , " as a Jewish student at Columbia , horrified his peers by organizing a Students for Strom Thurmond chapter , so staunchly did he believe in states ' rights . " 
 By the late 1960s , Rothbard 's " long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti @-@ New Deal and anti @-@ interventionist Robert Taft supporter into friendship with the quasi @-@ pacifist Nebraska Republican Congressman Howard Buffett ( father of Warren Buffett ) then over to the League of ( Adlai ) <unk> Democrats and , by 1968 , into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left . " Rothbard advocated an alliance with the New Left anti @-@ war movement , on the grounds that the conservative movement had been completely subsumed by the statist establishment . However , Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a " People 's Republic " style draft . It was during this phase that he associated with Karl Hess and founded Left and Right : A Journal of Libertarian Thought with Leonard <unk> and George Resch , which existed from 1965 to 1968 . 
 From 1969 to 1984 he edited The Libertarian Forum , also initially with Hess ( although Hess 's involvement ended in 1971 ) . The Libertarian Forum provided a platform for Rothbard 's writing . Despite its small readership , it engaged conservatives associated with the National Review in nationwide debate . Rothbard rejected the view that Ronald Reagan 's 1980 election as President was a victory for libertarian principles , and he attacked Reagan 's economic program in a series of Libertarian Forum articles . In 1982 , Rothbard called Reagan 's claims of spending cuts a " fraud " and a " hoax " , and accused <unk> of doctoring the economic statistics in order to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment . 
 Rothbard criticized the " frenzied nihilism " of left @-@ wing libertarians , but also criticized right @-@ wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state ; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them in order to bring about liberty . 
 <unk> Randolph Bourne 's idea that " war is the health of the state " , Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime , and engaged in anti @-@ war activism . During the 1970s and 1980s , Rothbard was active in the Libertarian Party . He was frequently involved in the party 's internal politics . He was one of the founders of the Cato Institute , and " came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after Cato 's Letters , a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America 's Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution . " From 1978 to 1983 , he was associated with the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus , allying himself with Justin Raimondo , Eric Garris and Williamson Evers . He opposed the " low @-@ tax liberalism " espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ed Clark and Cato Institute president Edward H Crane III . According to Charles Burris , " Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato . " 
 Rothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the " right @-@ wing populist " wing of the party , notably Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul , who ran for President on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988 . " Rothbard worked closely with Lew Rockwell ( joined later by his long @-@ time friend Burt Blumert ) in nurturing the Ludwig von Mises Institute , and the publication , The Rothbard @-@ Rockwell Report ; which after Rothbard 's 1995 death evolved into the website , <unk> " 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In 1989 , Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post @-@ Cold War anti @-@ interventionist right , calling himself a <unk> , a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism . <unk> sought to appeal to disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics . According to Reason , Rothbard advocated right @-@ wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke and Wisconsin U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy were models for an " Outreach to the Rednecks " effort that could be used by a broad libertarian / paleoconservative coalition . Working together , the paleo coalition would expose the " unholy alliance of ' corporate liberal ' Big Business and media elites , who , through big government , have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass . " Rothbard blamed this " Underclass " for " looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America . " Rothbard noted that David Duke 's substantive political program in a Louisiana governor 's race had " nothing " in it that " could not also be embraced by <unk> or paleo @-@ libertarians ; lower taxes , dismantling the bureaucracy , slashing the welfare system , attacking affirmative action and racial set @-@ asides , calling for equal rights for all Americans , including whites . " 
 Rothbard supported the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan in 1992 , and wrote that " with Pat Buchanan as our leader , we shall break the clock of social democracy . " When Buchanan dropped out of the Republican primary race , Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot , who Rothbard wrote had " brought an excitement , a verve , a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race . " Rothbard ultimately supported George Bush over Bill Clinton in the 1992 election . 
 Like Buchanan , Rothbard opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) . However , by 1995 , Rothbard had become disillusioned with Buchanan , believing that the latter 's " commitment to protectionism was mutating into an all @-@ round faith in economic planning and the nation state . " 
 After Rothbard 's death in 1995 Lew Rockwell , President of the von Mises Institute , told The New York Times that Rothbard was " the founder of right @-@ wing anarchism " . William F. Buckley , Jr. wrote a critical obituary in the National Review criticizing Rothbard 's " defective judgment " and views on the Cold War . The Ludwig von Mises Institute published Murray N. Rothbard , In Memoriam which included memorials from 31 individuals , including libertarians and academics . Journalist Brian Doherty summarizes Buckley 's obituary as follows : " when Rothbard died in 1995 , his old pal William Buckley took pen in hand to piss on his grave . " Hoppe , Rockwell and Rothbard 's colleagues at the Mises Institute took a different view , arguing that he was one of the most important philosophers in history .

 = Golden @-@ crowned sifaka = 
 The golden @-@ crowned sifaka or Tattersall 's sifaka ( Propithecus tattersalli ) is a medium @-@ sized lemur characterized by mostly white fur , prominent furry ears , and a golden @-@ orange crown . It is one of the smallest sifakas ( genus Propithecus ) , weighing around 3 @.@ 5 kg ( 7 @.@ 7 lb ) and measuring approximately 90 cm ( 35 in ) from head to tail . Like all sifakas , it is a vertical <unk> and leaper , and its diet includes mostly seeds and leaves . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka is named after its discoverer , Ian Tattersall , who first spotted the species in 1974 . However , it was not formally described until 1988 , after a research team led by Elwyn L. Simons observed and captured some specimens for captive breeding . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka most closely resembles the western forest sifakas of the P. verreauxi group , yet its karyotype suggests a closer relationship with the P. diadema group of eastern forest sifakas . Despite the similarities with both groups , more recent studies of its karyotype support its classification as a distinct species . 
 Found in gallery , deciduous , and semi @-@ evergreen forest , its restricted range includes 44 forest fragments , totaling an area of 44 @,@ 125 hectares ( 109 @,@ 040 acres ; 170 @.@ 37 sq mi ) , centered on the town of Daraina in northeast Madagascar . Its estimated population is 18 @,@ 000 individuals . It is primarily active during the day , although it also tends to be active at dawn and dusk during the rainy season . It sleeps in tall emergent trees and is preyed upon by the fossa . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka lives in groups of around five to six individuals , containing a balanced number of adult males and females . Scent is used to mark territories , which are defended by growling , chasing , and ritualistic leaping displays . Reproduction is seasonal , with gestation lasting six months and lactation lasting five months . Infants are weaned during the wet season to ensure the best chances of survival . 
 The small range and fragmented populations of this species weigh heavily on its survival . Forest fragmentation , habitat destruction , poaching , slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture , and other human factors threaten its existence . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka is listed by the IUCN Red List as Endangered . Its range was originally not covered by any national parks or protected areas in Madagascar , but a new protected area was established in 2005 to include a 20 @,@ 000 ha ( 49 @,@ 000 acres ; 77 sq mi ) portion . Attempts have been made to keep the golden @-@ crowned sifaka in captivity at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham , North Carolina . The small colony was maintained from 1988 to 2008 . In Madagascar , lawlessness resulting from the 2009 political coup led to increased poaching of this species , and many were sold to local restaurants as a delicacy . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The golden @-@ crowned or Tattersall 's sifaka ( Propithecus tattersalli ) , known locally as <unk> <unk> ( or <unk> <unk> , meaning " white lemur " ) , was discovered in 1974 north of Vohemar in northeast Madagascar by Ian Tattersall , who observed but did not capture the animal . Unsure of its classification , Tattersall provisionally considered it a variant of the silky sifaka in his 1982 book , The Primates of Madagascar , citing its mostly off @-@ white to yellowish fur , but also noting its uncharacteristic orange crown patch and tufted ears . Driven by a report in 1986 that the forest where Tattersall had observed this unique sifaka was contracted to be clear @-@ cut for charcoal production , a research team from the Duke Lemur Center , led by Elwyn L. Simons , obtained permits to capture specimens for a captive breeding program . Simons and his team were the first to capture and observe the golden @-@ crowned sifaka , formally describing it as a new species in 1988 and naming it in honor of Tattersall . The specimens were found 6 to 7 km ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 3 mi ) northeast of Daraina , a village in the northeast corner of Madagascar . 
 There have been conflicting studies regarding the taxonomic status of the golden @-@ crowned sifaka . When described by Simons in 1988 , size , vocalizations , and karyotypes ( the number and appearance of chromosomes ) were compared with the other sifakas . In terms of size , general morphology , and vocalizations , the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is more comparable to the western forest sifakas ( known as the P. verreauxi group ) in that it is smaller in length and weight . Its karyotype , however , is more similar to that of the eastern forest sifakas ( known as the P. diadema group ) . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka has 42 chromosomes ( 2n = 42 ) , 16 of which are autosomal pairs ( not sex chromosomes ) that are <unk> or submetacentric ( where chromosome arms are equal or unequal in length , respectively ) . The remaining autosomal pairs are smaller and acrocentric ( with the shorter chromosome arm difficult to observe ) . Its X chromosome is metacentric , which is comparable to that of the P. diadema group , not the P. verreauxi group . Given the conflicting information , its geographic isolation , as well as the unique long fur tufts on the ears — a trait not shared by any other sifaka — the golden @-@ crowned sifaka was recognized as a distinct species . 
 In 1997 , comparisons of repeated DNA sequences within the family Indriidae supported Simon 's classification , placing the golden @-@ crowned sifaka as a sister group to the other sifakas . In 2001 , a study involving mitochondrial DNA suggested a very recent divergence between it and the Coquerel 's sifaka , then considered a subspecies of the P. verreauxi group . If this were true , the golden @-@ crowned sifaka would not merit species status and would form a subclade with the Coquerel 's sifaka within the P. verreauxi group . In 2004 , a comparative study of the karyotypes of the three traditional species of sifakas provided insight into the chromosomal arrangements of all three groups . This study found that the golden @-@ crowned sifaka differs from P. verreauxi group and P. diadema group by 9 and 17 chromosomal rearrangements respectively , and conversely argued that the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is indeed a separate species and is more closely related to the P. verreauxi group . More recently , in 2007 a <unk> ( skull and tooth ) study provided evidence for 9 or 10 distinct sifaka species , including the golden @-@ crowned sifaka . It also placed the golden @-@ crowned sifaka within the P. verreauxi group . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 The golden @-@ crowned sifaka is one of the smallest sifaka species with a weight of 3 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 6 kg ( 7 @.@ 5 to 7 @.@ 9 lb ) , a head @-@ body length of 45 to 47 cm ( 18 to 19 in ) , a tail length of 42 to 47 cm ( 17 to 19 in ) , and total length of 87 to 94 cm ( 34 to 37 in ) . It is comparable in size to the sifakas inhabiting the southern and western dry forests , such as Coquerel 's sifaka , the crowned sifaka , Von der <unk> 's sifaka , and Verreaux 's sifaka . It has a coat of moderately long , creamy @-@ white fur with a golden tint , dark black or chocolate @-@ brown fur on its neck and throat , pale orange fur on the tops of its legs and forelimbs , a white tail and hindlimbs , and a characteristic bright orange @-@ gold crown . It is the only sifaka with prominent tufts of white fur protruding from its ears , making its head appear somewhat triangular and distinctive in appearance . Its eyes are orange , and its face is black and mostly hairless , with dark gray @-@ black fur with white hairs stretching from beneath the eyes to the cheeks . Its snout is blunt and rounded , and its broad nose helps to distinguish it from other sifakas . Occasionally the bridge of the nose will have a patch of white fur . Similar to other sifakas , this arboreal animal has long , strong legs that enable it to cling and leap between tree trunks and branches . 
 = = Geographic range and habitat = = 
 The golden @-@ crowned sifaka lives in dry deciduous , gallery , and semi @-@ evergreen forests and is found at altitudes up to 500 m ( 1 @,@ 640 ft ) , though it seems to prefer lower elevations . Surveys have shown it to be limited to highly fragmented forests surrounding the town of Daraina in an area encircled by the <unk> and <unk> rivers in northeastern Madagascar . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka has one of the smallest geographic ranges of all indriid lemur species . Out of 75 forest fragments studied by researchers , its presence could be definitively reported in only 44 , totaling 44 @,@ 125 ha ( 109 @,@ 040 acres ; 170 @.@ 37 sq mi ) . This study , published in 2002 , also estimated the total species population and observed population densities . Home range size varied between 0 @.@ 18 and 0 @.@ 29 km2 ( 0 @.@ 069 and 0 @.@ 112 sq mi ) per group . With an average group size of five individuals , the population density ranged between 17 and 28 individuals per km2 . Another home range size estimate of 0 @.@ 09 to 0 @.@ 12 km2 ( 0 @.@ 035 to 0 @.@ 046 sq mi ) has also been suggested with a population density range of 10 and 23 individuals per km2 . The forested area available to the species within its desired elevation range was estimated at 360 km2 ( 140 sq mi ) , yielding an estimated population of 6 @,@ 120 – 10 @,@ 080 and a breeding population between 2 @,@ 520 and 3 @,@ 960 individuals . However , a study published in 2010 using line transect data from 2006 and 2008 in five major forest fragments yielded an estimated population of 18 @,@ 000 individuals . 
 The species is sympatric ( coexists ) with two other medium @-@ sized lemurs : the Sanford 's brown lemur ( Eulemur <unk> ) and the crowned lemur ( Eulemur coronatus ) . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The golden @-@ crowned sifaka is primarily active during the day ( diurnal ) , but researchers have witnessed activity in the early morning and evening ( crepuscular ) during the rainy season ( November through April ) . In captivity , it has been observed feeding at night , unlike captive Verreaux 's sifakas . It travels between 461 @.@ 7 and 1 @,@ 077 m ( 1 @,@ 515 and 3 @,@ 533 ft ) per day , an intermediate range compared to other sifakas of the eastern forests . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka can be observed feeding and resting higher in the canopy during the dry season ( May through October ) . It sleeps in the taller trees ( the emergent layer ) of the forest at night . 
 When stressed , the golden @-@ crowned sifaka emits grunting vocalizations as well as repeated " churrs " that escalate into a high @-@ amplitude " <unk> . " Its ground predator alarm call , which sounds like " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , closely resembles that of Verreaux 's sifaka . It also emits mobbing alarm calls in response to birds of prey . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The diet of the golden @-@ crowned sifaka consists of a wide variety of plants — as many as 80 species — whose availability varies based on the season . It is a seed predator , making seeds a year @-@ round staple in its diet when available . The golden @-@ crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits , flowers , and leaves . One study showed a diet composition of 37 % unripe fruit and seeds , 22 % immature leaves , 17 % mature leaves , 13 % flowers , and 9 % fruit pulp . Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season . In general , approximately 60 % of its diet consists of unripe fruits and seed , mainly from leguminous pods , and less than 50 % consists of leaves . At Daraina , it has been observed feeding on the <unk> tree ( <unk> <unk> ) and on mango trees . Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available , in the early wet season . Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available . Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy , feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling . Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations , suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins . 
 A study in 1993 showed variability and flexibility in feeding preferences between three research sites around Daraina . Plant species preferences ( measured in feeding time ) changed between wetter , intermediate , and drier forests : 
 = = = Social organization = = = 
 The social structure of the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is very similar to that of Verreaux 's sifaka , both averaging between five and six individuals per group , with a range between three and ten . Unlike the Verreaux 's sifaka , group sex ratios are more evenly balanced , consisting of two or more members of both sexes . Females are dominant within the group , and only one female breeds successfully each season . Males will roam between groups during the mating season . 
 Because of their smaller home ranges relative to other sifakas , group encounters are slightly more common , occurring a few times a month . It has been noted that the temperament of the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is more volatile than that of other sifaka species and , in the case of a dispute , this animal frequently emits a grunt @-@ like vocalization that seems to signal annoyance . Aggressive interactions between groups are generally non @-@ physical but include loud growling , territorial marking , chasing , and ritualistic leaping displays . Same @-@ sexed individuals act most aggressively towards each other during such encounters . Scent marking is the most common form of territorial defense , with scent marks acting as " signposts " to demarcate territorial boundaries . Females use glands in the genital regions ( " anogenital " ) while males use both anogenital and chest glands . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The golden @-@ crowned sifaka is a seasonal breeder , often mating during the last week of January . Its gestation period is a little less than six months , and its lactation period is five months . Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality . Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season ( late January ) , and continues for approximately 170 days . Parturition occurs in the middle of the dry season ( late June or July ) . Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season , in December , when an abundance of immature leaves is available . It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period . 
 Females reproduce once every two years . Infants are born with little hair and initially cling to their mother 's belly . As they mature , they begin to ride on her back . Following weaning , riding on the back is only tolerated for short durations , particularly when the group is alerted to the presence of a predator . By one year of age , the juveniles are 70 % of their full adult body weight . Infant mortality is high in this species . Upon reaching sexual maturity , males leave their natal group and transfer to neighboring social groups . Observations by researchers and reports from local people indicate that this species will jump to the ground and cross more than 200 m ( 660 ft ) of grassland to reach nearby forest patches . This suggests that forest fragmentation may not completely isolate separated populations . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 The only predator known to target this species is the fossa , although the golden @-@ crowned sifaka reacts to the presence of birds of prey with alarm calls . A hematology and serum chemistry study published in 1995 revealed that 59 % of the wild golden @-@ crowned sifakas sampled were infected with a <unk> parasite , a potentially unknown species of nematode in the genus <unk> . Healthy , infected individuals did not appear to be adversely affected by the infestation , but the overall effect on the dwindling population is unknown . Also , no malarial or intestinal parasites were found , although 48 % of the golden @-@ crowned sifakas examined had external ear mites . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 While the golden @-@ crowned sifaka faces few biological threats , such as predation , it faces many significant human @-@ caused ( anthropogenic ) threats . Its habitat has been highly fragmented , with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands . By 1985 it was estimated that 34 % of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared , and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of deforestation there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020 . Illegal logging practices , slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture ( known as tavy ) , uncontrolled grass fires , gold mining , poaching , and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species . 
 Malagasy farmers continue to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock , promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration . The fires sometimes burn out of control and destroy forest edges along with the natural flora , increasing the damage even further than intended . Due to the nature of Madagascar 's geology and soil , tavy also depletes the fertility of the soil , accelerating the crop rotation rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests . 
 Although coal is the preferred cooking fuel of the Malagasy people , the most affordable and prominent source of energy is timber , known as <unk> . Wood is also used as a primary building material , only adding further incentive to remove trees from the forest . With the depletion of dead wood from the forest patches , the people have begun to remove young , healthy trees . This is seen most commonly in areas closest to villages . Although the shapes and sizes of forest fragments around the Daraina region have been mostly stable for 50 years prior to a study in 2002 , the six years preceding the study had seen 5 % of the small- to medium @-@ sized forest fragments disappear due to increased human encroachment . 
 A newly emergent threat facing the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners moving into the region 's forests . Although mining operations are small scale , the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees , disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing the trees in the area . The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure . Although the species is protected from hunting by local fady ( taboo ) around Daraina , due to their likeness to humans , and by Malagasy law , the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden @-@ crowned sifaka as a source of bushmeat . In 1993 , David M. Meyers , a researcher who has studied the golden @-@ crowned sifaka , speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate , the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans . Indeed , bushmeat hunting by people from nearby Ambilobe has already extirpated at least one isolated population . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Because studies have shown that the golden @-@ crowned sifaka are most likely to be found in large forest fragments ( greater than 1 @,@ 000 ha ( 2 @,@ 500 acres ; 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) ) , the species is thought to be sensitive to forest fragmentation and degradation . However , since it has been found around gold mining camps and degraded forests , it is not restricted to undisturbed forests and appears to tolerate human activity . Regardless , with its low population , highly restricted range , and badly fragmented habitat , the prospect for survival for the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is considered bleak . For these reasons , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) added it to its list of the 25 most endangered primates in 1997 . Previously , in 1992 , the IUCN 's Species Survival Commission ( IUCN / SSC ) Primate Specialist Group also assigned the species its highest priority rating . As of its 2008 assessment , the golden @-@ crowned sifaka was downgraded from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List . In its four previous assessments , it was listed as Critically Endangered in 1996 and 2000 and Endangered in 1990 and 1994 . 
 The area inhabited by the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is also an important agricultural and economical resource for the human population . Suggested conservation action aimed at protecting this species and its habitat has focused on offering varying degrees of protection to forest fragments in the region , allowing human activity and resource extraction in areas that have less conservation potential while strictly protecting areas critical to the species ' survival . In 2002 , none of the forested areas that the golden @-@ crowned sifaka inhabits were part of a formally protected national park or reserve . A conservation study from 1989 called for the creation of a national park that includes the forest of <unk> as well as the dry forests to the north of Daraina . A more recent study from 2002 proposed a network of protected forest areas including areas outside of the village of Daraina , forests north of the <unk> River , and the northern forests that constitute the species ' northern reservoir . In 2005 , Fanamby , a Malagasy non @-@ governmental organization ( NGO ) , teamed up with Conservation International to create a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ hectare ( 49 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ; 77 sq mi ) protected area that both Association Fanamby and the Ministry of Water and Forests manage . As of 2008 , only ten forest patches that could support viable populations remained , according to the IUCN . 
 Only one captive population of golden @-@ crowned sifakas has been represented in a zoological collection . Building on a successful record of maintaining a viable captive Verreaux 's sifaka population , the Duke Lemur Center ( DLC ) in Durham , North Carolina , requested and obtained permission from the government of Madagascar to capture and export this ( then ) unknown species for captive breeding . Plans were also made to establish a captive breeding program at the Ivoloina Forestry Station , now known as Parc Ivoloina . In November 1987 , during the same expedition that resulted in the formal description of the species , two males and two females were caught and measured . Five others were also caught , but were released because they were juvenile males . In July 1988 , a golden @-@ crowned sifaka was born in captivity at the DLC . However , the captive population was small and not viable for long @-@ term breeding , and captive sifakas have proven difficult to maintain due to their specialized dietary needs . The last captive individual died in 2008 . Despite the loss of its small colony after 20 years , DLC believes that establishment of a captive population for conservation @-@ oriented captive breeding purposes could provide an important second level of protection , particularly if habitat protection measures are unsuccessful . 
 = = = Effects of the 2009 political crisis = = = 
 As a result of the political crisis that began in 2009 and the resulting breakdown of law and order in Madagascar , poachers have hunted lemurs in the Daraina area and sold them to local restaurants as a delicacy . Pictures of dead lemurs that had been smoked for transport were taken by Fanamby and released by Conservation International in August 2009 . The lemurs in the photographs included the endangered golden @-@ crowned sifaka , as well as crowned lemurs . Around the time the photographs were released , 15 people were arrested for selling smoked lemurs , which were bought from hunters for 1 @,@ 000 ariary , or around US $ 0 @.@ 53 , and then sold in restaurants for 8 @,@ 000 ariary ( US $ 4 @.@ 20 ) . Russell Mittermeier , president of Conservation International , said that the arrests would not end the poaching since the poachers would " just get slaps on the wrist " . 
 = Artemis Fowl ( novel ) = 
 Artemis Fowl is a young @-@ adult fantasy novel written by Irish author Eoin Colfer . It is the first book in the Artemis Fowl series , followed by Artemis Fowl : The Arctic Incident . Described by its author as " Die Hard with fairies " , it follows the adventures of Artemis Fowl , a twelve @-@ year @-@ old criminal mastermind , as he kidnaps a fairy for a large ransom of gold . 
 Throughout the book , the third @-@ person narration switches from following the human characters to following the fairy characters to present underlying themes of greed and conflict . The book received a mostly favourable critical response and several awards . A film adaptation was reported to be in the writing stage in mid @-@ 2008 with Jim Sheridan directing . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Artemis Fowl II is the twelve @-@ year @-@ old son of an Irish crime lord , Artemis Fowl I. He is a child prodigy , who has dedicated his life to criminal activities . He leads the Fowl criminal empire , which has been established by his family for generations . After significant research , Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies . He tracks down an alcoholic sprite posing as a healer in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her The Book of the People — the Fairy holy book that is written in <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , Captain Holly Short of the Lower Elements Police is tracking a rogue troll that has managed to reach the surface of the Earth from Haven city , thousands of feet underground . Assisted by the technically minded centaur Foaly and <unk> commander Julius Root , she incapacitates the troll . 
 Artemis decodes the Book using translating software , and in the process , learns the specifics of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic : take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a bend in a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere . Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible locations for the ritual and start a stakeout , they discover Holly performing the ritual . Butler tranquilizes Holly with a hypodermic dart gun . 
 A LEP retrieval team is sent to scout Fowl Manor . Using their ' shielding ' ability , which allows them to vibrate faster than the human eye can follow , the team enters the manor grounds . Artemis had anticipated this , however , and installed a camera with a high frames @-@ per @-@ second rate , allowing him to detect the threat by freezing the image . After Butler incapacitates the intruders , Root decides to lay siege to Fowl Manor using a time @-@ stop and enter negotiations . Artemis reveals the ransom demand : one metric ton of 24 @-@ carat gold . Artemis also reveals his knowledge of the time @-@ stop and claims that he can escape it . An analysis by LEP behavior experts determines that Artemis is telling the truth . 
 The attempts to gain entry to the manor continue as the LEP recruit an infamous criminal , the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch <unk> to break in . Fairies are forbidden from entering human dwellings without permission , but Mulch has broken this rule so many times that he is immune to the adverse consequences . He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system , allowing Mulch to freely explore . Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis ' copy of the Book , finally revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis ' knowledge , which he had led them to believe he had acquired form a truth serum administered to Holly . The Fairy Council , deciding that nothing is working , promotes a lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to Acting Commander , temporarily usurping Julius Root . Meanwhile , Holly Short cracks through the concrete of her cell , finding fresh dirt , and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn . Having regained her magic , she escapes into the main house . 
 Cudgeon decides to release the troll Holly captured earlier into the mansion to force Artemis to allow the fairies to enter and subdue the troll . This backfires , as Butler , aided by Holly 's healing powers , defeats the troll . The Fairy Council subsequently strips Cudgeon of his post . 
 Artemis is finally granted the ransom . The gold is sent in , and Artemis asks Holly for a wish : to cure his mother 's insanity — she has been living in her bedroom , driven mad by the loss of her husband . Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold . The LEP decides to send in a ' blue rinse ' – a biological bomb that kills all organic life — to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold , but this fails when Artemis escapes the time @-@ stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills . 
 Having survived until the end of the time stop , the LEP is bound by law and leaves the remaining gold and departs . At the end , Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills . Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales , in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies , and had guessed that time @-@ stops were the reason . Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly 's magic . 
 = = Major characters = = 
 Artemis Fowl II – The protagonist ; a 12 @-@ year @-@ old genius , he uses his intelligence to obtain massive wealth through various illegal business ventures ; this stems from his family , who have been criminals for generations . While he seems cold and distant at the beginning , his character develops throughout , and he shows remorse , guilt , and passion for his family at the end . 
 Butler – The Fowl 's best manservant and Artemis ' bodyguard but also Artemis ' friend and accomplice , despite this trait being against his training . He is only referred to as " Butler , " that being his family name and the origin of the actual term " butler " . His first name is not revealed , but in Artemis Fowl : The Eternity Code , it is revealed as " <unk> . " 
 Captain Holly Short – A determined , forthright elf and the first female captain of <unk> . Compassionate and caring , she goes as far as healing Butler from fatal wounds sustained fighting a troll , even though he has been integral in the plan to hold her hostage — this act is the first step to changing Artemis ' attitude and conscience . 
 Commander Julius Root – Known as " <unk> " by fellow fairies for his characteristic red face , he is Holly Short 's superior officer . A father figure to the other fairies , and especially Holly , he is distressed at her disappearance , as seen in his conversation with Artemis in the whaling ship : " If you 've harmed one tip of my officer 's pointy ears ... " . 
 Foaly – The LEP 's technical advisor . Portrayed as brilliant and sarcastic , he is described as " having few friends . " He has invented several technological innovations eons ahead of human technology , such as the time @-@ stop used in the siege of Fowl Manor and provides the other characters with numerous high @-@ tech gadgets . 
 Mulch <unk> – A kleptomaniac dwarf whom the LEP recruits use to gain access to Fowl Manor during the siege , due to his many hereditary abilities , such as tunneling at unbelievable speeds . Having forfeited his magic years ago to allow him to follow a life of crime , he is immune to the restrictions of the Book of the People . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Artemis Fowl has a number of underlying themes , but the most essential of these are greed and the conflict between good and evil . 
 Greed is the first main theme that is introduced into the book , and specifically the desire to obtain gold . In a similar manner to other themes in the book , it changes throughout , becoming less of a focus near to the end of the novel , where Artemis is willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else . 
 The idea of conflict between good and evil is one that is touched upon in the book in a light hearted manner . Although Artemis sees himself as an evil genius at the beginning of the book , and is portrayed as such , the end of the story contradicts this image when he pays the fairies to help his mother . Artemis ' enemies , the fairies , would be " the good side " , but their actions call this view into question — they are as determined as Artemis is , to achieve their goals , and while only some of them are willing to ruthlessly deploy a troll , regardless of the possible danger to life , all are willing to utilize a bio @-@ bomb once Holly is out of the mansion to force Artemis into submission . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 In general , the book received a very positive critical response – in 2004 it received the Young Reader 's Choice Award and Garden State Teen Book Award , among other awards . 
 The New York Post said " Artemis Fowl is great ... a new thriller fairy tale that will grab your interest , no matter your age . " and the Library Journal said " Fun to read , full of action and humour , this is recommended for all public libraries and to readers of all ages . " Time.com said , " Artemis Fowl is pacy , playful , and very funny , an inventive mix of myth and modernity , magic and crime , " while The New York Times Book Review said that " Colfer has done enormously , explosively well . " 
 Kate Kellaway of The Observer called the book " a smart , amusing one @-@ off . It flashes with hi @-@ tech invention – as if Colfer were as much an inspired boffin as a writer . " The Amazon.com official review highly complimented the book , saying " Fantastic stuff from beginning to end , Artemis Fowl is a rip @-@ roaring , 21st century romp of the highest order . " 
 However , another Time Magazine review criticized the " abysmal " writing and the characterization , calling Artemis ' character " repellent in almost every regard . " It concluded that Artemis Fowl is " an awkward , calculated , humorless and mean @-@ spirited book . " USA Today 's review concluded : " All the familiar action @-@ flick clichés are trotted out : the backstabbing , politically astute subordinate ; the seemingly loony but loyal computer expert ; the dabs of family loyalty ; the requisite happy ending ; the utterly unsubtle plugs for the sequel ; the big action scenes . ... Resist the hype , parents , booksellers and librarians . This is not the new Harry Potter , nor is it a good children 's book . "

 In 2001 plans were announced for a film adaptation of the series . Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights , with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct . In 2003 Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year , but expressed scepticism over whether or not this would come to pass . The film remained in development and was assumed to be in development hell until 2011 , when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie . In July 2013 , it was announced that Disney and Harvey Weinstein are developing a project based on the first and second installment of the Artemis Fowl series . Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal will be the executive producers . 
 Artemis Fowl : The Graphic Novel is a graphic novel based on the book . Written by Colfer and adapted by Andrew Donkin , the graphic novel was released on 2 October 2007 . The plot remains the same as the book 's except some minor details . Some characters ' appearances differed from their description in the book ; Holly Short 's hair is longer than described in the book and a darker brown , as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book . Haven City 's roof is stalactites and rock as opposed to the computer @-@ generated sky described by the book . The graphic novel does not contain many word balloons , showing each character 's story in first @-@ person . Graphic novels for subsequent books in the series were released in 2009 , 2013 , and 2014 .

 = French cruiser Bruix = 
 Bruix was one of four Amiral Charner @-@ class armored cruisers built for the French Navy in the 1890s . She served in the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean , and in the Far East before World War I. In 1902 she aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique and spent several years as guardship at Crete , protecting French interests in the region in the early 1910s . 
 At the beginning of the war in August 1914 , Bruix was assigned to protect troop convoys from French North Africa to France before she was transferred to the Atlantic to support Allied operations against the German colony of Kamerun in September . She was briefly assigned to support Allied operations in the Dardanelles in early 1915 before she began patrolling the Aegean Sea and Greek territorial waters . 
 The ship was decommissioned in Greece at the beginning of 1918 and recommissioned after the end of the war in November for service in the Black Sea against the Bolsheviks . Bruix returned home later in 1919 and was reduced to reserve before she was sold for scrap in 1921 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Amiral Charner @-@ class ships were designed to be smaller and cheaper than the preceding armored cruiser design , the Dupuy de Lôme . Like the older ship , they were intended to fill the commerce @-@ raiding strategy of the Jeune École . 
 The ship measured 106 @.@ 12 meters ( 348 ft 2 in ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 14 @.@ 04 meters ( 46 ft 1 in ) . Bruix had a forward draft of 5 @.@ 55 meters ( 18 ft 3 in ) and drew 6 @.@ 06 meters ( 19 ft 11 in ) aft . She displaced 4 @,@ 748 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 673 long tons ) at normal load and 4 @,@ 990 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 910 long tons ) at deep load . 
 The Amiral Charner class had two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was provided by 16 Belleville boilers and they were rated at a total of 9 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 6 @,@ 600 kW ) using forced draught . Bruix had a designed speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but only reached a maximum speed of 18 @.@ 37 knots ( 34 @.@ 02 km / h ; 21 @.@ 14 mph ) from 9 @,@ 107 metric horsepower ( 6 @,@ 698 kW ) during sea trials on 15 September 1896 . The ship carried up to 535 metric tons ( 527 long tons ; 590 short tons ) of coal and could steam for 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ships of the Amiral Charner class had a main armament that consisted of two Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1887 guns that were mounted in single gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Their secondary armament comprised six Canon de 138 @.@ 6 mm Modèle 1887 guns , each in single gun turrets on each broadside . For anti @-@ torpedo boat defense , they carried four 65 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) guns , four 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) and eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) five @-@ barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns . They were also armed with four 450 @-@ millimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) pivoting torpedo tubes ; two mounted on each broadside above water . 
 The side of the Amiral Charner class was generally protected by 92 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 6 in ) of steel armor , from 1 @.@ 3 meters ( 4 ft 3 in ) below the waterline to 2 @.@ 5 meters ( 8 ft 2 in ) above it . The bottom 20 centimeters ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) tapered in thickness and the armor at the ends of the ships thinned to 60 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) . The curved protective deck had a thickness of 40 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) along its centerline that increased to 50 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) at its outer edges . Protecting the boiler rooms , engine rooms , and magazines below it was a thin splinter deck . A watertight internal cofferdam , filled with cellulose , ran the length of the ship from the protective deck to a height of 1 @.@ 2 meters ( 4 ft ) above the waterline . The ship 's conning tower and turrets were protected by 92 millimeters of armor . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Bruix , named after Admiral Étienne Eustache Bruix , was laid down at the Arsenal de Rochefort on 9 November 1891 . She was launched on 2 August 1894 and commissioned for trials on 15 April 1896 . The ship was temporarily assigned to the Northern Squadron ( Escadre du Nord ) on 24 November for the visit of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his wife to Dunkerque on 5 – 9 October . The ship 's steering broke down on 7 October and she had to return to Rochefort for repairs . Trials lasted until early December and Bruix was officially commissioned on 15 December and assigned to the Northern Squadron . 
 On 18 August 1897 , together with the protected cruiser Surcouf , she escorted the armored cruiser Pothuau that carried President Félix Faure on a state visit to Russia . Shortly after departure , Bruix fractured a piston rod in her port engine which forced her to return to port . Her repairs and armament trials lasted until January 1898 , although the last of the trials was not completed until 25 February . Bruix was then assigned to the Far Eastern Squadron where she was based at Saigon , French Indochina until October , although she made a port visit to Manila , the Philippines , on 5 May after the American victory in the Battle of Manila Bay . While returning home in November , she damaged her starboard propeller on the 20th while transiting the Suez Canal . The ship reached Toulon on the 28th and was under repair until January 1899 before rejoining the Northern Squadron on 3 February . 
 Bruix made port visits in Spain and Portugal in June before another piston rod was damaged on the 7th . She began a refit on 20 September that lasted until 4 November that modified her for service as a flagship . On 20 November the ship became the flagship of a cruiser division . In 1901 she participated in the annual fleet maneuvers with the rest of the Northern Squadron . During this training the British steamer SS Paddington collided with the ship , lightly damaging the plating of her armored ram on 27 June . Bilge keels were fitted to Bruix in November – December and she remained at the dockyard until 10 January 1902 to evaluate the operation of her turrets . The ship was assigned to the Atlantic Division in April and visited several Spanish ports during the month and into May . 
 After the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on 5 May , Bruix , now the flagship of Rear Admiral ( contre @-@ amiral ) Palma Gourdon , was ordered to Fort @-@ de @-@ France to render assistance to the survivors where she remained until 19 August . On 30 November Rear Admiral Joseph <unk> hoisted his flag aboard Bruix . The ship spent most of the next several years either commissioned with a reduced complement or assigned to the reserve . The ship was reactivated in late 1906 for service with the Far Eastern Squadron and departed Toulon on 15 November , accompanied by her sister ship Chanzy . They arrived at Saigon on 10 January 1907 and Bruix was in Nagasaki , Japan when Chanzy ran aground off the Chinese coast on 20 May . The ship then participated in the unsuccessful effort to rescue her sister . Bruix spent most of her tour in the Far East showing the flag in Russia , China and Japan and departed for home on 26 April 1909 . While passing through the Suez Canal , she accidentally collided with the Italian steamer SS Nilo before arriving at Toulon on 2 August . She began an overhaul several weeks later that that was repeatedly delayed by labor shortages at the dockyard . She was finally towed to the dockyard at Bizerte , in French North Africa , in June 1911 and her overhaul was completed in January 1912 . 
 Briefly assigned to the reserve , Bruix was recommissioned on 13 May for service with the Levant Division as the guardship for Crete . She relieved her sister Amiral Charner at Souda Bay on 9 July and spent the next two years in the Levant . During the Italo @-@ Turkish War , her captain protested the bombardment of fleeing Turkish troops near the port of <unk> on 3 October by the protected cruiser Coatit as a breach of international law . On 8 November the ship assisted in the refloating of the Russian protected cruiser Oleg . Although formally assigned to the Tunisian Squadron on 13 January 1913 , Bruix remained in the Levant . Later in the year , she assisted in the salvage of the steamer SS Sénégal that had struck a mine at Smyrna , Turkey , that had been laid by the Italians during the war . In March 1914 Bruix escorted William , Prince of Albania during his voyage from Trieste to Durazzo , Albania to take up his throne . The ship returned to Bizerta on 25 April 1914 and began a refit that lasted until July . 
 When World War I began in August , she was assigned to escort convoys between Morocco and France and general patrols together with her sisters Latouche @-@ Tréville and Amiral Charner . Bruix was sent to support the Allied campaign against Kamerun in September and bombarded several small towns as part of her contribution before returning home later in the year . After several short refits , Bruix was assigned to the Dardanelles squadron in February 1915 although the ship spent most of her time patrolling the Aegean . On 31 January 1918 , she was placed in reserve at Salonika . Bruix was recommissioned on 29 November and transferred to Constantinople where she was assigned to the armored cruiser division of the 2nd Squadron on 2 December . Between March and May 1919 she patrolled the Black Sea as part of the Allied intervention against the Bolsheviks and took part in the evacuation of German and Allied troops from Nikolaev , Ukraine in March and from Odessa in April . Her crew did not participate in the mutiny that occurred aboard some French ships in Sevastopol , Crimea in April . Bruix departed the Black Sea for Constantinople on 5 May and then sailed for Toulon on 22 May where she was assigned to the reserve upon arrival . Proposals that she be converted into an accommodation ship or a merchant ship were judged impractical and she was stricken from the Navy List on 21 June 1920 . Bruix was sold for scrap a year later , to the day , together with two other obsolete warships , for the price of 436 @,@ 000 francs .

 = Brook Farm = 
 Brook Farm , also called the Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education or the Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education , was a utopian experiment in communal living in the United States in the 1840s . It was founded by former Unitarian minister George Ripley and his wife Sophia Ripley at the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury , Massachusetts ( 9 miles outside of downtown Boston ) in 1841 and was inspired in part by the ideals of Transcendentalism , a religious and cultural philosophy based in New England . Founded as a joint stock company , it promised its participants a portion of the profits from the farm in exchange for performing an equal share of the work . Brook Farmers believed that by sharing the workload , ample time would be available for leisure activities and intellectual pursuits . 
 Life on Brook Farm was based on balancing labor and leisure while working together for the benefit of the greater community . Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally , including women . Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm . The main source of income was the school , which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley . A pre @-@ school , primary school , and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education . Adult education was also offered . 
 The community was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits . By 1844 , the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model based on the socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism . Following his vision , the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery . When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire , the community was financially devastated and never recovered . It was fully closed by 1847 . Despite the experimental commune 's failure , many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively . Critics of the commune included Charles Lane , founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands . Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member of Brook Farm , though he was not a strong adherent of the community 's ideals . He later fictionalized his experience in his novel The Blithedale Romance ( 1852 ) . 
 After the community 's failure , the property was operated for most of the next 130 years by a Lutheran organization as first an orphanage , and then a treatment center and school . The buildings of the Transcendentalists were destroyed by fire over the years . In 1988 the State of Massachusetts acquired 148 acres ( 60 ha ) of the farm , which is now operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation as a historic site .

 = = = Planning and background = = = 
 In October 1840 , George Ripley announced to the Transcendental Club that he was planning to form a Utopian community . Brook Farm , as it would be called , was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism ; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits . The experiment was meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world , based on the principles of " industry without drudgery , and true equality without its vulgarity " . At Brook Farm , and as in other communities , physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well @-@ being and health . Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s , though it was the first to be secular . Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society . He predicted : " If wisely executed , it will be a light over this country and this age . If not the sunrise , it will be the morning star . " As more interested people began to take part in planning , Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody . 
 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 Ripley and his wife Sophia formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors . He sold shares of the company $ 500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor . Shareholders were also allowed a single vote in decision @-@ making and several held director positions . The <unk> chose to begin their experiment at a dairy farm owned by Charles and Maria Mayo Ellis in West Roxbury , Massachusetts , near the home of Theodore Parker . They began raising money , including holding a meeting at Peabody 's bookshop to raise $ 10 @,@ 000 for the farm 's initial purchase . The site was eventually purchased on October 11 , 1841 , for $ 10 @,@ 500 @.@ though participants had begun moving in as early as April . The 170 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 69 km2 ) farm about eight miles ( 13 km ) from Boston was described in a pamphlet as a " place of great natural beauty , combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country " . The purchase also covered a neighboring Keith farm , approximately 22 acres ( 89 @,@ 000 m2 ) , " consisting altogether of a farm with dwelling house , barn , and outbuildings thereon situated " . 
 The first major public notice of the community was published in August 1841 . " The Community at West Roxbury , Mass . " was likely written by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody . Though they began with 10 investors , eventually some 32 people would become Brook Farmers . Writer and editor Margaret Fuller was invited to Brook Farm and , though she never officially joined the community , she was a frequent visitor , often spending New Year 's Eve there . Ripley received many applications to join the community , especially from people who had little money or those in poor health , but full @-@ fledged membership was granted only to individuals who could afford the $ 500 share of the joint stock company . 
 One of the initial founders of Brook Farm was author Nathaniel Hawthorne . Hawthorne did not particularly agree with the ideals of the experiment , hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife @-@ to @-@ be Sophia Peabody . She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841 , though Hawthorne sent her away . Ripley was aware of Hawthorne 's motivations , and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees , specifically overseeing " Direction of Finance " . After requesting his initial investment be returned , Hawthorne officially resigned from Brook Farm on October 17 , 1842 . He wrote of his displeasure with the community : " even my Custom House experience was not such a <unk> and weariness ; my mind and heart were freer ..... Thank God , my soul is not utterly buried under a dung @-@ heap . " 
 = = = Fourier inspiration = = = 
 In the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in " Associationism " , an early socialist movement based on the work of Charles Fourier . Horace Greeley , a New York newspaper editor , and others began to pressure the Brook Farm experiment to follow more closely the pattern of Charles Fourier at a time when the community was struggling to be self @-@ sufficient . Albert Brisbane , whose book The Social Destiny of Man ( 1840 ) had been an inspiration to Ripley , paid Greeley $ 500 for permission to publish a front @-@ page column in the New York Tribune which ran in several parts from March 1842 to September 1843 . Brisbane argued in the series , titled " Association : or , Principles of a True Organization of Society " , how Fourier 's theories could be applied in the United States . Brisbane published similar articles in 1842 in The Dial , the journal of the Transcendentalists . Fourier 's societal vision included elaborate plans for specific structures and highly organized roles of its members . He called this system for an ideal community a " Phalanx " . 
 To meet this vision , now under the name " Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education " , Brook Farmers committed themselves to constructing an ambitious communal building known as the Phalanstery . Construction began in the summer of 1844 and the structure would provide accommodations for 14 families and single people as well . It was planned to be 175 feet ( 53 m ) by 40 feet ( 12 m ) and include , as Ripley described , " a large and commodious kitchen , a dining @-@ hall capable of seating from three to four hundred persons , two public saloons , and a spacious hall or lecture room " . 
 Ripley and two associates created a new constitution for Brook Farm in 1844 , beginning the experiment 's attempts to follow closely Fourier 's Phalanx system . Many Brook Farmers supported the transition ; at a dinner in honor of Fourier 's birthday , one member of the group proposed a toast to " Fourier , the second coming of Christ " . Others , however , did not share in the enthusiasm and some left the commune altogether . One of those who left was Isaac Hecker , who converted to Catholicism and went on to become the founder of the first American @-@ based order of priests , the <unk> Fathers , in 1858 . In particular , many Brook Farmers thought the new model was too rigid and structured and too different from the carefree aspects that they had been attracted to . Both supporters and detractors referred to the early part of Brook Farm 's history as the " Transcendental days " . Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community . 
 In the last few months of 1844 , Brook Farmers were offered the possibility of taking over two Associationism @-@ inspired publications , Brisbane 's The Phalanx and John Allen 's The Social Reformer . Four printers were part of Brook Farm at the time and members of the community believed it would elevate their status as leaders of the movement as well as provide additional income . Ultimately , the Brook Farmers published a new journal combining the two , The Harbinger . The journal 's first issue was published June 14 , 1845 , and was continuously printed , originally weekly , until October 1847 , when it was relocated to New York City , still under the oversight of George Ripley and fellow Brook Farmer Charles Anderson Dana . Naming the publication , however , turned out to be a difficult task . Parke Godwin offered advice when it was suggested to keep the name The Phalanx : 
 Call it the Pilot , the Harbinger , the <unk> , the <unk> , The Worker , the Architect , The Zodiac , The Pleiad , the Iris , the Examiner , The Aurora , the Crown , the Imperial , the Independent , the <unk> , the Light , the Truth , the Hope , the Teacher , the <unk> , the Wedge , the Pirate , the Seer , the Indicator , the Tailor , the Babe in the Manger , the Universe , the Apocalypse , the Red Dragon , the Plant , Beelzebub — the Devil or anything rather than the meaningless name Phalanx . 
 = = = Decline and dissolution = = = 
 Brook Farm began to decline rapidly after its restructuring . In October 1844 , Orestes Brownson visited the site and sensed that " the atmosphere of the place is horrible " . To save money , " <unk> " , or sacrifices , were called for , particularly at the dinner table . Meat , coffee , tea , and butter were no longer offered , though it was agreed that a separate table with meat be allowed in December 1844 . That Thanksgiving , a neighbor had donated a turkey . Many Brook Farmers applied for exceptions to these rules and soon it was agreed that " members of the Association who sit at the meat table shall be charged extra for their board " . Life on Brook Farm was further worsened by an outbreak of smallpox in November 1845 ; though no one died , 26 Brook Farmers were infected . Ripley attempted to quell the financial difficulties by negotiating with creditors and stockholders , who agreed to cancel $ 7 @,@ 000 of debts . 
 Construction on the Phalanstery was progressing well until the evening of March 3 , 1846 , when it was discovered that the Phalanstery had caught fire . Within two hours , the structure had completely burned down ; firefighters from Boston arrived too late . The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney . One participant noted , " Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure ; running across long corridors and up and down the supporting columns of wood , until the huge edifice was a mass of firework " . The financial blow from the loss of the uninsured building was $ 7 @,@ 000 and it marked the beginning of the end of Brook Farm . 
 George Ripley , who had begun the experiment , made an unofficial break with Brook Farm in May 1846 . Many others began to leave as well , though the dissolution of the farm was slow . As one Brook Farmer said , the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground , making it seem " dreamy and unreal " . On November 5 , 1846 , Ripley 's book collection , which had served as Brook Farm 's library , was auctioned to help cover the association 's debts . By the end , Brook Farm had a total debt of $ 17 @,@ 445 . Ripley told a friend , " I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral " . He took a job with the New York Tribune and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt , which he did in 1862 .

 A man named John Plummer purchased the land that was Brook Farm in 1849 before selling it six years later to James Freeman Clarke , who intended to establish another community there . Instead , Clarke offered it to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War and the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training as Camp Andrew . 
 Clarke sold the property in 1868 to two brothers , who used it as a summer boarding house . In 1870 Gottlieb F. Burckhardt purchased the property , after which he formed the Association of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for Works of Mercy to operate an orphanage in The Hive , as the main house on the property was known . The orphanage opened in 1872 and operated until 1943 . In 1948 the Lutherans converted it into a treatment center and school , which closed in 1977 . Parts of the farm were separated in 1873 for use as a cemetery , a use that continues today as an non @-@ denominational cemetery known as the Gardens of <unk> ( as part of St. Joseph 's Cemetery and the Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries ) . During the period of Lutheran ownership the only now extant building , a c . 1890 print shop , was built on the land ; the buildings associated with the Transcendentalists , most recently the Margaret Fuller Cottage , had burned down by the 1980s . 
 In 1988 the Metropolitan District Commission ( since merged with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation , or DCR ) purchased 148 acres ( 0 @.@ 60 km2 ) of the original land . The farm was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965 , a Boston Landmark in 1977 , and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The DCR now operate the state @-@ owned portion as a historic site ; the West Roxbury Historical Society periodically offers tours .

 Brook Farm was named for the brook that ran near the roadside and that eventually went to the Charles River . It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard , quiet groves and denser pine woods . The land , however , turned out to be difficult to farm . 
 The land on the Keith lot that was purchased along with the Ellis farm included a functional farmhouse , which Brook Farmers immediately began calling " The Hive " . The Hive became the center for social activities and was where the people of the community went to eat three meals a day . The Hive 's dining room held fifty people and its library was stocked with George Ripley 's personal book collection which was made available for all community members . 
 As the community grew , it became necessary to add more buildings for lodgings and various activities . The first building constructed was " The Nest " , where school lessons took place and where guests of the farm would stay . Mr. and Mrs. Ripley 's house , later to be called the Eyrie , was built during the second year . The next building to be built was the Margaret Fuller Cottage ; though named after Fuller , she never spent a night there . A participant at Brook Farm named Ichabod Morton built the Pilgrim House , named in honor of his home town of Plymouth , Massachusetts . The 2 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ story building was the third structure built that year and cost nearly $ 5 @,@ 000 to build . Morton stayed there only two weeks before moving out , after which the building was used for general lodging and also held the laundry facilities . The many constructions , including greenhouses and small craft shops , quickly reduced their treasury .

 = = = Work and finances = = = 
 Participants at Brook Farm were also shareholders and were promised five percent of the annual profits or free tuition for one student . In exchange for 300 days of work per year , they were granted free room and board . Members performed whatever work most appealed to them and all , including women , were paid equal wages . The philosophy of labor , according to Ripley , was " to insure a more natural union between intellectual and manual labor than now exists ; to combine the thinker and the worker , as far as possible , in the same individual . " 
 The organization of work in Brook Farm changed over time because of both financial troubles and changes in ideologies . Members of Brook Farm initially participated in an “ attractive industry ” system where each individual could pick his or her work assignments based on their won preferences . This method did not have any specific authority making sure that essential tasks were getting done . After initial leniency , some sensed that not all members were doing their fair share of the labor , so in 1841 the community adopted required standards for work : ten hours of work were required per day during the summer , and eight hours during winter . When Brook Farm first started adopting Fourierist notions , they created a more structured work environment with a system that consisted of three series of industry , which were agriculture , mechanical , and domestic , and within each series there were a number of groups that handled more specific tasks . Each group had a chief whose duty it was to keep a record of the work done . While this system did create a new work hierarchy , the members still had the flexibility to move between groups easily . These new measures caused Brook Farm to achieve a profit in 1844 which was a feat that had not been accomplished in its first few years of the community 's existence . 
 Typical work duties at Brook Farm included chopping wood , bringing in firewood , milking cows , turning a grindstone , and other farming chores . Not all were farmers , however . Some worked in the trades , including making shoes , and others were teachers . Regardless of the job , all were considered equal and because of the job distribution , as Elizabeth Peabody wrote , " no one has any great weight in any one thing " . In exchange for their work , participants were granted several " guarantees " , including " medical attendance , nursing , education in all departments , amusements " . There were some occasional conflicts between different workers , partly because those who were educators believed themselves more aristocratic ; overall , however , as historian Charles Crowe wrote , " indeed all aspects of communal life operated with surprisingly little friction " in general . 
 Visitors to Brook Farm came frequently , totaling an estimated 1 @,@ 150 each year , though each was charged for their visit . Between November 1844 and October 1845 , surviving records show that $ 425 was collected from visitor fees . The list of visitors included theologian Henry James , Sr. , sculptor William Wetmore Story , artist John Sartain , and British social reformer Robert Owen . 
 Despite multiple sources of income , the community was in constant debt almost immediately after it began . The community , including Ripley , had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community , in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor . The major crop was hay , though it was sold at low grade prices ; vegetables , milk , and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable . The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845 . Brook Farm got into the habit of spending money before they had raised it . As one Brook Farmer wrote , " I think here lies the difficulty , — we have not had business men to conduct our affairs ... those among us who have some business talents , see this error " . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 On September 29 , 1841 , the " Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education " was organized . The school was the most immediate ( and at times the only ) source of income for Brook Farm and attracted students as far away as Cuba and the Philippines . Children under twelve were charged three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half dollars per week and , at first , boys over twelve were charged four dollars a week and girls were charged five ; by August 1842 , the rates were made identical , regardless of gender . Adult education was also available in the evenings . The schedule for adults included courses on moral philosophy , German language , and modern European history . 
 Within the school there was an infant school for children under six , a primary school for children under ten , and there was a preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years . When entering the school , each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community who was in charge of his / her wardrobe , personal habits , and exercise . The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School ( George Ripley , George Bradford , John Sullivan Dwight ) as well as several women ( Ripley 's wife Sophia , his sister Marianne , and his cousin Hannah , as well as Georgianna Bruce and Abby Morton ) . Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class . Dana taught languages , being able to speak ten himself . Dwight taught music as well as Latin . Students studied European languages and literature and , at no extra cost , pupils could also indulge in the fine arts . The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley , using a progressive child @-@ centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of John Dewey . Sophia Ripley 's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many ; she only missed two classes in six years . 
 = = = Leisure = = = 
 The people of Brook Farm spent most of their time either studying or working the farm , but they always set aside time in the day for play . In their free time , the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music , dancing , card games , drama , costume parties , sledding , and skating . Every week everyone in the community would gather at The Hive for a dance of the young ladies of the community . They would wear wreaths of wild daisies on top of their heads , and each week a special wreath , bought from a florist , would be given to the best dressed girl . At the end of every day , many performed a " symbol of Universal Unity " , in which they stood in a circle and joined hands and vowed for " truth to the cause of God and Humanity " . 
 Spirits remained high throughout the experiment , regardless of the community 's financial standing . Their social structure demanded selflessness and individuals rarely failed to fulfill their duties , a requirement to earn leisure time . Leisure time was important to the Brook Farm philosophy . As Elizabeth Palmer Peabody wrote for The Dial in January 1842 , " none will be engaged merely in bodily labor ... This community aims to be rich , not in the metallic representative of wealth , but in ... leisure to live in all the faculties of the soul " . 
 = = = Role of women = = = 
 At Brook Farm , women had the opportunity to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued . They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation , and shared housekeeping . However , during the harvest time women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather . Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community , women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time . Because of the community 's focus on individual freedom , women were autonomous from their husbands and were also allowed to become stockholders . Women also played an important role in providing sources of income to the community . Many devoted time to making , as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described , " elegant and tasteful caps , capes , collars , <unk> , etc . , etc . , " for sale at shops in Boston . Others painted screens and lamp shades for sale . Women were allowed to go to school and , because of the well @-@ known education of women at Brook Farm , many female writers and performers visited the farm . George Ripley 's wife Sophia , who had written an outspoken feminist essay for The Dial on " Woman " before moving to Brook Farm , was very educated and was able to teach history and foreign languages at the farm . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 Many people in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and , in particular , the light @-@ hearted atmosphere . One participant , a man named John Codman , joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843 . He wrote , " It was for the meanest a life above humdrum , and for the greatest something far , infinitely far beyond . They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions , and hopes springing up for all " . The idealism of the community sometimes was not met , however . Because the community was officially secular , a variety of religions were represented , though not always amicably . When Isaac Hecker and , later , Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism , a Protestant Brook Farmer complained , " We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints ... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons . " 
 Nathaniel Hawthorne , eventually elected treasurer of the community , did not enjoy his experience . Initially , he praised the work he was doing , boasting of " what a great , broad @-@ shouldered , elephantine personage I shall become by and by ! " Later , he wrote to his wife @-@ to @-@ be Sophia Peabody , " labor is the curse of the world , and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately <unk> " . After disassociating with the community Hawthorne demanded the return of his initial investment , though he never held any ill will with Ripley , to whom he wrote he would " heartily rejoice at your success — of which I can see no reasonable doubt " . 
 Many outside the community were critical of Brook Farm , especially in the press . The New York Observer , for example , suggested that , " The <unk> , under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals , design to overthrow the marriage institution , and in the place of the divine law , to substitute the ' passions ' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes " , concluding that they were " secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society " . Critic Edgar Allan Poe expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled " Brook Farm " in the December 13 , 1845 , issue of the Broadway Journal . He wrote that he had " sincere respect " for the group and that its journal , The Harbinger , was " conducted by an assemblage of well @-@ read persons who mean no harm — and who , perhaps , can do no less " . Despite many critics , none suggested George Ripley be replaced as Brook Farm 's leader . 
 Ralph Waldo Emerson never joined the Brook Farm community , despite several invitations . He wrote to Ripley on December 15 , 1840 , of his " conviction that the Community is not good for me " . He also questioned the idealism of the community , particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload . As he wrote , " The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day ... and both received at night the same wages " . Twenty years later , Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life . Charles Lane , one of the founders of another community called Fruitlands , thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough . As he said , they were " playing away their youth and day @-@ time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner " . Like other communities , Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community . After its conversion to Fourierism , the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment . Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members ' idealism and wrote in his journal , " As for these communities , I think I had rather keep bachelor 's hall in hell than go to board in heaven " . Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism , referring to it as " childish , empty , & sad " . 
 = = In fiction = = 
 Nathaniel Hawthorne , though a founding member , was unhappy during his tenure as a Brook Farmer , partly because he was unable to write while living there . " I have no quiet at all " , he complained , and his hands were covered " with a new crop of blisters — the effect of raking hay " . He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel , The Blithedale Romance . He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction , saying " in the ' Blithedale ' of this volume , many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm , in West Roxbury , which ( now a little more than ten years ago ) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists . " The chapter called " The <unk> " , for example , was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season . George Ripley , who reviewed the book for the New York Tribune , said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story . Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne 's fictional character Zenobia . In the novel , a visitor — a writer like Hawthorne — finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity .

 The 2015 Canadian Grand Prix , formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada 2015 , was a Formula One motor race held on 7 June 2015 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal , Canada . The race was the seventh round of the 2015 season , and marked the 52nd running of the Canadian Grand Prix . Daniel Ricciardo was the defending race winner , having won his first ever grand prix the year before . 
 Lewis Hamilton of the Mercedes team won the race from pole position , leading for all but one lap of the race . He extended his championship lead over teammate Nico Rosberg , who finished second , to 17 points .

 The pit @-@ stop decision that seemingly cost Lewis Hamilton a victory at the previous race in Monaco was still a talking point when the paddock arrived in Canada . In Thursday 's press conference however , Hamilton insisted that he " couldn 't care less " about the incident , saying : " I can 't do anything about the past so there 's honestly no point in thinking about it , it is about trying to shape the future . " 
 Max Verstappen received a five @-@ place grid penalty for the Canadian Grand Prix after causing a collision with Romain Grosjean in Monaco . During the final practice session , Toro Rosso had to equip his car with the fifth internal combustion engine of the season . As he exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element per season , he received an additional ten @-@ place grid penalty . 
 Minor changes were made to the last right @-@ left chicane of the track . Prior to the first session of the weekend , the stewards placed a bollard in the run @-@ off area to keep the drivers from re @-@ entering the track too early . Ahead of the third practice session on Saturday , an additional orange @-@ coloured kerb was added on the apex of turn 14 . The stewards stated that " any driver who fails to negotiate turn 14 by using the track , and who makes contact with any part of the new kerb element , will not be required to keep to the left of the red and white polystyrene block , but must re @-@ join the track safely . " 
 Going into the race , Hamilton was leading the World Drivers ' Championship by ten points from teammate Nico Rosberg , who had won the two previous rounds in Spain and Monaco . Sebastian Vettel was third , a further 18 points behind Rosberg . In the Constructors ' Championship , Mercedes was leading Ferrari by 84 points , with Williams down in third .

 Per the regulations for the 2015 season , three practice sessions were held , two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ hour sessions on Friday and another one @-@ hour session before qualifying on Saturday . During first practice on Friday morning , Lewis Hamilton posted the fastest time – over a second quicker than the fastest time set in first practice in 2014 – and four @-@ tenths of a second ahead of his teammate Nico Rosberg in second . Both Lotus and Force India showed good pace with Romain Grosjean and Nico Hülkenberg being third and fourth fastest respectively , though over 1 @.@ 5 seconds behind Hamilton . Incidents during the session included Hamilton spinning out when his brakes locked up and Carlos Sainz , Jr. stopping at the end of pit lane when he set out to post a timed lap towards the end of the session . 
 In second practice , Hamilton was again quickest but was also caught out again . He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while he was doing a run on intermediate tyres in wet conditions – a downpour of rain affected the second half of the session . Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half , setting times on the super @-@ soft tyre compound . Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes , with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively , less than 0 @.@ 4 seconds behind Hamilton . Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest , behind Rosberg . 
 The third practice session on Saturday morning was disrupted by two red flag periods . Twenty minutes into practice , Felipe Nasr lost control of his car when he weaved from side to side on track to increase his tyre temperatures while his DRS was open on the first part of the Casino straight , and crashed into the barrier at the inside of the track . After the red flag was lifted , only twelve minutes of the session remained and all drivers took to the track to try out the super @-@ soft compound . This did not last long however , as Jenson Button had to park his car at turn seven , reporting a problem with his power unit . This brought out the red flag once again , effectively ending the session . Nico Rosberg was fastest , half a second ahead of Räikkönen , while Hamilton drove just nine laps , ending the practice with the slowest time set .

 Qualifying consisted of three parts , 18 , 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively , with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions . The 45 minutes of qualifying were split into parts of eighteen , fifteen and twelve minutes of running respectively . While Sauber were able to place Felipe Nasr in a new car in time for qualifying following his accident in practice , Jenson Button 's problems could not be sorted out and he missed the session , meaning that his participation in the race would be left to a decision by the race stewards . 
 During the first part of qualifying ( Q1 ) , Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super @-@ soft tyres , nevertheless setting times below 1 : 16 . Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean , who was narrowly quicker than the Mercedes drivers , but on the softer tyre compound . With Button not participating , four drivers were left to be eliminated . The two Manors once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid , with Roberto Merhi out @-@ qualifying his teammate Will Stevens for the first time in a qualifying that both drivers participated in . Joining them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers : both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units , finishing 16th and 17th respectively . 
 Lewis Hamilton was quickest in Q2 , just 0 @.@ 012 seconds ahead of his teammate Nico Rosberg . The Mercedes power unit proved its superiority on the high @-@ speed Montreal track , with all remaining Mercedes @-@ powered cars making it into Q3 , leaving Kimi Räikkönen and the two Red Bulls to take the remaining three places . This was the first time in 2015 that Force India was able to get both cars into Q3 in qualifying , having last done so at the 2014 German Grand Prix . 
 As the top ten took to the track for the final part of qualifying , Nico Rosberg was unable to beat his time set in Q2 with his first fast lap . Hamilton however improved on his time , being more than three @-@ tenths of a second faster than Rosberg . When both drivers were unable to improve on their times with their second timed laps , Hamilton took the 44th pole position of his career . Row two was taken up by the two Finns , Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas , who narrowly beat the two <unk> of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado . Both Lotus drivers had emerged from their pit boxes simultaneously for their final timed laps , entering the track side @-@ by @-@ side . The two Red Bulls finished eighth and ninth , splitting the two Force Indias of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez .

 In an interview following qualifying , Lewis Hamilton expressed that it was " very special " to get another pole in Canada , since Canada had been the scene of his first race win in 2007 . Sebastian Vettel lamented his qualifying performance , telling German TV that a small part of the car was broken but that he was confident to be able to make up places during the race , pointing to Kimi Räikkönen 's fast pace in qualifying . 
 Since he did not post a lap time within 107 % of the fastest time during Q1 , Jenson Button was required to apply to the race stewards to be allowed to the start the race ; they granted him permission to do so . After qualifying , McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit ( MGU @-@ H ) and a fifth turbo charger for the season . As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element , Button was later handed ten @-@ place and five @-@ place grid penalties . As he was already due to start from the back of the grid , the penalty was substituted with a drive @-@ through penalty , to be served within the first three laps of the race . 
 Sebastian Vettel was handed a five @-@ place grid penalty for overtaking Manor 's Roberto Merhi under red flags during the third free practice session . After Max Verstappen qualified twelfth for the race , he was unable to be placed the full fifteen places back on the grid from both his penalties . As grid penalties were no longer carried over to subsequent races in 2015 , he was instead handed a ten @-@ second penalty , to be served with his first pit stop during the race .

 At the start of the race , all drivers at the front of the grid got away without incident and with no changes in position . On the outside of turn three , Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position . Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa , who both started from the rear end of the grid , made up places early in the race , running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9 , when Vettel came into the pits for his first stop . The pit stop did not go well , as his car was stationary for about six seconds . Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel @-@ to @-@ wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two . Meanwhile , at the front , Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second @-@ placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake . 
 By lap 14 , Massa had passed 2014 race winner Daniel Ricciardo to move up into tenth position . The first pit stops at the front began by lap 18 , when Maldonado pitted from seventh . While Massa passed Daniil Kvyat for seventh place on lap 21 , Sebastian Vettel was stuck in 16th behind the McLaren of Fernando Alonso , who was told to save fuel , a problem that also afflicted his teammate Jenson Button . By lap 23 however , Vettel had gone past Alonso and the two Toro Rossos of Verstappen and Sainz to move up into 13th . 
 On lap 28 , Kimi Räikkönen was the first of the top runners to pit , coming out in fourth , but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an incident from 2014 . The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he pitted on lap 30 . Hamilton pitted on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later , both without incident . At this point , Rosberg was about 1 @.@ 5 seconds behind his teammate . Another four laps later , Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final stop of the race . Massa came in for his only stop on lap 38 , putting on the super @-@ soft tyres , and dropped from sixth to ninth . Räikkönen pitted again on lap 42 , staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean . 
 On lap 46 , Vettel went past Hülkenberg for eighth at the final chicane . There was no contact between the two drivers , but the Force India car spun in order to avoid the wall on the outside of the final corner . Two laps later , Fernando Alonso was the first driver to retire from the race , his third consecutive retirement . On lap 52 , Romain Grosjean tried to lap Will Stevens , cutting his rear left tyre in the process . The incident also brought him a five @-@ second time penalty . The other Lotus of Pastor Maldonado also lost a position when Vettel moved past him for fifth on lap 56 . Jenson Button joined his teammate in retirement two laps later , being called into the pits by his team . Felipe Massa went up into sixth overtaking Maldonado on lap 64 . For the remaining laps , Hamilton managed to control the lead and went on to win in Montreal for the fourth time , finishing 2 @.@ 2 seconds ahead of Rosberg , with Bottas in third a further 38 seconds behind .

 During the podium interview , conducted by Ted Kravitz , a reporter for Sky Sports F1 , Lewis Hamilton expressed delight at his victory , saying that he needed the victory after the disappointment of Monaco . While he stated that the car suffered from understeer throughout the race , he felt that he " always had it under control " , saying : " I had a bit of time in my pocket to be able to pull it out when I needed to , so it was never too serious . " In turn , Nico Rosberg felt that his qualifying performance on Saturday " [ made ] that big difference " and had cost him the chance at victory . 
 Following the race , Kimi Räikkönen apologised to his team over the radio for his spin , which many felt cost him a podium finish . In post @-@ race interviews , he explained that an issue with the torque map , triggered by the pit stop , had caused him to spin out at the hairpin . After finishing sixth from 15th on the grid , Felipe Massa was happy with a " good race " , but lamented his problems in qualifying as he felt a podium finish would have been in reach , should he have started further up the order . 
 For causing the collision with Will Stevens , Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and said after the race : " I thought I was past the Manor , but it was soon clear that I wasn 't . It was my fault entirely and I apologise for it . You never stop learning as a driver . " Meanwhile , Sebastian Vettel insisted that " it was fairly clear [ with Hülkenberg ] [ ... ] When I got close enough I went around the outside , braking later and still managing to get the corner . I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into the last part of the chicane , so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track , we would have crashed . " Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel " didn 't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking , lost the rear and spun " . He did however voice satisfaction with his result , finishing eighth and taking four championship points .

 = Battle of Lalakaon = 
 The Battle of Lalakaon ( Greek : Μάχη τοῦ <unk> ) or the Battle of Poson ( or Porson ) ( Greek : Μάχη τοῦ <unk> ( ρ ) <unk> ) was fought in 863 between the Byzantine Empire and an invading Arab army in Paphlagonia ( modern northern Turkey ) . The Byzantine army was led by Petronas , the uncle of Emperor Michael III ( r . 842 – 867 ) , although Arab sources also mention the presence of Emperor Michael himself , while the Arabs were led by the emir of Melitene ( Malatya ) , Umar al @-@ Aqta ( r . 830s – 863 ) . 
 Umar al @-@ Aqta was able to overcome the initial Byzantine resistance against his invasion and reach the shores of the Black Sea . The Byzantines then mobilized all their forces , and the Arab army was encircled near the River Lalakaon . The subsequent battle ended in a complete Byzantine victory and the death of the Emir on the field , and was followed by a successful Byzantine counteroffensive across the border . The Byzantine victories proved decisive : the main threats to the Byzantine borderlands were eliminated , and the era of Byzantine ascendancy in the East , which would culminate in the great conquests of the 10th century , had begun . 
 The Byzantine success had another corollary : deliverance from constant Arab pressure on the eastern frontier allowed the Byzantine government to concentrate on affairs in Europe , and , in particular , neighboring Bulgaria . The Bulgarians were pressured into accepting the Byzantine form of Christianity , thus beginning this nation 's absorption into the Byzantine cultural sphere . 
 = = Background : Arab – Byzantine border wars = = 
 Following the rapid Muslim conquests of the 7th century , the Byzantine Empire found itself confined to Asia Minor , the southern coasts of the Balkans , and parts of Italy . As Byzantium remained the Caliphate 's major infidel enemy , Arab raids into Asia Minor continued throughout the 8th and 9th centuries . Over time , these expeditions , launched from bases in the Arab frontier zone on an almost annual basis , acquired a quasi @-@ ritualized character as part of the Muslim jihad ( holy war ) . 
 During that period , the Byzantines were generally on the defensive , and suffered some catastrophic defeats such as the razing of Amorium , the home city of the reigning Byzantine dynasty , in 838 . Nevertheless , with the waning of the Abbasid Caliphate 's power after 842 and the rise of semi @-@ independent emirates along the Byzantine eastern frontier , the Byzantines were increasingly able to assert their own power . 
 In the 850s , the most persistent threats to the Empire were the emirate of Melitene ( Malatya ) under Umar al @-@ Aqta , the emirate of Tarsus under Ali ibn Yahya ( " Ali the Armenian " ) , the emirate of Qaliqala ( Theodosiopolis , modern Erzurum ) and the Paulicians of Tephrike under their leader Karbeas . Melitene , in particular , was a major threat to Byzantium as its location on the western side of the Anti @-@ Taurus range allowed direct access to the Anatolian plateau . An indication of the threat posed by these states came in 860 , when their combined actions turned the year into a veritable annus horribilis for the Byzantines : Umar and Karbeas raided deep into Asia Minor and returned with much plunder ; they were followed shortly after by another raid by the forces of Tarsus under Ali , while a naval attack from Syria sacked the major Byzantine naval base at Attaleia . 
 = = Arab invasion of 863 = = 
 In the summer of 863 , Umar struck again , joining forces with the Abbasid general Ja 'far ibn Dinar al @-@ Khayyat ( probably the governor of Tarsus ) for a successful raid into Cappadocia . The Arabs crossed the Cilician Gates into Byzantine territory , plundering as they went , until they reached a place near Tyana . There , the <unk> army returned home , but Umar obtained Ja 'far 's leave to press on into Asia Minor . Umar 's forces represented the bulk of his emirate 's strength , but their size is unknown : the contemporary Muslim historian Ya <unk> claims that Umar had 8 @,@ 000 men at his disposal , while the Byzantine historians <unk> and Theophanes Continuatus inflate the numbers of the Arab army to 40 @,@ 000 men . The Byzantinist John Haldon considers the former number to be closer to reality , and estimates the size of the combined Arab force at 15 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 men . It is likely that a Paulician contingent under Karbeas was present as well . 
 On the Byzantine side , Emperor Michael III had assembled his army to counter the Arab raid , and met them at a battle in an area called Marj al @-@ <unk> ( " Bishop 's Meadow " ) by Arab sources , a highland near <unk> , north of Nazianzus . The battle was bloody with many casualties on both sides ; according to the Persian historian al @-@ Tabari , only a thousand of Umar 's army survived . Nevertheless , the Arabs managed to escape the Byzantines and continue their raid north into the Armeniac Theme , eventually reaching the Black Sea and sacking the port city of Amisos . The Byzantine historians report that Umar , enraged at the sea blocking his advance , ordered it to be lashed , but this is most likely inspired by the similar account of Xerxes during the Persian Wars . 
 = = Battle = = 
 As soon as Michael learned of the fall of Amisos , he ordered a huge force to be assembled ( al @-@ Tabari gives its size at 50 @,@ 000 men ) under his uncle Petronas , the Domestic of the Schools , and Nasar , the stratēgos of the Bucellarian Theme . Al @-@ Tabari records that the Emperor himself assumed command of these forces , but this is not supported by Byzantine sources . Given the bias against Michael by the historians writing during the Macedonian dynasty , this may be a deliberate omission . The forces assembled came from all over the Byzantine Empire . Three separate armies were formed and converged on the Arabs : a northern Byzantine force composed of the forces from the Black Sea themes of the Armeniacs , <unk> , Koloneia and Paphlagonia ; a southern force , probably the one that had already fought at the Bishop 's Meadow and had kept shadowing the Arab army , composed from the Anatolic , Opsician and Cappadocian themes , as well as the <unk> ( frontier districts ) of <unk> and Charsianon ; and the western force , under Petronas himself , comprising the men of the Macedonian , Thracian and Thracesian themes and of the imperial tagmata from the capital . 
 The coordination of all these forces was not easy , but the Byzantine armies , marching from three directions , were able to converge on the same day ( September 2 ) and surround Umar 's smaller army at a location called Poson ( <unk> ) or Porson ( <unk> ) near the Lalakaon River . The exact location of the river and the battle site have not been identified , but most scholars agree that they lay near the river Halys , some 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) southeast of Amisos . With the approach of the Byzantine armies , the only open escape route left to the Emir and his men was dominated by a strategically located hill . During the night , both Arabs and Byzantines endeavoured to occupy it , but the Byzantines emerged victorious from the ensuing fight . On the next day , September 3 , Umar decided to throw his entire force towards the west , where Petronas was located , attempting to achieve a breakthrough . The Byzantines though stood firm , giving the other two Byzantine wings time to close in and attack the Arab army 's exposed rear and flanks . The rout was complete , as the larger part of the Arab army and Umar himself fell on the field . Casualties possibly included the Paulician leader Karbeas : although the latter 's participation in the battle is uncertain , it is recorded that he died in that year . 
 Only the Emir 's son , at the head of a small force , managed to escape the battlefield , fleeing south towards the border area of Charsianon . He was , however , pursued by <unk> , the <unk> of Charsianon , and was defeated and captured with many of his men . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Byzantines moved quickly to take advantage of their victory : a Byzantine army invaded Arab @-@ held Armenia , and sometime in October or November , defeated and killed the emir Ali ibn Yahya . Thus , within a single campaigning season , the Byzantines had eliminated the three most dangerous opponents on their eastern border . In retrospect , these successes proved decisive , as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene . The Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the strategic balance in the region , and heralded the beginning of Byzantium 's century @-@ long offensive in the East . 
 The importance of these victories did not go unnoticed at the time : the Byzantines hailed them as revenge for the sack of Amorium 25 years earlier , the victorious generals were granted a triumphal entry into Constantinople , and special celebrations and services were held . Petronas was awarded the high court title of magistros , and the <unk> of Charsianon was raised to a full theme . On the Muslim side , al @-@ Tabari reports that the news of the deaths of Umar and Ali — " strong defenders of Islam , men of great courage who elicited enormous praise among the frontier districts where they served " — provoked great outpouring of grief in Baghdad and other cities , culminating in riots and looting . As Tabari comments , however , while private donations and volunteers for the holy war began to flock to the border , " the central authorities [ were not ] prepared to send a military force against the Byzantines on their own account in those days " due to the ongoing internal turmoil in the Caliphate . 
 The removal of the eastern threat and the rise of the Byzantines ' confidence also opened up opportunities in the west , where the Bulgarian ruler Boris ( r . 852 – 889 ) had been negotiating with the Pope and Louis the German ( r . 817 – 876 ) for a possible conversion of himself and his pagan people to Christianity . This expansion of Rome 's ecclesiastic influence up to Constantinople 's very doorstep could not be tolerated by the Byzantine government . In 864 , the victorious eastern armies were transferred to Europe and invaded Bulgaria , in a demonstration of military might that convinced Boris to accept Byzantine missionaries instead . Boris was baptized , taking the name Michael in honor of the Byzantine emperor , thus beginning the Christianization of Bulgaria and initiating the nation 's absorption into the Byzantine @-@ influenced , Eastern Orthodox world . 
 = = Influence on heroic poetry = = 
 According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire , the Byzantine success against the Arabs that culminated with the Battle of Lalakaon inspired the creation of one of the oldest surviving <unk> ( heroic ) poems : the Song of Armouris . Grégoire claimed that the eponymous protagonist , the young Byzantine warrior Armouris , was actually inspired by Emperor Michael III . A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly recalls the events of Lalakaon , as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near <unk> . Strong influences can be found in episodes in the Arab , and later Turkish , epic cycles around Battal Ghazi , as well as an episode in the One Thousand and One Nights . 
 = Anonymous ( group ) = 
 Anonymous is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities . A website nominally associated with the group describes it as " an Internet gathering " with " a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives " . The group became known for a series of well @-@ publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial @-@ of @-@ service ( DDoS ) attacks on government , religious , and corporate websites . 
 Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan , representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic , digitized global brain . Anonymous members ( known as " Anons " ) can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film , V for Vendetta . 
 In its early form , the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner , usually toward a loosely self @-@ agreed goal , and primarily focused on entertainment , or " lulz " . Beginning with 2008 's Project Chanology — a series of protests , pranks , and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology — the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally . Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions ( including direct action ) in retaliation against copyright @-@ focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations . Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S. , Israel , Tunisia , Uganda , and others ; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ; child pornography sites ; copyright protection agencies ; the Westboro Baptist Church ; and corporations such as PayPal , MasterCard , Visa , and Sony . Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement . Related groups LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies , media , video game companies , military contractors , military personnel , and police officers , resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups ' activities . Some actions by the group have been described as being anti @-@ Zionist . It has threatened to cyber @-@ attack Israel and engaged in the " # <unk> " cyber @-@ attacks of Israeli websites on Yom HaShoah ( Holocaust Remembrance Day ) in 2013 . 
 Dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks , in countries including the U.S. , UK , Australia , the Netherlands , Spain , and Turkey . Evaluations of the group 's actions and effectiveness vary widely . Supporters have called the group " freedom fighters " and digital Robin Hoods while critics have described them as " a cyber lynch @-@ mob " or " cyber terrorists " . In 2012 , Time called Anonymous one of the " 100 most influential people " in the world . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 Anonymous has no strictly defined philosophy , and internal dissent is a regular feature of the group . A website associated with the group describes it as " an Internet gathering " with " a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives " . Gabriella Coleman writes of the group , " In some ways , it may be impossible to gauge the intent and motive of thousands of participants , many of who don 't even bother to leave a trace of their thoughts , motivations , and reactions . Among those that do , opinions vary considerably . " 
 Broadly speaking , Anons oppose Internet censorship and control , and the majority of their actions target governments , organizations , and corporations that they accuse of censorship . Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring . Since 2008 , a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious ( and , in some cases , political ) activism . 
 Because Anonymous has no leadership , no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole . <unk> Olson and others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well @-@ organized or homogeneous ; Olson writes , " There was no single leader pulling the levers , but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to start planning a stunt . " Some members protest using legal means , while others employ illegal measures such as DDoS attacks and hacking . Membership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the collective ; Carole <unk> of The Observer compared the group 's decentralized structure to that of al @-@ Qaeda , writing , " If you believe in Anonymous , and call yourself Anonymous , you are Anonymous . " Olson , who formerly described Anonymous as a " brand " , stated in 2012 that she now characterized it as a " movement " rather than a group : " anyone can be part of it . It is a crowd of people , a nebulous crowd of people , working together and doing things together for various purposes . " 
 The group 's few rules include not disclosing one 's identity , not talking about the group , and not attacking media . Members commonly use the tagline " We are Anonymous . We are Legion . We do not forgive . We do not forget . Expect us . " Brian Kelly writes that three of the group 's key characteristics are " ( 1 ) an unrelenting moral stance on issues and rights , regardless of direct provocation ; ( 2 ) a physical presence that accompanies online hacking activity ; and ( 3 ) a distinctive brand . " 
 Journalists have commented that Anonymous ' secrecy , fabrications , and media awareness pose an unusual challenge for reporting on the group 's actions and motivations . Quinn Norton of Wired writes that " Anons lie when they have no reason to lie . They weave vast fabrications as a form of performance . Then they tell the truth at unexpected and unfortunate times , sometimes destroying themselves in the process . They are unpredictable . " Norton states that the difficulties in reporting on the group cause most writers , including herself , to focus on the " small groups of hackers who stole the limelight from a legion , defied their values , and crashed violently into the law " rather than " Anonymous ’ s sea of voices , all experimenting with new ways of being in the world " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 4chan raids ( 2003 – 2007 ) = = = 
 The name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet . Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards , particularly the / b / board of 4chan , dedicated to random content . A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content . Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual . The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a " Forced _ Anon " protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous . As the popularity of imageboards increased , the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme . 
 Users of 4chan 's / b / board would occasionally join into mass pranks or raids . In a raid on July 12 , 2006 , for example , large numbers of 4chan readers invaded the Finnish social networking site Habbo Hotel with identical avatars ; the avatars blocked regular Habbo members from accessing the digital hotel 's pool , stating it was " closed due to fail and AIDS " . Future LulzSec member Topiary became involved with the site at this time , inviting large audiences to listen to his prank phone calls via Skype . Due to the growing traffic on 4chan 's boards , users soon began to plot pranks offline using Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) . These raids resulted in the first mainstream press story on Anonymous , a report by Fox station KTTV in Los Angeles , California in the U.S. The report called the group " hackers on steroids " , " domestic terrorists " , and an " Internet hate machine " . 
 = = = Encyclopedia Dramatica ( 2004 – present ) = = = 
 Encyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod <unk> , initially as a means of documenting gossip related to <unk> , but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for satirical and other purposes . The not safe for work site celebrates a subversive " trolling culture " , and documents Internet memes , culture , and events , such as mass pranks , trolling events , " raids " , large @-@ scale failures of Internet security , and criticism of Internet communities that are accused of self @-@ censorship in order to garner prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets . Journalist Julian <unk> described Encyclopædia Dramatica as the site " where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in @-@ jokes , catchphrases , and obsessions is lovingly annotated , and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture : <unk> racist and misogynist content lurks throughout , all of it calculated to offend . " The site also played a role in the anti @-@ Scientology campaign of Project Chanology . 
 On April 14 , 2011 , the original URL of the site was redirected to a new website named Oh Internet that bore little resemblance to Encyclopedia Dramatica . Parts of the ED community harshly criticized the changes . In response , Anonymous launched " Operation Save ED " to rescue and restore the site 's content . The Web Ecology Project made a downloadable archive of former Encyclopedia Dramatica content . The site 's reincarnation was initially hosted at <unk> on servers owned by Ryan Cleary , who later was arrested in relation to attacks by LulzSec against Sony . 
 = = = Project Chanology ( 2008 ) = = = 
 Anonymous first became associated with hacktivism in 2008 following a series of actions against the Church of Scientology known as Project Chanology . On January 15 , 2008 , the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion ; and the Church responded with a cease @-@ and @-@ desist letter for violation of copyright . 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation , prank @-@ calling its hotline , sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges , and launching DDoS attacks against its websites . 
 The DDoS attacks were at first carried out with the <unk> and <unk> applications . Within a few days , these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon ( LOIC ) , a network stress @-@ testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets . The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal ; however , it would also lead to a number of arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses . Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk . 
 During the DDoS attacks , a group of Anons uploaded a YouTube video in which a robotic voice speaks on behalf of Anonymous , telling the " leaders of Scientology " that " For the good of your followers , for the good of mankind — for the laughs — we shall expel you from the Internet . " Within ten days , the video had attracted hundreds of thousands of views . 
 On February 10 , thousands of Anonymous joined simultaneous protests at Church of Scientology facilities around the world . Many protesters wore the stylized Guy Fawkes masks popularized by the graphic novel and movie V for Vendetta , in which an anarchist revolutionary battles a totalitarian government ; the masks soon became a popular symbol for Anonymous . In @-@ person protests against the Church continued throughout the year , including " Operation Party Hard " on March 15 and " Operation <unk> " on April 12 . However , by mid @-@ year , they were drawing far fewer protesters , and many of the organizers in IRC channels had begun to drift away from the project . 
 = = = Operation Payback ( 2010 ) = = = 
 By the start of 2009 , Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security , and actions against the group had largely ceased . A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members ( called " <unk> " in the parlance of 4chan ) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment ( trolls ) . By September 2010 , the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest ; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels , organizing again from the chan boards , particularly / b / . 
 In September 2010 , however , Anons became aware of Aiplex Software , an Indian software company that contracted with film studios to launch DDoS attacks on websites used by copyright <unk> , such as The Pirate Bay . Coordinating through IRC , Anons launched a DDoS attack on September 17 that shut down Aiplex 's website for a day . Primarily using LOIC , the group then targeted the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , successfully bringing down both sites . On September 19 , future LulzSec member Mustafa Al @-@ Bassam ( known as " Tflow " ) and other Anons hacked the website of Copyright Alliance , an anti @-@ infringement group , and posted the name of the operation : " Payback Is A Bitch , " or " Operation Payback " for short . Anons also issued a press release , stating : 
 Anonymous is tired of corporate interests controlling the internet and silencing the people ’ s rights to spread information , but more importantly , the right to SHARE with one another . The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause ; yet they do no such thing . In their eyes is not hope , only dollar signs . Anonymous will not stand this any longer . 
 As IRC network operators were beginning to shut down networks involved in DDoS attacks , Anons organized a group of servers to host an independent IRC network , titled <unk> . Operation Payback 's targets rapidly expanded to include the British law firm ACS : Law , the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft , the British nightclub Ministry of Sound , the Spanish copyright society Sociedad General de <unk> y Editores , the U.S. Copyright Office , and the website of Gene Simmons of Kiss . By October 7 , 2010 , total downtime for all websites attacked during Operation Payback was 537 @.@ 55 hours . 
 In November 2010 , the organization WikiLeaks began releasing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. diplomatic cables . In the face of legal threats against the organization by the U.S. government , Amazon.com booted WikiLeaks from its servers , and PayPal , MasterCard , and Visa cut off service to the organization . Operation Payback then expanded to include " Operation Avenge Assange " , and Anons issued a press release declaring PayPal a target . Launching DDoS attacks with the LOIC , Anons quickly brought down the websites of the PayPal blog ; PostFinance , a Swiss financial company denying service to WikiLeaks ; <unk> , a web @-@ hosting company that had also denied service ; and the website of U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman , who had supported the push to cut off services . 
 On December 8 , Anons launched an attack against PayPal 's main site . According to Topiary , who was in the command channel during the attack , the LOIC proved ineffective , and Anons were forced to rely on the botnets of two hackers for the attack , marshaling hijacked computers for a concentrated assault . Security researcher Sean @-@ Paul Correll also reported that the " zombie computers " of involuntary botnets had provided 90 % of the attack . Topiary states that he and other Anons then " lied a bit to the press to give it that sense of abundance " , exaggerating the role of the grassroots membership . However , this account was disputed . 
 The attacks brought down <unk> for an hour on December 8 and another brief period on December 9 . Anonymous also disrupted the sites for Visa and MasterCard on December 8 . Anons had announced an intention to bring down Amazon.com as well , but failed to do so , allegedly because of infighting with the hackers who controlled the botnets . PayPal estimated the damage to have cost the company US $ 5 @.@ 5 million . It later provided the IP addresses of 1 @,@ 000 of its attackers to the FBI , leading to at least 14 arrests . On Thursday , December 5 , 2013 , 13 of the PayPal 14 pleaded guilty to taking part in the attacks . 
 = = = 2011 – 2012 = = = 
 In the years following Operation Payback , targets of Anonymous protests , hacks , and DDoS attacks continued to diversify . Beginning in January 2011 , Anons took a number of actions known initially as Operation Tunisia in support of Arab Spring movements . Tflow created a script that Tunisians could use to protect their web browsers from government surveillance , while fellow future LulzSec member Hector Xavier <unk> ( alias " Sabu " ) and others allegedly hijacked servers from a London web @-@ hosting company to launch a DDoS attack on Tunisian government websites , taking them offline . Sabu also used a Tunisian volunteer 's computer to hack the website of Prime Minister Mohamed <unk> , replacing it with a message from Anonymous . Anons also helped Tunisian dissidents share videos online about the uprising . In Operation Egypt , Anons collaborated with the activist group <unk> to help dissidents access government @-@ censored websites . Sabu and Topiary went on to participate in attacks on government websites in Bahrain , Egypt , Libya , Jordan , and Zimbabwe . 
 Tflow , Sabu , Topiary , and Ryan Ackroyd ( known as " Kayla " ) collaborated in February 2011 on a cyber @-@ attack against Aaron Barr , CEO of the computer security firm HBGary Federal , in retaliation for his research on Anonymous and his threat to expose members of the group . Using a SQL injection weakness , the four hacked the HBGary site , used Barr 's captured password to vandalize his Twitter feed with racist messages , and released an enormous cache of HBGary 's e @-@ mails in a torrent file on Pirate Bay . The e @-@ mails stated that Barr and HBGary had proposed to Bank of America a plan to discredit WikiLeaks in retaliation for a planned leak of Bank of America documents , and the leak caused substantial public relations harm to the firm as well as leading one U.S. congressman to call for a congressional investigation . Barr resigned as CEO before the end of the month . 
 Several attacks by Anons have targeted organizations accused of homophobia . In February 2011 , an open letter was published on <unk> threatening the Westboro Baptist Church , an organization based in Kansas in the U.S. known for picketing funerals with signs reading " God Hates Fags " . During a live radio current affairs program in which Topiary debated church member Shirley Phelps @-@ Roper , Anons hacked one of the organization 's websites . After the church announced its intentions in December 2012 to picket the funerals of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims , Anons published the names , phone numbers , and e @-@ mail and home addresses of church members and brought down <unk> with a DDoS attack . <unk> also circulated petitions to have the church 's tax @-@ exempt status investigated . In August 2012 , Anons hacked the site of Ugandan Prime Minister <unk> <unk> in retaliation for the Parliament of Uganda 's consideration of an anti @-@ homosexuality law permitting capital punishment . 
 In April 2011 , Anons launched a series of attacks against Sony in retaliation for trying to stop hacks of the PlayStation 3 game console . More than 100 million Sony accounts were compromised , and the Sony services <unk> and PlayStation Network were taken down for a month apiece by cyberattacks . 
 When the Occupy Wall Street protests began in New York City in September 2011 , Anons were early participants and helped spread the movement to other cities such as Boston . In October , some Anons attacked the website of the New York Stock Exchange while other Anons publicly opposed the action via Twitter . Some Anons also helped organize an Occupy protest outside the London Stock Exchange on May 1 , 2012 . 
 Anons launched Operation <unk> in October 2011 , targeting websites hosting child pornography . Most notably , the group hacked a child pornography site called " Lolita City " hosted by Freedom Hosting , releasing 1 @,@ 589 usernames from the site . Anons also stated that they had disabled forty image @-@ swapping pedophile websites that employed the anonymity network Tor . In 2012 , Anons leaked the names of users of a suspected child pornography site in <unk> . 
 In 2011 , the Koch Industries website was attacked following their attack upon union members , resulting in their website being unable to be accessed for 15 minutes . In 2013 , one member , a 38 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver , pleaded guilty when accused of participating in the attack for a period of one minute , and received a sentence of two years federal probation , and ordered to pay $ 183 @,@ 000 restitution , the amount Koch stated they paid a consultancy organisation , despite this being only a denial of service attack . 
 On January 19 , 2012 , the U.S. Department of Justice shut down the file @-@ sharing site <unk> on allegations of copyright infringement . Anons responded with a wave of DDoS attacks on U.S. government and copyright organizations , shutting down the sites for the RIAA , MPAA , Broadcast Music , Inc . , and the FBI . 
 In 2012 , Anonymous launched Operation Anti @-@ Bully : Operation Hunt Hunter in retaliation to Hunter Moore 's revenge porn site , " Is Anyone Up ? " Anonymous crashed Moore 's servers and publicized much of his personal information online , including his social security number . The organization also published the personal information of Andrew Myers , the proprietor of " Is Anyone Back , " a copycat site of Mr. Moore 's " Is Anyone Up ? " 
 In response to Operation Pillar of Defense , a November 2012 Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip , Anons took down hundreds of Israeli websites with DDoS attacks . Anons pledged another " massive <unk> " against Israel in April 2013 in retaliation for its actions in Gaza , promising to " wipe Israel off the map of the Internet " . However , its DDoS attacks caused only temporary disruptions , leading cyberwarfare experts to suggest that the group had been unable to recruit or hire <unk> operators for the attack .

 Operation Safe Winter was an effort to raise awareness about homelessness through the collection , collation , and redistribution of resources .

 The # <unk> call to action quickly spread through the Mutual Aid communities like Occupy Wall Street and its offshoot groups like the open @-@ source @-@ based <unk> . With the addition of the long @-@ term mutual aid communities of New York City and online hacktivists in the U.S. , it took on an additional three suggested missions . Encouraging participation from the general public , this Operation has raised questions of privacy and the changing nature of the Anonymous community 's use of monikers . The project to support those living on the streets while causing division in its own online network has been able to partner with many efforts and organizations not traditionally associated with Anonymous or online activists . 
 = = = = Shooting of Michael Brown = = = = 
 In the wake of the fatal police shooting of unarmed African @-@ American Michael Brown , " Operation Ferguson " — a hacktivist organization that claimed to be associated with Anonymous — organized <unk> against police , setting up a website and a Twitter account to do so . The group promised that if any protesters were harassed or harmed , they would attack the city 's servers and computers , taking them offline . City officials said that e @-@ mail systems were targeted and phones died , while the Internet crashed at the City Hall . Prior to August 15 , members of Anonymous corresponding with Mother Jones said that they were working on confirming the identity of the undisclosed police officer who shot Brown and would release his name as soon as they did . On August 14 , Anonymous posted on its Twitter feed what it claimed was the name of the officer involved in the shooting . However , police said the identity released by Anonymous was incorrect . Twitter subsequently suspended the Anonymous account from its service . 
 It was reported on 19 November 2014 that Anonymous had declared cyber war on the Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) the previous week , after the KKK had made death threats following the Ferguson riots .

 In May 2011 , the small group of Anons behind the HBGary Federal hack — including Tflow , Topiary , Sabu , and Kayla — formed the hacker group " <unk> Security " , commonly abbreviated " LulzSec " . The group 's first attack was against <unk> , leaking several passwords , LinkedIn profiles , and the names of 73 @,@ 000 X Factor contestants . In May 2011 , members of <unk> Security gained international attention for hacking into the American Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) website . They stole user data and posted a fake story on the site that claimed that rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls were still alive and living in New Zealand . LulzSec stated that some of its hacks , including its attack on PBS , were motivated by a desire to defend WikiLeaks and its informant Chelsea Manning . 
 In June 2011 , members of the group claimed responsibility for an attack against Sony Pictures that took data that included " names , passwords , e @-@ mail addresses , home addresses and dates of birth for thousands of people . " In early June , LulzSec hacked into and stole user information from the pornography website <unk> They obtained and published around 26 @,@ 000 e @-@ mail addresses and passwords . On June 14 , 2011 , LulzSec took down four websites by request of fans as part of their " Titanic Take @-@ down Tuesday " . These websites were Minecraft , League of Legends , The Escapist , and IT security company <unk> . They also attacked the login servers of the multiplayer online game EVE Online , which also disabled the game 's front @-@ facing website , and the League of Legends login servers . Most of the takedowns were performed with DDoS attacks . 
 LulzSec also hacked a variety of government @-@ affiliated sites , such as chapter sites of <unk> , a non @-@ profit organization affiliated with the FBI . The group leaked some of <unk> member e @-@ mails and a database of local users . On June 13 , LulzSec released the e @-@ mails and passwords of a number of users of <unk> , the website of the U.S. Senate . On June 15 , LulzSec launched an attack on <unk> , the public website of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency , taking the website offline for several hours with a distributed denial @-@ of @-@ service attack . On December 2 , an offshoot of LulzSec calling itself LulzSec Portugal attacked several sites related to the government of Portugal . The websites for the Bank of Portugal , the Assembly of the Republic , and the Ministry of Economy , Innovation and Development all became unavailable for a few hours . 
 On June 26 , 2011 , the core LulzSec group announced it had reached the end of its " 50 days of lulz " and was ceasing operations . Sabu , however , had already been secretly arrested on June 7 and then released to work as an FBI informant . His cooperation led to the arrests of Ryan Cleary , James Jeffery , and others . Tflow was arrested on July 19 , 2011 , Topiary was arrested on July 27 , and Kayla was arrested on March 6 , 2012 . Topiary , Kayla , Tflow , and Cleary pleaded guilty in April 2013 and were scheduled to be sentenced in May 2013 .

The July 2011 arrest of LulzSec member Topiary became a particular rallying point , leading to a widespread " Free Topiary " movement . 
 The first person to be sent to jail for participation in an Anonymous DDoS attack was Dmitriy <unk> , an American 19 @-@ year @-@ old . He pleaded guilty to " unauthorized impairment of a protected computer " in November 2009 and was sentenced to 366 days in U.S. federal prison . 
 On June 13 , 2011 , officials in Turkey arrested 32 individuals that were allegedly involved in DDoS attacks on Turkish government websites . These members of Anonymous were captured in different cities of Turkey including Istanbul and Ankara . According to PC Magazine , these individuals were arrested after they attacked these websites as a response to the Turkish government demand to ISPs to implement a system of filters that many have perceived as censorship .

 = = Analysis = = 
 Evaluations of Anonymous ' actions and effectiveness vary widely . In a widely shared post , blogger Patrick Gray wrote that private security firms " secretly love " the group for the way in which it publicises cyber security threats . Anonymous is sometimes stated to have changed the nature of protesting , and in 2012 , Time called it one of the " 100 most influential people " in the world . 
 In 2012 , Public Radio International reported that the U.S. National Security Agency considered Anonymous a potential national security threat and had warned the president that it could develop the capability to disable parts of the U.S. power grid . In contrast , CNN reported in the same year that " security industry experts generally don 't consider Anonymous a major player in the world of cybercrime " due the group 's reliance on DDoS attacks that briefly disabled websites rather than the more serious damage possible through hacking . One security consultant compared the group to " a jewelry thief that drives through a window , steal jewels , and rather than keep them , waves them around and tosses them out to a crowd ... They 're very noisy , low @-@ grade crimes . " In its 2013 Threats Predictions report , McAfee wrote that the technical sophistication of Anonymous was in decline and that it was losing supporters due to " too many uncoordinated and unclear operations " . 
 Graham <unk> , a security expert for Sophos , argued that Anonymous ' actions against child porn websites hosted on a <unk> could be counterproductive , commenting that while their intentions appear beneficial , the removal of illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities , rather than Internet vigilantes . Some commentators also argued that the DDoS attacks by Anonymous following the January 2012 Stop Online Piracy Act protests had proved counterproductive . Molly Wood of CNET wrote that " [ i ] f the SOPA / <unk> protests were the Web 's moment of inspiring , non @-@ violent , hand @-@ holding civil disobedience , # <unk> feels like the unsettling wave of car @-@ burning hooligans that sweep in and incite the riot portion of the play . " Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle concurred , stating that " Anonymous ' actions hurt the movement to kill SOPA / <unk> by highlighting online lawlessness . " The Oxford Internet Institute 's Joss Wright wrote that " In one sense the actions of Anonymous are themselves , anonymously and unaccountably , censoring websites in response to positions with which they disagree . " 
 Gabriella Coleman has compared the group to the trickster archetype and said that " they dramatize the importance of anonymity and privacy in an era when both are rapidly eroding . Given that vast databases track us , given the vast explosion of surveillance , there 's something enchanting , mesmerizing and at a minimum thought @-@ provoking about Anonymous ' interventions " . When asked what good Anonymous had done for the world , <unk> Olson replied : 
 In some cases , yes , I think it has in terms of some of the stuff they did in the Middle East supporting the pro @-@ democracy demonstrators . But a lot of bad things too , unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing . <unk> the CIA website , stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing . 
 Quinn Norton of Wired wrote of the group in 2011 : 
 I will confess up front that I love Anonymous , but not because I think they 're the heroes . Like Alan Moore 's character V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item , you 're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero . The trickster is attracted to change and the need for change , and that 's where Anonymous goes . But they are not your personal army – that 's Rule 44 – yes , there are rules . And when they do something , it never goes quite as planned . The internet has no neat endings . 
 Furthermore , Landers assessed the following in 2008 : 
 Anonymous is the first internet @-@ based super @-@ consciousness . Anonymous is a group , in the sense that a flock of birds is a group . How do you know they ’ re a group ? Because they ’ re travelling in the same direction . At any given moment , more birds could join , leave , peel off in another direction entirely . 
 = O. G. S. Crawford = 
 Osbert Guy Stanhope Crawford ( 28 October 1886 – 28 November 1957 ) , better known as O. G. S. Crawford , was a British archaeologist who specialised in the study of prehistoric Britain and the archaeology of Sudan . Working for most of his career as the archaeological officer of the Ordnance Survey , he wrote a range of books on archaeological subjects and was a keen proponent of aerial archaeology . 
 Born in Bombay , British India to a wealthy middle @-@ class Scottish family , Crawford moved to England as an infant and was raised by his aunts in London and Hampshire . He studied geography at Keble College , Oxford and worked briefly in that field before devoting himself professionally to archaeology . Employed by the philanthropist Henry Wellcome , Crawford oversaw the excavation of Abu Geili in Sudan before returning to England shortly before the First World War . During the conflict he served in both the London Scottish Regiment and the Royal Flying Corps , where he was involved in both ground and aerial reconnaissance along the Western Front . After an injury forced a period of convalescence in England , he returned to the Front , where he was captured by the German Army in 1918 and held as a prisoner of war until the end of the conflict , when he returned to Britain . 
 In 1920 he was employed by the Ordnance Survey . In this position he toured Britain to plot the location of archaeological sites in the landscape , in the process identifying a number of previously unknown sites . Increasingly interested in aerial archaeology , he obtained aerial photographs produced by the Royal Air Force and identified the extent of the Stonehenge Avenue , excavating it in 1923 . With the archaeologist Alexander Keiller he conducted an aerial survey of many counties in southern England and raised the finances to secure the land around Stonehenge for The National Trust . In 1927 , he established the scholarly journal Antiquity , which contained contributions from many of Britain 's most prominent archaeologists , and in 1939 he became president of The Prehistoric Society . An internationalist and socialist , he came under the influence of Marxism and for a time became a Soviet sympathiser . During the Second World War he worked with the National Buildings Record , photographically documenting Southampton . After retiring in 1946 , he refocused his attention on Sudanese archaeology and wrote several further books prior to his death . 
 While friends and colleagues remembered Crawford as a cantankerous and irritable individual , his contributions to British archaeology – namely in the form of Antiquity and his promotion of aerial archaeology – have been widely acclaimed , with some referring to him as one of the great pioneering figures in the field . His photographic archive remained of use to archaeologists into the 21st century . A biography of Crawford by Kitty Hauser was published in 2008 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Childhood : 1886 – 1904 = = = 
 O. G. S. Crawford was born on 28 October 1886 at Breach Candy , a suburb of Bombay in British India . His father , Charles Edward Gordon Crawford , was a civil servant who had been educated at Marlborough College and Wadham College , Oxford prior to his move to India , where he became a High Court Judge at Thane . The Crawford family hailed from Ayrshire in Scotland , and the child 's great @-@ uncle was the politician Robert Wigram Crawford . Crawford 's mother , Alice Luscombe Mackenzie , was the daughter of a Scottish army doctor and his Devonshire wife . Alice died a few days after her son 's birth , and so when he was three months old , Crawford was sent to England aboard the P & O liner <unk> . During the journey he was entrusted to the care of his paternal aunt Eleanor , an Anglican nun who was the head of the Poona Convent of the Community of St Mary the Virgin . 
 After his arrival in Britain , he spent the next seven years with two paternal aunts who lived together near to Portland Place in the Marylebone district of central London . Like his father , they were devout Christians , having been the children of a Scottish clergyman . Under their guardianship Crawford had little contact with other children or with men . Crawford saw his father on the few occasions that the latter visited England , prior to his death in India in 1894 . In 1895 , Crawford and his two aunts moved to a rural house in East <unk> in Hampshire . Initially educated at Park House School , which he enjoyed , he was subsequently moved to Marlborough College , his father 's alma mater ; he was unhappy there , complaining about bullying and enforced sporting activities , and characterising it as a " detestable house of torture " . 
 At the school , Crawford was influenced by his housemaster , F. B. Malim , who presided over the archaeological section of the college 's Natural History Society and encouraged the boy 's interest in the subject . It has been suggested that Malim provided something of a father figure for the young Crawford . With the society , Crawford visited such archaeological sites as Stonehenge , West Kennet Long Barrow , Avebury , and <unk> . It was also through the society that he obtained Ordnance Survey maps of the landscape , allowing him to explore the downs near to his aunts ' home . He began excavation of a barrow near to Bull 's Copse , thus attracting the attention of the antiquarian Harold Peake , who was then involved in compiling the Victoria County History of Berkshire . Peake and his wife lived a Bohemian lifestyle , being vegetarians and social reformers , and their ideas had a strong impact on Crawford . Under the <unk> ' influence , Crawford rejected his religious upbringing in favour of a rationalist world @-@ view based in science . Moreover , from Peake , Crawford gained an appreciation for the understanding of past societies through an examination of the geographical landscape rather than simply through texts or artefacts . 
 = = = University and early career : 1905 – 1914 = = = 
 Following his schooling , Crawford won a junior scholarship to study at Keble College , Oxford . There he began reading <unk> <unk> in 1905 but – after gaining only a third @-@ class score in his second year exams – he switched courses to study geography in 1908 . In 1910 he gained a distinction for his diploma , for which he had conducted a study of the landscape surrounding Andover . Reflecting his interest in the relationship between geography and archaeology , during a walking tour of Ireland he had also written a paper on the geographic distribution of Bronze Age flat bronze axes and beakers in the British Isles . It was presented to the Oxford University Anthropological Society before being published in The Geographical Journal . The archaeologist Grahame Clark later related that the paper " marked a milestone in British Archaeology ; it was the first real attempt to deduce prehistoric events from the geographical distribution of archaeological objects " . Crawford 's fellow archaeologist Mark Bowden stated that while archaeological distribution maps had been previously produced , " archaeological data had never before been married with environmental information " in the way that Crawford did in this article . 
 After Crawford graduated , Professor A. J. Herbertson offered him a job as a junior demonstrator in the university 's geography department ; Crawford agreed , and served in the position , which largely entailed teaching students , over the following year . Through Herbertson , Crawford was introduced to Patrick Geddes . Crawford however decided that he wanted to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography ; attempts to find a professional position in the field were hindered by the fact that very few existed in Britain at the time . Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment , he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum . 
 On the recommendation of Herbertson , on 1913 Crawford joined William Scoresby Routledge and Katherine Routledge 's expedition to Easter Island as an assistant ; the expedition was put on with the intent of learning more about the island 's first inhabitants and its Moai statues . However , after the team departed from Britain aboard the schooner Mana , Crawford quarrelled with the <unk> – informing them that they exhibited an " extraordinary lack of courtesy " and " appalling stinginess " toward him and other crew members – and he then left the ship at Cape Verde and returned to Britain . He subsequently gained employment from the wealthy philanthropist Henry Wellcome , who sent him to gain training in archaeological excavation from G. A. Reisner in Egypt before sending him on to Sudan , where Crawford was given charge of the excavation of the <unk> site at Abu Geili ; he remained there from January to June 1914 . On his return to England , where he was planning on sorting through the artefacts found in Sudan , he and his friend Earnest Hooton began excavation of a long barrow on <unk> Down in Wiltshire . 
 = = = First World War : 1914 – 1918 = = = 
 It was while Crawford was engaged in this excavation that the United Kingdom entered the First World War . At Peake 's encouragement , Crawford enlisted to serve in the British Army , joining the London Scottish Regiment which was sent to reinforce the First Battalion in France . The regiment marched to Béthune to relieve the British line , there fighting on the Western Front at Givenchy . Afflicted with influenza and malaria , in February Crawford was invalided back to England , being stationed at Birmingham for his recuperation . After recovery , he applied to join the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) but was deemed too heavy . In July 1915 he was successful in his application to join the Royal Berkshire Regiment as part of the Third Army , being stationed at Beauval and then St. Pol . Utilising his existing skills , he served as the regiment 's maps officer , responsible for mapping the areas around the front line , including the German Army positions . He also took various photographs which were used for British propaganda purposes , and in 1916 he guided the writer H. G. Wells around the trenches on the latter 's visit to the Front . 
 In January 1917 , Crawford successfully applied to join the RFC as an observer with the 23rd Squadron , as part of which he flew over enemy lines to make observations and draw maps . On his maiden flight , the German Army opened fire on his aircraft , in which his right foot was pierced by bullets and badly injured . To recuperate , he spent time at various hospitals in France and England before eventually being sent to the RFC Auxiliary Hospital at the Heligan estate in Cornwall . During this time in England he spent a weekend at Wells 's home in Dunmow , Essex , embracing the latter 's desire for a united world government and the idea that writing about global history was a contribution to that cause . While at Heligan , Crawford began working on a book , Man and his Past , which examined a broad sweep of human history from an archaeological and geographical perspective . 
 In September 1917 , Crawford – who had been promoted to the position of squadron intelligence officer – joined the 48th Squadron , during which he again took aerial photographs during flying reconnaissance trips . While on one flight in February 1918 , Crawford 's aircraft was shot at and forced to land in German @-@ held territory ; he and his co @-@ pilot were taken as prisoners of war . He was initially imprisoned at Landshut in Bavaria , from where he tried to escape by swimming down the River Isar ; the river current proved too strong and he was soon recaptured . He was then transferred to Holzminden prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp , where he was aware of an escape plan involving tunnelling out of the camp , but did not take part . Instead he spent much of his time reading works by Wells , Carl Jung , and Samuel Butler , and working on Man and his Past . Crawford remained in the camp for seven months , until the declaration of armistice , at which he returned to Britain and was demobilised .

 = = = Ordnance Survey and Antiquity = = = 
 Back in England , Crawford finished writing Man and his Past , which was published by Oxford University Press in 1921 . According to the historian of archaeology Adam Stout , the book was " a manifesto , a rallying @-@ cry for a new generation of archaeologists who shared in the idealism and the faith in the potential of Progress " . Bowden suggested that it could be seen as a " manifesto for <unk> , environmental archaeology and economic archaeology . The unifying theme is that all these topics should be approached through the compilation of maps " . The work fitted within the theoretical trend of culture @-@ historical archaeology by discussing geographical methods for delineating cultures although it did not attempt to apply the concept of culture in a systematic fashion . He also returned to field work , carrying out archaeological excavation for the Cambrian Archaeological Association in both Wiltshire and Wales . During the summer of 1920 , he then excavated at Roundwood in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight for Sir William Portal . 
 His expertise resulted in his being invited by Charles Close , the Director @-@ General of the Ordnance Survey ( OS ) , to join that organisation as their first archaeological officer . Accepting the position , Crawford moved to Southampton and began work at the project in October 1920 . His arrival at the OS generated some resentment , with co @-@ workers often seeing his post as superfluous and deeming archaeology to be unimportant . His job entailed correcting and updating information on archaeological monuments as the OS maps were revised , and involved him undertaking much fieldwork , travelling across the British landscape , checking the location of previously recorded sites and discovering new ones . He began in Gloucestershire in the autumn and winter of 1920 , visiting 208 sites around the Cotswolds and adding 81 previously unknown barrows to the map . As a result of his research in this region , in 1925 he published his book Long Barrows and the Stone Circles of the Cotswolds and the Welsh Marches . 
 As part of his job , he travelled around Britain , from Scotland in the north to the Scilly Isles in the south , often conducting his fieldwork by bicycle . On his visits he took photographs of archaeological sites , which were stored in his archive , and he also obtained aerial photographs of archaeological sites taken by the Royal Air Force . In this he was aided by regional antiquarian societies and by his correspondents , whom he called his " ferrets " . In 1921 , the Ordnance Survey published Crawford 's work , " Notes for Beginners " , in which he explained how amateur archaeologists could identify traces of old monuments , roads , and agricultural activity in the landscape . He also began producing " period maps " in which archaeological sites were marked ; the first of these was on Roman Britain , and featured Roman roads and settlements . First published in 1924 , it soon sold out , resulting in a second edition in 1928 . He followed this with a range of further maps in the 1930s : ' England in the Seventeenth Century ' , ' Celtic Earthworks of Salisbury Plain ' , ' Neolithic Wessex ' , and ' Britain in the Dark Ages ' . Although his position had initially been precarious , in 1926 it was made permanent , despite the reluctance of the Treasury , which financed the OS at the time . By 1938 , he had been able to persuade the OS to employ an assistant , W. F. Grimes , to aid him in his work . 
 Crawford became particularly interested in the new technique of aerial archaeology , claiming that this new process was to archaeology what the telescope was to astronomy . He produced two OS leaflets containing various aerial photographs , printed in 1924 and 1929 respectively . Through these and other works he was keen to promote aerial archaeology , coming to be firmly identified with the technique . His association with it reached the extent that in his 1939 novel The Shape of Things to Come , Wells named a survey aeroplane that discovers an ancient archaeological device " Crawford " . 
 Using RAF aerial photographs , Crawford determined the length of the Avenue at Stonehenge before embarking on an excavation of the site with A. D. Passmore in the autumn of 1923 . This project attracted press attention , resulting in Crawford being contacted by the marmalade magnate and archaeologist Alexander Keiller . Keiller invited Crawford to join him in an aerial survey , financed by Keiller himself , in which they flew over Berkshire , Dorset , Hampshire , Somerset , and Wiltshire in the spring and summer 1924 , taking photographs of archaeological traces in the landscape . Many of these images were published in Crawford and Keiller 's Wessex from the Air in 1928 . In 1927 Crawford and Keiller helped raise the finances to buy the land around Stonehenge and present it to The National Trust in order to prevent it facing agricultural or urban development . Previously , in 1923 , Crawford had assisted Keiller in campaigning to prevent a radio mast being erected on the archaeologically significant Windmill Hill in Wiltshire , with Keiller later purchasing the hill and the surrounding Avebury area . Despite this working relationship , the two never became friends , perhaps a result of their highly divergent interests and opinions . 
 In 1927 , Crawford founded Antiquity ; A Quarterly Review of Archaeology , a quarterly journal designed to bring together the work of archaeologists working across the world to supplement the variety of regional antiquarian periodicals that were then available . Although designed to have an international scope , the journal exhibited a clear bias towards the archaeology of Britain , with its release coinciding with the blossoming of British archaeology as a field of study . It contained contributions from a variety of young archaeologists who came to dominate the field of British archaeology , among them V. Gordon Childe , Grahame Clark , Cyril Fox , Christopher Hawkes , T. D. Kendrick , Stuart Piggott , and Mortimer Wheeler . Crawford himself was known as " Ogs " or " Uncle Ogs " to a number of these individuals , who shared his desire to professionalise the field and take it in a more scientific direction and away from the domination of antiquarian hobbyists . In particular , Crawford saw Antiquity as a rival to the Antiquaries Journal published by the Society of Antiquaries , an organisation that Crawford was contemptuous of , disliking their neglect of prehistory and believing that they did little valuable research . 
 The journal proved influential from the start . Although not initially using a process of peer review , Crawford asked his friends to read through submissions that he was unsure about . As well as seeking to shape and define the discipline , Antiquity sought to spread news of archaeological discoveries to a wider public , thereby being more accessible than pre @-@ existing scholarly journals . However , it resulted in Crawford receiving letters from proponents of various pseudo @-@ archaeological ideas , such as the ley line theory of Alfred Watkins ; he filed these letters under a section of his archive titled " <unk> " and was annoyed that educated people believed such ideas when they were demonstrably incorrect . He refused to publish an advert for Watkins ' The Old Straight Track in Antiquity , with Watkins becoming very bitter towards him . In 1938 , Crawford served as President of the Prehistoric Society ; in this position he instigated a series of excavations , inviting the German archaeologist Gerhard <unk> – persecuted in Germany by the Nazi authorities – to move to England to oversee the excavation of Little Woodbury .

 Crawford enjoyed foreign travel and left Britain on a number of occasions . In 1928 the OS sent him to the Middle East , there to collect aerial photographs that had been produced during the First World War and which were stored at Baghdad , Amman , and Heliopolis . In the summer of 1931 he visited Germany and Austria , there furthering his interest in interest in photography through the purchase of a <unk> . He later visited Italy with the intent of examining the possibility of producing OS maps pinpointing the country 's archaeological sites ; in November 1932 he met with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini , who was interested in Crawford 's ideas about creating an OS map of archaeological sites in Rome . This was part of a wider project to produce a series of maps covering the entirety of the Roman Empire , for which Crawford visited various parts of Europe during the late 1920s and 1930s . Holiday destinations included Germany , Austria , Romania , Corsica , Malta , Algeria , and Tunisia , and in 1936 he purchased a plot of land in Cyprus on which he had a house built . During these vacations , he visited archaeological sites and met with local archaeologists , encouraging them to contribute articles to Antiquity . 
 Crawford believed that society would progress with the growth of internationalism and the increased application of science , and politically he had moved toward socialism under the influence of Childe , who had become a close friend . He expressed the view that socialism was " the natural corollary of science in the regulation of human affairs " . He attempted to incorporate Marxist ideas into his archaeological interpretations , for instance in an article on " The Dialectical Process in the History of Science " that was published in The Sociological Review journal . He became enthusiastic about the Soviet Union , a state governed by the Marxist Communist Party , viewing it as the forerunner of a future world state . 
 With his friend Neil Hunter , he travelled to the Soviet Union in May 1932 , sailing to Leningrad aboard the Smolny . Once there , they followed a prescribed tourist itinerary , visiting Moscow , <unk> Novgorod , Stalingrad , Rostov @-@ on @-@ Don , Tiflis , Armenia , Batum , and <unk> . Crawford admired what he perceived as the progress that the Soviet Union had made since the fall of the Tsarist regime , the increasingly classless and gender @-@ equal status of its population , and the respect accorded to scientists in planning its societal development . He described his holiday with glowing praise in a book , A Tour of <unk> , stating that he did so in order to " hasten the downfall of capitalism " while at the same time making " as much money as possible " out of capitalists . The book was rejected by the publisher Victor Gollancz , after which Crawford decided not to approach other publishers , instead giving typed copies of the work to his friends . Although he became involved with the Friends of the Soviet Union and wrote several articles for the Daily Worker newspaper , he never joined the Communist Party of Great Britain or became involved in organised politics , perhaps fearing that to do so would jeopardise his employment in the civil service . 
 In Britain , he photographed a number of sites associated with the prominent Marxists Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin , as well as photographing the signs erected by landowners and religious groups , believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by socialism . Both in Britain and on a visit to Germany he photographed both pro @-@ fascist and anti @-@ fascist propaganda and graffiti , and like many leftists at the time , he believed that fascism was a temporary , extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by socialism . He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government , highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities ; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology . 
 Despite his socialist and pro @-@ Soviet beliefs , Crawford believed in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists , regardless of political or ideological differences . In the spring of 1938 , he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry ; they published his lecture as Luftbild und <unk> , and Crawford was frustrated that the British government did not publish his work with the same enthusiasm . From there , he visited Vienna , to meet with his friend , the archaeologist Oswald <unk> , who took him to an event celebrating the Anschluss , at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel . Shortly after , he holidayed in Schleswig @-@ Holstein , where German archaeologists took him to see the Danevirke . 
 In the late 1930s he began work on a book titled Bloody Old Britain , which he described as " an attempt to apply archaeological methods to the study of contemporary society " and in which he was heavily critical of his homeland . It examined 1930s Britain through its material culture , with Crawford reaching the judgement that it was a society in which appearances were given greater importance than value , with clothing for instance emphasising bourgeois respectability over comfort . He attributed much of this to the impact of capitalism and consumerism on British culture . The work fitted within an established genre of 1930s publications which lamented the state of British society , in particular the quality of its food and manufactured products as well as its increasing suburbanisation . However , by the outbreak of the Second World War the work had become less marketable due to its unpatriotic nature , and when he proposed it to Methuen Publishing in 1943 they turned it down ; he gave copies to a few friends , but never published it .
