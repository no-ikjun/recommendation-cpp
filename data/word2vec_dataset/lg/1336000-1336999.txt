 = Nintendo DSi = 
 The Nintendo DSi ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Nintendō Dī Esu Ai ) is a dual @-@ screen handheld game console released by Nintendo . The console launched in Japan on November 1 , 2008 , and worldwide beginning in April 2009 . It is the third iteration of the Nintendo DS , and its primary market rival is Sony 's PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) . The fourth iteration , entitled Nintendo DSi XL , is a larger model that launched in Japan on November 21 , 2009 , and worldwide beginning in March 2010 . Development of the DSi began in late 2006 , and the handheld was unveiled during an October 2008 Nintendo conference in Tokyo . Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the DS Lite . Consequently , Nintendo removed the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) cartridge slot to improve portability without sacrificing durability . 
 While the DSi 's design is similar to that of the DS Lite , it features two digital cameras , supports internal and external content storage , and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop . Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles . Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization , so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi . The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi @-@ specific features and standard DS titles . The only exception to its backward compatibility are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot . Nintendo had sold over 41 million DSi and DSi XL units combined . 
 Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were generally positive ; although IGN and bit @-@ tech decried the console 's lack of exclusive software and removal of the GBA cartridge slot , its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it to those who had not purchased a previous DS model . Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi 's cameras , though others such as Ars Technica and GameSpot agreed they were adequate for the handheld 's display . CNET and PCWorld considered the DSi Shop to be the most important buying incentive for current DS owners . Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade . GamePro and Wired UK , on the other hand , praised the DSi XL 's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games . 
 Nintendo will be ceasing operations of the DSi Store on March 31 , 2017 , starting with Nintendo Points becoming unredeemable on September 30 , 2016 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Development of the Nintendo DSi started at the end of 2006 . It was the first time Masato Kuwahara of Nintendo 's Development Engineering Department served as a hardware project leader . Work went at a quick pace to meet deadlines ; his team had to devise a theme for the new DS in time for a late December presentation , and by February 2007 , most specifications for a chipset had to be completed . Kuwahara reported that his team had difficulty determining the potential market for the handheld during the design process ; he said of their goal , " We have to be able to sell the console on its own [ without games at launch ] . It also has to be able to meld into the already @-@ existing DS market . " The console 's digital cameras were considered early in development : Nintendo president and Chief Executive Officer Satoru Iwata described the touchscreen as the Nintendo DS 's sense of touch , and the microphone as its " ears " ; a co @-@ worker suggested that it should have " eyes " . Kuwahara 's team originally wanted one camera with a swivel mechanism , but this was abandoned due to concerns of reliability , cost , and the need of a thicker console . Owing to consumer demand , Nintendo also improved the handhelds ' volume and audio quality and made it slimmer with larger screens compared to the Nintendo DS Lite . However , to improve portability without sacrificing durability , the GBA cartridge slot present on earlier models was removed . To compensate , Nintendo continued to support the DS Lite as long as there was consumer demand for it . 
 The DSi 's size was changed midway through development , delaying its release . Its original design included two DS game card slots , because of demand from both fan communities and Nintendo employees , which consequently made it larger . When the console 's designs were unveiled to Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development producers in October 2007 , it was met with lukewarm reception due to its size . However , Iwata and Kuwahara 's own hopes resulted in the creation of a prototype . A quick hands @-@ on investigation led them to abandon the dual @-@ slot design , which made the DSi approximately 0 @.@ 12 inches ( 3 mm ) slimmer . Ever since the handheld 's in @-@ company unveiling , its internal designs were finished along with assembly and durability specifications . Iwata described having to <unk> the console so close to manufacturing as being essentially the same as making another handheld . 
 Yui <unk> , designer of the DS Lite and DSi 's original casing , had to redesign the revised case . He advocated changing the six speaker apertures , as their circular perforations were redundant to the rest of the handheld 's interface . He believed that this alteration also signaled a clearer distinction between the DSi and its predecessors while keeping the unit " neat " and " simple " . <unk> hoped the DSi 's added features would not interfere with his desired iconic image of the Nintendo DS product line : two rectangles , one on top of the other , with each half containing another rectangle inside . This model was publicly revealed at the October 2008 Nintendo Conference in Tokyo , along with its Japanese price and release date . While the DS product line 's worldwide yearly sales figures consistently surpassed those of its primary market rival , Sony 's PlayStation Portable , demand for it in Japan was decreasing ; Nintendo 's launch of the DSi was intended to stimulate sales . The company was less concerned with releasing the DSi in other territories , where DS Lite market demand remained high . 
 Development of a large DS Lite model in 2007 eventually led to the DSi XL ( known in Japan as the Nintendo DSi LL ( <unk> LL , Nintendō DSi LL ) ) . Nintendo had designed a large DS Lite model with 3 @.@ 8 @-@ inch ( 97 mm ) screens , compared to the standard 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) screens ; development of this new handheld advanced far enough that it could have begun mass production . However , Iwata placed the project on hold due to consumer demand for the DS Lite and Wii . He later pitched the idea of simultaneously releasing large and small versions of the DSi instead , but Nintendo 's hardware team was incapable of developing two models concurrently . After finishing work on the DSi , Kuwahara started the DSi XL project and became project leader . The DSi XL , a DSi model with 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) screens , was announced on October 29 , 2009 . Various names for it were considered , including " DSi Comfort " , " DSi Executive " , " DSi Premium " , " DSi Living " , and " DSi Deka " ( Japanese for " large " ) . Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto insisted on " DSi Deka " . The handheld has an improved viewing angle over its predecessor , which allows onlookers to see the screen 's contents more easily . This feature was absent from the large DS Lite model due to cost issues at the time , which also limited LCD screen size . The cost of LCD screens is determined by how many pieces are cut from a single large glass sheet . To keep these costs within a certain threshold , Nintendo set a screen size limit of approximately 3 @.@ 8 inches ( 97 mm ) , which was later increased to 4 @.@ 2 inches ( 110 mm ) .

 On November 1 , 2008 , the DSi was released in Japan ; on April 2 , 2009 , in Australia and New Zealand , and on April 3 in Europe , all with a black and white casing . It launched in the United States and Canada on April 5 , alongside the game Rhythm Heaven . It was the first DS console to launch with multiple colors in North America — black and <unk> iQue released a Chinese DSi model in black and white , with a pre @-@ installed version of Nintendogs , in December 2009 ; the Nikkei <unk> Shimbun reported that the Chinese and Korean models featured improved security , to combat piracy . On April 15 , 2010 , the DSi was launched in South Korea in white , black , blue , and pink , alongside the game MapleStory DS . MapleStory DS was also bundled with a red limited @-@ edition DSi , which had characters from the game printed around its external camera . Other countries the DSi was released in include Brazil , Russia , and Turkey . 
 Nintendo had shipped 200 @,@ 000 units for the DSi 's Japanese launch , and during its first two days on sale , over 170 @,@ 000 units were sold — the remaining units were either unclaimed pre @-@ orders or reserved for sale on Culture Day . By the end of the month , the DSi sold 535 @,@ 000 units , in comparison to 550 @,@ 000 DS Lites sold in its launch month . In the two @-@ day launch period , Europe and North American sales totaled 600 @,@ 000 units combined . North American first week sales almost doubled the DS Lite 's 226 @,@ 000 units by selling 435 @,@ 000 . In the UK , the console totaled 92 @,@ 000 sales within two days of release , which GfK / Chart @-@ Track data showed to be the fourth @-@ best opening weekend ever in the region — higher than previous records set by other DS iterations . 
 DSi launch events were held on the western and eastern coasts of the United States . Nintendo sponsored an official launch event at the Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles and the Nintendo World Store in New York City . The LA midnight launch party featured several events , including merchandise handouts , signings and art galleries from iam8bit , parkour demonstrations , and performances by Gym Class Heroes . Hundreds attended and over 150 stayed until midnight to purchase a unit at GameStop . A human @-@ sized Lego DSi by artist Sean Kenney was on display at the Nintendo World Store . 
 The Nintendo DSi XL was released in Japan on November 21 , 2009 , in bronze , burgundy , and white . The former two colors were available for its European launch on March 5 , 2010 , and its North American launch on March 28 . The console launched in Australia on April 15 , 2010 , in bronze and burgundy . The DSi XL was released in other countries including Brazil , South Africa , and Turkey . Over 100 @,@ 500 units were sold during the console 's first two days on sale in Japan , and 141 @,@ 000 units were sold during its first three days in the United States . 
 The 2011 release of the Nintendo 3DS , the successor to the Nintendo DS series of handhelds , was announced on March 23 , 2010 , to preempt impending news leaks by the Japanese press and to attract potential attendees to the Electronic Entertainment Expo . According to industry analysts , the timing drew attention from the North American launch of the DSi XL . M2 Research senior analyst Billy Pigeon argued the " XL is old news ... in Japan – and Nintendo is a very Japan @-@ centric organization . This is just the corporate parent in Japan maybe not acting in the best interest of Nintendo of America . " Iwata dismissed any significant impact when speaking to concerned investors , " those who are eager to buy Nintendo 3DS right after the announcement generally tend to react quickly to anything new on the market , and those who are purchasing a Nintendo DS today tend to react relatively slowly . " 
 = = Demographic and sales = = 
 Nintendo targeted a wider demographic profile with the first Nintendo DS ( 2004 ) than it had with the Game Boy line . Comparing 2008 life @-@ to @-@ date DS and DS Lite sales to the best @-@ selling game console , Sony 's PlayStation 2 , showed potential in further expanding the Nintendo DS gaming population — particularly in Europe and the United States . To further promote the product line while expanding its gaming population , Nintendo created the DSi . Iwata has said that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles , so to encourage each family member to buy an individual handheld , Nintendo added personalization features to the DSi . 
 The " i " in DSi symbolizes both an individual person ( I ) and the handheld 's cameras ( eyes ) ; the former meaning contrasts with the " i " ' s in Wii , which represent players gathering together . Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils @-@ Aime said , " If Wii was about gaming for the masses , then think of DSi as creativity for the masses . " Iwata has said that the DSi is meant to be a first camera for children , and a social networking device for adults . In response to media commentary following the DSi 's announcement , Iwata insisted that its new audio and camera capabilities are not meant to compete with mobile phones , the iPod , or the PSP . He explained their role in the marketplace : 
 While cell phone and digital camera manufacturers have been trying to compete against each other by intensifying the picture pixel quality and zooming ability of their camera functions , and while music players are making its improvements mainly by making smaller exterior design and by increasing memory storage capacity , DSi is trying to propose a different path of evolution by providing the users with the opportunity to be able to touch and play with photographs and sounds . 
 The DSi helped maintain strong sales for Nintendo 's handheld product line . The DSi accounted for 40 percent of its product line 's 2009 UK sales and frequently topped weekly sales charts in Japan during its first year of availability . In the United States , the console 's initial three @-@ month sales surpassed those of the DS , DS Lite , and Wii . Average weekly sales of the Wii and Nintendo DS declined slightly in March ; Nintendo DS hardware sales stabilized at over 200 @,@ 000 units for seven months after the DSi 's April launch , while Wii sales diminished . Gamasutra estimated that , in October 2009 and February 2010 , 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles . In an October 2009 interview , Fils @-@ Aime announced that the DSi had sold 2 @.@ 2 million units in the United States . He said , " If you give the consumer great value in terms of what they pay , they 're willing to spend , and we say [ that ] based on the experience of launching the DSi " . The United States had its highest yearly DS sales in 2009 with 11 @.@ 22 million units sold . The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 16 @.@ 88 million of the 27 @.@ 11 million units sold worldwide of its product line for Nintendo 's 2009 fiscal year beginning April 1 , 2009 and ending March 31 , 2010 . 
 In Gamasutra 's United States hardware sales estimate for July 2010 , the DSi and DSi XL each outsold the DS Lite . The website reported DSi sales of approximately 300 @,@ 000 units in July 2009 and February 2010 , which remains consistent for July 2010 if combined with DSi XL sales . As a result , the average price consumers were spending on the Nintendo DS hardware family rose to over $ 165 ( in 2004 dollars , $ 190 adjusted for inflation as of 2010 ) , which is over $ 15 more than the November 2004 launch price of the original Nintendo DS . Nintendo made its first DSi price cuts in Europe on June 18 , 2010 , for DSi and DSi XL consoles in Japan on June 19 , and in North America on September 12 . The DSi and DSi XL accounted for 14 @.@ 66 million of the 17 @.@ 52 million units sold worldwide of its product line in fiscal year 2010 . 
 In a United States hardware sales estimate for July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite 's price drop a month earlier , about 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290 @,@ 000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles . <unk> 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price to match the DSi XL in the United States on August 12 . Japan and Europe had similar price reductions . Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result ; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent , while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month . Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20 , 2012 . Gamasutra called these price cuts the DS product line 's " final send @-@ off " and expects " by this time next year its contributions to the market will be minuscule . After Christmas , Nintendo will effectively be a single @-@ handheld system company , putting all of portable software efforts into the Nintendo 3DS . "

 The Nintendo DSi 's design is similar to that of the second DS iteration , the Nintendo DS Lite . It is approximately 12 percent shorter ( 0 @.@ 10 inches ( 2 @.@ 5 mm ) ) than the Nintendo DS Lite when closed , but slightly wider and lighter . The DSi has two 3 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 83 mm ) TFT @-@ LCD screens — .25 inches ( 6 @.@ 4 mm ) larger than those of previous models — that are capable of displaying 262 @,@ 144 colors . The touch sensitive lower screen accepts input from the included stylus . The handheld features four lettered buttons ( X , Y , A , B ) , a directional pad , and Start , Select , and Power buttons . Two shoulder buttons , a game card slot , and a power cable input are placed under the console 's hinge . The included AC adapter ( WAP @-@ 002 ) is not compatible with any other DS model . 
 Unlike previous models , the handheld has two VGA ( 0 @.@ 3 @-@ megapixel ) digital cameras . The first is on the internal hinge and points toward the user ; the second is on the outer casing and faces away from the user . The SD card slot is also new , set behind a cover on the right side . While the DS Lite used a switch , the DSi , like the original Nintendo DS , features a button to power on or off . The button has extra functions and unlike the original 's power button , it is located on the bottom @-@ left side of the touchscreen . Brightness and volume controls are on the left side ; five brightness settings — one more than on the DS Lite — are available . The headset port is on the bottom . 
 The DSi has a matte surface to hide fingerprints . It is available in numerous colors , but color selection varies by region . For example , lime green is exclusive to Japan , while red is available in Europe and North America . North America also received a different shade of blue . Numerous special @-@ edition models and bundles have been released , including those for Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth , Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : Echoes of Time , and the 2009 Black Friday shopping day .

 The DSi has more RAM and a faster CPU than the DS Lite . Developers reported the console has a native mode , which runs software specifically designed for its hardware , access to the system 's extra processing and memory resources . The inclusion of a codec integrated circuit ( a microchip ) amplifies sound signals and converts them from digital to analog . This increases audio output , and depending on the mode , higher audio quality . Unused space on the motherboard was removed ; the CPU was relocated , and the battery housing was expanded . 
 The camera 's resolution is two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half times higher than the handheld 's screens . However , their resolution is considerably lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones . This was done to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable response time for viewing photos in quick session , particularity since numerous applications will use them . 
 CPU : The DSi has two ARM architecture CPUs : <unk> clocked at 133 MHz and <unk> clocked at 33 MHz . Its <unk> is twice as fast as previous models . 
 RAM : 16 MB ( four times as much as previous models ) 
 Screen resolution : 256 × 192 pixels ( same as previous models ) 
 Cameras : 640 × 480 pixels 
 Storage : 256 MB of internal flash memory with an SD card ( up to 2 GB ) and SDHC card ( up to 32 GB ) expansion slot 
 Battery : Shorter than the DS Lite , regardless of brightness setting ; for example , the DSi has a battery life of 9 – 14 hours on the lowest brightness setting , compared to the 15 – 19 hours of the DS Lite on the same setting . The battery is an 840 mAh internal rechargeable , compared to 1000 mAh for the DS Lite , and has an optimal lifespan of approximately 500 cycles ; after this point , it may be replaced by the user .

 The Nintendo DSi XL features larger screens , and a greater overall size , than the original DSi . It is the fourth DS model , the first to be available as a pure size variation . Iwata said that cost restraints had , until then , limited the screen size and multiplayer aspects of portable game consoles , and that the DSi XL offers " an improved view angle on the screens " , which makes it the first " portable system that can be enjoyed with people surrounding the gamer . " He argued that this introduces a new method of playing portable video games , wherein those " surrounding the game player can also join in one way or the other to the gameplay . " While the original DSi was specifically designed for individual use , Iwata suggested that DSi XL buyers give the console a " steady place on a table in the living room , " so that it might be shared by multiple household members . 
 The DSi XL is the longest , widest and heaviest DS model . The console features two 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) wide @-@ viewing @-@ angle LCD screens with the same resolution as the smaller model . It has improved battery life over the DSi on all brightness settings ; for example , batteries last 13 – 17 hours at the dimmest setting . The handheld is outfitted with identical speakers contained in larger speaker enclosures , enabling them to produce louder sound . The hinges stop the screen at 120 ° in addition to the original DSi 's position of 155 ° to allow easier table @-@ top viewing . The DSi XL is bundled with two longer styli , one of which is thicker , rounded , and pen @-@ like , and does not fit inside the unit . 
 The DSi XL has a matte surface , and the exterior of its top panel is coated with a gloss finish . It is available in eight two @-@ toned colors , varying by region such as white , green , red , yellow , and pink . Two special @-@ edition models were released : those for <unk> + and the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. <unk> Studio and the Nintendo DSi Browser come pre @-@ installed with the DSi XL , alongside other , region @-@ specific software . 
 = = Features = = 
 Like the Wii , the DSi has upgradeable firmware , and features a menu interface that displays applications as selectable icons . The seven primary icons represent " Card Software " , " Nintendo DSi Camera " , " Nintendo DSi Sound " , " Nintendo DSi Shop " , " DS Download Play " , " <unk> " , and " system settings " ; additional applications may be downloaded from the DSi Shop . Icons are set in a grid navigable with the stylus or D @-@ pad , and may be re @-@ arranged via drag @-@ and @-@ drop . The power button can either soft reset the console , returning it to the main menu , or shut it down . Game cards may be hot swapped when the console is set to the main menu , allowing players to switch game cards without shutting down . 
 The DSi has more extensive multimedia features than previous models ; AAC audio files from other devices , pictures , and downloadable software can be stored to an SD card . The latter two do not need external storage and can be stored internally . Before taking a photograph , users may modify the viewfinder 's live image with ten " lens " options . Images captured can be uploaded to the Wii 's Photo Channel , and , for consoles with the 1 @.@ 4 firmware update or greater , to the social networking website Facebook . 
 The built @-@ in sound player has voice recording and music playback functionality . Voice recordings can be edited with audio filters and manipulated through pitch and playback . Users may save and modify up to 18 ten @-@ second sound clips . These clips cannot be exported to an SD card . Users can play music from SD cards with visualizations displayed on the upper screen . AAC audio with <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> filename extensions are supported , but non @-@ AAC formats , including MP3 , are not supported . Sounds like drum beats and the classic Mario jumping noises can be added with button presses . Playing music also has its own set of manipulation options similar to those used for voice recordings , as well as a group of audio filters . Using headphones , music can be played when the case is closed . Users may export photos , sounds , and Internet settings to a 3DS . 
 = = = Internet connectivity = = = 
 The Nintendo DSi connects to the Internet via either its built @-@ in 802.11b / g Wi @-@ Fi or a Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi USB Connector ; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection service . The DSi supports WEP , WPA ( AES / <unk> ) , and <unk> ( AES / <unk> ) wireless encryption ; only software with built @-@ in support can use the latter two encryption types , as they were not supported by the DS and DS Lite . Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved ; using the traditional setup method , the first three profiles support WEP encryption , while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option , which supports WPA encryption . Under this advanced option , users may access the Wi @-@ Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings . The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi @-@ Fi connections . The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games , access to the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection and DSi Shop , and may have location @-@ specific content . 
 = = Software library = = 
 All DS games are compatible with the DSi , except those that require the GBA slot . Because of its absence , the DSi is not backward compatible with GBA Game Paks or with accessories that require the GBA slot , such as the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak and the Guitar Hero : On Tour series guitar grip . " DSi @-@ enhanced " game cards contain DSi @-@ exclusive features , but can still be used with earlier models ; " DSi @-@ exclusive " game cards cannot . The DSi is Nintendo 's first region @-@ locked handheld ; it prevents using certain software released for another region . Due to regional differences in Internet services and parental controls , DSi @-@ specific software is region locked . However , cartridge software compatible with previous models , Internet browsing , and photo sharing are not locked . Homebrew flash cards designed for previous DS models are incompatible with the DSi , but new cards capable of running DS software on a DSi were available . 
 Like the Wii , the DSi can connect to an online store . The store , called the DSi Shop , allows users to download DSiWare games and applications , which are paid for with a Nintendo Points <unk> Card ( previously known as Wii Points <unk> Card ) . Application prices follow a three @-@ tiered pricing scheme . The service launched with the DSi Browser , a free web browser developed by Opera Software and Nintendo . A DSiWare trial campaign , whose expiration date varied by region , formerly offered 1 @,@ 000 free Nintendo Points to each DSi that accesses the DSi Shop . As of June 2011 , over 350 downloadable games were available , varying by region . Purchased DSiWare on DSi or DSi XL consoles cannot be transferred between units unless that console is repaired or replaced by Nintendo . Most DSiWare can be transferred to a 3DS , however saved data cannot . Nintendo DSi Points will become unredeemable on September 30 , 2016 , and the entire Nintendo DSi Shop will shut down on March 31 , 2017 .

 The Nintendo DSi received generally positive reviews . Critics praised many of the console 's changes to the DS Lite 's aesthetic and functionality , but complained that it launched with insufficient exclusive software . IGN 's Craig Harris noted that the DSi @-@ exclusive software library and DSi Shop were lacking in content even after five months on the Japanese market . Jeff Bakalar of CNET said that owners of the original DS should consider buying a DSi , but that its only incentive for DS Lite owners was the DSi Shop . PCWorld New Zealand 's Jan Birkeland shared Bakalar 's opinion , but believed that it was too early to judge the quality of DSi Shop software . Many critics were disappointed by the removal of the GBA cartridge slot , but some of them , such as PCWorld 's Darren Gladstone , Bit @-@ tech 's Joe Martin , and IGN 's Harris and Lowe , believed that it was a reasonable exchange for SD card support and the DSi Shop . However , Bakalar stated , " We 'd gladly give up the 4 millimeters [ of reduced thickness ] to be able to play any Game Boy Advance game . " 
 Most reviewers criticized the quality of its cameras , particularly due to their resolution in comparison to contemporaneous mobile phones . They considered them sufficient for the DSi 's screens , however . Harris and Lowe believed that the camera 's only use was to take " silly pictures of yourself and others " . They complained about the difficulty of taking photographs in low @-@ light environments , and said that low @-@ light images were tinged green or blue . Opinions on the DSi 's photograph @-@ editing tools were varied : Bit @-@ tech 's Martin and Reid considered them to be a gimmick , but Bakalar and Cliff Edwards of BusinessWeek thought otherwise . Edwards said that the camera 's use in gameplay was a new opportunity for developers ; Martin did not think that the concept would be widely adopted , as he believed it to be " a gimmick that would alienate [ ... ] DS Lite owners " . Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell speculated that the DSi follows Game & Watch and Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi 's philosophy of using dated technology developers are familiar with to introduce new game design concepts that are inexpensive enough for mass production at a profit . He argued its features are designed to " briefly entertain " early adopters while encouraging " developers to consider it as an alternative [ of the DS Lite ] " to build an attractive game library for the long term . 
 Because of the DSi 's additions to the DS Lite design , critics recommended the console to those who had not purchased a previous DS model . Pete Metzger of the Los Angeles Times considered the DSi to be " more like version 2 @.@ 5 than a total reboot " , but called its new features " worthwhile additions to an already great product . " Gladstone gave the DSi a score of 75 / 100 , and said that Nintendo " puts in smart nips and tucks to its already @-@ svelte handheld while adding a raft of useful multimedia features . " Harris and Lowe defined the console 's hardware redesign as " evolutionary " , rather than " revolutionary " . After the DSi was unveiled , Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew J. <unk> called the DSi Shop a " tangible early threat " to big @-@ box stores and retailers . Martin believed that the cameras and DSi Shop did not justify purchasing the DSi at launch , but , in line with the general consensus , saw potential in future software for the console . 
 Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought previously existing Nintendo DS games were revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL 's larger screens ; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text , respectively . CVG 's Mike Jackson argued that the bigger screens , which made its unchanged resolution <unk> , would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed . However , Jackson and IGN 's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution . Carol <unk> of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL , but the larger screens were not enough of an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade . Lowe , Burke , Jackson , and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade ; Jackson explained " if you tend not to carry it out with you , and only ever tend to use it at home , then the DSi XL is the better choice " . 
 = Joking Apart = 
 Joking Apart is a BBC television sitcom written by Steven Moffat about the rise and fall of a relationship . It juxtaposes a couple , Mark ( Robert Bathurst ) and Becky ( Fiona Gillies ) , who fall in love and marry , before getting separated and finally divorced . The twelve episodes , broadcast between 1993 and 1995 , were directed by Bob Spiers and produced by Andre Ptaszynski for independent production company Pola Jones . 
 The show is semi @-@ autobiographical ; it was inspired by the then @-@ recent separation of Moffat and his first wife . Some of the episodes in the first series followed a non @-@ linear parallel structure , contrasting the rise of the relationship with the fall . Other episodes were ensemble farces , predominantly including the couple 's friends Robert ( Paul Raffield ) and Tracy ( Tracie Bennett ) . Paul Mark Elliott also appeared as Trevor , Becky 's lover . 
 Scheduling problems meant that the show attracted low viewing figures . However , it scored highly on the Appreciation Index and accrued a loyal fanbase . One fan acquired the home video rights from the BBC and released both series on his own DVD label .

 By 1990 , Moffat had written two series of Press Gang , but the programme 's high cost along with organisational changes at Central cast its future in doubt . As Moffat wondered what to do next and worried about his future employment , Bob Spiers , Press Gang 's primary director , suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom . Moffat 's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang , so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk , a series that eventually aired in 1997 . 
 As he was separating from his wife , Moffat was going through a difficult period and aspects of it coloured his creative output . He introduced a proxy of his wife 's new partner into the Press Gang episode " The Big Finish ? " , the character Brian Magboy ( Simon Schatzberger ) . Moffat scripted unfortunate situations for the Magboy character , such as having a typewriter drop on his foot . Moffat says that the character 's name was inspired by his wife 's : " Magboy : Maggie 's boy " . 
 During the pitch meeting at the Groucho Club , Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of his initial proposal , a school sitcom . Taking Ptaszynski 's advice , Moffat 's new idea was about " a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him " . Speaking about the autobiographical elements of the show , the writer jokes that he has to remember that his wife didn 't leave him for an estate agent ; his wife was an estate agent . In 2003 , Moffat told The New York Times that his " ex @-@ wife wasn 't terribly pleased about her failed marriage being presented as a sitcom on BBC2 on Monday nights " . In an interview with Richard Herring , Moffat says that " the sit @-@ com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage " . Conversely , his later sitcom Coupling was based on his relationship with his second wife , TV producer Sue Vertue . Moffat reused the surname ' Taylor ' , which is Mark 's surname in Joking Apart , for Jack Davenport 's character Steve in Coupling . 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 The pilot , directed by John Kilby , was filmed at Pebble Mill in Birmingham on 9 – 10 August 1990 . It is practically identical to the first episode of the series proper ; some scenes are even reused , notably the scene with Mark and Becky meeting when he accidentally turns up at a funeral . The reused footage gave rise to the first episode 's shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby . The stand @-@ up sequences were shot against a black background . Although this made it clearer that they were not " real " , Moffat thought that it looked odd . The pilot was transmitted on BBC2 as part of its Comic Asides series of pilot shows on 12 July 1991 . 
 Moffat had written all six episodes of the first series before recording commenced . Never again would he be so far in advance of production . With series two , he had written only the first four episodes by the time recording had commenced , only delivering the final episode by the first day of rehearsals . 
 All of the location shots were filmed at the beginning of the production block . Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director 's home . The stand @-@ up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London 's Fulham Road , now known as the Valmont Club , and were shot for the benefit of the studio audience , with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version . Robert Bathurst has complained that , in order to save £ 5 @,@ 000 , this promised reshoot never materialised . The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in the studio for the second series , with stock footage of the club 's audience reused . 
 After the exterior shots had been filmed , the episodes were recorded at BBC Television Centre in April and May 1992 for the first series , and 12 November until 18 December 1993 for the second . Studio recording sessions were normally completed quickly ; Gillies recalls " an hour and a half , tops " . To a large extent , the editing occurred live during the studio recording with only tightening later . At the end of the recording on Sunday evenings Spiers would review the show before retiring to the bar , with the bulk of the work complete . Moffat compares this to the editing of modern sitcoms , which , he says , are edited more like film . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Many of the first six episodes of Joking Apart were constructed non @-@ sequentially , with scenes from the beginning of the relationship juxtaposed with those from the end . Moffat describes this non @-@ linear technique as a " romantic comedy , but a romantic comedy backwards because it ends with the couple unhappy " . Moffat had experimented with non @-@ linear narrative in Press Gang , notably the episode " Monday @-@ Tuesday " . Various episodes of Coupling played with structure , such as the fourth series episode " 9 ½ Minutes " which showed the same events from three perspectives . 
 All of the episodes open with Bathurst portraying Mark Taylor , a sitcom writer , apparently performing stand @-@ up in a small comedy club . These performances are fantasy sequences , playing out in the character 's mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues ; these monologues mainly employ material from the character 's failing marriage and are intended to show that " he thinks in punchlines , in comedy " . Episodes regularly cut back to these fantasy performances , which usually open with the signature line : " My wife left me ... " . Moffat felt that audiences needed to know from the start that the relationship would not survive . However , it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer 's mind ; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand @-@ up comic , not a sitcom writer . 
 In the fantasy sequences for the pilot , Bathurst was filmed against a completely black backdrop , which Moffat describes as " hell to look at " . For the series , the sequences were filmed in a real club . Moffat describes this as the " wrong direction " as it became unclear that the fantasy sequences were " not real " . Moffat observes that , like Seinfeld , an American sitcom that used a similar device , Joking Apart would use less of the stand @-@ up as the series progressed . In retrospect , Moffat regrets including the stand @-@ up sequences . Bathurst , however , has considered refilming them as a video diary . Now with older features , he can portray a Mark Taylor reflecting on his earlier life . Both are very critical of the sequences in the DVD audio commentaries . The sequences have also drawn the sharpest criticisms from reviewers . The second series followed a more linear structure , although it retained the stand @-@ up sequences . 
 = = = Music and titles = = = 
 " Fool ( If You Think It 's Over ) " , written by Chris Rea , was used for both the opening and closing credit sequences . The original Rea version was used for the pilot 's closing credits , but for the series it was performed by Kenny Craddock , who arranged the incidental music with Colin Gibson . Beginning with a saxophone , only the chorus of the theme song accompanied the opening titles . These ran over legal imagery and a sequence of images of famous separated couples , including Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe ; Winnie and Nelson Mandela ; The Princess Anne and Mark Phillips , and culminating in Mark and Becky . The closing credits featured a verse and chorus . The first part of the closing credits was usually over a still of the final frame , and faded to black with the line " All dressed in black . "

 Mark Taylor ( Robert Bathurst ) is a television sitcom writer . Other than episode one , where he is shown working on a script and references to a show of his that had aired during a dinner with Robert and Tracy the night before , his work is hardly mentioned . Mark is quick @-@ witted , and the stand @-@ up sequences indicate that he thinks in one @-@ liners . However , this proves to be the downfall of his marriage with Becky , who says that she didn 't sign on to become his " lawfully wedded straight man " . In one episode , Mark jokes about worrying if his virginity will heal back ; Becky articulates her frustration by responding " What page is that on ? " Identifying his insecurities , she points out that the " thing about someone who uses humour as a weapon , is not the sense of humour , but the fact that they need a weapon " . In interviews , Bathurst has compared Steven Moffat to his character : Mark is " a man whose wife leaves him because he talks in one @-@ liners . And Steven Moffat 's wife had just left him , because he talks in one @-@ liners . " 
 Robert Bathurst , a former Footlights president , was cast as Mark Taylor . He was performing on a live topical programme on BSB called Up Yer News . A fellow performer on that show also auditioned for the part at what is now the Soho Theatre , then the old Soho Synagogue in Dean Street , and claimed that he would break Bathurst 's legs if the latter got the job . In a 2005 interview , Bathurst recalls that the threat seemed not to be entirely jocular . Bathurst speaks very highly of Joking Apart , identifying it as a " career highlight " and the most enjoyable job he has ever done . Retrospectively , he wishes that he had " roughened up " Mark , as he was " too <unk> " . 
 Becky Johnson / Taylor ( Fiona Gillies ) meets Mark at a funeral and they eventually marry . Although irritated at being his comic foil , she is capable of her own quick @-@ witted put @-@ downs . In episode 3 , for example , she wins an impromptu one @-@ liner contest over Mark , whose put @-@ downs fall flat . Becky is shown as an independent woman , meeting Mark on her terms . The first series revolves around her leaving Mark for estate agent Trevor , whom she subsequently cheats in series two . This was Fiona Gillies ' first major television role , having appeared in " The Hound of the Baskervilles " , a 1988 episode of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , and the mini @-@ series Mother Love . She was aware that some of her dialogue was based on what had been said to Moffat during his own separation . 
 Robert and Tracy Glazebrook ( Paul Raffield and Tracie Bennett ) are their " increasingly bizarre and totally dim friends " . They are initially Becky 's friends , but soon befriend Mark , comforting him on the night Becky leaves him . Tracy , as Tracie Bennett identifies , is a stereotypical Tracy — normally a <unk> for an intellectually inadequate , usually blonde , female . However , " she 's not a bimbo : she 's quite clever in her own logic " . Bennett jokes that she was quite offended that such a character was named Tracy . Tracy 's catchphrase of " you 're a silly " was originally Moffat 's typographical error , which Bennett faithfully reproduced in her performance . They decided that the amended version worked well for the character . 
 They are both naive about sex and technology . Tracy , for example , attempts to telephone Robert to inform him that he 's lost his mobile phone , and believes that she is a lesbian when she discovers her husband in women 's clothing . They have a baby , who is seen or referred to occasionally . This reflects , as the writer observes , Moffat 's inexperience of looking after children at the time . 
 Trevor ( Paul Mark Elliott ) is Becky 's lover . His job as an estate agent regularly provokes derision from Mark . ( Moffat 's ex @-@ wife was an estate agent . ) He is himself cheated on in the second series , as Becky dates her solicitor Michael ( Tony Gardner ) . His debut appearance is in the third episode where he and Becky go to Robert and Tracy 's house for dinner , but generally features less regularly than the main ensemble .

 The first episode showed the couple meeting at a funeral , marrying , and going through the honeymoon phase . The last section of the episode features a confrontation between Becky and Mark , in which the former admits that she is an adulteress before realising that all of her friends were hiding around her living room in preparation for a surprise party for her . The story continues directly into episode two , when Robert and Tracy return to the flat to check on Mark after his wife 's departure . The three recall the circumstances in which they had first met . After their first date , the couple go back to Becky 's flat . While she is in the bathroom , he strips down to his boxer shorts and handcuffs himself to the bedpost . Unable to free himself , Robert and Tracy walk in on him . Moffat used a similar scenario for the Coupling episode " The Freckle , the Key , and the Couple who Weren 't " and reveals in its audio commentary that it is based on a situation with one of his ex @-@ girlfriends . 
 In the third episode , Mark arrives at Robert and Tracy 's house on the wrong night for a dinner party . The couple are entertaining that night , but are instead expecting Becky and her new boyfriend Trevor . Hopeful of a reconciliation , Mark assumes that his friends are trying to smooth things over between them . They spend the evening trying to keep Mark and Trevor apart , each not knowing that the other is also there . Episode five makes extensive use of what Moffat labels " techno @-@ farce " , which uses technology , predominantly telephones , to facilitate the farcical situations . Moffat considers this episode the best of the show . Discussing the series as a whole , he feels that the story ends after this episode . It begins when Mark attempts to return Robert 's " portable telephone " and ends with Robert threatening to shoot Mark after the latter has slept with Tracy . The series ends with Becky and Trevor , and Robert and Tracy reconciling their relationships and Mark being left alone . 
 = = = Series two = = = 
 The format was changed for this series , with the dual timelines and much of the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative . Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point going back to the start . Set two months after the end of series one , Mark meets Becky in a newsagent , where he is purchasing pornographic magazines . He discovers the location of Becky and Trevor 's house and breaks in using Tracy 's keys . However , he is forced to hide under the bed when Becky and Trevor return home . Listening to them having sex , he becomes optimistic when he thinks that Becky begins to shout his name ( " M ... " ) . The name turns out to be Michael ( Tony Gardner ) , Becky 's solicitor with whom she is now cheating on Trevor . 
 Robert and Tracy are given more stories than in the first series . Their main story arc begins in the third episode when Robert is caught by all of the main characters and his parents in a maid 's outfit being spanked by a prostitute . The couple temporarily separate while Robert experiments with cross @-@ dressing , but they are reunited by the end of the series . 
 The fourth episode features a scene where Mark jams his dressing gown in the door and is forced to hide naked in his new neighbour 's flat . This sequence was Moffat 's revenge for Bathurst 's late arrival at the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street , London . Moffat threatened that if they ever did a second series he would write a whole episode in which Bathurst was naked . After being mistaken for a flasher , Mark is punched by his neighbour 's brother . When he awakens he is confronted by a man ( Kerry Shale ) in a red polo neck jumper who claims to be " his very best friend " . In the fifth episode it transpires that the man , who identifies himself as Dick , is the personification of Mark 's penis . 
 The final episode begins after Becky and Michael had slept together while house sitting for Tracy and Robert , and Michael hides in the bathroom when the latter couple return . Tracy phones a morning television phone @-@ in show ( hosted by Michael Thomas and Helen Atkinson @-@ Wood , with appearances by Rachael Fielding and Jonathan Barlow ) , and when she realises that the show 's divorce expert is hiding in her bathroom she takes on his role ( with a heavy Northern accent , actually a slightly exaggerated version of Bennett 's own voice ) to give herself advice on the other line . Bennett says this was the hardest thing she has had to do in her career . 
 = = Scheduling = = 
 After the pilot was transmitted on 12 July 1991 , the BBC were interested in a series . However , Moffat had signed on to write the third and fourth series of Press Gang as one twelve @-@ episode block so it was not until 1992 that they produced the series . After being postponed from the autumn schedules , the first series was transmitted on Thursday evenings on BBC2 from 7 January until 11 February 1993 . 
 The second series was filmed in late 1993 . However , the controller of BBC2 , Michael Jackson , had little faith in the project at the time , which , according to the writer , he now admits was wrong . Jackson felt that it was too mainstream for BBC2 and not mainstream enough for BBC1 . The second series was scheduled to air from 11 June 1994 , but was delayed many times . Bathurst articulates the group 's frustration at the delay : 
 Every so often , I ’ d get a call from the producer saying , it ’ s going out at this time . The publicity people would be alerted , then we ’ d get a call saying no , it ’ s not , it ’ s been put back . That happened six times , I think , altogether – seven <unk> in a year or so ... It was extraordinary and inexplicable , and just one of these things that happen . I mean , a lot of shows are left on people ’ s desks and they hardly get seen , and Joking Apart was certainly one of those . Meanwhile , they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire , and you thought , " Bloody Hell ! Come on , surely … . ? " To my mind , our show was a very superior product , and it upset me that other shows , which I , personally , felt were broader and less interesting , were getting precedence . 
 The first series was repeated in preparation for the six episodes of the second series , which began transmission on Tuesday evenings from 3 January until 7 February 1995 . The second series was only transmitted once even though the BBC had paid to show it twice . Moffat feels that the delay damaged the series because such bad scheduling hinders returning audiences and that the two @-@ year gap meant that it seemed as if Mark " had been banging on about this sodding divorce for an awfully long time ! " 
 After winning the Montreux award it seemed inevitable that the show would get a third series . At a Christmas party , a BBC executive had plans for the ratings of a third series " to go like Everest " , indicating a steep slope with his hands . Bathurst replied , " But , Everest goes down the other side ... " The show was not recommissioned . Moffat says that he had no idea for a third series anyway , as it would have been difficult to contrive how a group of people who did not particularly like each other would get together so regularly . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The scheduling problems meant that the show did not get the momentum to achieve high viewing figures . Moffat jokes that " the eight people who saw it were very happy indeed " . However , as Bathurst observes , " there 's an underground of people who like it " . The show rated highly on the Appreciation Index , meaning that viewers thought very highly of the programme . Bathurst says that drunks on the London Underground tell him in detail the plot of their favourite episode . The cast claim that the programme has a timeless , universal appeal as there are no time @-@ specific references apart from the typewriter and the size of the mobile telephones . Gillies says that her accountant watches it to cheer himself up , while Bathurst recalls that a friend cheered so loudly when Mark pushes avocado into Trevor 's face in the third episode that he woke his son . 
 Critical reception was generally positive . In his overview of Moffat 's celebrated Press Gang , Paul Cornell said that the writer " continues to impress " with Joking Apart . The Daily Express said that it was " flavoured with a delicious bitterness about the perfidy of women and the conscious @-@ less nature of the male orgasm , it was plotted with the intricacy of a French farce " . Another reviewer for the Express commented that " it 's quite funny and an acute analysis " of the modern divorce , and that the first episode was " distinctly promising " . Similarly DVD Review comments that " Moffat 's distillation of his marriage melting down is as precise a piece of comic writing as you 're likely to find . " 
 Not all reviews were completely positive . Criticising Bathurst for being too handsome to convey the frustrations of a writer , the Daily Telegraph said that the show had " its problems but possesses a dark , mordant wit " . William Gallagher comments that " Press Gang was pretty flawless , but Joking Apart would veer from brilliance to schoolboy humour from week to week . " 
 While the transmission of series two was being delayed by BBC 2 controller Michael Jackson , the show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys . The show was remade in Portugal but used a linear structure rather than the flashbacks . Moffat reflects that although the remake is " not as dark or ground @-@ breaking " as the original , it is " probably more fun " because it ends happily . 
 = = DVD release = = 
 Both series have been released on DVD . The DVD is notable because a fan of the show , Craig Robins , bought the rights from <unk> , BBC Worldwide 's DVD interest , and released it on his own independent label , Replay DVD . Robins put up £ 30 @,@ 000 of his own money to buy the rights and produced the series one disc . As a professional videotape editor , Robins was able to restore the video , and author the disc himself , using a piece of freeware to transcribe the dialogue for the subtitles . 
 The first series was released on DVD on 29 May 2006 . It contains audio commentaries on four of the episodes from Moffat , Bathurst , Gillies and Bennett . It also contains a featurette , " Fool If You Think It 's Over " , with retrospective interviews . The second series was released on 17 March 2008 as a two @-@ disc set . It contains audio commentaries on all episodes : five featuring a mix of Moffat , Bathurst , Gillies , Bennett , Raffield and Ptaszynski , with episode two featuring Spiers , and production manager Stacey Adair that concentrates on the behind @-@ the @-@ scenes production . The pilot from Comic Asides is also included on Disc 2 , along with a complete set of Series Two scripts in Portable Document Format ( PDF ) and a PDF article entitled " Joking Apart In The Studio " . The release includes a companion booklet . 
 Replay DVD was commended in reviews for the quality of the disc . DVD Times reports that " Joking Apart looks much sharper than the average television show on DVD . The colours are also much richer and have obviously been fixed throughout to present a more uniform image while the picture is bright and clear . " The featurette on the series 1 set is labelled " a great little feature " , with Moffat particularly praised for his contribution . DVD Times identifies " a real sense of friendship and of a real liking for this show " within the commentaries , highlighting that Moffat " sounds really happy ... for Joking Apart to have finally gotten some recognition " . 
 = Fluorine = 
 Fluorine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number 9 . It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions . As the most electronegative element , it is extremely reactive : almost all other elements , including some noble gases , form compounds with fluorine . 
 Among the elements , fluorine ranks 24th in universal abundance and 13th in terrestrial abundance . Fluorite , the primary mineral source of fluorine , was first described in 1529 ; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting , the Latin verb fluo meaning " flow " became associated with it . Proposed as an element in 1810 , fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds , and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts . Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low @-@ temperature electrolysis , a process still employed for modern production . Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment , its largest application , began during the Manhattan Project in World War II . 
 Owing to the expense of refining pure fluorine , most commercial applications use fluorine compounds , with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking . The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides , or into cryolite which plays a key role in aluminium refining . Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability ; their major uses are as refrigerants , electrical insulation and cookware , the last as PTFE ( Teflon ) . Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine , and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities , and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation . Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US $ 15 billion a year . 
 Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global @-@ warming potentials 100 to 20 @,@ 000 times that of carbon dioxide . <unk> compounds persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon – fluorine bond . Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals ; a few plants synthesize organofluorine poisons that deter herbivores . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Electron configuration = = = 
 Fluorine atoms have nine electrons , one fewer than neon , and electron configuration <unk> : two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one more to be filled . The outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding , and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 − 2 = 7 ; this affects the atom 's physical properties . 
 Fluorine 's first ionization energy is third @-@ highest among all elements , behind helium and neon , which complicates the removal of electrons from neutral fluorine atoms . It also has a high electron affinity , second only to chlorine , and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon ; it has the highest electronegativity of any element . Fluorine atoms have a small covalent radius of around 60 picometers , similar to those of its period neighbors oxygen and neon . 
 = = = Reactivity = = = 
 The bond energy of <unk> is much lower than that of either Cl 
 2 or Br 
 2 and similar to the easily cleaved peroxide bond ; this , along with high electronegativity , accounts for fluorine 's easy dissociation , high reactivity , and strong bonds to non @-@ fluorine atoms . Conversely , bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine 's high electronegativity . <unk> substances like powdered steel , glass fragments , and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas ; wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet . 
 Reactions of elemental fluorine with metals require varying conditions . Alkali metals cause explosions and alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk ; to prevent passivation from the formation of metal fluoride layers , most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered , and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at 300 – 450 ° C ( 575 – 850 ° F ) . Some solid nonmetals ( sulfur , phosphorus ) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine . Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine , the latter sometimes explosively ; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity , requiring elevated temperatures . 
 Hydrogen , like some of the alkali metals , reacts explosively with fluorine . Carbon , as lamp black , reacts at room temperature to yield <unk> . Graphite combines with fluorine above 400 ° C ( 750 ° F ) to produce non @-@ stoichiometric carbon monofluoride ; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons , sometimes with explosions . Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature , whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions : even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride , normally incombustible , may explode . Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable , nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur , due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen ; ammonia may react explosively . Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions , but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures ; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated . Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon ; of the other noble gases , only xenon and krypton react , and only under special conditions . 
 = = = Phases = = = 
 At room temperature , fluorine is a gas of diatomic molecules , pale yellow when pure ( sometimes described as yellow @-@ green ) . It has a characteristic pungent odor detectable at 20 ppb . Fluorine condenses into a bright yellow liquid at − 188 ° C ( − 306 ° F ) , a transition temperature similar to those of oxygen and nitrogen . 
 Fluorine has two solid forms , α- and β @-@ fluorine . The latter crystallizes at − 220 ° C ( − 364 ° F ) and is transparent and soft , with the same disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen , unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens . Further cooling to − 228 ° C ( − 378 ° F ) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α @-@ fluorine , which has a monoclinic structure with dense , angled layers of molecules . The transition from β- to α @-@ fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine , and can be violent . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Only one isotope of fluorine occurs naturally in abundance , the stable isotope 19F . It has a high <unk> ratio and exceptional sensitivity to magnetic fields ; because it is also the only stable isotope , it is used in magnetic resonance imaging . Seventeen radioisotopes with mass numbers from 14 to 31 have been synthesized , of which 18F is the most stable with a half @-@ life of 109 @.@ 77 minutes . Other radioisotopes have half @-@ lives less than 70 seconds ; most decay in less than half a second . The isotopes 17F and 18F undergo β + decay , lighter isotopes decay by electron capture , and those heavier than 19F undergo β − decay or neutron emission . One metastable isomer of fluorine is known , <unk> , with a half @-@ life of 234 nanoseconds .

 = = = Universe = = = 
 Among the lighter elements , fluorine 's abundance value of 400 ppb ( parts per billion ) – 24th among elements in the universe – is exceptional : other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common . This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine , and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections , allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively . 
 Beyond this transient existence , three explanations have been proposed for the presence of fluorine : 
 during type II supernovae , bombardment of neon atoms by neutrinos could transmute them to fluorine ; 
 the solar wind of Wolf – Rayet stars could blow fluorine away from any hydrogen or helium atoms ; or 
 fluorine is borne out on convection currents arising from fusion in asymptotic giant branch stars .

 Fluorine is the thirteenth most common element in Earth 's crust at 600 – 700 ppm ( parts per million ) by mass . Elemental fluorine in Earth 's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric water vapor , precluding its natural occurrence ; it is found only in combined mineral forms , of which fluorite , fluorapatite and cryolite are the most industrially significant . Fluorite or fluorspar ( CaF 
 2 ) , colorful and abundant worldwide , is fluorine 's main source ; China and Mexico are the major suppliers . The U.S. led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995 . Although fluorapatite ( <unk> ( PO4 ) 3F ) contains most of the world 's fluorine , its low mass fraction of 3 @.@ 5 % means that most of it is used as a phosphate . In the U.S. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via fluorosilicic acid , a phosphate industry byproduct . <unk> ( Na 
 <unk> 
 6 ) , once used directly in aluminium production , is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals . The main commercial mine on Greenland 's west coast closed in 1987 , and most cryolite is now synthesized . 
 Other minerals such as topaz contain fluorine . Fluorides , unlike other halides , are insoluble and do not occur in commercially favorable concentrations in saline waters . Trace quantities of organofluorines of uncertain origin have been detected in volcanic eruptions and geothermal springs . The existence of gaseous fluorine in crystals , suggested by the smell of crushed antozonite , is contentious ; a 2012 study reported the presence of 0 @.@ 04 % F 
 2 by weight in antozonite , attributing these inclusions to radiation from the presence of tiny amounts of uranium .

 = = = Early discoveries = = = 
 In 1529 , Georgius Agricola described fluorite as an additive used to lower the melting point of metals during smelting . He penned the Latin word <unk> ( fluo , flow ) for fluorite rocks . The name later evolved into fluorspar ( still commonly used ) and then fluorite . The composition of fluorite was later determined to be calcium difluoride . 
 Hydrofluoric acid was used in glass etching from 1720 onwards . Andreas Sigismund Marggraf first characterized it in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid , and the resulting solution corroded its glass container . Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele repeated the experiment in 1771 , and named the acidic product <unk> @-@ spats @-@ <unk> ( fluorspar acid ) . In 1810 , the French physicist André @-@ Marie Ampère suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid . Sir Humphry Davy proposed that this then @-@ unknown substance be named fluorine from fluoric acid and the -ine suffix of other halogens . This word , with modifications , is used in most European languages ; Greek , Russian , and some others ( following Ampère 's suggestion ) use the name <unk> or derivatives , from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> , destructive ) . The New Latin name <unk> gave the element its current symbol F ; Fl was used in early papers . 
 = = = Isolation = = = 
 Initial studies on fluorine were so dangerous that several 19th @-@ century experimenters were deemed " fluorine martyrs " after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid . Isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme corrosiveness of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride , as well as the lack of a simple and suitable electrolyte . Edmond Frémy postulated that electrolysis of pure hydrofluoric acid to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce anhydrous samples from acidified potassium bifluoride ; instead , he discovered that the resulting ( dry ) hydrogen fluoride did not conduct electricity . Frémy 's former student Henri Moissan persevered , and after much trial and error found that a mixture of potassium bifluoride and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor , enabling electrolysis . To prevent rapid corrosion of the platinum in his electrochemical cells , he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and iridium , and used fluorite stoppers . In 1886 , after 74 years of effort by many chemists , Moissan isolated elemental fluorine . 
 In 1906 , two months before his death , Moissan received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , with the following citation : 
 [ I ] n recognition of the great services rendered by him in his investigation and isolation of the element fluorine ... The whole world has admired the great experimental skill with which you have studied that savage beast among the elements .

 The <unk> division of General Motors ( GM ) experimented with chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants in the late 1920s , and Kinetic Chemicals was formed as a joint venture between GM and DuPont in 1930 hoping to market Freon @-@ 12 ( CCl 
 2F 
 2 ) as one such refrigerant . It replaced earlier and more toxic compounds , increased demand for kitchen refrigerators , and became profitable ; by 1949 DuPont had bought out Kinetic and marketed several other Freon compounds . Polytetrafluoroethylene ( Teflon ) was serendipitously discovered in 1938 by Roy J. Plunkett while working on refrigerants at Kinetic , and its superlative chemical and thermal resistance lent it to accelerated commercialization and mass production by 1941 . 
 Large @-@ scale production of elemental fluorine began during World War II . Germany used high @-@ temperature electrolysis to make tons of the planned incendiary chlorine trifluoride and the Manhattan Project used huge quantities to produce uranium hexafluoride for uranium enrichment . Since UF 
 6 is as corrosive as fluorine , gaseous diffusion plants required special materials : nickel for membranes , fluoropolymers for seals , and liquid fluorocarbons as coolants and lubricants . This burgeoning nuclear industry later drove post @-@ war fluorochemical development .

 Fluorine has a rich chemistry , encompassing organic and inorganic domains . It combines with metals , nonmetals , metalloids , and most noble gases , and usually assumes an oxidation state of − 1 . Fluorine 's high electron affinity results in a preference for ionic bonding ; when it forms covalent bonds , these are polar , and almost always single . 
 = = = Metals = = = 
 Alkali metals form ionic and highly soluble monofluorides ; these have the cubic arrangement of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides . Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water , with the exception of beryllium difluoride , which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz @-@ like structure . Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides . 
 Covalent bonding first comes to prominence in the tetrafluorides : those of zirconium , hafnium and several actinides are ionic with high melting points , while those of titanium , vanadium , and niobium are polymeric , melting or decomposing at no more than 350 ° C ( 660 ° F ) . <unk> continue this trend with their linear polymers and oligomeric complexes . Thirteen metal hexafluorides are known , all octahedral , and are mostly volatile solids but for liquid <unk> 
 6 and <unk> 
 6 , and gaseous WF 
 6 . Rhenium heptafluoride , the only characterized metal heptafluoride , is a low @-@ melting molecular solid with pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry . Metal fluorides with more fluorine atoms are particularly reactive . 
 = = = Hydrogen = = = 
 Hydrogen and fluorine combine to yield hydrogen fluoride , in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding , resembling water more than hydrogen chloride . It boils at a much higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water . Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride , also known as hydrofluoric acid . Unlike the other hydrohalic acids , which are strong , hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations . However , it can attack glass , something the other acids cannot do . 
 = = = Other reactive nonmetals = = = 
 Metalloids are included in this section 
 Binary fluorides of metalloids and p @-@ block nonmetals are generally covalent and volatile , with varying reactivities . Period 3 and heavier nonmetals can form hypervalent fluorides . 
 Boron trifluoride is planar and possesses an incomplete octet . It functions as a Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts . Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert ; its group analogues , silicon and germanium tetrafluoride , are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids . The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight , although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic . The pentafluorides of phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides , with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known . 
 Chalcogens have diverse fluorides : unstable difluorides have been reported for oxygen ( the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of + 2 ) , sulfur , and selenium ; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur , selenium , and tellurium . The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms , so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert . Chlorine , bromine , and iodine can each form mono- , tri- , and pentafluorides , but only iodine heptafluoride has been characterized among possible interhalogen <unk> . Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms , and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine . 
 = = = Noble gases = = = 
 Noble gases , having complete electron shells , defied reaction with other elements until 1962 when Neil Bartlett reported synthesis of xenon hexafluoroplatinate ; xenon difluoride , tetrafluoride , hexafluoride , and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then . Among other noble gases , krypton forms a difluoride , and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride . Binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable : argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give argon fluorohydride . Helium and neon have no long @-@ lived fluorides , and no neon fluoride has ever been observed ; helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures . 
 = = = Organic compounds = = = 
 The carbon – fluorine bond is organic chemistry 's strongest , and gives stability to organofluorines . It is almost non @-@ existent in nature , but is used in artificial compounds . Research in this area is usually driven by commercial applications ; the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity inherent in organic chemistry . 
 = = = = Discrete molecules = = = = 
 The substitution of hydrogen atoms in an alkane by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties : melting and boiling points are lowered , density increases , solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases . <unk> , in which all hydrogen atoms are substituted , are insoluble in most organic solvents , reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia . 
 The term perfluorinated compound is used for what would otherwise be a perfluorocarbon if not for the presence of a functional group , often a carboxylic acid . These compounds share many properties with <unk> such as stability and hydrophobicity , while the functional group augments their reactivity , enabling them to adhere to surfaces or act as surfactants ; Fluorosurfactants , in particular , can lower the surface tension of water more than their hydrocarbon @-@ based analogues . <unk> , which have some <unk> carbon atoms near the functional group , are also regarded as perfluorinated . 
 = = = = Polymers = = = = 
 Polymers exhibit the same stability increases afforded by fluorine substitution ( for hydrogen ) in discrete molecules ; their melting points generally increase too . Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) , the simplest fluoropolymer and <unk> analogue of polyethylene with structural unit – CF 
 2 – , demonstrates this change as expected , but its very high melting point makes it difficult to mold . Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature @-@ tolerant but easier to mold : fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups , <unk> alkanes do the same with <unk> groups , and Nafion contains <unk> side chains capped with <unk> acid groups . Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms ; <unk> fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter , but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Industrial = = = 
 Moissan 's method is used to produce industrial quantities of fluorine , via the electrolysis of a potassium fluoride / hydrogen fluoride mixture : hydrogen and fluoride ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container cathode and a carbon block anode , under 8 – 12 volts , to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively . Temperatures are elevated , KF • <unk> melting at 70 ° C ( 158 ° F ) and being electrolyzed at 70 – 130 ° C ( 158 – 266 ° F ) . KF , which acts as catalyst , is essential since pure HF cannot be electrolyzed . Fluorine can be stored in steel cylinders that have passivated interiors , at temperatures below 200 ° C ( 392 ° F ) ; otherwise nickel can be used . Regulator valves and pipework are made of nickel , the latter possibly using Monel instead . Frequent passivation , along with the strict exclusion of water and greases , must be undertaken . In the laboratory , glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions ; some sources instead recommend nickel @-@ Monel @-@ PTFE systems . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 While preparing for a 1986 conference to celebrate the centennial of Moissan 's achievement , Karl O. Christe reasoned that chemical fluorine generation should be feasible since some metal fluoride anions have no stable neutral counterparts ; their acidification potentially triggers oxidation instead . He devised a method which evolves fluorine at high yield and atmospheric pressure : 
 2 KMnO4 + 2 KF + 10 HF + 3 H2O2 → 2 K2MnF6 + 8 H2O + 3 O2 ↑ 
 2 K2MnF6 + 4 <unk> → 4 <unk> + 2 <unk> + F2 ↑ 
 Christe later commented that the reactants " had been known for more than 100 years and even Moissan could have come up with this scheme . " As late as 2008 , some references still asserted that fluorine was too reactive for any chemical isolation . 
 = = Industrial applications = = 
 Fluorite mining , which supplies most global fluorine , peaked in 1989 when 5 @.@ 6 million metric tons of ore were extracted . <unk> restrictions lowered this to 3 @.@ 6 million tons in 1994 ; production has since been increasing . Around 4 @.@ 5 million tons of ore and revenue of US $ 550 million were generated in 2003 ; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $ 15 billion and predicted 2016 – 18 production figures of 3 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 9 million tons , and revenue of at least $ 20 billion . Froth flotation separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion : 60 – 85 % pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97 % + pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial intermediate hydrogen fluoride . 
 At least 17 @,@ 000 metric tons of fluorine are produced each year . It costs only $ 5 – 8 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride , but handling challenges multiply its price as an element , and most processes that use the latter in large amounts employ in situ generation under vertical integration . 
 The largest application of fluorine gas , consuming up to 7 @,@ 000 metric tons annually , is in the preparation of UF 
 6 for the nuclear fuel cycle . Fluorine is used to <unk> uranium tetrafluoride , itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid . Fluorine is monoisotopic , so any mass differences between UF 
 6 molecules are due to the presence of 235U or 238U , enabling uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion or gas centrifuge . About 6 @,@ 000 metric tons per year go into producing the inert dielectric SF 
 6 for high @-@ voltage transformers and circuit breakers , eliminating the need for hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls associated with oil @-@ filled devices . Several fluorine compounds are used in electronics : rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in chemical vapor deposition , <unk> in plasma etching and nitrogen trifluoride in cleaning equipment . Fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides , but its reactivity often necessitates conversion first to the gentler <unk> 
 3 , <unk> 
 3 , or IF 
 5 , which together allow calibrated fluorination . <unk> pharmaceuticals use sulfur tetrafluoride instead . 
 = = = Inorganic fluorides = = = 
 As with other iron alloys , around 3 kg ( 6 @.@ 5 lb ) metspar is added to each metric ton of steel ; the fluoride ions lower its melting point and viscosity . Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats , most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid , which is used in steel pickling , glass etching and alkane cracking . One @-@ third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride , both fluxes in the Hall – Héroult process for aluminium extraction ; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus . Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23 kg ( 51 lb ) of flux . <unk> consume the second largest portion , with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment , and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride . Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt , nickel , and ammonium . 
 = = = Organic fluorides = = = 
 <unk> consume over 20 % of mined fluorite and over 40 % of hydrofluoric acid , with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share . Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $ 1 billion in annual revenue . Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon – fluorine reactions above − 150 ° C ( − 240 ° F ) , industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect , mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as <unk> fluorination , in which <unk> <unk> are substituted for <unk> by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts . Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride , and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride .

 <unk> refrigerants , termed <unk> in informal contexts , are identified by R @-@ numbers that denote the amount of fluorine , chlorine , carbon , and hydrogen present . <unk> ( CFCs ) like R @-@ 11 , R @-@ 12 , and R @-@ 114 once dominated organofluorines , peaking in production in the 1980s . Used for air conditioning systems , propellants and solvents , their production was below one @-@ tenth of this peak by the early 2000s , after widespread international prohibition . <unk> ( HCFCs ) and hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) were designed as replacements ; their synthesis consumes more than 90 % of the fluorine in the organic industry . Important HCFCs include R @-@ 22 , <unk> , and R @-@ <unk> . The main HFC is R @-@ 134a with HFO @-@ 1234yf coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1 % that of HFC @-@ 134a .

 About 180 @,@ 000 metric tons of fluoropolymers were produced in 2006 and 2007 , generating over $ 3 @.@ 5 billion revenue per year . The global market was estimated at just under $ 6 billion in 2011 and was predicted to grow by 6 @.@ 5 % per year up to 2016 . <unk> can only be formed by <unk> free radicals . 
 Polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) , sometimes called by its DuPont name Teflon , represents 60 – 80 % by mass of the world 's fluoropolymer production . The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric . It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed , in coating pipes , tubing , and gaskets . Another major use is in <unk> @-@ coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs . The major consumer application is for non @-@ stick cookware . Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE ( ePTFE ) , a fine @-@ pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore @-@ Tex and used for <unk> , protective apparel , and filters ; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters . Other fluoropolymers , including fluorinated ethylene propylene , mimic PTFE 's properties and can substitute for it ; they are more <unk> , but also more costly and have lower thermal stability . Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells . 
 The chemically resistant ( but expensive ) fluorinated <unk> are used as electrochemical cell membranes , of which the first and most prominent example is Nafion . Developed in the 1960s , it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury @-@ based chloralkali process cells . Recently , the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles . <unk> such as Viton are crosslinked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in O @-@ rings ; <unk> ( <unk> ) is used as a fire @-@ extinguishing agent .

 Fluorosurfactants are small organofluorine molecules used for repelling water and stains . Although expensive ( comparable to pharmaceuticals at $ 200 – 2000 per kilogram ) , they yielded over $ 1 billion in annual revenues by 2006 ; <unk> alone generated over $ 300 million in 2000 . Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market , most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon @-@ based products . Applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs ; this use was valued at only $ 100 million in 2006 .

 About 30 % of agrichemicals contain fluorine , most of them herbicides and fungicides with a few crop regulators . Fluorine substitution , usually of a single atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group , is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals : increased biological stay time , membrane crossing , and altering of molecular recognition . <unk> is a prominent example , with large @-@ scale use in the U.S. as a <unk> , but it is a suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries . Sodium monofluoroacetate ( 1080 ) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium ; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle . First synthesized in the late 19th century , it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th , and was later deployed in its current use . New Zealand , the largest consumer of 1080 , uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum . Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080 .

 = = = Dental care = = = 
 Population studies from the mid @-@ 20th century onwards show topical fluoride reduces dental caries . This was first attributed to the conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite , but studies on pre @-@ fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis , and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries . After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water , controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population , including two @-@ thirds of Americans . Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children . Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis , opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds . The benefits of fluoridation have lessened , possibly due to other fluoride sources , but are still measurable in low @-@ income groups . Sodium <unk> and sometimes sodium or tin ( II ) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes , first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries , alongside fluoridated mouthwashes , gels , foams , and varnishes . 
 = = = Pharmaceuticals = = = 
 Twenty percent of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine . One of these , the cholesterol @-@ reducer atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) , made more revenue than any other drug until it became generic in 2011 . The combination asthma prescription <unk> , a top @-@ ten revenue drug in the mid @-@ 2000s , contains two active ingredients , one of which – <unk> – is fluorinated . Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon – fluorine bond is very stable . <unk> also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon – hydrogen bond , and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability . 
 <unk> and other pre @-@ 1980s antidepressants had several side effects due to their non @-@ selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target ; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective and one of the first to avoid this problem . Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment , including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors : <unk> , its isomer escitalopram , and fluvoxamine and paroxetine . <unk> are artificial broad @-@ spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects . These include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin . Fluorine also finds use in steroids : <unk> is a blood pressure @-@ raising mineralocorticoid , and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids . The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated ; the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries . Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and desflurane are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood , allowing faster waking times . 
 = = = PET scanning = = = 
 Fluorine @-@ 18 is often found in radioactive tracers for positron emission tomography , as its half @-@ life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers . The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which , after intravenous injection , is taken up by glucose @-@ requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors ; computer @-@ assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging . 
 = = = Oxygen carriers = = = 
 Liquid fluorocarbons can hold large volumes of oxygen or carbon dioxide , more so than blood , and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing . Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water , they must be mixed into emulsions ( small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water ) to be used as blood . One such product , <unk> , has been through initial clinical trials . These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports ; one cyclist 's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse . Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing ( which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid , not a water emulsion ) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs . Partial and complete lung filling have been considered , though only the former has had any significant tests in humans . An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies . 
 = = Biological role = = 
 Fluorine is not essential for humans or other mammals ; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength , but this has not been definitively established . As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine , the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets . Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals . The most common is fluoroacetate , which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa , Australia and Brazil . Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids , <unk> , and 2 @-@ <unk> . An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl @-@ fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002 . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Elemental fluorine is highly toxic to living organisms . Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide 's 50 ppm and are similar to those of chlorine : significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm , which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine . Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm , and inhalation of 1 @,@ 000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes , compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide . 
 = = = Hydrofluoric acid = = = 
 Hydrofluoric acid is a contact poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid even though it is weak : it remains neutral in aqueous solution and thus penetrates tissue faster , whether through inhalation , ingestion or the skin , and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994 . It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia . Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160 cm2 ( 25 in2 ) can cause serious systemic toxicity . 
 Exposure may not be evident for eight hours for 50 % HF , rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations , and a burn may initially be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function . If skin has been exposed to HF , damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10 – 15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing . Calcium gluconate is often applied next , providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride ; skin burns can be treated with 2 @.@ 5 % calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions . Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment ; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously . Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated , and may lead to severe complications . Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required . 
 = = = Fluoride ion = = = 
 Soluble fluorides are moderately toxic : 5 – 10 g sodium fluoride , or 32 – 64 mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass , represents a lethal dose for adults . One @-@ fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects , and chronic excess consumption may lead to skeletal fluorosis , which affects millions in Asia and Africa . Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines , where it crosses cell membranes , binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes , before urinary excretion . Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body 's ability to clear fluoride ions . 
 Historically , most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides . Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride @-@ containing toothpaste . Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause : one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person . Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste . One regional study examined a year of pre @-@ teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases , including one death from ingesting insecticide . Most had no symptoms , but about 30 % had stomach pains . A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings : 80 % of cases involved children under six , and there were few serious cases .

 The Montreal Protocol , signed in 1987 , set strict regulations on chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and <unk> due to their ozone damaging potential ( ODP ) . The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant that they were not decomposing until they reached higher altitudes , where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules . Even with the ban , and early indications of its efficacy , predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery . With one @-@ tenth the ODP of CFCs , <unk> ( HCFCs ) are the current replacements , and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030 – 2040 by hydrofluorocarbons ( HFCs ) with no chlorine and zero ODP . In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries ; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one <unk> 's production and capped those of two others in 2003 . Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global @-@ warming potentials ( <unk> ) of about 100 to 10 @,@ 000 ; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20 @,@ 000 . An outlier is HFO @-@ 1234yf which has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1 @,@ 430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC @-@ 134a .

 <unk> exhibit biopersistence due to the strength of the carbon – fluorine bond . <unk> acids ( PFAAs ) , which are sparingly water @-@ soluble owing to their acidic functional groups , are noted persistent organic pollutants ; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ( PFOS ) and <unk> acid ( PFOA ) are most often researched . PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans , with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies . A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil <unk> levels and human activity ; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating , and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA . In the body , PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin ; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys . Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species , with half @-@ lives of days in rodents , and years in humans . High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels .

 Mother 3 is a 2006 role @-@ playing video game in the Mother series , developed by Brownie Brown and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance . The game , which is the final entry in the series , was directed by Nobuyuki Inoue , written by series creator Shigesato Itoi , and scored by composer Shogo Sakai . The story follows Lucas , a young boy with psychic abilities , as he attempts to prevent an invading army from destroying the world . The game 's themes include human physiology , renewal , moral <unk> , and <unk> such as nature and technology , and feudalism and capitalism . 
 The game 's development spanned twelve years and four consoles , beginning in 1994 for the Super Famicom console and then transitioning to the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD add @-@ on before being cancelled in 2000 . Mother 3 restarted development in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance and was finally released in Japan on April 20 , 2006 . 
 Mother 3 was a critical and commercial success upon release . Critics generally praised the game 's graphics , music , and story , but believed that the gameplay offered few innovations to the role @-@ playing genre . The game was never released outside Japan , though an unofficial English fan translation was released by the Starmen.net internet community in October 2008 . On December 17 , 2015 , the game was released for the Japanese Virtual Console on the Wii U. 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Mother 3 is a single @-@ player role playing video game similar to previous games in the Mother series . The player controls a party of playable characters who explore the game 's two @-@ dimensional fictional world , primarily shown from a top @-@ down perspective . While navigating the overworld , the player may converse with non @-@ player characters , obtain items , or encounter enemies . Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party , which is required for leveling up . Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points ( HP ) , power points ( PP ) , offense , and defense . Weapons , armor , or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes . The player can restore their characters ' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are placed abundantly in the game world , and the player can save the game by talking to frogs . Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points ( DP ) , earned by winning battles and used to purchase items . The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs . 
 Mother 3 retains the turn @-@ based battle system featured in EarthBound . When the player comes into contact with an enemy in the overworld , the game transitions to a battle screen . Battles are viewed from a first @-@ person perspective , showing the enemies against a distorted , animated background . The player can assign each character in their party to perform an action , such as attacking an enemy or using items to restore HP or PP . Some characters can utilize psychic @-@ based abilities referred to as PSI , which includes stronger attacks and healing abilities , and require PP to execute . Like Earthbound , combat uses a " rolling health " system : when one of the player 's characters is injured , its HP will gradually " roll " down , similar to an odometer , rather than immediately <unk> . This allows a mortally wounded character to perform actions like attacking or healing themselves , as long as the player acts quickly enough . If a character loses all HP , it will become unconscious and cannot participate unless revived by another character . The player loses a battle if all characters become unconscious ; the player will then be given the option to continue play from the nearest save point , but with half the DP on their person . 
 Combat in Mother 3 includes a unique musical combo system not seen in previous Mother games . When one of the player 's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon , they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button in time with the beat of the background music , with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms . Using this system , the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row . When the correct beat is not apparent , the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game takes place an unknown amount of years after the events of Mother 2 , Mother 3 's story is told in eight chapters , including a prologue . The game begins as the Pig Mask Army starts a forest fire and invades Tazmily Village , a small town in the Nowhere Islands . Flint ventures out to protect his friends and family ( twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa ) . When Hinawa is found dead , Flint lashes out and is imprisoned . Claus sneaks Flint a tool to escape before disappearing . Flint sets out to find Claus . In chapter two , neophyte thief Duster breaks into a castle to find an egg that keeps the world 's secrets . He meets the princess Kumatora , but they are separated when a flood washes them out of the castle . In chapter three , Pig Mask leader Fassad orders the monkey player @-@ character , Salsa , through the desert . Salsa escapes to the forest and futilely fights the Pig Mask Army with Kumatora until Lucas saves them . Lucas and Flint protect the town while Kumatora and Salsa look for Duster . In chapter four , three years have passed , Tazmily has been modernized , and Lucas becomes the game 's main protagonist . Lucas learns psychic powers from a superpowered , Cross @-@ Dressing creature known as a <unk> and recovers the amnesic Duster from life as a bandmate . 
 In chapter five , Lucas , Duster and Kumatora recover the egg , and meet a Masked Man . In chapter seven , separated from Duster and Kumatora , Lucas and his dog , Boney , learn about the seven Needles kept by seven Magypsies that quell a sleeping dragon underneath the earth . A prophecy foretold that a " chosen one " would come to pull the Needles and wake the dragon and determine the fate of the world . Racing the Masked Man in search of these Needles , Lucas battles through a laboratory of chimeras , reunites with Kumatora and Duster , and meets Mr. Saturn . In chapter eight , Pig King Master Porky , who returned from Mother 2 , invites Lucas and his cohorts to New Pork City , where Tazmily residents have relocated . Lucas learns that the islands are protected by the dragon , that the egg contains the destructive mindsets of the outside world , that Porky is after the needles and its subsequent power , and that both Porky 's Masked Man and Lucas have each pulled three of the seven Needles . Lucas and his cohorts fight Porky , and are able to defeat him . However , to protect himself , Porky seals himself within his absolutely safe capsule , which Lucas and his friends can not harm . However , Porky himself can not harm them , and is revealed to be unable to ever leave the capsule . Later , Lucas reunites with Flint . As they prepare to pull the final Needle , Lucas 's party is hurt by the Masked Man , who is revealed as Claus . A disembodied voice attempts to talk to Claus and Flint sacrifices himself in the battle . The boys fight and Claus tragically commits suicide , for the death of his and Lucas ' mother . Lucas pulls the final Needle which lead to destructions on the Nowhere Islands as a result of awakening the dragon and in the pitch black epilogue , the player is assured that the characters have survived . In the final frame , the Mother 3 logo is shown without its metal , as restored to nature . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mother 3 began development in 1994 as a game for the Super Famicom with Shigeru Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata as producers . The team mostly consisted of members involved in the development of EarthBound . Inspired by the Nintendo 64 launch title Super Mario 64 , the development team transitioned from the Super Famicom to the newer console believing that they could also creatively flourish by making a 3D world without technical restrictions . However , their early specifications exceeded the capabilities and memory limits of the console ; halfway through development the team scaled back its large scope and changed the platform to the 64DD , a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that was later released only in Japan in 1999 . Mother 3 was expected to be a launch title for the peripheral , but development shifted back to the Nintendo 64 after the 64DD was considered a commercial failure . A demo of Mother 3 was showcased at the 1999 Nintendo Space World trade show . The game was expected to be released in North America under the title EarthBound 64 , and the game was also stated to be released on a 256 @-@ megabit cartridge , similar to The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time . IGN reacted favorably to the demo and compared the multi @-@ character narrative to the Japan @-@ only Super Famicom RPG Live A Live , and Famitsu readers ranked the game as one of their top ten most anticipated towards the end of 1999 . 
 Shigesato Itoi announced in late August 2000 that Mother 3 was cancelled following a number of delays . Iwata and Miyamoto clarified in an interview that resources had been moved to the development of the GameCube , the next Nintendo console . Itoi stated that an additional two years would have been required to finish the game , which was 30 % complete at the time of cancellation . Iwata stated retrospectively that the focus on 3D graphics made the project overly complex . Miyamoto also stated that the Mother franchise was not abandoned and that he was still interested in bringing the game to fruition . 
 Mother 3 was later announced in 2003 to have restarted development for the Game Boy Advance handheld console in a Japanese commercial for Mother 1 + 2 . Itoi had earlier assumed that restarting the project was impossible but later decided to continue following encouragement from the Mother fanbase . Nintendo subsidiary Brownie Brown developed the game , with input from Itoi . While the graphics were changed from 3D to 2D , the game 's original story was not altered . Mother 3 was about 60 % complete by July 2004 , and was released on April 20 , 2006 , in Japan . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Itoi thought of the concept behind Mother 3 towards the end of Mother 2 's production , a " detective story where the city was the main character " . He thought of a hack , small @-@ time , womanizing private investigator who would become engrossed in a big murder case , and the story would unfold from a young female clerk at a flower shop who would slowly recall parts of a story consequential to the plot . Thus , the city would appear to grow . This idea of a " single place changing over time " was central to Mother 3 . Unlike previous RPGs , which he saw as " road movies " with little reason to revisit , he wanted the player to see the town gossip grow dynamically . It was enough of a departure from the series that the development team questioned whether fans would consider it part of the series . Itoi intended the game to have 12 chapters with various game mechanics and rotating player @-@ characters . He conceptualized the development as moving 3D puppets before realizing the degree of programming required . As development wore on , Itoi reduced the scope of the chapters until seven or nine were left . The " uncomfortable beauty " of chimera — multiple creatures fused into one — was central to the game and the idea behind the metallic and wooden Mother 3 logo . Itoi served less of a manager role and more as a team member and scriptwriter than in previous Mother development cycles . He saw himself as simultaneously making the game he wanted to play and setting traps for the player , and as making a game Nintendo could not . 
 Itoi chose to use the pixelated style of Mother 2 for the Game Boy Advance Mother 3 because he was uninterested in computer graphics trends . The series ' games were written in the hiragana alphabet instead of in kanji ( Chinese characters ) so as to remain accessible to young children . Itoi described the game world as governed by a " might equals right ... macho " power struggle . The antagonist , Porky , was designed as a " symbol of humankind " , complementing Itoi 's view of evil on a fungible morality spectrum with " pranks " and " crimes " at its extremes . Itoi compared the way in which the characters realize their psychic powers with menstruation , and added that human physiology was " one of his themes " . Players sweat when learning an ability based on Itoi 's belief of how physical struggle facilitates growth . He also included characters like the Magypsies and Duster ( who has a bad leg ) to show the value of having friends with different qualities . 
 Another of his themes was the duality of the seriousness and lightheartedness of games , which is why he added a serious death scene to the first chapter . Itoi 's Nintendo 64 version of the ending was darker , " dirtier " , and more upsetting , though the final version changed little in concept . Itoi attributed the change in tone to his own growth and the character composition of the new development team . Itoi later reflected on the ending 's lesson on the virtue of helping bad people . Itoi felt that the ending 's renewal theme reflected his worldview of appreciating our time on Earth in light of the planet 's inevitable end . Much of the rest of the script was written after @-@ hours at a local hotel where they would continue their work . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Shogo Sakai , a video game composer at HAL Laboratory whose previous works include music for Kirby Air Ride and Super Smash Bros. Melee , composed Mother 3 's soundtrack . Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was chosen for the role given his deep understanding of the game 's story and the EarthBound series in general , in addition to the fact that EarthBound composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka were both unavailable . Sakai worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series . The Mother 3 soundtrack was released on compact disc on November 2 , 2006 . Kyle Miller of RPGFan wrote that the game retained the quirkiness of the previous soundtracks in the series despite the change in composers . He found the second half of the album , which included reinterpreted " classics " from the series , to be its strongest . 
 " Love Theme " , the main theme of Mother 3 , was composed late in the game 's development ; earlier in development Itoi intended to use the " Pigmask Army " theme as the main theme of the game . During creation of an important scene in the game , however , Sakai was asked to create a song that would have a greater impact than the Pigmask theme ; upon its creation it was chosen to be used as the main theme instead of the " Pigmask Army " song . Itoi claims that , given how quickly Sakai composed the song , that he had been " waiting for the order " to make a song like " Love Theme " . Itoi requested that " Love Theme " be playable on a piano with only one finger , as the " Eight Melodies " theme from Mother had gained popularity and been played in elementary schools due to its simplicity . The " OK desu ka ? " that plays after the player chooses the character 's name was recorded without Itoi 's knowledge by Hirokazu Tanaka more than a decade before the release of Mother 3 .

 Mother 3 was released in Japan on April 20 , 2006 , where it became a bestseller . Prior to its release , the game was in the " top five most wanted games " of Famitsu and at the top of the Japanese preordered game charts . At one point leading up to its release , the game 's " Love Theme " would play as music on hold for the Japan Post . A limited edition Deluxe Box Set was produced with a special edition Game Boy Micro and Franklin Badge pin . The game was marketed in Japan with a television commercial that has Japanese actress Kō Shibasaki on the verge of tears as she explains her feelings about Mother 3 . Itoi has said that her performance was unscripted . 
 = = = Fan translation = = = 
 Mother 3 did not receive an official release outside Japan . On October 17 , 2008 , Starmen.net released a fan translation patch that , when applied on a copy of the Mother 3 ROM image , translates all the game 's text into English . Reid Young , co @-@ founder of Starmen.net , stated that when they realized Nintendo was not going to localize Mother 3 , they decided to undertake the task , for themselves and for fans of the game . The translation team consisted of around a dozen individuals , including project lead Clyde " Tomato " Mandelin , a professional Japanese @-@ to @-@ English translator . The project took two years and thousands of work @-@ hours to complete ; it was estimated that the theoretical freelance cost of the translation was $ 30 @,@ 000 . 
 The project included translating , writing , and revising about 1 @,@ 000 pages of the game script in addition to extensive ROM hacking and testing to ensure that the game properly and correctly displays the translated text . The translation included minor deviations from the original , such as localization of place @-@ names and puns . Few dramatic changes were made , but some characters and locations were renamed . For example , the character " <unk> " , loosely derived from <unk> ( <unk> , " greed " ) , was renamed " Fassad " , loosely derived from the French word façade and , incidentally , the Arabic word <unk> ( <unk> , " corruption " ) . The ROM hacking entailed assembly @-@ level changes to the game code to support features such as variable width fonts . 
 The team reported that " the highest levels " of Nintendo of America knew about their project , though they did not intervene . The localization team planned to end the project if Nintendo were to make an announcement about the future of the game . They acknowledged that the legality of the localization was unclear since the final translation required use of an emulator . The localization patch was downloaded over 100 @,@ 000 times in the first week following its release . Along with the translation , the team announced the Mother 3 Handbook , an English player 's guide for the game that had been in development since June 2008 . Wired reported the full @-@ color , 200 @-@ page player 's guide to be akin to a professional strategy guide , with quality " on par with ... Prima Games and BradyGames " . The Verge cited the two @-@ year fan translation of Mother 3 as proof of the fan base 's dedication , and Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell called it " undoubtably one of the best known fan translations in existence " , with active <unk> into other languages . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Mother 3 sold around 200 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of sales in Japan . It was one of Japan 's top 20 bestselling games for the first half of 2006 , and received a " Platinum Hall of Fame " score of 35 / 40 from Japanese reviewer Weekly Famitsu . It ended the year with over 368 @,@ 000 copies sold , the 36th highest of the year in Japan . Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell called it the " perfect " Game Boy Advance role @-@ playing game . Reviewers praised its story ( even though the game was only available in Japanese ) and graphics , and lamented its 1990s role @-@ playing game mechanics . Critics also complimented its music . 
 Famitsu 's reviewers noted the level of detail from the game 's direction , accessibility and wit of the story , unconventional art style , and conventional game mechanics . They considered the timed battles to be both useful and difficult . Eurogamer 's Simon Parkin detailed the 12 @-@ year development , the series ' legacy as both " one of Japan 's most beloved " and the video game cognoscenti 's " sacred cow " , and the endurance of its fan community . He was impressed by the quality of the fan translation , and described Itoi as a " storyteller " who chose the Japanese role @-@ playing game medium to tell his story . Parkin noted how the " excellent " script unfurled from a " straightforward tale " into " breadth and depth of quality that few titles many times its budget achieve " with " affecting scenes " and " unexpected impact " . He compared the chapter approach with the method of Dragon Quest IV . Parkin wrote that the script allowed for the somewhat " heavy @-@ handed " juxtaposition of " nature and technology , feudalism and capitalism , individuals and community " , and that what he first considers a name customization " trick " becomes useful later in the game . NGC Magazine 's Mark Green wrote that the game felt like Mother 2 @.@ 5 in its look and feel , which he did not consider negative , albeit somewhat antiquated . Lada of TechnologyTell said Mother 3 was surprisingly " darker " than its forbears . 
 Eurogamer 's Parkin wrote that the " childlike " and " unusually Western " graphics were similar to EarthBound 's in " flat pastel textures devoid of shading " as juxtaposed with background art that " fizzes with life and character " . He described the cutscenes ' animations as " bespoke " , rare for 16 @-@ bit role @-@ playing games , and of greater dramatic impact . RPGamer 's Jordan Jackson wrote that the visuals are typical of the series and fit the game 's mood , and the website 's Mike Moehnke criticized the inventory limits carried over from the previous game . Green of NGC said the game mechanics were " depressingly basic " against more advanced role @-@ playing games . Eurogamer 's Parkin felt that the role @-@ playing game elements were less interesting and added that Mother 3 had few standout selling points other than its attention to detail and " only systemic innovation " : the rhythm @-@ based battle system . Kotaku 's Richard Eisenbeis praised the system , and GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin compared it with that of the Mario & Luigi series . Jackson wrote that the music was " just as catchy as previous games " despite being " almost completely new " . Moehnke agreed , calling it " nothing less than stunning " . He noted overtones of Wagner and Chuck Berry . Jackson said that the game was somewhat easier than the rest of the series and somewhat shorter , at about 30 hours in length . Both RPGamer reviewers noted that Mother 3 has few penalties for death . Jackson reflected that while the game is humorous and grows in enjoyment , it has some somber moments as well . Eisenbeis of Kotaku cited " the importance of mothers " as a key theme about which the game revolves , which he preferred to the mid @-@ game " slapstick insanity " and final plot twist . Parkin wrote that the game was filled with " memorable moments " , including a character who criticizes the player " for not giggling at puns " , frogs with progressively silly costumes that save the game , a " reconstructed mecha caribou " battle , a bad haiku , and the " campfire scene " , and that while the game 's <unk> could have lent towards " raw stupidity " , instead it was " elegant in its simplicity " .

 Multiple critics wrote that Mother 3 was one of the best role @-@ playing games for the Game Boy Advance . GamePro 's Jeremy Signor listed it among his " best unreleased Japanese role @-@ playing games " for its script and attention to detail . Video game journalist Tim Rogers posited that Mother 3 was " the closest games have yet come to literature " . 
 The 2008 fighting game Super Smash Bros. Brawl features Mother 3 protagonist Lucas as a playable character alongside Ness , a perennial Smash Bros. series character and the protagonist of EarthBound ( Mother 2 ) . Their move sets are similar , both based on psychic powers . Official Nintendo Magazine 's Thomas East thought that both characters should be dropped from future Smash Bros. games , adding that Lucas was too similar to Ness . Both characters returned in the sequel , Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U , where Ness is in the main game and Lucas is available as downloadable content . 
 Nintendo is often criticized for Mother 3 's lack of an international release . IGN referred to the Mother series as " neglected " in regards to EarthBound being ( at the time ) the only game to be released outside Japan . Bob Mackey of 1UP.com wrote of Mother 3 that " no other game in the history of time garnered such a rabid demand for translation , " and Chris Plante of UGO Networks wrote that the lack of an official Mother 3 English localization was one of 2008 's " worst heartbreaks " . Frank Caron of Ars Technica said that the fan translation 's " massive undertaking ... stands as a massive success " and that " one cannot even begin to fathom why Nintendo wouldn 't see fit to release the game in the West . " 
 Itoi has stated that he does not have any plans to create a fourth Mother title . 
 = The X @-@ Files ( season 9 ) = 
 The ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files commenced airing in the United States on November 11 , 2001 , concluded on May 19 , 2002 , and consists of twenty episodes . Season nine takes place after Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) goes into hiding , following the events of the eighth season finale , " Existence " . As such , the main storyarc for the season follows Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , and Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) on their hunt to reveal a government conspiracy who are creating " Super Soldiers " . 
 For this season , former series ' leads Duchovny and Anderson scaled back their involvement with the show , with the former only starring in the two episodes that formed the season finale , " The Truth " . Doggett and Reyes became the show 's central characters , and former recurring character Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) became a main character . Series creator Chris Carter had hopes that the show could continue on with new leads , and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned again . 
 Season nine received mixed reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long @-@ time fans and viewers , partially because Duchovny did not make regular appearances on the show , after fulfilling his contract in the previous season . During this year , ratings for the season fell dramatically — which critics correlated with the season 's incoherent storylines but the cast and crew ascribed to the September 11 attacks — Fox eventually decided to cancel the series . During the airing of season eight , Carter and The X @-@ Files production team had created and aired a spinoff titled The Lone Gunmen . The show was unsuccessful and was cancelled before any story arcs were resolved , but The X @-@ Files episode " Jump the Shark " was written to give closure to the series . The X @-@ Files storyline was continued with the 2008 theatrical film The X Files : I Want to Believe and later with a tenth season in 2016 .

 After the eighth season finale " Existence " , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) goes into hiding . Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is again reassigned to the FBI Academy , and Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) becomes John Doggett 's ( Robert Patrick ) new FBI partner in the X @-@ Files office . Doggett asks Scully for help on a case involving an EPA official , Carl Wormus ( Nicholas Walker ) , who died after his car was forced off a bridge by a woman he picked up . Doggett and Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) travel to a reclamation plant , looking for links between Wormus ' work and death . After doing an illegal autopsy on Wormus , Alvin Kersh ( James Pickens , Jr . ) sends Brad Follmer ( Cary Elwes ) to locate Doggett . The investigation at the reclamation plant leads to an unknown woman , whose identity is later revealed to be Shannon McMahon ( Lucy Lawless ) , one of Doggett 's former Marine associates . She reveals to Doggett that she is a " Super Soldier " . This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment is taking place on board on a naval ship . They later find connections between the experiments on the ship and Scully 's child , William . 
 After Scully begins to miss Mulder , a complete stranger — the " Shadow Man " ( Terry O 'Quinn ) — offers his service to drive Mulder out of hiding . Scully takes the offer , but unknowingly gets herself and Mulder in even more danger . The " Shadow Man " , who is revealed to be a " Super Soldier " bent on killing Scully and Mulder . After a chase through a quarry , the " Shadow Man " is destroyed after being exposed to magnetite . Later , Scully , Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult which has uncovered a second spacecraft similar to one Scully studied in Africa two years ago . Misled by the FBI , the agents enlist the help of The Lone Gunmen to protect Scully 's son after they learn that the cult intends to kill the child . The cult , however , is successful in kidnapping the child . Concurrent with these events , Doggett is run over by a car , which sends him to the hospital . As Follmer and the " Toothpick Man " ( Alan Dale ) try to uncover the plans of the three agents , Scully and Reyes leave Washington , D.C. to find Scully 's son . 
 Doggett finds a strange disfigured man in the X @-@ Files office ; believing he is Mulder , Scully has his DNA tested , and the results reveal him to have the same pattern as Mulder . The disfigured man sticks a needle into William , which the other agents believe to be a virus of some kind , but it is later revealed to be a cure for William 's powers . The unnamed man is later revealed to be Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) , Mulder 's half @-@ brother . In the season finale , Mulder returns from hiding in the attempts of finding classified information at an army base . He is caught , however , after allegedly killing an apparently indestructible " Super Soldier " , which causes him to be tried before a military tribunal . With the help of Kersh , Scully , Reyes , Doggett , Spender , Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) and Gibson Praise ( Jeff Gulka ) , Mulder breaks out , and Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico to find an old " wise man " , later revealed to be the " Cigarette Smoking Man " ( William B. Davis ) . He tells the two that aliens will begin colonizing the planet on December 22 , 2012 . Cigarette Smoking Man appears to be killed by a missile , launched under the command of Knowle Rohrer ( Adam Baldwin ) , who is revealed to be alive and well . Mulder and Scully escape , but become fugitives on the run from the FBI . The final scene of the season features the two in a motel room facing an uncertain — but possibly hopeful — future .

 Following the eighth season of The X @-@ Files , David Duchovny announced that he would be completely leaving the show . As such , the future of the show was up in the air . Before greenlighting a ninth season , neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season . With this being said , he encouraged the other members of the crew to continue the series without him . Eventually , however , several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season , many of which excited Carter . This new @-@ found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year . Likewise , Anderson signed on at the last minute , with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002 ; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season . Due to the changes in the cast , during the ninth seasons , Doggett and Reyes became the series ' new leads . Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season , if the show was able to attract an audience . However , the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox . 
 With the news of the impending end to the series , the crew members decided to wrap up long @-@ running plots . " Jump the Shark " , the final episode to feature the Lone Gunmen , served as a de facto series finale for the cancelled X @-@ Files spin @-@ off series The Lone Gunmen . Executive producer and co @-@ writer Frank Spotnitz had to fight to get the episode made ; the studio informed Spotnitz that they did not want to bring the characters back in any capacity , as Fox reportedly " hated [ the ] characters " . Similarly , " Release " was written to create closure to the story of the murder of Doggett 's son . 
 The show 's crew and actors had a range of opinions about the show 's finale , " The Truth " . Carter said of the finale , " It 's the end — you don 't get another chance . So you 'd better put everything you 've ever wanted to put in into the episode . There were things to distract from what was going on . The band was breaking up . " Gish said , " It did feel like a big movie set . We were on location , there was an enormous budget , and everyone came back . " Davis said , " It was great that they brought us all back in the finale , that they found a way to get us all in again . " Pileggi said , " I can remember the last day on the set . We shot a scene with Gillian and myself , and that was it . And then I had to say goodbye to another family , another crew . I almost <unk> up , and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying ' Okay , go ahead , big guy ; get through this . ' It was tough . " Patrick said , " It was pretty euphoric , and sad , and all those emotions you can imagine . A chapter 's closing , and we 're all moving on to something new and exciting . And yet we were all going to miss each other . " Kim Manners called the final scene " truly one of the most emotional experiences I 've ever witnessed in my life . " Former lead actor Duchovny said , " In some ways , psychically I didn 't really leave . It was nice to be able to – I 'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 With " Nothing Important Happened Today " , the style of the opening credits were changed from the original credits , which , more or less , had been the same for the previous eight seasons . The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi . In addition , Elwes was cast to portray the new recurring character , Brad Follmer , an Assistant Director at the FBI , and Alan Dale was also written into the show as a new " villain " , the " Toothpick Man " . Lucy Lawless was cast as the intended @-@ recurring character Shannon McMahon , but she became pregnant after filming the season premiere , and — due to her high @-@ risk pregnancy — had to leave the series . 
 After the departure of Duchovny , the show garnered much criticism by fans and critics alike , with many saying that the bond between Mulder and Scully was what actually kept the show together for the first seven seasons of the show . Realizing his importance in the series , Chris Carter and his crew opened negotiations with Duchovny in the hopes that he would reprise his character for the finale . Initially , they were unsure if he would appear , but he eventually elected to return . Spotnitz said , " My impression from talking to him was that he still cares about the show . He 's still invested in it and certainly cares about [ Mulder ] . And I think he recognized that it was the best thing for the show and the audience [ for him ] to come back and give closure to nine years of the series . " Not only did Duchovny return for the finale , he also returned to write and direct the episode " William " ; he even had a small cameo in the episode , appearing as a reflection in Scully 's eye . Three episodes later , Duchovny returned as an actor for the season finale , " The Truth " .

 Sabadino Parker from PopMatters , when commenting on the series finale , said , " It 's also for the good , because The X @-@ Files has long been but a pale reflection of the show it once was . " Brian Linder from IGN was more positive to the ninth season , saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish 's character , which The X @-@ Files crew did not do and continued what was seen by many critics as tiresome . Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine was more negative to the new season , even joking about the new female lead , calling her a " peppy new female presence . " Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker said the show operated in what he called " quaint territory " , speculating that Chris Carter was the only one who seemed to understand the complex mytharc . Elizabeth <unk> from The New York Times concluded with , " shoddy writing notwithstanding , it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship " , between Mulder and Scully , ended remaining interest in what was a " waning phenomenon " . Another review from The New York Times said of the show , " The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination . " The A.V.

 = Russian monitor Novgorod = 
 Novgorod ( Russian : <unk> ) was a monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1870s . She was one of the most unusual warships ever constructed , and still survives in popular naval myth as one of the worst warships ever built . A more balanced assessment shows that she was relatively effective in her designed role as a coast @-@ defence ship . The hull was circular to reduce draught while allowing the ship to carry much more armour and a heavier armament than other ships of the same size . Novgorod played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 and was reclassified as a coast @-@ defence ironclad in 1892 . The ship was decommissioned in 1903 and used as a storeship until she was sold for scrap in 1911 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1868 , the Scottish shipbuilder John Elder published an article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area that needed to be protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier , more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship . In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship . Sir Edward Reed , then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy , agreed with Elder 's conclusions . Rear @-@ Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder 's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat @-@ bottomed , unlike Elder 's convex hull , to minimise its draught . 
 Popov designed Novgorod to meet an 1869 requirement to defend the Dnieper @-@ Bug Estuary and the Kerch Strait . The requirement was for four very heavily @-@ armoured ships of 11 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) draught and armed with 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) rifled guns , for which the total programme cost should not exceed four million rubles . The 2 @,@ 100 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) Charodeika @-@ class monitor met all of the requirements except that their armament was not powerful enough , so General @-@ Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich selected Popov 's circular design in late December 1869 . A model was built with a circular hull and performed well during tests in the Baltic Sea at St. Petersburg in April 1870 ; when Tsar Alexander II received reports of the trials , he nicknamed the ship a " <unk> " . 
 Popov submitted several designs to the General @-@ Admiral who selected the largest of these for a ship that displaced 6 @,@ 054 long tons ( 6 @,@ 151 t ) , 151 feet ( 46 @.@ 0 m ) in diameter , and armed with four 11 @-@ inch guns on 7 June . This ironclad was estimated to cost 4 @.@ 14 million rubles , more than the total cost of the entire programme , and Popov was forced to scale down his design . On 24 October , the Tsar approved his design for a ship 96 feet ( 29 @.@ 3 m ) in diameter , armed with two 11 @-@ inch guns , and protected by 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of armour . It was estimated to cost 1 @.@ 94 million roubles per ship and the total cost of the programme , including improvements to the shipyards , would cost 8 @.@ 5 million rubles . For further testing , the Kambala ( Flounder ) , a circular ship 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) in diameter , was built in 1871 . Equipped with two engines of eight nominal horsepower , her trials during that summer were considered a success . 
 = = Description = = 
 While under construction , Popov 's design was modified by the addition of wood and copper sheathing to reduce biofouling , which increased Novgorod 's diameter to 101 feet ( 30 @.@ 8 m ) . She had a maximum draught of 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) and displaced 2 @,@ 491 long tons ( 2 @,@ 531 t ) at normal load . Freeboard was only 18 inches ( 46 cm ) and the deck curved upwards to the gun barbette in the center . The ship had an unarmoured superstructure forward of the barbette that housed some of the crew 's quarters . Despite initial concerns about her sea @-@ keeping ability , Novgorod was a stable gun platform and had an easy roll that rarely exceeded 7 – 8 ° . Her bluff hull form meant that she lost speed in heavy weather and , on one occasion in 1877 , lost all headway during a Force eight storm . In some conditions the ship could pitch enough to lift her propellers out of the water . The biggest drawback to her hull shape was that it greatly reduced the rudder 's ability to turn the ship by masking much of the flow of water so much that it took 40 – 45 minutes to make a full circle and the ship was almost <unk> in a severe storm . The solution adopted was to use the engines for steering and leave the rudder fixed , even though this reduced the ship 's speed . She had a crew of 151 officers and ratings . 
 The ship had six horizontal compound @-@ expansion steam engines built by the Baird Works , each driving a single propeller , using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers . The engines produced a total of 3 @,@ 360 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 510 kW ) which gave her a speed of around 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) . Novgorod 's propulsion machinery proved problematic throughout her life as a result of defective workmanship and poor @-@ quality materials . Her blunt hull form was not conducive to efficient steaming and she proved to be a prodigious consumer of coal as her capacity of 200 long tons ( 200 t ) only gave her range of 480 nautical miles ( 890 km ; 550 mi ) at full speed . The ship had ventilation problems throughout her career , despite later fitting a large ventilation cowl over the central hatch of the barbette . 
 Novgorod was armed with two 20 @-@ calibre 11 @-@ inch rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . The guns could penetrate 11 inches of armour at a range of 800 yards ( 730 m ) ; their 489 @-@ pound ( 222 kg ) shells had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 290 feet per second ( 392 m / s ) . Their rate of fire was very slow , about one round every 10 minutes . The guns were mounted on separate revolving turntables that could be moved independently or locked together . Each turntable took about two or three minutes to rotate 180 ° . Gunnery trials in November 1874 showed that the locks for the turntables were too weak ; so much so that the gun 's recoil could cause them to rotate , leading to the persistent myth that the whole ship rotated when a gun fired . Reinforcement of the locks solved the problem , but the myth persisted . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The ship had a waterline belt of wrought iron that completely covered the hull and extended from 18 inches ( 457 mm ) above the waterline to 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) below it . The armour was configured in two strakes , each 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high . The upper plates were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick and the lower ones 7 inches ( 178 mm ) . The armour was backed by 9 inches of teak reinforced by interlocking channel irons . The navy considered this backing to be the equivalent of another 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of armour . Novgorod was the first Russian ironclad to place her armament in a barbette mounting . It was 7 feet ( 2 m ) high and was built in the same manner as the upper strake of the belt . 
 The rounded deck was protected by a total of 2 @.@ 75 inches ( 70 mm ) of armour , made up of three layers of plates ranging in thickness from 0 @.@ 75 to 1 inch ( 19 to 25 mm ) . The lower portion of the funnels and the base of the engine room skylight had armour plates 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 The Treaty of Paris that ended the Crimean War of 1854 – 56 limited the Imperial Russian Navy to only six 800 long tons ( 810 t ) corvettes in the Black Sea , so the royal shipyard in Sevastopol was leased to the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company . This meant that any ironclads built for Black Sea service would have to be built in Saint Petersburg , disassembled , and then shipped to a port there for reassembly . The long @-@ dormant facility at Nikolaev was chosen and the navy began ordering machinery and tools from Britain to re @-@ equip the shipyard in 1870 , when Russia abrogated those clauses of the treaty . 
 A temporary slipway was built at the New Admiralty Shipyard in January 1871 and construction of Novgorod , named after the city , began on 13 April . Using two shifts to speed construction , her hull was completed by 29 December , when the official keel @-@ laying ceremony was held . Within two weeks it was disassembled , and the first shipment of parts arrived at Nikolaev on 2 April 1872 . <unk> began on a specially @-@ prepared slipway eight days later . As there was no rail line between Saint Petersburg and Nikolaev , the components had to be railed to Odessa , where they were transshipped onto river barges and steamers . The boilers were too large and had to be shipped by freighter from the Baltic Sea to Odessa for transshipment . Construction was delayed by late deliveries of parts and the workforce 's lack of experience ; the ship was finally launched on 2 June 1873 , with Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich in attendance . Novgorod 's guns were mounted in September , and she entered service the following year , at a cost of 2 @,@ 830 @,@ 000 rubles . 
 During the winter of 1873 – 74 , a small superstructure was built aft of the barbette and an enclosed wheelhouse was built atop it . In addition , the shape of the forward superstructure was modified so that it overhung the bow , and prominent bridge wings were added . A telescoping boom for a spar torpedo was fitted at the same time . In 1875 the ship made a port visit to Taganrog , and hosted Sir Edward Reed during a cruise along the Crimean coast that October . During the Russo @-@ Turkish War , she was assigned to the defense of Odessa , and her armament was reinforced by a pair of 4 @-@ pounder 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) guns mounted on her aft superstructure to protect her against torpedo boats . These guns fired a 12 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 74 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 7 @,@ 070 feet per second ( 2 @,@ 154 m / s ) to a range of 3 @,@ 602 yards ( 3 @,@ 294 m ) . During this time , the navy realized that the ship 's outermost engines contributed little to her speed , and with steam capacity insufficient for all of her engines , the outer engines were removed in 1876 – 77 . This reduced Novgorod 's total power to 2 @,@ 000 ihp ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) and her speed to about 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 The ship made a cruise to the Romanian town of <unk> on the Danube after the war , and she received armoured covers for her engine room skylight and the central barbette hatch to protect against plunging fire . Novgorod was stationed in Sevastopol throughout the 1880s and made short cruises every summer . She received the refurbished boilers from Vice Admiral Popov after that ship was reboilered in 1883 . She was reclassified as a coast @-@ defence ironclad on 13 February 1892 , by which time her armament had been augmented by two 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing Hotchkiss five @-@ barreled revolving cannon . These guns had a range of 3 @,@ 038 yards ( 2 @,@ 778 m ) and a rate of fire of 32 rounds per minute . By the following year her hull and machinery were in poor condition . The ship was turned over to the Port Authority of Nikolaev for disposal on 1 May 1903 and stricken from the navy list on 3 July , after which she was used as a storeship . Novgorod was offered for sale to Bulgaria in 1908 , but the offer was not taken up . The ship was sold for scrap in December 1911 . 
 = = Myths and reality = = 
 In his book , The World 's Worst Warships , naval historian Antony Preston characterised the <unk> like this : 
 But in other respects , they were a dismal failure . They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr , and proved very difficult to steer . In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn out of control and even contra @-@ rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading . Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea . They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm , and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances . 
 The design of these ships was very controversial while they were being built in the 1870s , with many articles being published in the newspapers of the day by supporters and detractors , and later picked up by historians . One such account , published in 1875 , claimed that Novgorod made an uncontrollable turn while on the Dniepr , while Reed , describing a time when the ship 's engines on one side were reversed during a cruise in Sevastopol Bay , wrote : " The circular form is so extremely favourable to this kind of <unk> that the Novgorod can easily be revolved on her centre at a speed which quickly makes one giddy . She can , nevertheless , be promptly brought to rest , and , if , needed have her rotary motion reversed . " It would seem probable that the two reports quoted above were combined into the story as given by Fred T. Jane : " On a trial cruise , they ( Novgorod and <unk> @-@ admiral Popov ) went up the Dniepr very nicely for some distance , till they turned to retire . Then the current caught them , and they were carried out to sea , whirled helplessly round and round , every soul on board helplessly incapacitated by vertigo . " The other criticisms made by Preston have been discussed earlier and the opinion of naval historian Stephen McLaughlin is a reasonable assessment of these ships : 
 In the final analysis , the <unk> seem to have been relatively effective coast @-@ defence vessels ; certainly their combination of armament and armour could have only been carried by a conventional ship of much greater draught . Their faults – and they certainly had faults — were exaggerated by critics , both in Russia and abroad , and have left as a legacy stories of uncontrollable ships designed by incompetent men .

 Vanuatu competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China . A total of three Vanuatuan athletes competed in two sports . Moses Kamut and Elis Lapenmal competed in , respectively , the men 's and women 's 100m sprints , and Priscilla Tommy competed in women 's singles table tennis after being selected by the IOC 's Tripartite Commission . Tommy 's appearance in particular was Vanuatu 's debut into table tennis . Tommy was also the country 's flagbearer during the opening ceremony . The Vanuatuan delegation to Beijing included the country 's head of state and prime minister , but only included Elis Lapenmal ; the other two athletes did not accompany the delegation and arrived in China at different times . 
 None of the three Vanuatuan Olympians progressed past the first round in their events , and thus did not earn any medals . 
 = = Background = = 
 Vanuatu has participated in the Olympics since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea ; its Olympic committee ( VASANOC ) was founded a year earlier . Vanuatu 's appearance at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing , thus , marked its sixth appearance in the summer Olympics . Although Vanuatu 's earlier Olympic appearances were primarily characterized by people participating in athletics ( with the exception of the 2000 Summer Olympics , which included an archer ) , the 2008 Vanuatu team involved the country 's debut in Olympic table tennis . Other <unk> attempted Olympic qualification competitions in girl 's beach volleyball , men 's football , and taekwondo , but did not succeed . 
 Vanuatu 's delegation left for Beijing on August 4 ; the delegation encompassed one of the three Olympians , as well as coaches Denison <unk> , Sun <unk> , and <unk> Lulu ; VASANOC president Joe Carlo ; and VASANOC secretary general Seru <unk> . Vanuatuan dignitaries , including the head of state , prime minister , and the minister of sports , also accompanied the team to attend the opening ceremony on August 8 . Table tennis player Priscila Tommy and athlete Moses Kamut , the other two Vanuatuan qualifiers , did not accompany the Vanuatuan delegation to Beijing . Tommy arrived in China early for training , while Kamut spent time in Belgium . 
 Of the participating Olympians , table tennis player Priscila Tommy was the youngest , at age 17 . Moses Kamut , at age 26 , was the oldest . Kamut and Elis Lapenmal participated in athletics , and Tommy participated as the team 's only table tennis player . There were no medalists from Vanuatu during these Olympic Games . 
 Priscila Tommy was Vanuatu 's flag bearer in the opening ceremony .

 Moses Kamut and Elis Lapenmal participated on behalf of Vanuatu in track and field , or athletics , events at the 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 Kamut participated in the men 's 100m sprint , and participated in the first round of the event on August 14 . Kamut was placed in the first heat , and ran the event in 10 @.@ 81 seconds . Within the first heat , Kamut placed 7th out of 8 , beating Francis Manioru of the Solomon Islands by 0 @.@ 28 seconds , but falling behind Jamaica 's Usain Bolt by 0 @.@ 61 seconds . Bolt ranked first in Kamut ' heat . Overall , Moses Kamut ranked 61st out of 80 out of all the heats run on that day , and did not advance to the next round . Kamut received financial assistance through the Beijing Scholarship , which terminated after the Beijing Olympics ended . 
 Elis Lapenmal was Vanuatu 's sole participant in the women 's 100m dash . She took part in the first round of the event on August 15 , in which she was placed in heat three versus athletes that included the United States ' Muna Lee ; Saint Kitts and Nevis ' Virgil Hodge ; and Mauritania 's Bounkou Camara . Lapenmal ran the 100m in 13 @.@ 31 seconds , placing eighth in a heat of nine people , just ahead of Camara , who scored 13 @.@ 69 seconds . Muna Lee scored first in Lapenmal 's heat with a time of 11 @.@ 33 seconds .

During the preliminary rounds on August 17 , Priscilla Tommy was paired with Eva <unk> of Slovakia , who she faced on the thirteenth of fourteen matches that took place that day . Tommy lost to <unk> with a 4 – 0 record , and did not advance to the August 20 matches . 
 = Cornelius P. Rhoads = 
 Cornelius Packard " Dusty " Rhoads ( June 9 , 1898 – August 13 , 1959 ) was an American pathologist and oncologist , who was an administrator : he was director of Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research in New York beginning in 1940 , the first director of Sloan @-@ Kettering Institute beginning in 1945 , and the first director of the combined Memorial Sloan – Kettering Cancer Center . For his contributions to cancer research , he appeared on the cover of the June 27 , 1949 issue of Time magazine under the title " Cancer Fighter . " 
 During his early years with the Rockefeller Institute in the 1930s , Rhoads specialized in anemia and leukemia , working for six months in Puerto Rico in 1932 as part of the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Board contingent . During World War II , he worked for the United States Army helping to develop chemical weapons and set up research centers . Research on mustard gas led to developments for its use in chemotherapy at Sloan Kettering . 
 In early 1932 , a letter Rhoads had written in November 1931 , which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and intentionally injected cancer cells into his patients , was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos . He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media , which led to a scandal , an official investigation , and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and , by extension , Rockefeller interests . In the ensuing investigation , Rhoads defended himself , saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague . Neither Puerto Rico 's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project giving any inappropriate medical treatment , and the scandal was forgotten . 
 In 2002 , the controversy was revived . The American Association for Cancer Research ( AACR ) , which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979 , commissioned a new investigation . It was led by Jay Katz , emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics . He concluded there was no evidence of unethical human experimentation , but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed . AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Rhoads was born June 20 , 1898 , in Springfield , Massachusetts , as the son of an ophthalmologist , Dr. George H. Rhoads and his wife . He received his early education in Springfield , later attending Bowdoin College in Maine , where he graduated in 1920 . In 1924 , he received his M.D. from Harvard University , cum laude , and was class president . Rhoads became an intern at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital , and contracted pulmonary tuberculosis . During his treatment and recovery , he developed a lifelong interest in disease research . 
 = = Early career = = 
 After recovering from TB , Rhoads published a paper on the tuberculin reaction with Fred W. Stewart , who became his longtime colleague . Rhoads then taught as a pathologist at Harvard and conducted research on disease processes . 
 In 1929 Rhoads joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , now Rockefeller University , where he worked for Simon Flexner . He was also staff pathologist at Rockefeller Hospital . His early research interests included hematology and poliomyelitis . He worked at Rockefeller until 1939 . 
 = = Puerto Rico = = 
 While working for the Rockefeller Institute , in 1931 Rhoads was invited by hematologist William B. Castle 's to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission , to conduct clinical research at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan , Puerto Rico . This was part of the Rockefeller Foundation 's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division . Castle 's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia , specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm , which was endemic on the island at rates of 80 % , and tropical sprue . An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed , although the disease 's causes remained obscure . As recently as 2010 , medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions were a cause of high mortality in Puerto Ricans . The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified , but since the 1940s , it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6 @-@ month course of antibiotics . 
 Rhoads was to assist Castle , and they established a base in San Juan at the Presbyterian Hospital . Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests . In Puerto Rico , the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients ; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that , while referred to as patients , they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research . Because of the effects of anemia and the suspicion that tropical sprue was related to diet , Rhoads experimentally controlled patients ' diets . Lederer notes that in letters from this time , Rhoads referred to his patients as " experimental ' animals ' . " He wrote : " If they don ’ t develop something they certainly have the constitutions of oxen . " Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them . If they did develop tropical sprue , he could treat it with liver extract . 
 Castle wanted to perform a similar study in Cidra , in conjunction with the School of Tropical Medicine , which was doing similar research , but this was not approved . Rhoads also collected polio serum samples for his boss Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute , for which he was assisted by contacts at the university . 
 = = = Scandal = = = 
 On 10 November 1931 , Rhoads was at a party at a Puerto Rican co @-@ worker 's house in Cidra . After having some drinks , he left , finding his car had been vandalized and several items stolen . He went to his office , where he wrote and signed a letter addressed to " Ferdie " ( Fred W. Stewart , a colleague from Boston , by then working at the Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research in New York ) . He wrote the following : 
 " Dear Ferdie : 
 The more I think about the Larry Smith appointment the more disgusted I get . Have you heard any reason advanced for it ? It certainly is odd that a man out with the entire Boston group , fired by Wallach , and as far as I know , absolutely devoid of any scientific reputation should be given the place . There is something wrong somewhere with our point of view . 
 The situation is settled in Boston . Parker and Nye are to run the laboratory together and either Kenneth or MacMahon to be assistant ; the chief to stay on . As far as I can see , the chances of my getting a job in the next ten years are absolutely nil . One is certainly not encouraged to make scientific advances , when it is a handicap rather than an aid to advancement . I can get a damn fine job here and am tempted to take it . It would be ideal except for the Porto Ricans . They are beyond doubt the dirtiest , laziest , most degenerate and thievish race of men ever inhabiting this sphere . It makes you sick to inhabit the same island with them . They are even lower than Italians . What the island needs is not public health work but a tidal wave or something to totally exterminate the population . It might then be livable . I have done my best to further the process of extermination by killing off 8 and transplanting cancer into several more . The latter has not resulted in any fatalities so far ... The matter of consideration for the patients ' welfare plays no role here — in fact all physicians take delight in the abuse and torture of the unfortunate subjects . 
 Do let me know if you hear any more news . 
 Sincerely , " Dusty " " 
 His <unk> letter was found by one of his staff and circulated among people at the Anemia Commission . When Rhoads learned of this , he quickly made a public apology at a meeting of all staff and doctors . A while later , he was dismayed to hear that the letter was going to be discussed at a meeting of the Puerto Rico Medical Association . With relations having deteriorated locally , he returned to New York in December 1931 . 
 = = = Publicity and investigations = = = 
 At the end of December Rhoads ' former lab technician Luigi <unk> resigned ; he later testified that he feared for his safety . In January 1932 he gave the Rhoads letter to Pedro Albizu Campos , president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . Albizu Campos sought publicity , sending copies of the letter to the League of Nations , the Pan American Union , the American Civil Liberties Union , newspapers , embassies , and the Vatican . In addition to distributing the letter to the media , Albizu wrote his own , charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans . He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism , saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment , and promoted birth control , which was offensive to the many Catholic residents . Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his remarks encouraging birth control use on the island , which resulted in his being removed from office . 
 A photograph of the letter was published on January 27 , 1932 in La Democracia , the Unionist newspaper of Antonio Rafael Barceló , with a translation in Spanish of the entire letter . It did not support Albizu Campos ' theory of a US conspiracy against Puerto Rico . On February 13 , El Mundo published the entire letter , in both Spanish and English . 
 The Rhoads ' letter created one of the first crises for James Beverley , newly appointed as the acting Governor of Puerto Rico . He said the letter was a " confession of murder " and " a libel against the people of Puerto Rico " , and ordered an investigation , one of his first acts . Beverley said of Rhoads that " he was just a damned fool , ... a good doctor , but not very strong mentally on anything else . " Rhoads , already back in New York , released an official response to the media and the governor . He insisted that he was joking in his letter , which was intended to be confidential , calling it a " fantastic and playful composition written entirely for my own diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico , " explaining that nothing " was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated . " Rhoads offered to return to clear things up , but never did . The governor 's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter , nor any other crimes . 
 Rhoads and his work were investigated by the Puerto Rican Attorney General Ramon Quinones , with review of medical aspects by Dr. P. Morales Otero , representative of the Puerto Rico Medical Association , and Dr. E , Garrido Morales , representing the Commissioner of Health . Sworn testimony was taken from several of Rhoads ' patients as well as his colleagues , including Castle , William Galbreath , and George C. Payne . They reviewed the case files for the 257 patients treated by Rhoads and the Rockefeller Commission , including the 13 patients who died during this period . They found no evidence of the crimes described in Rhoads ' <unk> letter . The Attorney General and medical community joined in absolving Rhoads of the Nationalist charges that he was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans . Rhoads was subject to separate investigations ordered by the acting American governor of Puerto Rico James R. Beverley and the Rockefeller Institute , and " neither ... was able to uncover any evidence that Dr. Rhoads had exterminated any Puerto Ricans . " 
 Confirmed in Lederer 's 21st century account , " records at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan , Puerto Rico , where Rhoads had performed his research , revealed no patients in the young pathologist 's care had died under suspicious circumstances . " Additionally , the investigators were " unable to confirm Rhoads 's other claim ( omitted in Time ' s account ) that he had ' transplanted cancer into several patients . ' " 
 During the investigations , Ivy Lee , who handled public relations for the Rockefeller family , and a team at the Institute began a campaign to defend Rhoads ' reputation . He was seen as a promising researcher . The Rockefeller Foundation also wanted to protect its working relationship with medical organizations in Puerto Rico and avoid problems with critics of human experimentation in the US . During the early 1930s , there was a revival of the anti @-@ vivisectionist movement in the US , which also was concerned about the use of vulnerable populations as human subjects of experimentation : children ( especially orphans ) , prisoners , and soldiers . As Lederer observed , " some members of the medical community ... monitored the popular and medical press . " Francis Peyton Rous of the Rockefeller Institute was editor of the Journal of Experimental Medicine through the 1930s and 1940s . Although it accepted few articles on clinical research , he was careful about their wording in an effort to avoid criticism by the anti @-@ vivisectionists . 
 Lee was given access to pre @-@ published versions of the articles on the controversy by both The New York Times and Time . He persuaded Time to eliminate the words " and transplanting cancer into several more " , from its published version of the letter . Also , based on the positive testimony of some patients , The New York Times headlined its article as " Patients Say Rhoads Saved Their Lives " and reported on this as well . Rhoads had returned to New York before the scandal broke in Puerto Rico . After the Attorney General 's report and that of the Rockefeller Institute in 1932 , the controversy quickly faded in the United States . 
 Reaction to the Rhoads scandal and controversy was mixed in the United States , in part due to the Rockefeller campaign . Starr says ( from the 21st century ) that his colleagues did not believe Rhoads ' spin that his letter was a " fantastic and playful composition ... intended as a parody . " Some were worried about Rhoads ' mental health at the time . A superior dismissed the incident as a case of local ingratitude . Time magazine headlined the incident as " Porto Ricochet " ; Starr suggests they meant that Rhoads 's humanitarian work in Puerto Rico had come back to bite him . 
 In Puerto Rico , Albizu Campos used the Rhoads scandal as part of his anti @-@ colonial campaign , attracting followers to the Nationalist Party . In 1950 , longtime Puerto Rican pro @-@ independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the world stage . Collazo said that as a young man , in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement after that .

 Following his study in Puerto Rico , in 1933 Rhoads was chosen to lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in clinical hematology , to study diseases of the blood @-@ forming organs . He built on his research on anemia and tropical sprue . In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue ( and relieve anemia ) . Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field . 
 = = Memorial Hospital and World War II = = 
 In 1940 , Rhoads was selected as director of Memorial Hospital , which was devoted to cancer care and research , and had recently moved into a new building . Rhoads was selected for his interest in clinical investigation in addition to laboratory research , as the hospital did research as well as treatment . He succeeded James Ewing , a noted oncologist . Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931 , a subject which Rhoads referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year . In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat leukemia . 
 During World War II , Rhoads was commissioned as a colonel and assigned as chief of medicine in the Chemical Weapons Division of the U.S. Army . He established the U.S. Army chemical weapons laboratories in Utah , Maryland , and Panama . For this work , he won the Legion of Merit in 1945 . 
 Due to his casualty studies on mustard gas from an accident during the war in Italy , Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment . For the rest of his life , his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan @-@ Kettering . From studies of mustard gas , he developed a drug called <unk> or <unk> . Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis for the development of the field of anti @-@ cancer chemotherapy . Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation , which led to early work on chemotherapy . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 In 1945 Sloan @-@ Kettering Institute was founded as a cancer research center , in the hopes that an industrial approach to research would yield a cure . It opened in 1948 . While still director of Memorial , from 1945 until 1953 Rhoads also served as the first director of the Sloan @-@ Kettering Institute . He was " praised by Memorial for his ' essential role in the evolution of the hospital into a modern medical center . ' " As director of Sloan @-@ Kettering , he had oversight as well over research related to Department of Defense radiation experiments through 1954 . For instance , that year , a Sloan @-@ Kettering team began a multi @-@ year study of " Post @-@ Irradiation Syndrome in Humans . " 
 In 1953 , Rhoads stepped back slightly , becoming scientific director of the newly merged Memorial Sloan – Kettering Cancer Center . He at the same time continued as the scientific director of Sloan @-@ Kettering operations . He also was an adviser to the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding nuclear medicine . Some AEC funding supported Sloan @-@ Kettering research into the use of iodine to transport radiation to cancer tumors . 
 Rhoads continued to serve as scientific director of the Memorial Sloan – Kettering Cancer Center until his death . He died of a coronary occlusion on August 13 , 1959 , in Stonington , Connecticut . In 1979 , on the 20th anniversary of his death , the American Association of Cancer Research established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Prize in his honor , as an annual award to a promising young researcher . 
 = = Revival of controversy = = 
 In 1982 , Puerto Rican social scientist and writer Pedro Aponte @-@ Vázquez discovered new information at various archives which raised questions about the investigations conducted on the 1932 work . Most prominent among his findings was a 1932 letter written by Governor Beverly to the associate director of the Rockefeller Foundation , stating that Rhoads had written a second letter " even worse than the first " and which , according to Beverley , the [ Puerto Rican ] government had suppressed and destroyed . In 1932 the Puerto Rican Attorney General , aided by top @-@ ranking Puerto Rican doctors , had investigated all of the work of Rhoads and the Rockefeller Project , including 13 deaths that occurred among nearly 300 patients treated . They found no evidence of wrongdoing or crimes . In addition , Rhoads ' superior at the Rockefeller Project had conducted a close investigation of the 13 patients who died under Rhoads 's tenure , but found no evidence of wrongdoing . In 1982 Aponte @-@ Vázquez urged the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to reopen the case , but it refused as Rhoads had been dead for so long . 
 In 2002 , Edwin Vazquez , a biology professor at the University of Puerto Rico , came across Rhoads ' 1932 letter and contacted the American Association for Cancer Research ( AACR ) about it . Given the letter 's offensive nature , he demanded that Rhoads ' name be removed from the AACR award . Others also contacted the AACR , including Puerto Rico 's Secretary of State Ferdinand Mercado . Revival of the issue generated a fresh wave of publicity . The AACR , which said it had not known of the 1932 controversy , commissioned an investigation led by Jay Katz , a bioethicist from Yale University . Katz said although " there was no evidence of Dr. Rhoads ' killing patients or transplanting cancer cells , the letter itself was reprehensible enough to remove his name from the award . " The AACR agreed with his conclusion . 
 Eric Rosenthal of Oncology Times in 2003 characterized the case as the AACR having to " deal with the embarrassment of having history catch up to modern @-@ day sensibilities . " He wrote , 
 " The complicated legacy of Cornelius “ Dusty ” Rhoads , who died in 1959 , should not cause society to promote nor deny his existence but should provide a perspective that neither condones what he wrote or thought — or the whitewashing of the incident by institutions and media of the 1930s — but that does give him due appropriate credit for his accomplishments as well as acknowledgement of his faults and sins . " 
 In 2003 the AACR renamed the award , stripping the honor from Rhoads posthumously . The AACR indicated that the new name would be retroactive and past awardees would receive updated plaques .

 = Yu Kanda = 
 Yu Kanda ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Kanda Yū ) is a fictional character from the manga and anime series D.Gray @-@ man by Katsura Hoshino . He is an Exorcist from the Black Order group in charge of destroying enemies known as Akuma . For this , he uses an object referred to as " Innocence " . Kanda is devoted to the Black Order and their fight against a group of enemies known as the Noah Family . However , he is cold and antisocial toward his teammates , often choosing to engage in fights with the series ' protagonist , Allen Walker . Later in the series , it is revealed he is the result of an experiment from the Black Order that created his artificial body and merged it with the brain of a late Exorcist . Kanda was voiced by Takahiro Sakurai in the first anime series and by Takuya Satō in the anime sequel D.Gray @-@ man Hallow in Japanese . He is voiced by Travis Willingham in English . 
 The character was created with the intention to bring a change to the series ' Western setting , with his design being based on samurais . Kanda has been popular with the series ' readers , often appearing in top ten lists of character polls and taking first place twice . His character development , dynamic with Allen and backstory have earned him praise . Merchandise based on him has also been released . On the other hand , publications for the manga and anime series have had mixed reactions due to his lack of social qualities . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Yu Kanda first appears in D.Gray @-@ man as a quick @-@ tempered and cold Exorcist . He openly objects to the paternal way his master General <unk> <unk> treats him , [ ch . 135 ] and he and fellow Exorcist Allen Walker often throw insults and offensive statements at one another . [ ch . 5 ] Kanda refuses to die until he finds a " certain person " . His anti @-@ Akuma weapon Mugen ( <unk> , lit . " Six Illusions " ) is an Equipment @-@ type Innocence that takes the form of a Japanese sword . [ ch . 186 ] Mugen is capable of unleashing several techniques , dubbed " illusions " . [ ch . 10 ] He uses these powers to fight the <unk> as well as the Noah Family . Once he joins his comrades in Edo , Kanda is trapped inside the Noah 's Ark alongside them . [ ch . 86 ] There , he engages the Noah Skin Bolic to let his allies move to another room . Although Kanda defeats Skin , the room is destroyed after pushing Mugen to its limit . Later Allen manages to restore it by taking control of Ark 's piano , which grants his wish of recovering his allies . [ ch . 97 ] Kanda later returns with them to the Black Order . [ ch . 133 ] 
 It is later revealed that Kanda is a Second Exorcist : an artificial body possessing the brain of an Exorcist who died thirty years before the storyline . The Black Order had launched the Synthetic Disciple Project nine years before , hoping that Second <unk> would be able to synchronize with their original Innocence . [ ch . 186 , 187 ] In order for him to survive the synchronization tests , his body was created to heal much more quickly than that of an ordinary human . [ ch . 190 ] This ability is connected to a variation of Om tattooed on the left side of his chest . [ ch . 16 ] [ ch . 12 @,@ 198 ] Kanda was the second Second Exorcist to awaken . He was a friend of Alma Karma , the first Second Exorcist . [ ch . 190 ] Alma learned the truth about Second <unk> and killed the research staff . Hoping Kanda would die with him , Alma attacked Kanda but he was instead sliced to pieces by his friend . [ ch . 193 ] Alma is afterward found to be alive as an Akuma , and tries to kill Kanda again in revenge . It is eventually revealed to Allen that Alma is the woman that Kanda had been looking for . [ ch . 198 ] Kanda finds out after overhearing Alma discussing this with Allen . Allen helps him and Alma run away together , hoping the two would find peace . [ ch . 199 ] Alma dies shortly after telling Kanda he loves him . [ ch . 200 ] 
 Three months later , Kanda returns to the Order . [ ch . 207 ] Kanda 's willingness to return and be an Exorcist causes Mugen to evolve into a Crystal @-@ type weapon . [ ch . 208 ] However , he does not forgive the Order for what they have done to him and Alma ; he refuses to reveal the location of Alma 's body . Shortly afterwards , Kanda and a scientist named Johnny go on a mission to find the disappeared Allen — who escaped the Order after being treated as a Noah — in order to thank him for giving him and Alma their happiness , as well as self @-@ redemption for never caring that Allen was turning into a Noah while going on missions with him . [ ch . 210 ] 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 The character of Yu Kanda was carried over from one unpublished title created by Katsura Hoshino . Hoshino designed Kanda to introduce a change to D.Gray @-@ man 's Western setting . Kanda 's design " came out very naturally " because she typically drew boys with Japanese swords in her amateur manga and she liked samurai " who are like young lions " such as Okita Sōji of the Shinsengumi special police forces . Kanda wears a long coat , and though Allen Walker wore a similar coat , she felt that the design better suited Kanda 's defensive personality and the long coat became Kanda 's " trademark " design . Additionally , she found Kanda difficult to illustrate due to his beauty . [ vol . 2 : 24 ] Hoshino said that she took more care in drawing the highlights in Kanda 's hair than she did with <unk> Lee , another character with long hair . She paid most attention to his hair and eyes especially , as she characterized Kanda as one who " speaks with his eyes " . She noted that Kanda 's early design featured large eyes because she had difficulty drawing finer eyes . Hoshino derived Kanda 's surname from <unk> ( <unk> ) , a rice paddy of which its rice is offered to the gods , a meaning shared by kanda ( <unk> ) . She also referred to Kanda as the " dumbest " protagonist in the series . [ vol . 3 : 106 ] 
 Once Alma Karma 's story arc finished in the series , Hoshino was able to finish Kanda 's backstory which she had promised to the manga 's readers . It was originally very different and had too many inconsistencies . Kanda was given his feminine look because he was to be the reincarnation of the same woman he was looking for . When the series was moved to a monthly serialization rather than weekly , Hoshino had rewritten Kanda 's backstory . Once new prominent characters were introduced in the series , Hoshino felt the it was possible to tell Kanda and Alma 's story . 
 Across the series , Kanda sees illusions of lotus flowers but Hoshino says this holds no particular meaning for him . The flowers were actually seen during Kanda 's previous life . For Kanda , seeing the lotus sinking in dirt would mean his death . The illusion is also noted the first time Kanda nearly kills Alma , and he began to think it was a curse . For the flashbacks , Kanda 's first meeting with his future comrade , Marie , was shortened . The original idea was for Kanda to see the corpses of all the people taking care of him . However , she thought this scene to be too horrific .

 Yu Kanda has been highly popular with the D.Gray @-@ man reader base , often ranking in top tens polls and taking first place twice . [ vol . 7 : 117 ] [ ch . 121 ] [ ch . 171 ] Multiple types of merchandise based on Kanda 's character have been released such as cosplay costumes , his sword Mugen and wigs . Outside the main series , Kanda has made appearances in two video games for the Nintendo DS . He also appears in the crossover game Jump Ultimate Stars . 
 Kanda has received mixed reactions by publications for manga , anime and other media . UK Anime Network 's Kevin Leathers simply referred to him as " the resident emo . " <unk> from Manga News compared the character with several other anti @-@ heroes such as Vegeta from Dragon Ball , Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto based on their personalities . Sandra Scholes from Active Anime found Kanda and Allen to be " not the standard anime variety " , comparing them more with fantasy stories . Sheena McNeil from <unk> said that while she found the character 's personality to be " cold " , she still found his design and his anti @-@ Akuma weapon appealing . Despite finding issues with the anime adaptation of the series , Anime News Network 's Casey Brienza commented " Fan favorites Kamui and Kanda in particular are sketched out strongly , with their dominant traits facing forward " . Animation Insider 's Kimberly Morales enjoyed the contrast between Kanda and Allen due to their different personalities . John Rose from The Fandom Post liked Kanda and Allen 's team up , considering it to be the greatest strength of the manga 's second volume . 
 Since his appearance in the manga 's second volume , Kanda has made minor appearances in the series . His return in the tenth volume was praised by <unk> , as well as his battle against the Noah Skin Bolic . In a later volume review , the same site 's writer expressed surprise at how dark Kanda 's past was , noting the impact in which it had on the character . Chris Beveridge , a reviewer from the Fandom Post , also enjoyed the flashbacks that detailed Kanda 's past due to the impact it could make on future volumes as well as his dynamic with Allen . Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin enjoyed the fight between Kanda and Alma , but instead preferred the situation Allen was put into and said that he wanted to see more of that . Similar to Beveridge , Douresseaux expected to see more of Kanda 's dynamic with the characters when the former and Johnny went in search for Allen . Morales criticized Kanda 's English voice actor Travis Willingham as " his portrayal of the cold and mysterious Kanda makes the young man sound more like a bodybuilder than a lithe swordsman " . In the second D.Gray @-@ man anime , D.Gray @-@ man Hallow , Takahiro Sakurai was replaced by Takuya Satō ' ; Anne <unk> had mixed feelings about the change of Kanda 's new voice actor . 
 = Vervet monkey = 
 The vervet monkey ( Chlorocebus pygerythrus ) , or simply vervet , is an Old World monkey of the family Cercopithecidae native to Africa . The term " vervet " is also used to refer to all the members of the genus Chlorocebus . The five distinct subspecies can be found mostly throughout Southern Africa , as well as some of the eastern countries . <unk> were introduced to Florida , Texas , Alabama , Louisiana , Arizona , California , Ascension Island , Cape Verde , Barbados , Saint Kitts , Bermuda , Bahamas , Cuba , Jamaica , Haiti , Dominican Republic , and Nevis . These mostly herbivorous monkeys have black faces and grey body hair color , ranging in length from about 50 centimetres ( 20 in ) for males to about 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) for females . 
 In addition to very interesting behavioral research on natural populations , vervet monkeys serve as a nonhuman primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans . They have been noted for having human @-@ like characteristics , such as hypertension , anxiety , and social and dependent alcohol use . <unk> live in social groups ranging from 10 to 70 individuals , with males changing groups at the time of sexual maturity . The most significant studies done on vervet monkeys involve their communication and alarm calls , specifically in regard to kin and group recognition and particular predator sightings . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The vervet monkey was previously classified as Cercopithecus <unk> . The vervet and <unk> have often been considered conspecific , or as subspecies of the widespread <unk> . 
 The five subspecies of vervet monkey are : 
 Chlorocebus pygerythrus <unk> 
 C. p. <unk> from southern Kenya 
 C. p. nesiotes 
 C. p. <unk> from South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , and Swaziland 
 C. p. <unk> from Mozambique and Uganda has a distinctly reddish @-@ coloured back , which is darker towards the base of the tail . 
 = = = Synonymy = = = 
 C. p. pygerythrus , as Cercopithecus <unk> , was also formerly divided into four subspecies : 
 C. a. pygerythrus , from South Africa ( Western Cape , Eastern Cape , Northern Cape and southern KwaZulu @-@ Natal ) , and Lesotho ; is said to have pale @-@ coloured limbs and white hands and feet ( though the hands are also said to be black with a scattering of greyish hairs ) , and a greyish body colour with an olive sheen . 
 C. a. <unk> , from northern KwaZulu @-@ Natal , Swaziland and northern South Africa ; is darker , with greyish @-@ brown speckles and dark feet . 
 C. a. <unk> , from southern Botswana and the North West Province of South Africa ; is pale in colour ( light ash @-@ grey ) . 
 C. a. <unk> , from north @-@ eastern Botswana and the Okavango ; has pale feet and a yellowish back and the tail is darker ( especially towards the tip ) than in other southern vervets . 
 These subspecies are no longer recognised and are synonymous with C. p. pygerythrus . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 The vervet monkey has a black face with a white fringe of hair , while the overall hair color is mostly grizzled @-@ grey . The species exhibits sexual dimorphism ; the males are larger in weight and body length . Adult males weigh between 3 @.@ 9 and 8 @.@ 0 kg ( 8 @.@ 6 and 17 @.@ 6 lb ) , averaging 5 @.@ 5 kg ( 12 lb ) , and have a body length between 420 and 600 mm ( 17 and 24 in ) , averaging 490 mm ( 19 in ) from the top of the head to the base of the tail . Adult females weigh between 3 @.@ 4 and 5 @.@ 3 kg ( 7 @.@ 5 and 11 @.@ 7 lb ) and average 4 @.@ 1 kg ( 9 @.@ 0 lb ) , and measure between 300 and 495 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 and 19 @.@ 5 in ) , averaging 426 mm ( 16 @.@ 8 in ) . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Social behavior = = = 
 When males reach sexual maturity , they move to a neighboring group . Often , males will move with a brother or peer , presumably for protection against aggression by males and females of the resident group . Groups that had previously transferred males show significantly less aggression upon the arrival of another male . In almost every case , males migrate to adjacent groups . This obviously increases benefits in regard to distance traveled , but also reduces the amount of genetic variance , increasing the likelihood of inbreeding . 
 Females remain in their groups throughout life . Separate dominance hierarchies are found for each sex . Male hierarchies are determined by age , tenure in the group , fighting abilities , and allies , while female hierarchies are dependent on maternal social status . A large proportion of interactions occur between individuals which are similarly ranked and closely related . Between unrelated individuals , there is female competition for grooming members of high @-@ ranking families , presumably to gain more access to resources . These observations suggest individual recognition is possible and enables discrimination of genetic relatedness and social status . Interactions between different groups are variable , ranging from highly aggressive to friendly . Furthermore , individuals seem to be able to recognize cross @-@ group vocalizations , and identify from and to which monkey each call is intended , even if the call is made by a subadult male which is likely to transfer groups . This suggests the members within a group are actively monitoring the activity of other groups , including the movement of individuals within a group . 
 Within groups , aggression is directed primarily at individuals that are lower on the hierarchy . Once an individual is three years or older , it is considerably more likely to be involved in conflict . Conflict often arises when one group member shows aggression toward a close relative of another . Further , both males and females may redirect aggression towards individuals in which both had close relatives that were previously involved in a conflict . This suggests complex recognition not only of individuals , but also of associations between individuals . This does not suggest recognition of other 's individual kinship bonds is possible , but rather that discrimination of social relationships does occur . 
 = = = Alarm calls and offspring recognition = = = 
 Vervet monkeys have four confirmed predators : leopards , eagles , pythons , and baboons . The sighting of each predator elicits an acoustically distinct alarm call . In experimentation with unreliable signalers , individuals became habituated to incorrect calls from a specific individual . Though the response was lessened for a specific predator , if an unreliable individual gives an alarm call for a different predator , group members respond as if the alarm caller is , in fact , reliable . This suggests vervet monkeys are able to recognize and to respond to not only the individual calling , but also to the semantics of what the individual is communicating . It is believed that vervet monkeys have up to 30 different alarm calls . In the wild vervet monkeys have been seen giving a different call when seeing a human being approaching , leading to researchers believing that vervet monkeys may have a way of distinguishing between different land and flight predators . 
 Mothers can recognize their offspring by a scream alone . A juvenile scream will elicit a reaction from all mothers , yet the juvenile 's own mother had a shorter latency in looking in the direction of the scream , as well as an increased duration in her look . Further , mothers have been observed to help their offspring in conflict , yet rarely aided other juveniles . Other mothers evidently can determine to which mother the offspring belongs . Individuals have been observed to look towards the mother whose offspring is creating the scream . 
 = = = Kin relationships = = = 
 Siblings likely provide the prevailing social relationships during development . Within social groups , mother @-@ offspring and sibling interactive units are distinct groups . The sibling interaction are heavily supportive and friendly , but do have some competition . Contests primarily involve <unk> resource allocation by the common mother . For example , siblings have conflict over grooming time allocated by their mother . Offspring are usually not born in extremely close proximity due to the interbirth period of the mother . This time can be reduced by use of an allomother . The clarity of the familial and <unk> within a group may act as a form of alliance , which would come at relatively low cost in regards to grooming . Other alliances are shown through conflict with aggressive individuals that have acted against a closely related sibling . 
 <unk> is the process when another individual besides the mother cares for an infant . In groups of vervet monkeys , infants are the source of a tremendous amount of attention . Days after an infant is born , every member of the group will inspect the infant at least once by touching or sniffing . While all group members participate in infant caretaking , juvenile females which cannot yet menstruate are responsible for the majority of <unk> . The benefit is mutual for the mother and allomother . Mothers that use <unk> are able to shorten their interbirth periods , the time between successive births . At the same time , <unk> gain experience in rearing infants , and had more success in raising their own offspring . Juvenile females discriminate in preference for the infant they choose to allomother , and will usually choose siblings or infants of high @-@ ranking individuals . When a mother allows her juvenile daughter to become an allomother for a newborn sibling , the mother decreases her own investment in the infant , while increasing the chances of successful rearing of her immature daughter . 
 Grandmothers and grandchildren share one @-@ quarter of their genes , so they should be more likely to form affiliative relationships than unrelated members in a group . Not only do infants approach their grandmothers more often than unrelated members , but they also prefer their grandmothers compared to other adult female kin , not including their own mothers . Additional research has shown grandmothers show no preference over the sex of their grandchild . Interest in the grandchild spurred from the rank of the grandmother within a group . Higher @-@ ranking grandmothers showed more interest in caring for their grandchildren when compared to low @-@ ranking grandmothers . The presence of grandmothers has been associated with a decrease in mortality of infants . 
 = = = Spite = = = 
 Spiteful actions are extremely rare in the animal kingdom . Often , there is an indirect benefit to the individual acting ' spiteful ' or to a close relative of that individual . Vervet monkeys have been observed to destroy a competitor 's food source rather than consume or steal it themselves . While energy is being lost on destroying the food , a competitive advantage is given to the individual due to an increase in competitive gain . This would be pertinent for a male which could be displaced within his group to immigrating males . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Female vervets do not have external signs indicating a menstruation period , thus there are not elaborate social behaviors involving reproduction . Typically , a female gives birth once a year , between September to February , after a gestation period of about 165 days . Usually only one infant is born at a time , though twins can occur rarely . A normal infant weighs 300 – 400 g . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The vervet monkey eats a primarily herbivorous diet , living mostly on wild fruits , flowers , leaves , seeds , and seed pods . In agricultural areas , vervets become problem animals , as they will raid bean crops , peas , young tobacco plants , vegetables , fruit , and various grain crops . Carnivorous aspects of their diet include grasshoppers and termites . Raids of cattle egrets and weaver bird nests have been observed where the vervets will eat the eggs and chicks .

 The vervet monkey ranges throughout much of Southern and East Africa , being found from Ethiopia , Somalia and extreme southern South Sudan , to South Africa . It is not found west of the East African Rift or the Luangwa River , where it is replaced by the closely related <unk> ( C. <unk> ) . The vervet monkey inhabits savanna , riverine woodland , coastal forest and mountains up to 4000 m ( 13 @,@ 100 ft ) . They are adaptable and able to persist in secondary and / or highly fragmented vegetation , including cultivated areas , and sometimes are found living in both rural and urban environments . Annual home range size has been observed to be as high as 176 ha with an average population density of 54 @.@ 68 animals / km ² . 
 Introduced vervet monkeys are naturalized in Ascension Island , Cape Verde , Bermuda , Barbados , Bahamas , Cuba , Jamaica , Haiti , Dominican Republic , and Saint Kitts and Nevis . Dania Beach , Florida is home to about 20 introduced vervets .

 In spite of low predator populations in many areas , human development has encroached on wild territories , and this species is killed by electricity pylons , vehicles , dogs , pellet guns , poison , and bullets , and is trapped for traditional medicine , bush meat , and for biomedical research . The vervet monkey has a complex and fragile social system , and persecution of the monkeys is thought to have affected troop structures and diminishing numbers . Many people living in close proximity to vervet monkey colonies see them as pests as they steal their food . There are heavy fines in some cities to discourage the killing of vervet monkeys . 
 Its status according to the IUCN is " least concern " . 
 This species was known in ancient Egypt including the Red Sea Mountains and the Nile Valley . From fresco artworks found in Akrotiri on the Mediterranean island of Santorini there is evidence that the vervet monkey was known to the inhabitants of this settlement around 2000 BC ; this fact is most noted for evidence of early contact between Egypt and Akrotiri .

 Zhenguo Temple ( Chinese : <unk> ) is a Buddhist temple located 10 km from Pingyao in the village of <unk> , in Shanxi Province , China . The temple 's oldest hall , the <unk> Hall , was built in 963 during the Northern Han dynasty , and is notable for featuring very large brackets that hold up the roof and flying eaves . The sculptures inside the hall are among the only examples of 10th century Buddhist sculpture in China .

 The history of the temple begins in 963 , when it was recorded that Ten @-@ Thousand Buddha Hall ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was built . The date is written on a beam in the hall , and is also the date given by a local history of Pingyao county written in the 19th century . A stela written in 1819 also confirms this date . <unk> Hall is the oldest building at Zhenguo temple , and is the only surviving building that dates from the short @-@ lived Northern Han dynasty . Although little is known of the temple 's history , stelae record that it was renovated in 1540 and in 1816 .

Despite the building 's small size , and features that would identify it as a regular hall ( such as pillars that have been implanted directly into the floor instead of on a stone pedestal ) , the structure is quite complex . There are doors at the front and back of the hall . In addition , the front of the hall has two windows on either side of the door . There are twelve pillars supporting the structure . The corner and column @-@ top brackets holding up the roof are of the 7th degree , one of the most complex and large types according to Yingzao Fashi . These bracket sets are nearly 2 @.@ 5 meters high – 70 % the height of the columns . Inter @-@ columnar brackets that occur between every two pillars are of the 5th degree . The hall has no ceiling , and the upper and lower set of rafters are exposed . Nancy Steinhardt speculates that the complex brackets on what would have been a humble structure were an attempt by the Northern Han rulers to build a magnificent structure with limited resources . 
 The hall contains eleven sculptures from the Northern Han period . These are the only Chinese sculptures from the period that survive from outside the Mogao Grottoes . There is a main statue of Sakyamuni flanked by Bodhisattvas and the Heavenly Kings . 
 = Islands of the Clyde = 
 The Islands of the Firth of Clyde are the fifth largest of the major Scottish island groups after the Inner and Outer Hebrides , Orkney and Shetland . They are situated in the Firth of Clyde between Ayrshire and Argyll . There are about forty islands and skerries , of which only four are inhabited and only nine larger than 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) . The largest and most populous are Arran and Bute , and Great Cumbrae and Holy Isle are also served by dedicated ferry routes . Unlike the four larger Scottish archipelagos , none of the isles in this group are connected to one another or to the mainland by bridges . 
 The geology and geomorphology of the area is complex and the islands and the surrounding sea lochs each have distinctive features . The influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Drift create a mild , damp oceanic climate . 
 The larger islands have been continuously inhabited since Neolithic times , were influenced by the emergence of the kingdom of Dál Riata from 500 AD and then absorbed into the emerging Kingdom of Alba under Kenneth MacAlpin . They experienced Norse incursions during the early Middle Ages and then became part of the Kingdom of Scotland in the 13th century . There is a diversity of wildlife , including three species of rare endemic tree . 
 = = Geology and geography = = 
 The Highland Boundary Fault runs past Bute and through the northern part of Arran , so from a geological perspective some of the islands are in the Highlands and some in the Central Lowlands . As a result , Arran is sometimes referred to as " Scotland in miniature " and the island is a popular destination for geologists , who come to see intrusive igneous landforms such as sills and dykes as well as sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks ranging widely in age . Visiting in 1787 , the geologist James Hutton found his first example of an unconformity there and this spot is one of the most famous places in the study of geology . A group of weakly metamorphosed rocks that form the Highland Border Complex lie discontinuously along the Highland Boundary Fault . One of the most prominent exposures is along Loch Fad on Bute . Ailsa Craig , which lies some 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) south of Arran , has been quarried for a rare type of micro @-@ granite containing <unk> known as " <unk> " which is used to make curling stones . As of 2004 , 60 to 70 % of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island . 
 In common with the rest of Scotland the Firth of Clyde was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation . Arran 's highest peaks may have been nunataks at this time . After the last retreat of the ice sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting post glacial coastlines a complex task but the resultant <unk> behind raised beaches are a prominent feature of the entire coastline . 
 The soils of the islands reflect the diverse geology . Bute has the most productive land , and a pattern of deposits that is typical of the southwest of Scotland . There is a mixture of boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys , and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere , especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places , inland from the sandy bays , such as <unk> . 
 The Firth of Clyde , in which these island lie , is north of the Irish Sea and has numerous branching inlets , some of them substantial features in their own right . These include Loch Goil , Loch Long , Gare Loch , Loch Fyne and the estuary of the River Clyde . In places the effect of glaciation on the seabed is pronounced . For example , the Firth is 320 metres ( 1 @,@ 050 ft ) deep between Arran and Bute , although they are only 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) apart . The islands are all exposed to wind and tide and various lighthouses , such as those on Ailsa Craig , Pladda and Davaar act as an aid to navigation . 
 = = Climate = = 
 The Firth of Clyde lies between 55 and 56 degrees north , at the same latitude as Labrador in Canada and north of the Aleutian Islands , but the influence of the North Atlantic Drift — the northern extension of the Gulf Stream — ameliorates the winter weather and the area enjoys a mild , damp oceanic climate . Temperatures are generally cool , averaging about 6 ° C ( 43 ° F ) in January and 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in July at sea level . Snow seldom lies at sea level and frosts are generally less frequent than the mainland . In common with most islands of the west coast of Scotland , rainfall is generally high at between 1 @,@ 300 mm ( 51 in ) per annum on Bute , the <unk> and in the south of Arran and 1 @,@ 900 mm ( 75 in ) per annum in the north of Arran . The Arran mountains are wetter still with the summits receiving over 2 @,@ 550 mm ( 100 in ) annually . May , June and July are the sunniest months , with upwards of 200 hours of bright sunshine being recorded on average , southern Bute benefiting from a particularly high level of sunny days .

 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 Mesolithic humans arrived in the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth millennium BC , probably from Ireland . This was followed by a wave of Neolithic peoples using the same route and there is some evidence that the Firth of Clyde was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time . A particular style of megalithic structure developed in Argyll , the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that has become known as the Clyde cairn . They are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large slabs of stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments . A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead , who were placed inside the chambers . They are concentrated in Arran , Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating . An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to <unk> BC , although it was almost certainly built earlier than that , possibly c . <unk> . There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times , including six stone circles on Machrie Moor , Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute . 
 Bronze Age settlers also constructed megaliths at various sites , many of them dating from the second millennium BC , although the chambered cairns were replaced by burial cists , found on for example , Inchmarnock . Settlement evidence , especially from the early part of this era is however poor . The Queen of the Inch necklace is an article of jewellery made of jet found on Bute that dates from circa 2000 BC . During the early Iron Age Brythonic culture held sway , there being no evidence that the Roman occupation of southern Scotland extended to these islands .

 During the 2nd century AD Irish influence was at work in the region and by the 6th century the kingdom of Dál Riata was established . Unlike the P @-@ Celtic speaking Brythons , these Gaels spoke a form of Gaelic that still survives in the Hebrides . Through the efforts of Saint Ninian and others Christianity slowly supplanted <unk> . Dál Riata flourished from the time of Fergus Mór in the late fifth century until the Viking incursions that commenced in the late eighth century . Islands close to the shores of modern Ayrshire would have remained part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde during this period , whilst the main islands became part of the emerging Kingdom of Alba founded by Kenneth MacAlpin ( Cináed mac Ailpín ) . 
 = = = Viking influence = = = 
 The Islands of the Clyde historically formed the border zone between the Norse @-@ dominated <unk> and Scotland . As such many of these islands fell under Norwegian and Uí Ímair hegemony between the 9th and 13th centuries and this Norse influence would see almost constant warfare on the western seaboard of Scotland until the partitioning of the Hebrides in 1156 . 
 Latterly , the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Godred V of the Isle of Man while the Inner Hebrides south of Ardnamurchan and the islands of the Clyde became part of the Kingdom of the Hebrides controlled by Somerled . This began a process whereby the islands of the Clyde became Scottish in language and culture rather than Norse . After Somerled 's death in 1164 his kingdom was split between his three sons , Ragnall in Islay and Kintyre , <unk> in Lorne and the other Argyll islands , and Angus holding Arran and Bute . 
 Nearly a century later in the 1230s invading Norse forces took Rothesay Castle , hacking through the walls with their axes . In 1263 troops commanded by Haakon Haakonarson repeated the feat but the ensuing Battle of Largs between Scots and Norse forces , which took place on the shores of the Firth of Clyde , was inconclusive as a military contest . This marked an ultimately terminal weakening of Norse power in Scotland . Haakon retreated to Orkney , where he died in December 1263 , entertained on his death bed by recitations of the sagas . Following this ill @-@ fated expedition , all rights that the Norwegian crown " had of old therein " in relation to the islands were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth . 
 = = = Modern Scotland = = = 
 From the mid thirteenth century to the present day all of the islands of the Clyde have remained part of Scotland . 
 From the commencement of the early medieval period until 1387 all of these isles were part of the Diocese of Sodor and Man , based at Peel , on the Isle of Man . Thereafter , the seat of the Bishopric of the Isles was relocated to the north , firstly to Snizort on Skye and then Iona , a state of affairs which continued until the 16th century Scottish Reformation . 
 The century following 1750 was time of significant change . New forms of transport , industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes , and an end to traditional ways of life that had endured for centuries . The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden marked the beginning of the end for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some , these transformations came at a cost for others . In the early 19th century Alexander , 10th Duke of Hamilton ( 1767 – 1852 ) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran 's population . Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow . A memorial to this early form of ethnic cleansing has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash , paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants . 
 From the 1850s to the late 20th century the Clyde Puffer , made famous by the Vital Spark , was the workhorse of the islands , carrying all kinds of produce and products to and from the islands . The Caledonian Steam Packet Company ( CSP ) was formed in May 1889 to operate steamer services to and from Gourock for the Caledonian Railway and soon expanded by taking over rival steamer operators . David MacBrayne Ltd operated the Glasgow to <unk> steamer service , as part of the " Royal Route " to Oban . During the 20th century many of the islands were developed as tourist resorts for <unk> who went " Doon the <unk> " , in parallel to mainland resorts such as Largs and Troon . In 1973 CSP and <unk> commenced joint Clyde and West Highland operations under the new name of Caledonian MacBrayne . A publicly owned company , they serve Great Cumbrae , Arran and Bute as well as running mainland @-@ to @-@ mainland ferries across the firth . Private companies operate services from Arran to Holy Isle and from <unk> 's Point ( Gourock ) to Hunter 's Quay on the Cowal peninsula . 
 The majority of the islands at one time made up the traditional County of Bute . Today the islands are split more or less equally between the modern unitary authorities of Argyll and Bute and North Ayrshire with only Ailsa Craig and Lady Isle in South Ayrshire falling outwith these two council areas .

In the late 11th century Magnus Barefoot , King of Norway , made an arrangement with King Malcolm III of Scotland that he could take possession of land on the west coast around which a ship could sail . He had his longship dragged across the 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) long isthmus in the north of Kintyre between East Loch Tarbert and West Loch Tarbert as part of a campaign to increase his possessions . Magnus declared that Kintyre had " better land than the best of the Hebrides " , and by taking command of his ship 's tiller and " sailing " across the isthmus he was able to claim the entire peninsula was an island , which remained under Norse rule for more than a dozen years as a result . 
 Loch Fyne , which extends 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) inland from the Sound of Bute is the longest of Scotland 's sea lochs and contains several islets and skerries .

 There are populations of red deer , red squirrel , badger , otter , adder and common lizard . Offshore there are harbour porpoises , basking sharks and various species of dolphin . Davaar is home to a population of wild goats . 
 Over 200 species of bird have been recorded in the area including black guillemot , eider , peregrine falcon and the golden eagle . In 1981 there were 28 ptarmigan on Arran , but in 2009 it was reported that extensive surveys had been unable to record any . Similarly , the red @-@ billed chough no longer breeds on the island . 
 Arran also has three rare endemic species of tree , the Arran Whitebeams . These are the Scottish or Arran whitebeam , the cut @-@ leaved whitebeam and the Catacol whitebeam , which are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world . They are found in a protected national nature reserve , and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage . Only 283 Arran whitebeam and 236 cut @-@ leaved whitebeam were recorded as mature trees in 1980 . The Catacol whitebeam was discovered in 2007 and steps have been taken to protect the two known specimens . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Roman historian Tacitus refers to the <unk> meaning the Clyde . The derivation is not certain but probably from the Brythonic <unk> which became Clut in Old Welsh . The name 's literal meaning is " wash " but probably refers to the idea of a river goddess being " the washer " or " strongly flowing one " . Bute 's derivation is also uncertain . <unk> is the Norse name and this is the Old Irish word for " fire " , possibly a reference to signal fires . The etymology of Arran is no more clear — Haswell @-@ Smith ( 2004 ) offers a Brythonic derivation and a meaning of " high place " although Watson ( 1926 ) suggests it may be pre @-@ Celtic . 
 = Paisley witches = 
 The Paisley witches , also known as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches , were tried in Paisley , Renfrewshire , central Scotland , in 1697 . Eleven @-@ year @-@ old Christian Shaw , daughter of the Laird of Bargarran , complained of being tormented by some local witches ; they included one of her family 's servants , Catherine Campbell , whom she had reported to her mother after witnessing her steal a drink of milk . 
 Seven people – Margaret Lang , John Lindsay , James Lindsay , John Reid , Catherine Campbell , Margaret Fulton , and Agnes Naismith – were found guilty of having bewitched Shaw and were condemned to death . One subsequently committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell , and it is believed that Agnes Naismith may have died while imprisoned . The other five were hanged and then burned on the Gallow Green in Paisley on 10 June 1697 , the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe . 
 Agnes Naismith cursed everyone present at her trial and their descendants , and for many years afterwards every tragedy in Paisley was blamed on her curse . Christian Shaw went on to become a successful businesswoman and manufacturer of thread .

 On 17 August 1696 , 11 @-@ year @-@ old Christian Shaw , the daughter of a local landowner , John Shaw of Bargarran , saw one of her family 's servants , Catherine Campbell , steal a drink of milk . Shaw reported the theft to her mother , whereupon Campbell cursed her , wishing that the Devil would " haul her soul through Hell " . Four days later Shaw encountered Agnes Naismith , an old woman reputed to be a witch . The following day , 22 August , Shaw became violently ill with fits , similar to the symptoms reported a few years earlier in the American Salem witch trials of 1693 . After eight weeks Shaw 's parents took her to see the eminent Glasgow physician Matthew Brisbane , who could find no cause for her symptoms . For eight days after her visit Shaw seemed to have recovered , but then " the fits returned with increased violence . She would become as stiff as a corpse and be senseless and motionless " . 
 Shaw 's parents took her back to Dr Brisbane , and by the time they arrived back in Glasgow she had begun to pull out of her mouth balls of hair she claimed had been put there by those who were afflicting her . Soon she began to pull other " trash " out of her mouth , including straw , coal , gravel , chicken feathers , and cinders . During her fits she was sometimes heard to be talking to the invisible Catherine Campbell , pleading for a return to their former friendship . 
 With Brisbane unable to provide any rational explanation for Shaw 's condition her family and their local parish minister concluded that she must be possessed and being tormented by witches , a common occurrence in England and Scotland and a central element in the Salem witch trials a few years earlier . The church set up a weekly fast and prayer meeting at Bargarron House , and Shaw 's father appealed to the authorities that those named by his daughter as tormenting her should be arrested . She had initially identified only Catherine Campbell and Agnes Naismith , but as time wore on she implicated others , and eventually 35 were accused . Ten were male and twenty female ; the genders and identities of the remaining five are unknown . 
 = = Investigation and trial = = 
 At the request of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up a commission to investigate the case . Under the chairmanship of Lord Blantyre , the hearing opened on 5 February 1697 . The commission 's task was to decide whether there was a prima facie case against those accused by Shaw before they were committed for trial . 
 Seven were subsequently summoned to appear before a second commission in Paisley : Margaret Lang , John Lindsay , James Lindsay , John Reid , Catherine Campbell , Margaret Fulton , and Agnes Naismith . They were charged with murder and tormenting a number of people , including Christian Shaw . Their advocate , James <unk> , argued that the prosecution was obliged to rule out the possibility that the events surrounding the case could be explained by natural causes before a conviction could be safely secured . Matthew Brisbane gave evidence stating that he had been unable to find any such cause for Shaw 's condition . James Hutchison , the minister of <unk> , about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Paisley , delivered a sermon to the commission ; it was commonplace at the time for a member of the clergy to preach to the court in Scottish witch trials , and they were not infrequently instrumental in securing convictions . Hutchison placed great store on the presence of witches ' marks on the bodies of the accused , and cast doubt on the natural explanations of those marks offered by some physicians : " And however doctors may say such and such things of it [ a witches ' mark ] , we know not upon what ground . It may be that they have been budded and bribed to say such things " . 
 The jury , confronted by a threat from the prosecutor that if they acquitted the defendants they would be " accessory to all the <unk> , <unk> , murders , tortures , and seductions , etc . , whereof those enemies of heaven and earth shall hereafter be guilty when they get out " , found all seven of the accused guilty . 
 = = Executions = = 
 One of those convicted , James Reid committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell , using his handkerchief attached to a nail in the wall . The remaining six were hanged and then burned on the Gallow Green in Paisley on 10 June 1697 , the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe . John and James Lindsay , brothers from <unk> Mill , near Houston , aged 11 and 14 respectively , held each other 's hands as they were hanged together . Catherine Campbell , after having been carried struggling and screaming to the gallows , " called down the wrath of God and the Devil on her accusers " before being despatched . Margaret Fulton appeared to have become insane , and " spoke cheerfully about visits to <unk> and the Abode of the Fairies on the backs of magical horses " . Margaret Lang admitted to consorting with the Devil , but said that she had renounced sin and was reconciled with God . Agnes Naismith laid a " dying woman 's curse " on everyone present and their descendants ; for many years afterwards every tragedy in the town was blamed on " the witches ' curse " . 
 One account of the executions states that some of the condemned were still alive when their bodies were burned , and that the executioners borrowed a walking stick from an onlooker with which to push their victims ' moving limbs back into the fire ; its owner refused to take it back after it had been in contact with witches . 
 = = Modern interpretation = = 
 The anxiety induced in Christian Shaw by Catherine Campbell 's curse may have brought on a conversion disorder in the young girl , the modern name for what was once known as hysteria . The term " conversion " derives from Sigmund Freud 's idea that anxiety can be converted into physical symptoms such as the seizures displayed by Shaw .
