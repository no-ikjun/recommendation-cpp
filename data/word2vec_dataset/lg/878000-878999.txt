 Orci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise , ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast . Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed , as Hasbro had to start designing the toys . Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked . Optimus , Megatron , Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script . Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman , but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender ; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form , which he found too small . An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The filmmakers created the size of each robot with the size of their vehicle mode in mind , supporting the Transformer 's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth . The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why " aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel " . This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look , away from the " blocky " Generation 1 Transformers . Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor , returning full @-@ circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line . The robots also had to look alien , or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man . 
 A product placement deal with General Motors supplied alternate forms for most of the Autobots , which saved $ 3 million for the production . GM also provided nearly two hundred cars , destined for destruction in the climactic battle scene . The U.S. Armed Forces provided significant support , enhancing the film 's realism : the film features F @-@ 22s , F @-@ <unk> , and V @-@ 22 Ospreys , the first time these aircraft were used for a film ; soldiers served as extras , and authentic uniforms were provided for the actors . A @-@ 10 Thunderbolt IIs and Lockheed AC @-@ 130s also appear . Captain Christian Hodge joked that he had to explain to his superiors that the filmmakers wanted to portray most of their aircraft as evil Decepticons : however , he remarked " people love bad guys " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 To save money for the production , Bay reduced his usual fee by 30 % . He planned an 83 @-@ day shooting schedule , maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set @-@ ups per day than usual . Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada , allowing him to work with a crew he was familiar with , and who understood his work ethic . A pre @-@ shoot took place on April 19 , 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base , which stood in for Qatar . To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range , a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin ; ironically , the village would be blown up . The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft , who improvised dialogue as if it were an actual battle . 
 The company also shot at Hoover Dam and at the Pentagon , the first time since the September 11 attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations . The external Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10 : 00 a.m. , with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day . Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista , where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built . Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles , California shooting the climactic battle , with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit 's Michigan Central Station . The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory , which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002 . Filming wrapped on October 4 , 2006 . 
 The film has been found to re @-@ use footage from Bay 's previous film Pearl Harbor ( 2001 ) . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Spielberg encouraged Bay to restrict computer @-@ generated imagery to the robots and background elements in the action sequences . Stunts such as Bonecrusher smashing through a bus were done practically , while cameras were placed into the midst of car crashes and explosions to make it look more exciting . Work on the animatics began in April 2005 . Bay indicated that three quarters of the film 's effects were made by Industrial Light & Magic , while Digital Domain made the rest , including the Arctic discovery of Megatron ; Frenzy 's severed head ; a vending machine mutated by the Allspark , and the Autobots ' protoforms . Many of the animators were big Transformers fans and were given free rein to experiment : a scene where Jazz attacks Brawl is a reference to a scene in The Transformers : The Movie where Kup jumps on <unk> . 
 ILM created computer @-@ generated transformations during six months in 2005 , looking at every inch of the car models . Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics , but it did not look exciting enough and was changed to be more fluid . Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters ' faces , instead going for a " Rubik 's Cube " style of modeling . He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting , realistic , dynamic and quick , rather than like lumbering beasts . One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible , allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed . Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful . 
 Due to the intricate designs of the Transformers , even the simplest motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts ; each of Ironhide 's guns are made of ten thousand parts . Bumblebee uses a piece below his face @-@ plate as an eyebrow , pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile , and all the characters ' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten . According to Bay , " The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement " ; that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities . Each rendered piece had to look like real metal , shiny or dull . This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars . Close @-@ up shots of the robots were sped up to look " cool " , but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight . Photographs were taken of each set . These were used as a reference for the lighting environment , which was reproduced within a computer , so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there . Bay , who has directed numerous car commercials , understood ray tracing was the key to making the robots look real ; the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies . Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots , so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Composer Steve Jablonsky , who collaborated with Bay on The Island , scored music for the trailers before work began on the film itself . Recording took place in April 2007 , at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City , California . The score , including the teaser music , uses six major themes across ninety minutes of music . The Autobots have three themes , one named " Optimus " to represent the wisdom and compassion of the Autobot leader , and another played during their arrival on Earth . The Decepticons have a chanted theme which relies on electronics , unlike most of the score . The AllSpark also has its own theme . Hans Zimmer , Jablonsky 's mentor , also helped to compose the score .

 Hasbro 's toy line for the film was created over two months in late 2005 and early 2006 , in heavy collaboration with the filmmakers . <unk> Optimus Prime and Starscream were released in the United States on May 1 , 2007 , and the first wave of figures was released on June 2 . The line featured characters not in the film , including Arcee . A second wave , titled " AllSpark Power " , was set for release late 2007 , which consisted of repaints and robotic versions of ordinary vehicles in the film . The toys feature " <unk> Technology " , where moving parts of the toy allow other parts to shift automatically . Merchandise for the film earned Hasbro $ 480 million in 2007 . 
 Deals were made with 200 companies to promote the film in 70 countries . Michael Bay directed tie @-@ in commercials for General Motors , Panasonic , Burger King and PepsiCo , while props – including the Camaro used for Bumblebee and the AllSpark – were put up for charity sale on eBay . A viral marketing alternate reality game was employed through the Sector 7 website , which presented the film and all previous Transformers toys and media as part of a cover @-@ up operation called " Hungry Dragon , " perpetrated by a " real life " Sector 7 to hide the existence of genuine Transformers . The site featured several videos presenting " evidence " of Transformers on Earth , including a cameo from the original Bumblebee .

 Transformers had its worldwide premiere at N Seoul Tower on June 10 , 2007 . The film 's June 27 premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival used a live digital satellite feed to project the film on to a screen . A premiere took place at Rhode Island on June 28 , which was a freely available event giving attendees the opportunity to buy tickets for $ 75 to benefit four charities : the Rhode Island Community Food Bank , the Autism Project of Rhode Island , Adoption Rhode Island , and Hasbro Children 's Hospital . The film was released in IMAX on September 21 , 2007 , with additional footage that had not been included in the general theatrical release .

 Transformers fans were initially divided over the film due to the radical redesigns of many characters , although the casting of Peter Cullen was warmly received . Transformers comic book writer Simon Furman and Beast Wars script consultant Benson Yee both considered the film to be spectacular fun , although Furman also argued that there were too many human storylines . Yee felt that being the first in a series , the film had to establish much of the fictional universe and therefore did not have time to focus on the Decepticons . 
 The film created a greater awareness of the franchise and drew in many new fans . Transformers ' box office success led to the active development of films based on <unk> and <unk> , as well as a Knight Rider remake . When filming the sequel , Bay was told by soldiers the film helped their children understand what their work was like , and that many had christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters . 
 After the film 's 2009 sequel was titled Revenge of the Fallen , screenwriter Orci was asked if this film would be retitled , just as Star Wars was titled Star Wars Episode IV : A New Hope when re @-@ released . He doubted the possibility , but said if it was retitled , he would call it Transformers : More Than Meets the Eye . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 At the website Metacritic , the film received a rating average of 61 , based on 35 reviews , indicating that it is generally a favorably reviewed film . Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 57 % of critics gave the film positive reviews , based on 219 reviews . IGN 's Todd Gilchrist called it Bay 's best film , and " one of the few instances where it 's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time , mostly because it 's undeniably also a whole lot of fun " . The Advertiser 's Sean <unk> found the visual effects so seamless that " you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence " . The Denver Post 's Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having " a believably rendered scale and intimacy " , and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised " that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega @-@ machines " . Ain 't It Cool News 's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story , and that " it has a real sense of wonder , one of the things that 's missing from so much of the big CGI <unk> released these days " . Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun , and said that " [ Bay ] manages to hold on to his audience 's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes " . Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review , giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4 , writing : " It 's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good , and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is , but to make that into an asset . " 
 Despite the praise for the visual effects , there was division over the human storylines . The Hollywood Reporter 's Kirk Honeycutt liked " how a teen plotline gets tied in to the end of the world " , while Empire 's Ian Nathan praised Shia LaBeouf as " a smart , natural comedian , [ who ] levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster " . Ain 't It Cool News founder Harry Knowles felt Bay 's style conflicted with Spielberg 's , arguing the military story only served as a distraction from Sam . James Berardinelli hated the film as he did not connect with the characters in @-@ between the action , which he found tedious . Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan found the humans " oddly lifeless , doing little besides marking time until those big toys fill the screen " , while ComingSoon.net 's Joshua Starnes felt the Transformers were " completely believable , right up to the moment they open their mouths to talk , when they revert to bad cartoon characters " . Daily Herald 's Matt Arado was annoyed that " the Transformers [ are ] little more than supporting players " , and felt the middle act was sluggish . CNN 's Tom Charity questioned the idea of a film based on a toy , and felt it would " buzz its youthful demographic [ ... ] but leave the rest of us wondering if Hollywood could possibly aim lower " .

 = Yawkey ( MBTA station ) = 
 Yawkey is a commuter rail station on the MBTA Commuter Rail Framingham / Worcester Line , located in the Fenway @-@ Kenmore neighborhood of Boston , Massachusetts near Kenmore Square . The station sits below grade between Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue , next to the Massachusetts Turnpike . Yawkey station was originally opened as an infill station in 1988 , for limited service to Boston Red Sox games at Fenway Park . Regular commuter service began in 2001 for riders headed to Boston University , Kenmore Square , and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area . 
 Inbound and outbound trains formerly shared a single two @-@ car platform on the inbound track , requiring Yawkey passengers to embark or debark from the front two cars of outbound trains or the rear two cars of inbound trains . In 2012 , work began on a new station , which includes two longer high @-@ level platforms and an overhead pedestrian bridge . The bridge will eventually allow direct access from the Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue overpasses through the planned Fenway Center development . Passengers boarded from the east end of the new station until March 10 , 2014 ; after delays , it opened fully that day . 
 The new station is served by all Worcester Line trains ; it is expected to increase ridership at Yawkey from 585 total daily boardings and alightings to 937 . By a 2012 count , there were 827 daily ( 362 boardings and 465 alightings ) . With the completion of the new station , Yawkey is fully handicapped accessible .

 Named in honor of long @-@ time Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey , Yawkey was opened on April 29 , 1988 , and initially was only used for special service to Fenway Park for Boston Red Sox games . It was used by Framingham Line trains as well as special " Fenway Flyer " baseball trains from the Attleboro ( now Providence / Stoughton ) and Franklin lines . The " Fenway Flyer " trains had an annual ridership of 58 @,@ 000 in 1990 . The station became popular enough that the MBTA added regular commuter service . This largely obviated the need for " Fenway Flyer " specials , though certain weekend Providence trains ran to Yawkey as late as 2007 . Similar special trains continue to serve Foxboro station during football and soccer games and special events at Gillette Stadium . 
 Yawkey was built with a low @-@ level asphalt platform and was not initially handicapped accessible . After the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act , a mini @-@ high platform was added between 1990 and 1992 . However , the mini @-@ high platform only served one of the line 's two tracks , limiting the number of trains that could stop at the station . 
 = = = Regular service = = = 
 In early 2000 , the MBTA released a study which analyzed the possibility of full @-@ time commuter service to Yawkey to serve workers at nearby Boston University , Kenmore Square , and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area . An addendum released in August 2000 analyzed increased service ( on all modes ) to Fenway Park on game days . Possibilities studied included running game day service from the Plymouth / Kingston Line with an unused trainset , a South Station @-@ Yawkey shuttle , increased Green Line service , and bus shuttles to the Red Line in Cambridge and to Ruggles station . Consideration was given to building a dedicated terminal spur and station on the remains of the former Highland Branch . 
 Regular weekday commuter service to the station began on January 2 , 2001 with 4 daily round trips . Weekend service was still initially limited to game days . Regular weekend service was added on April 30 , 2001 . From 2001 to 2014 , not all trains stopped at the station ; most peak @-@ direction trains stopped , but many off @-@ peak trains did not . Before the rebuilding began in 2012 , some trains stopped at Yawkey only on game days during the Red Sox season . 
 = = = New station = = = 
 In August 2007 , the MBTA published a feasibility study exploring the possibility of rebuilding Yawkey as a full @-@ service station . The study concluded that doing so would increase ridership by 60 % , from 585 daily boardings and alightings to 937 . On November 15 , 2010 , Governor Deval Patrick and other officials broke ground on a major rebuilding of the station , originally expected to be completed in the spring of 2012 . The new station has two full @-@ length high @-@ level platforms that provide level , handicapped @-@ accessible boarding for all passengers ; the old platform had only a wooden ramp for accessibility . The two 700 @-@ foot @-@ long platforms ( a side platform between the tracks plus a side platform on the south side of the tracks ) are connected with an overpass , and passengers no longer have to cross the tracks to access certain outbound trains . 
 The rebuilt station was intended to be the first component of a larger , mostly private development called Fenway Center . The new station , which cost about $ 13 @.@ 5 million , is planned to be powered entirely by solar panels after the development opens . Although the developer , Meredith Corporation , wished to close the station during rebuilding , the MBTA elected to keep it open . Fenway Center , which was to be built on the air rights over the adjacent Massachusetts Turnpike ( I @-@ 90 ) , would eventually cover much of the station . As part of the development , walkways would be built above the station , allowing passengers to walk directly to the pedestrian bridge and platforms from Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue rather than passing through private parking lots . After lengthy negotiations , an air @-@ rights deal between the city and the developer regarding Fenway Center was reached in May 2013 . As of June 2016 , construction on the new buildings had still yet to begin , while financing and staging negotiations for the section not located over the station and highway were underway . 
 The Framingham / Worcester line schedule was changed slightly in April 2012 to allow for temporary single @-@ tracking through the station for construction . Actual station construction activity started in June 2012 , and in August one track was cut , reducing the line to one track through the station . The platforms were installed in late November 2012 ; construction of the elevator shafts began in February 2013 . A temporary ramp opened in June 2013 for passengers to use the east end of the future outbound platform ; the old platform was demolished soon afterwards to make room for the west ends of the new platforms . The pedestrian bridge was lifted into place in August 2013 , followed by the various roof and canopy elements . The second track was rebuilt in late September , followed by the remaining platform segments . 
 The new station fully opened on March 10 , 2014 , coinciding with planned service increases on the Framingham / Worcester Line . Before the reconstruction , 17 trains stopped at Yawkey each weekday ; after , all 48 daily trains ( 24 round trips ) stopped . The opening was first planned for January 13 , then January 27 , but was delayed due to problems with the Yawkey elevators and adjustments to the schedule based on public comment . The walkway between the new station and Fenway Park includes large lit statues of the uniform numbers retired by the Red Sox . 
 After special events like concerts at Fenway Park , the MBTA sometimes runs special commuter rail shuttles from Yawkey to South Station . 
 In December 2015 , Boston Globe columnist Adrian Walker proposed renaming Yawkey Way and Yawkey station because their current namesake , Tom Yawkey , was a racist .

 Yawkey Station was a proposed stop on the MBTA 's proposed Urban Ring Project . The Urban Ring was to be a Bus Rapid Transit ( BRT ) Line designed to connect the current MBTA Lines to reduce strain on the downtown stations . Under the most recent plan , the Urban Ring would access Yawkey via Mountfort Street to the north and a new tunnel paralleling the Green Line " D " Branch to the southwest , with a turnoff and station at Overland Street . The Urban Ring project is currently shelved due to the MBTA 's financial difficulties . 
 In 2014 , it was revealed by the state that the stop would be part of the proposed Indigo Line system with frequent DMU service , but that plan was canceled in 2015 .

 The station is fully handicapped accessible , with two full @-@ length high @-@ level platforms and elevators to cross from one track to another . The overhead pedestrian bridge is designed to connect to a future deck between Brookline Avenue and Beacon Street as part of the Fenway Center project . The main entrance to the station is on Overland Street between the two major streets ; staircases to Beacon Street are also available from the west ends of the platforms . 
 The station has an extremely unusual platform layout , where the outbound side platform is between the tracks rather than to the side . This is because the station is located on a tight curve ; doors located on the end of passenger cars would have gaps next to a convex platform .

 The HTC One A9 is an Android smartphone manufactured and marketed by HTC . It was officially announced on October 20 , 2015 . It is the successor to the One M9 in the United States ; but in global markets , it was sold alongside the One M9 as a mid @-@ range offering . It was launched as an effort to improve the revenue of HTC 's smartphone business after the failure of the One M9 . 
 It features a unibody aluminum frame with a Super AMOLED HD display and Dolby Surround sound for headphones . It also features a fingerprint sensor which can be used to unlock the phone . It is the first non @-@ Nexus device to be pre @-@ installed with Android Marshmallow and the first non @-@ CDMA phone that is compatible to work with the Verizon network in the United States . 
 It received mixed reviews following its release . While many critics lent specific praise to its construction and fingerprint scanner , other aspects have generally received indifferent or mixed reception . Some thought that its price point was too high , while others thought it was a clone of the iPhone 6 . In November 2015 , HTC reported a 15 percent increase in overall revenue . 
 = = Development = = 
 Following the launch of the One M9 , the manufacturer saw a decline of nearly 40 percent of their revenue due to the poor sales of the M9 because of the overheating issue caused by the Snapdragon 810 chipset which forced the manufacturer to throttle the processor and the poor performance of the camera which also led the manufacturer to reduce its component order by 30 percent . HTC has reported further loss of revenue in the first and second quarter and they have also mentioned that they closed some of their manufacturing facilities due to the poor sales and outsourced some of their manufacturing . In June , the CEO of HTC , Cher Wang , confirmed that it was developing a " hero product " which was planned to launch in October intended to improve its smartphone business . 
 Rumors surrounding the development of the phone began to surface in July 2015 after the failure of the One M9 . It was reported by <unk> that the device will feature a metal unibody , a five @-@ inch screen , and a fingerprint sensor . The internal specifications of the phone was speculated through an unofficial <unk> benchmark test report . Several leaked images of the device began to surface which showed its similarities with the iPhone 6 . 
 In October 2015 , HTC began to release a teaser video to promote the launch event of the device on its official Twitter account . On 20 October 2015 , the phone was unveiled online in a virtual event held by HTC .

 = The Projected Man = 
 The Projected Man is a 1966 British science fiction film directed by Ian Curteis , written by Peter Bryan , John C. Cooper , and Frank Quattrocchi , and starring Bryant Haliday , Mary Peach , Norman Wooland , Ronald Allen , and Derek Farr . It was released in the United States by Universal Studios , as a double bill with Island of Terror . The plot revolves around a scientist , Dr. Paul Steiner , experimenting with matter teleportation by means of a laser device . However , after a failed attempt at projecting himself , he becomes a disfigured monster who embarks on a murderous rampage . 
 Discovered by Alex Gordon as an unproduced screenplay by Hollywood writer Frank Quattrocchi , The Projected Man was directed by Ian Curteis ; it would be the first theatrical film that he would direct . However , due to his lack of experience , he ran into several problems during filming . As the film fell behind schedule and the budget kept increasing , he was fired during the film 's final stages . Producer John Croydon replaced him ; however , Croydon remained uncredited as the producers did not wish to publicise the problems which had occurred on set . 
 The Projected Man has received mixed reviews . Several sources were critical of the film 's resemblance to other science fiction films , with The Fly and 4D Man being singled out by critics and moviegoers alike as possible inspirations , although the film 's executive producer Richard Gordon has denied this . The Projected Man was featured in a ninth season episode of comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 , and has been released on DVD by Cinema Club . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dr. Paul Steiner ( Bryant Haliday ) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell ( Ronald Allen ) work on a projection device that enables them to transmit any object within a few miles of the machine . While they find the device works with inanimate objects , the living creatures they use it on always seem to die . When Dr. Patricia Hill ( Mary Peach ) arrives , she helps them fix the error , making Steiner think the problem has been solved . Meanwhile , Dr. Blanchard ( Norman Wooland ) , Steiner 's boss and head of the institute he works for , is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham ( Derrick De <unk> ) , who wants credit for Steiner 's discovery . He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach ( Gerard Heinz ) . 
 Steiner , Mitchell , and Hill feel they are ready to present , but at the event , Blanchard places acid on the machine when everyone is unaware , causing an explosion . The funding for Steiner 's project is ended instantly , however , Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with . Steiner goes to Blanchard 's house , where Lembach and Latham are having dinner . He presents the men with the evidence that his machine was deliberately tampered with , and Lembach allows him to have another chance . Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach 's house , and , with help from his secretary , Sheila ( Tracey Crisp ) , he begins the procedure . However , right then , Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory . 
 The two try to convince Sheila to stop the projection , but as she is inexperienced with the device , she instead ends up projecting Steiner to somewhere else . He ends up at a construction site , the hideout of a band of thieves who are attempting to break into a bank . It is learned that an error in the projection has given Steiner the ability to kill people by touching them , and has mutilated one half of his body . Steiner kills the criminals , and then enters a store , where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat . He then breaks into the institute , where he finds Latham and kills him . He also destroys the building 's power supply , alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong . By this time , Inspector Davis ( Derek Farr ) has discovered the bodies of the criminals and is determined to stop Steiner . 
 Sheila is kidnapped by Steiner , who interrogates her in her apartment . She reveals that Blanchard and Latham planned against him , angering Steiner . Before leaving , Steiner sets Sheila 's apartment on fire with her inside ( unaware that she survives ) and goes to hide at Blanchard 's house . When Blanchard returns home , he is killed by Steiner . Meanwhile , Davis has examined Latham 's body and realises that the electric marks left on Latham were the same as the criminals . Steiner shows up at Hill 's house , where he finds her and Mitchell . Steiner demands that they tell him where he can find more electricity , since after the projection he needs energy to survive . Hill and Mitchell try to convince him to return to the laboratory so they can try reversing the projection , but Steiner rebuffs them and leaves toward a power plant . 
 Davis , Hill , and Mitchell find him rumbling around in the power plant . Davis tries to kill him , but Steiner resists his bullets , so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner to return to the laboratory . Steiner is eventually convinced , so he goes with them , but when he arrives , he tricks them and begins destroying things . With the laboratory on fire and the projection device wildly out of control , Steiner is hit by the projection device 's laser , causing him to disappear as the fire rages on . 
 = = Production = = 
 The Projected Man was discovered as an unproduced screenplay by film producer Alex Gordon . The script was written by Frank <unk> , a Hollywood screenwriter , and was originally set in the United States . Gordon sent it to his brother Richard , also a film producer . Richard enjoyed reading it , but had it re @-@ written to be set in London . He would serve as producer on the film . Ian Curteis was hired to direct The Projected Man , which would be his first theatrical film , as all of his previous work had been in television . Curteis was hired at the insistence of producer John Croydon , who was confident that Curteis would later become a success . 
 The movie was 50 % financed by Compton , the company of Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser . 
 Bryant Haliday was cast in the lead role as Professor Steiner . He was chosen for the role as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title role , and the budget would not allow a Hollywood star to be used . The fact that Gordon was already familiar with him , as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll , was also a factor . Haliday , a fan of horror movies , enjoyed doing The Projected Man . British stage actress Mary Peach was cast in the lead role as Dr. Patricia Hill . It was insisted that she be given top billing for her role . Norman Wooland , a German @-@ born British character actor , was cast as Dr. Blanchard , the film 's villain . Derek Farr portrays Inspector Davis , and Ronald Allen plays the role of Dr. Christopher Mitchell . A scene in the film features actress Norma West lying topless on a morgue table ; this scene was added to aid sales overseas . 
 Curteis ran into several problems while directing the film . Owing to his absence of feature film experience , the film 's tight schedule , and limited funding , he became quickly overwhelmed , and The Projected Man started going over its budget and falling behind on schedule . Executive producers Michael Klinger and Tony Tenser threatened to take over production as they did not want to increase the budget . Since Croydon had hired Curteis , it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film . Richard Gordon suggested that " I think Curteis was relieved to step out because he simply didn 't know any longer what to do . " Croydon was not credited for his directing work on the film ; as Gordon said , " one tries not to publicize such incidents . " 
 = = Release = = 
 The Projected Man was released in the United Kingdom by Compton @-@ Cameo Films Ltd in the summer of 1966 under an X @-@ certificate , which indicated it was suitable only for those aged 16 and older . 
 The Projected Man was shot at the same time as Island of Terror , with which it was released on a double bill . The idea of the double bill came to Richard Gordon when he ran Island of Terror for Universal Studios ' executive in charge , Hi Martin . As The Projected Man 's special effects were not yet finished , Gordon showed Martin Island of Terror . Martin enjoyed the film and obtained the American rights for a " very large sum of money . " As Gordon was not keen on the idea of Island of Terror being placed at the bottom of the bill with one of Universal 's other features , which he described as " no good for [ our production company ] financially , " he proposed adding a second film , noting that The Projected Man was nearing completion . He showed an unfinished workprint of the film to see if Martin was interested , and he enjoyed it enough to accept the deal . When The Projected Man was shown in theatres in the United States , it was cut thirteen minutes shorter than the original British print , due to the fact that Universal felt the opening scene , which depicted a rehearsal for an experiment which came later in the film , was " repetitive . " They also did not want a double bill with a duration of over three hours , and did not want to edit Island of Terror , so The Projected Man was trimmed to provide an exact 180 @-@ minute running time .

 A review in entertainment industry magazine Variety praised The Projected Man , writing that the screenplay " is a mosaic compiled from other films but the pieces hang together fairly well . " However , Variety criticised the character 's motives , saying that " the origin and motives of the third party are never fully explained . " The magazine wrote that the performances in the film were " generally good , " and that " the characters do not fall prey to the usual cliches . " Writing for Ottawa Citizen , Gordon Stoneham , reviewing the double bill of The Projected Man and Island of Terror , called The Projected Man " dreadful stuff , " saying that the film was " badly written , woodenly acted , and abounding in the cliches of the horror film genre . " However , he wrote that " it is short and to the point " and wrote that " although it <unk> a familiar path , every now and then it comes up with some arresting bit of cinematic coloring that <unk> the attention . " Comparing the two films , he stated that The Projected Man was " the best . " A TV Guide review wrote that the " characters are better portrayed than usual in films of this nature , keeping the actors from becoming mere stereotypes " and that " subtle artistic direction and first @-@ quality special effects give this picture a strong visual presence . " The review graded The Projected Man with two stars out of four . The anonymous reviewer for the British Kinematograph Weekly called the cast " competent " and noted that , while the " plot [ was ] at least as old as H. G. Wells " , there was something about the film that would challenge the " hard @-@ boiled child of today " . 
 Many reviews were critical of the film 's resemblance to The Fly . British magazine Time Out pointed it out , as did TV Guide . Audiences also noted that it was similar to the 1959 science fiction film 4D Man . In a 2000 interview with Video Watchdog , Richard Gordon stated " we weren 't really influenced by The Fly " and wrote in the 2006 book Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers that " Projected Man does have a very strong similarity to The Fly , but it came to us as a finished screenplay and seemed to be a perfectly logical film to make .

 The Projected Man was shown in a ninth season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . The show , a comedy television series , revolves around a human character Mike Nelson and his two robots friends , Crow T.

To stay sane while watching the bad movies , Mike and the robots mock the film as they watch .

The Projected Man was the first episode of the ninth season . It was originally broadcast on Sci @-@ Fi Channel on 14 March 1998 , the second season of the series to premiere on that channel . It was the series ' second film to star Bryant Haliday ; his film Devil Doll had been previously lampooned . Series writer Paul Chaplin spoke negatively about Haliday 's performance , saying , " I guess Haliday was considered to be someone who could carry a film .

 Sonic Rush is a 2005 platform handheld video game developed by Sonic Team and Dimps for the Nintendo DS as part of Sega 's Sonic the Hedgehog series . It was released on November 15 , 2005 in North America , November 18 in the PAL region , and November 23 in Japan . It is a 2D platform game , but Sonic 's and Blaze 's sprites are rendered in 3D , creating a 2.5D effect . Boss battles , along with a Sonic @-@ exclusive special stage , are entirely 3D . The game 's storyline follows the intertwining adventures of a new character , Blaze the Cat , and the series ' main character , Sonic the Hedgehog . They respectively battle Doctor Eggman and his doppelgänger Eggman Nega at certain points throughout the game . 
 The game was announced under the working title Sonic DS at Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) 2004 , and under Sonic Rush at E3 2005 . The game 's 2.5D format was based on Sonic Team 's idea to combine elements from 2D and 3D games in the series . Upon release , Sonic Rush was positively received by critics , with praise stemming from the game 's music and similarity to older games in the series and criticism stemming from its overall quickness . A sequel , Sonic Rush Adventure , was later created and released in 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Sonic Rush is a 2D platform game , similar to earlier games in the series as well as later ones like Sonic Advance . The player controls either Sonic the Hedgehog or Blaze the Cat , who differ in terms of special abilities . In the tradition of past Sonic games , gameplay consists of moving quickly through levels , collecting rings and defeating enemies . The player collects rings as a form of health ; when they are attacked by an enemy , their rings bounce in all directions . If they are hit by an enemy and have no rings , they lose a life . Both of the DS 's screens are used to display the play area , with the player 's character moving between them as necessary . Levels in the game are divided into " zones " , each consisting of two acts of normal gameplay then a 3D boss battle . The course of the game differs depending on whether Sonic or Blaze is chosen ; the seven zones are the same , but are accessed in different orders . During boss battles , Blaze fights Doctor Eggman and Sonic fights an Eggman doppelgänger called Eggman Nega . As the characters ' stories progress , they meet each other several times and unite in the final zone that comes after the seventh . The game features a special stages can access via certain handles in order to obtain the Chaos Emeralds . These Special Stages resemble those of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and utilises the DS ' stylus controls . Blaze , on the other hand , can 't enter special stages as she earns Sol Emeralds throughout her story . When the player completes both Sonic and Blaze 's stories and collect all the Chaos Emeralds , they can access a final story . 
 New features include a grading system that grades the player based on the time it takes for them to complete the level ; they can return to levels later to try for a higher grade . There is a point system based on the one in Sonic Advance 2 but displaying points in multiple categories . There is also a " Tension Gauge " on the left side of the screen which is filled by doing tricks and defeating enemies . The energy it generates allows the player to use boosts of speed while moving ; defeating enemies , moving through the level more quickly which results in more points and a higher grade , and when playing as Sonic , accessing the special stage . Although the game is primarily two @-@ dimensional , there are three @-@ dimensional elements which create a 2.5D effect . For the first time in the series , Sonic and Blaze 's sprites are rendered in 3D . The game 's boss battles are 3D . 
 The game has a two @-@ player mode in which Sonic and Blaze race to the end of a chosen level from the game . There is also a feature in which players who own the game can send a demo of the game to other Nintendo DS users . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Blaze the Cat is somehow pulled from her native dimension into Sonic 's world . Her world had seven Sol Emeralds — similar to the Chaos Emeralds — but they were stolen by Doctor Eggman . She then makes it her goal to retrieve them ; this is where Sonic meets her . While she is searching for the Sol Emeralds , Sonic is searching for the Chaos Emeralds . Blaze meets Cream the Rabbit and is surprised by her politeness . Meanwhile , Miles " Tails " Prower learns that Blaze 's world and Sonic 's are merging somehow . Sonic grows suspicious of Blaze , and along with Tails , looks for her . Soon , after they find Blaze and Cream , Sonic questions Blaze about her nature , but she refuses to give any information and leaves with Cream . Sonic follows her to Eggman Nega 's base , where it is revealed that Eggman and Eggman Nega are working together to collect both the Chaos Emeralds and the Sol Emeralds . Blaze declares that she is the only one who can save their worlds , without anyone 's help . Sonic and Blaze fight each other , until Sonic wins the fight and Blaze realizes the error of her ways . 
 After Eggman kidnaps Cream , Blaze goes after him while Sonic takes on Nega . Sonic collects the last of the seven Chaos Emeralds ; and meets Blaze , who fails to protect the Sol Emeralds . Sonic and his friends help Blaze realize the meaning of friendship and she turns into Burning Blaze — apparently her answer to Sonic 's Super Sonic form — while Sonic turns into Super Sonic . They fight Eggman and Eggman Nega and defeat them . The two worlds are restored , forcing Blaze to return to her own world . As she flies there , she realizes that she truly understands her powers . Later , on Sonic 's planet , Cream is crying because she misses Blaze , but Sonic tells her that Blaze promised to return someday .

 USS West Ekonk ( ID @-@ 3313 ) was a cargo ship for the United States Navy during World War I. She was later known as SS West Ekonk in civilian service under American registry , and as SS Empire Wildebeeste under British registry . 
 West Ekonk was launched for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) in June 1918 as a part of the West ships , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort . At one point West Ekonk had the distinction of being the ninth fastest @-@ built ocean @-@ going ship in the world . Pressed into cargo service for the US Navy , USS West Ekonk was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) and completed three round @-@ trip voyages to Europe for the Navy . After decommissioning in mid 1919 , she was briefly in cargo service out of Baltimore and New York before being laid up in Norfolk , Virginia . 
 West Ekonk was reactivated for cargo service out of Los Angeles in early 1924 . By 1926 , she was sailing out of New York and called at ports such as Liverpool and Hamburg . In 1933 , she was sold to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company and operated for two of its subsidiary shipping lines through the mid @-@ 1930s . In late 1940 she was sold to British interests to help fill the United Kingdom 's urgent need for merchant ships . 
 After sailing to the UK as West Ekonk , the ship was renamed Empire Wildebeeste and sailed in transatlantic convoys , making three round @-@ trips between March 1941 and December 1942 . On the westbound leg at the beginning of her fourth round @-@ trip , she straggled behind her convoy and was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine U @-@ 106 on 24 January 1942 . Nine men died in the attack ; the 22 survivors were rescued by American destroyer USS Lang ( DD @-@ 399 ) and landed at Bermuda .

 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Ekonk , one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle , Washington . West Ekonk ( Skinner & Eddy No. 25 ; USSB No. 1178 ) was laid down on 16 April 1918 . She was launched on 22 June with an elapsed time of 57 working days — 67 calendar days — from keel laying to launch . West Ekonk was completed on 13 July , 73 working days after her keel laying , and in a list of the ten fastest @-@ constructed ocean @-@ going ships compiled in 1920 by Edward N. Hurley , the wartime chairman of the USSB , West Ekonk was listed as the ninth fastest @-@ constructed ship in the world . 
 West Ekonk was the fourth ship built under a USSB contract that called for Skinner & Eddy to deliver 14 ships at a cost of $ 1 @,@ 672 @,@ 000 each , but the cost of extras during her construction added $ 35 @,@ 268 . Skinner & Eddy received a $ 69 @,@ 200 bonus for West Ekonk 's early completion , which brought the total cost of the ship to $ 1 @,@ 776 @,@ 468 . 
 West Ekonk was 5 @,@ 630 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 409 feet 5 inches ( 124 @.@ 79 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 2 inches ( 16 @.@ 51 m ) abeam . West Ekonk had a steel hull and a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 800 DWT . The ship had a single steam turbine that drove her single screw propeller which moved the ship at an 11 @.@ 5 @-@ knot ( 21 @.@ 3 km / h ) pace .

 After her 13 July 1918 completion , West Ekonk was handed over to the United States Navy for use in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) and assigned the identification number 3313 . She was commissioned at Seattle , as USS West Ekonk ( ID @-@ 3313 ) the same day with Lieutenant Commander Richard <unk> , United States Naval Reserve Forces , in command . 
 West Ekonk sailed to Port Costa , California , and took on a load of wheat flour and sailed for New York , via the Panama Canal , on 24 July . After reaching New York on 27 August , West Ekonk joined a France @-@ bound convoy , departing on 4 September . 
 West Ekonk arrived at Brest , France , on 19 September , discharged her cargo , and headed back to New York on 30 September . She took on a load of freight consigned to the Italian government and set out for Genoa in early November . West Ekonk was en route to Italy when the Armistice that ended fighting was signed on 11 November . After completing her trip , she made another cargo run to Genoa , sailing from New York in late January 1919 and returning on 3 April 1919 . Six days later West Ekonk was decommissioned and returned to the USSB .

 West Ekonk 's activities immediately after her return to the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) in April are not known , but in mid @-@ June The Washington Post reported that West Ekonk would be among the 26 ships allocated to sail out of Baltimore beginning later in the month . In early March 1920 , The New York Times reported on West Ekonk 's arrival in New York from Liverpool , and in April and June reported on West Ekonk 's departure to and arrival from Hamburg . 
 After being laid up in a reserve fleet in Norfolk , Virginia , some time after mid 1920 , West Ekonk was one of two ships reactivated for service out of Los Angeles in early 1924 . By early 1926 , however , West Ekonk was sailing from Galveston , Texas , to Liverpool , sometimes carrying passengers in addition to freight . In December 1927 , West Ekonk 's master and chief engineer each received a $ 50 bonus from the Conservation Committee of the Merchant Fleet Corporation when West Ekonk was named to an honor roll for efficient operation ; they were one of 50 duos so honored . On 23 December 1928 , West Ekonk was anchored in the River Thames at Gravesend , Kent , United Kingdom when she was struck by the British cargo ship <unk> and sustained damage to her port bow . 
 In 1933 , West Ekonk was sold to Lykes Brothers Steamship Company and home @-@ ported at Houston , Texas . West Ekonk sailed for the Dixie UK Line , a subsidiary operation of Lykes , for most of 1935 , sailing between Galveston and Liverpool . By December 1935 , West Ekonk had begun sailing for another subsidiary of Lykes Brothers , the Ripley Steamship Company , and continued sailing on the same Galveston – Liverpool route through September 1937 . West Ekonk 's activities over the next three years are not recorded .

 In November 1940 , while the United States was still neutral , the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) , a successor to the USSB , granted Lykes Brothers permission to sell West Ekonk and five other cargo ships to the British Ministry of War Transport ( MoWT ) . After West Ekonk took on a load of steel and scrap , the ship sailed to Halifax , where she joined convoy HX 99 in sailing for Liverpool on 26 December 1940 . On 30 December , the ship 's compass went out but West Ekonk was able to remain in her station in the convoy , and safely arrived at Liverpool on 11 January 1941 , despite sailing through a gale with sleet storms on 4 January . In his notes for the convoy , P. E. Parker , the convoy 's commodore , singled out H. MacKinnon , master of West Ekonk , for praise of his seamanship in keeping West Ekonk in the convoy without a working compass . 
 After her arrival at Liverpool , West Ekonk was renamed Empire Wildebeeste — MoWT ships taking a name prefixed with " Empire " and joined westbound convoy OB 293 in sailing for the United States on 2 March 1941 . The convoy dispersed four days later , and though seven ships were sunk by four German submarines , Empire Wildebeeste safely docked at Baltimore on 24 March . After sailing to Hampton Roads , Virginia , on 1 April and on to Halifax on 6 April , Empire Wildebeeste was scheduled to sail as a part of HX 120 on 10 April , but apparently did not arrive in time . She instead sailed in convoy HX 121 which departed Halifax six days later . Convoy HX 121 was attacked by two U @-@ boats on 28 April and four ships were hit , two ahead of Empire Wildebeeste and two to the starboard . Even though another ship was sunk on 1 May , Empire Wildebeeste successfully delivered her cargo of pig iron to Middlesbrough on 7 May . 
 After making her way across the Atlantic independently , Empire Wildebeeste arrived at Norfolk , Virginia , on 25 June . After making intermediate stops in Baltimore and Hampton Roads , she sailed for Halifax with a load of scrap iron on 17 July , reaching her destination three days later . She departed in convoy HX 140 on 22 July and arrived at Belfast Lough on 5 August and Newport on 8 August . After arriving at Milford Haven on 25 August , she sailed from there two days later in convoy ON 10 for Halifax , where she arrived on 13 September . From there , Empire Wildebeeste sailed to Montreal and back to Halifax by 5 October . She departed Halifax that same day as a part of convoy HX 153 , but had unspecified problems that caused her to drop out and put in at St. John 's , Newfoundland , on 11 October . After aborted attempts to sail east in convoys SC 50 and SC 52 , Empire Wildebeeste finally reached Loch Ewe on 25 November as a part of convoy SC 54 and Methil on 30 November . 
 After Empire Wildebeeste made a trip to Hull and back by 23 December , she sailed to Loch Ewe five days later and then departed from Liverpool on 2 January 1942 as a part of convoy ON 53 . Empire Wildebeeste strayed behind even before the convoy dispersed on 19 January , and was left to sail on to Baltimore independently . At 06 : 53 on 24 January , Empire Wildebeeste was struck by a torpedo launched from German submarine U @-@ 106 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hermann Rasch . Empire Wildebeeste went down at position 39 ° 30 ′ N 59 ° 54 ′ W ; eight crewmen and one naval gunner were killed during the attack and sinking . American destroyer Lang was dispatched from Bermuda to pick up the master , 18 crewmen , and three gunners , and landed them in Bermuda .

 Pullman Square is a lifestyle center in downtown Huntington , West Virginia , United States between 8th and 10th Street and 3rd Avenue and Veteran 's Memorial Boulevard . It is located on what was known as the Superblock , a large urban renewal project that saw the demolishing of four city @-@ square @-@ blocks in 1970 .

 The Superblock was to be a large <unk> project in downtown Huntington . In 1970 , a four @-@ block 9 @-@ acre ( 36 @,@ 000 m2 ) vacant site was created for the next " large development , " however , problems besieged the area for decades . In 1974 , a master plan was developed for the vacant site . 
 In 1977 , the Huntington Civic Arena was constructed on one parcel . One year later , a group of entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350 @-@ room hotel and retail stores , however , the plan died by 1980 . In 1983 , the National Shamrock Development and Investment Company wanted to develop the property and took a two @-@ year lease on the project . By mid @-@ 1985 , however , the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $ 15 million Urban Development Action Grant request . 
 In the spring of 1986 , the Huntington Development Corporation suggested that an off @-@ track betting facility be constructed , however , the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off @-@ track betting bill that was critical to the project 's success . In 1987 , the Webb Companies presented a plan for a $ 110 million mixed @-@ use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20 @-@ story office tower , an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park . The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project . In 1988 , the city 's grant to help develop the project was revoked . 
 Another instance included an outlet mall proposal that was announced on May 6 , 1987 , however , two @-@ months later , the Herald @-@ Dispatch reported that the project was " dead " and that the " 13 @-@ year history of failure haunts ( the ) Superblock . " Another proposal , on April 28 , 1989 reported on a development that was " on tap , " followed by an article several years later that stated , " super development dream fails to become reality . " In 1992 , a two @-@ story shopping center was proposed but the idea failed to receive tenant support . 
 A Chi @-@ Chi 's Mexican restaurant was constructed on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street in 1991 . These developments were mostly suburban in nature and was not conductive to improvements in downtown Huntington . A Holiday Inn was constructed adjacent to the Big Sandy Superstore Arena between 8th and 9th Street in 1998 . 
 = = = Intermodal facility = = = 
 In 1998 , $ 27 million for an intermodal facility was appropriated from Congress ; an additional $ 6 @.@ 7 million came from state and local funding . Then Governor Cecil Underwood had promised $ 700 @,@ 000 in 1999 , with local lawmakers funding the additional $ 1 @.@ 3 million ; an additional $ 4 million was to be allocated from the state over the next two years . 
 The proposed facility was for a Tri @-@ State Transit Authority ( TTA ) bus transfer station , retail development and associated parking structures and would occupy a two @-@ block surface parking lot between 8th Street and 10th Street along 3rd Avenue . A later study by Woolpert suggested at least 150 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 14 @,@ 000 m2 ) of retail and a parking structure that has 800 to 1 @,@ 400 spaces . Yet another study suggested that retail , entertainment , dining , housing , cultural , and educational aspects be included in the project . A ground breaking ceremony was planned in early 2000 with initial completion of the project in 2001 . 
 In order to complete the Superblock , Chi @-@ Chi 's would need to be evicted , however , it was granted and opportunity to have a restaurant within the proposed development . Chi @-@ Chi 's refused to leave the Superblock , however , citing that they wanted to " upgrade and remodel " the restaurant . 
 In 1999 , Robert C. Byrd allocated $ 8 million to federal appropriation bills for the Superblock project . Another $ 400 @,@ 000 was allocated from the Federal Transit Administration to the Huntington Transit Authority for the feasibility study and master plan for the intermodal facility . 
 = = = Pullman Square = = = 
 On September 30 , 1999 , it was announced that the Huntington Urban Renewal Authority was in negotiations with the Transit Authority and an unnamed Columbus , Ohio developer for the Superblock . In early October , President Bill Clinton signed the Transportation Appropriations bill , which provided an additional $ 12 million in funds for the intermodal facility . 
 On October 18 , 2000 , Steiner + Associates ( dropped in favor of Metropolitan Partners with the same developers ) , a Columbus , Ohio developer that specializes in recreating downtown urban environments , announced a $ 60 million 200 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) . retail and entertainment complex between 10th streets and 3rd Avenue and Veterans Memorial Boulevard that would resemble an " old @-@ time small town " and would fit within the " historic context of the existing downtown . " The developers had previously constructed similar developments in Newport , Kentucky with the completion of Newport on the Levee and Easton Town Center in Columbus . The project would include stores , restaurants and a 12 to 16 @-@ screen movie theater and would open in fall of 2002 . Two parking structures would be constructed as well . The parking structure between 8th and 9th Street would be four @-@ levels and include 940 parking spaces , but could be expanded upward to include an office tower ; the parking structure between 9th and 10th Streets would be three @-@ levels and include the movie complex on top . Broken down , the project plan included , 
 65 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 6 @,@ 000 m2 ) of retail , 
 30 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m2 ) of restaurants , 
 25 @,@ 300 sq , ft. of office space ,

 a 2 @,@ 300 @-@ seat , 50 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 5 @,@ 000 m2 ) theater . 
 The plan included narrowing 3rd Avenue from four @-@ lanes westbound towards the Robert C. Byrd Bridge to one @-@ lane in each direction with angled parking , however , this was later revised to one @-@ lane in each direction with parallel parking and a center variable lane . The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a traffic calming measure . 
 In January 2002 , the Huntington Urban Renewal Authority began eminent domain proceedings against Chi @-@ Chi 's . The parent company of Chi @-@ Chi 's , <unk> Inc . , had refused to sell the property and rejected the city 's final offer on October 19 , 2000 and refused all negotiations and communications with the Authority and with Metropolitan Partners . In March , <unk> Inc. refused an offer of $ 975 @,@ 000 for the property plus $ 200 @,@ 000 in relocation costs , which was over the appraised value of the property . The company requested a sale price of $ 2 million instead . The company , however , went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in March . In May , Chi @-@ Chi 's wanted to sell the property for $ 1 @.@ 15 million , including undisclosed costs for relocation and loss of business , but later reversed out of the deal and wanted $ 1 @.@ 75 million . 
 During November 2002 , Metropolitan Partners filed a grant request to the West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee . It received $ 10 @.@ 6 million in infrastructure improvements . A lawsuit was later filed by the Jackson County , West Virginia lawyer Larry Harless , questioning the legality of the committee and its work . Eventually , the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia nullified the grant process and the grants that were given . 
 On March 26 , 2003 , the Superblock was sold to the developers of Pullman Square , Metropolitan Partners . Chi @-@ Chi 's had until April 15 to vacate ; it was demolished on the 29th . The opening date had been pushed back from spring to summer 2004 due to a court case that was being considered by the West Virginia Supreme Court . In July 2003 , the West Virginia Legislature passed legislation that withstood the Court of Appeals , however , the Pullman Square project had to be re @-@ approved by the reconstituted grant committee . The grant money was once again awarded in August , however , two citizens ' lawsuits by Larry Harless once again disputed the process . In their case , they stated that the state may provide loans to the projects but not to the grants , and questioned the legality of the state 's video lottery . The West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee was to finance the grants by selling bonds which would be repaid from profits on video lottery . 
 On October 17 , 2003 , the state Supreme Court ruled that the state could proceed with the sale of bonds financing Pullman Square and 48 other projects throughout the state .

 Construction began on Pullman Square on July 16 , 2004 with the excavation of the parking lot for the parking structures . It opened on November 19 , 2004 with Marquee Cinemas . Others , such as Empire Books & News , EB Games and Starbucks , opened in early December . In June 2005 , the Funny Bone Comedy Club opened , followed by Cold Stone Creamery in July and pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill and Max & Erma 's in August . 
 A few months after opening , the Uno Chicago Grill was sued for not paying the builders , suppliers , and utilities . It soon changed its name to La Sha 's West Virginia Bistro and was headed by <unk> winner Jack Whittaker ; however , it closed on February 22 , 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC complained that the Bistro owed thousands for rent . 
 Edible Arrangements was announced on August 5 , 2006 . The retail store , specializing in fruit bouquets and designer arrangements of fruit , opened in the fall . A few months later , on January 11 , 2007 , Moe 's Southwest Grill closed for remodeling . The quick @-@ casual restaurant later reluctantly announced that it was , in fact , moving to a nearby location on 9th Street . On March 17 Runway Couture opened next to Inspired , featuring west coast @-@ inspired fashions ; both are owned by <unk> Chafin . Moe 's Southwest Grill maintained <unk> talks with Pullman Square and after protracted negotiations Metropolitan Partners agreed to Moe 's corporate lease arrangements and subsequently surrendered the keys to the former location on November 5 , 2007 . 
 On May 8 , 2008 , it was announced that Community Trust Bank would locate a bank branch at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street . It would include spaces for more retail that is currently " under negotiations " . Construction began in August . The Garage <unk> , however , pulled out of Pullman Square . In June , it was announced that Uno Chicago Grill would reopen under the franchise of Rick Rose , who owns some <unk> 's restaurants in Ohio , and under Mike <unk> , a retired NFL player . The restaurant sells Chicago @-@ style pizza and could open by July 30 . Benny 's <unk> opened on June 19 , the second location for the Columbus , Ohio @-@ based restaurant that sells Philadelphia @-@ style <unk> , wings , wraps , and beer .

 = Hugo Black = 
 Hugo Lafayette Black ( February 27 , 1886 – September 25 , 1971 ) was an American politician and jurist . A member of the Democratic Party , Black represented Alabama in the United States Senate from 1927 to 1937 , and served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1937 to 1971 . Black was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 63 to 16 ( 6 Democratic Senators and 10 Republican Senators voted against him . ) He was first of nine Roosevelt nominees to the Court , and he outlasted all except for William O. Douglas . Black is widely regarded as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the 20th century . 
 The fifth longest @-@ serving justice in Supreme Court history , Black is noted for his advocacy of a textualist reading of the United States Constitution and of the position that the liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights were imposed on the states ( " incorporated " ) by the Fourteenth Amendment . During his political career , Black was regarded as a staunch supporter of liberal policies and civil liberties . However , Black consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process ( the anti @-@ New Deal Supreme Court cited this concept in such a way as to make it impossible for the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners ) and believed that there was no basis in the words of the Constitution for a right to privacy , voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut . Black endorsed Roosevelt in both the 1932 and 1936 US Presidential elections and was a staunch supporter of the New Deal . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Hugo LaFayette Black was the youngest of the eight children of William Lafayette Black and Martha Toland Black . He was born on February 27 , 1886 , in a small wooden farmhouse in Ashland , Alabama , a poor , isolated rural Clay County town in the Appalachian foothills . 
 Because his brother Orlando had become a medical doctor , Hugo decided at first to follow in his footsteps . At age seventeen , he left school and enrolled at Birmingham Medical School . However , it was Orlando who suggested that Hugo should enroll at the University of Alabama School of Law . After graduating in June 1906 , he moved back to Ashland and established a legal practice . His practice was not successful there , so Black moved to Birmingham in 1907 where he specialized in labor law and personal injury cases . 
 Consequent to his defense of an African American who was forced into a form of commercial slavery after incarceration , Black was befriended by A. O. Lane , a judge connected with the case . When Lane was elected to the Birmingham City Commission in 1911 , he asked Black to serve as a police court judge , an experience that would be his only judicial experience prior to the Supreme Court . In 1912 , Black resigned that seat in order to return to practicing law full @-@ time . He was not done with public service ; in 1914 , he began a four @-@ year term as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney . 
 Three years later , during World War I , Black resigned in order to join the United States Army , eventually reaching the rank of captain . He served in the 81st Field Artillery , but was not assigned to Europe . He joined the Birmingham Civitan Club during this time , eventually serving as president of the group . He remained an active member throughout his life , occasionally contributing articles to Civitan publications . 
 On February 23 , 1921 , he married Josephine Foster ( 1899 – 1951 ) , with whom he would have three children : Hugo L. Black , II ( 1922 – 2013 ) , an attorney ; Sterling Foster ( 1924 – 1996 ) , and Martha Josephine ( born 1933 ) . Josephine died in 1951 ; in 1957 , Black married Elizabeth Seay <unk> . 
 = = Ku Klux Klan and anti @-@ Catholicism = = 
 In 1921 , Black successfully defended E. R. Stephenson in the sensationalistic trial for the murder of a Catholic priest , Father James E. Coyle . Black joined the Ku Klux Klan shortly after , thinking it necessary for his political career . Running for the Senate as the " people 's " candidate , Black believed he needed the votes of Klan members . Near the end of his life , Black would admit that joining the Klan was a mistake , but he went on to say " I would have joined any group if it helped get me votes . " Black , along with fellow politician and friend , Bibb Graves , were known in Alabama Klan circles as the Gold Dust Twins . 
 Biographers in the 1990s examined Black 's views of religious denominations . Ball found regarding the Klan that Black " sympathized with the group 's economic , nativist , and anti @-@ Catholic beliefs . " Newman said Black " disliked the Catholic Church as an institution " and gave numerous anti @-@ Catholic speeches in his 1926 election campaign to Ku Klux Klan meetings across Alabama . However in 1937 The Harvard Crimson reported on Black 's appointment of a Jewish law clerk , noting that he " earlier had appointed Miss Annie Butt , a Catholic , as a secretary , and the Supreme Court had designated Leon Smallwood , a Negro and a Catholic as his messenger . "

 Black was one of the Associate Justices who held in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional . The plaintiffs were represented by Thurgood Marshall . A decade later , on October 2 , 1967 Marshall became the first African American to be appointed to the Supreme Court , and served with Black on the Court until Black 's retirement on September 17 , 1971 .

 In United States v. Price eighteen Ku Klux Klan members were charged with murder and conspiracy for the deaths of James Chaney , Andrew Goodman and Michael <unk> , but the charges were dismissed by the trial court . A unanimous Supreme Court , which included Black , reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial . Seven of these men , including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers , Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found guilty of the crime ; eight of them , including Lawrence A. Rainey , were found not guilty ; and three of them , including Edgar Ray Killen , had their cases end in a mistrial . 
 = = Senate career = = 
 In 1926 , Black sought election to the United States Senate from Alabama , following the retirement of Senator Oscar Underwood . Since the Democratic Party dominated Alabama politics at the time , he easily defeated his Republican opponent , E. H. Dryer , winning 80 @.@ 9 % of the vote . He was reelected in 1932 , winning 86 @.@ 3 % of the vote against Republican J. Theodore Johnson . 
 Senator Black gained a reputation as a tenacious investigator . In 1934 , for example , he chaired the committee that looked into the contracts awarded to air mail carriers under Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown , an inquiry which led to the Air Mail scandal . In order to correct what he termed abuses of " fraud and collusion " resulting from the Air Mail Act of 1930 , he introduced the Black @-@ McKellar Bill , later the Air Mail Act of 1934 . The following year he participated in a Senate committee 's investigation of lobbying practices . He publicly denounced the " <unk> , deceptive , telegram @-@ fixing , <unk> , Washington @-@ visiting " lobbyists , and advocated legislation requiring them to publicly register their names and salaries . 
 In 1935 , Black became chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor , a position he would hold for the remainder of his Senate career . In 1937 he sponsored the Black @-@ Connery Bill , which sought to establish a national minimum wage and a maximum workweek of thirty hours . Although the bill was initially rejected in the House of Representatives , an amended version of it , which extended Black 's original maximum workweek proposal to forty @-@ four hours , was passed in 1938 ( after Black left the Senate ) , becoming the Fair Labor Standards Act . 
 Black was an ardent supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal . In particular , he was an outspoken advocate of the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937 , popularly known as the court @-@ packing bill , FDR 's unsuccessful plan to expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court in his favor . 
 Black would throughout his career as a senator give speeches based on his belief in the ultimate power of the Constitution . He came to see the actions of the anti @-@ New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess ; in his view , the Court was improperly overturning legislation passed by large majorities of Congress . 
 During his Senate career Black consistently opposed the passage of Anti @-@ Lynching legislation . In 1935 Black lead a filibuster of the Wagner @-@ Costigan anti @-@ lynching bill . The Pittsburgh Post Gazette reported that when a motion to end the <unk> was defeated " [ t ] he southerners — headed by Tom Connally of Texas and Hugo Black of Alabama — grinned at each other and shook hands . " 
 = = Appointment to the Supreme Court = = 
 Soon after the failure of the court @-@ packing plan , President Roosevelt obtained his first opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court Justice when conservative Willis Van Devanter retired . Roosevelt wanted the replacement to be a " thumping , evangelical New Dealer " who was reasonably young , <unk> by the Senate , and from a region of the country unrepresented on the Court . The three final candidates were Solicitor General Stanley Reed , Sherman Minton , and Hugo Black . Roosevelt said Reed " had no fire , " and Minton did not want the appointment at the time . The position would go to Black , a candidate from the South , who , as a senator , had voted for all 24 of Roosevelt 's major New Deal programs . Roosevelt admired Black 's use of the investigative role of the Senate to shape the American mind on reforms , his strong voting record , and his early support , which dated back to 1933 . Both Reed and Minton were later appointed to the Supreme Court ; Reed was the next Justice appointed by Roosevelt , while Minton was appointed by Harry Truman in 1949 . 
 On August 12 , 1937 , Roosevelt nominated Black to fill the vacancy . By tradition , a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate . However , when Black was nominated , the Senate departed from this tradition for the first time since 1853 ; instead of confirming him immediately , it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee . Black was criticized for his presumed bigotry , his cultural roots , and his Klan membership , when that became public . 
 The Judiciary Committee recommended Black 's confirmation by a vote of 13 – 4 on August 16 of that year . 
 The next day the full Senate considered Black 's nomination . Rumors relating to Black 's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators , and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination . However , no conclusive evidence of Black 's involvement was available at the time , so after six hours of debate , the Senate voted 63 – 16 to confirm Black . Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black . Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife , Dixie B. Graves , to fill Black 's vacated seat . 
 The next month , the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette investigated Black 's past . Ray Sprigle won a Pulitzer Prize for his series of articles revealing Black 's involvement in the Klan . However , the controversy soon subsided ; the criticism was highly partisan , and polls showed that the attacks had little effect on public opinion of Black . Black also addressed public concerns in person : " I did join the Klan . I later resigned . I never rejoined .... Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan . I have had nothing to do with it since that time . I abandoned it . I completely discontinued any association with the organization . I have never resumed it and never expect to do so . " 
 Black was close friends with Walter Francis White , the black executive secretary of the NAACP who would help assuage critics of the appointment . Chambers v. Florida ( 1940 ) , an early case where Black ruled in favor of African American criminal defendants who experienced due process violations , helped put concerns to rest . 
 = = Supreme Court career = = 
 As soon as Black started on the Court , he advocated judicial restraint and worked to move the Court away from interposing itself in social and economic matters . Black vigorously defended the " plain meaning " of the Constitution , rooted in the ideas of its era , and emphasized the supremacy of the legislature ; for Black , the role of the Supreme Court was limited and constitutionally prescribed . 
 During his early years on the Supreme Court , Black helped reverse several earlier court decisions taking a narrow interpretation of federal power . Many New Deal laws that would have been struck down under earlier precedents were thus upheld . In 1939 Black was joined on the Supreme Court by Felix Frankfurter and William O. Douglas . Douglas voted alongside Black in several cases , especially those involving the First Amendment , while Frankfurter soon became one of Black 's ideological foes . From 1946 until 1971 , Black was the Senior Associate Justice of the Supreme Court . 
 = = = Relationship with other justices = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1940s , Justice Black became involved in a bitter dispute with Justice Robert H. Jackson as a result of Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Local <unk> , United Mine Workers ( 1945 ) . In this case the Court ruled 5 – 4 in favor of the UMW ; Black voted with the majority , while Jackson dissented . However , the coal company requested the Court rehear the case on the grounds that Justice Black should have recused himself , as the mine workers were represented by Black 's law partner of 20 years earlier . Under the Supreme Court 's rules , each Justice was entitled to determine the propriety of disqualifying himself . Jackson agreed that the petition for rehearing should be denied , but refused to give approval to Black 's participation in the case . Ultimately , when the Court unanimously denied the petition for rehearing , Justice Jackson released a short statement , in which Justice Frankfurter joined . The concurrence indicated that Jackson voted to deny the petition not because he approved of Black 's participation in the case , but on the " limited grounds " that each Justice was entitled to determine for himself the propriety of recusal . At first the case attracted little public comment , however , after Chief Justice Harlan Stone died in 1946 , rumors that President Harry S. Truman would appoint Jackson as Stone 's successor led several newspapers to investigate and report the Jewell Ridge controversy . Black and Douglas allegedly leaked to newspapers that they would resign if Jackson were appointed Chief . Truman ultimately chose Fred M. Vinson for the position . 
 In 1948 , Justice Black approved an order solicited by Abe Fortas that barred a federal district court in Texas from further investigation of significant voter fraud and irregularities in the 1948 Democratic primary election for United States Senator from Texas . The order effectively confirmed future President Lyndon Johnson 's apparent victory over former Texas Governor Coke Stevenson . 
 Black later clashed with fellow Justice Abe Fortas during the 1960s . In 1968 , a Warren clerk called their feud " one of the most basic animosities of the Court . " 
 = = = 1950s and beyond = = = 
 Vinson 's tenure as Chief Justice coincided with the Red Scare , a period of intense anti @-@ communism in the United States . In several cases the Supreme Court considered , and upheld , the validity of anticommunist laws passed during this era . For example , in American Communications Association v. Douds ( 1950 ) , the Court upheld a law that required labor union officials to forswear membership in the Communist Party . Black dissented , claiming that the law violated the First Amendment 's free speech clause . Similarly , in Dennis v. United States , 341 U.S. 494 ( 1951 ) , the Court upheld the Smith Act , which made it a crime to " advocate , abet , advise , or teach the duty , necessity , desirability , or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States . " The law was often used to prosecute individuals for joining the Communist Party . Black again dissented , writing : 
 " Public opinion being what it now is , few will protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners . There is hope , however , that , in calmer times , when present pressures , passions and fears subside , this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society . " 
 Beginning in the late 1940s , Black wrote decisions relating to the establishment clause , where he insisted on the strict separation of church and state . The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale ( 1962 ) , which declared state @-@ sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional . This provoked considerable opposition , especially in conservative circles . Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed . 
 In 1953 Vinson died and was replaced by Earl Warren . While all members of the Court were New Deal liberals , Black was part of the most liberal wing of the Court , together with Warren , Douglas , William Brennan , and Arthur Goldberg . They said the Court had a role beyond that of Congress . Yet while he often voted with them on the Warren Court , he occasionally took his own line on some key cases , most notably Griswold v. Connecticut ( 1965 ) , which established that the Constitution protected a right to privacy . In not finding such a right implicit in the Constitution , Black wrote in his dissent that " Many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written ... about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times . ... For myself , I must with all deference reject that philosophy . " 
 Black 's most prominent ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II , who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955 . They disagreed on several issues , including the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the states , the scope of the due process clause , and the one man , one vote principle . 
 = = Jurisprudence = = 
 Black 's jurisprudence is among the most distinctive of any members of the Supreme Court in history and has been influential on justices as diverse as Earl Warren , William Rehnquist , and Antonin Scalia . 
 Black 's jurisprudence had three essential components : history , literalism , and absolutism . Black 's love of history was rooted in a lifelong love of books , which led him to the belief that historical study was necessary for one to prevent repeating society 's past mistakes . Black wrote in 1968 that " power corrupts , and unrestricted power will tempt Supreme Court justices just as history tells us it has tempted other judges . " 
 Second , Black 's commitment to literalism involved using the words of the Constitution to restrict the roles of the judiciary — Black would have justices validate the supremacy of the country 's legislature , unless the legislature itself was denying people their freedoms . Black wrote : " The Constitution is not deathless ; it provides for changing or repealing by the amending process , not by judges but by the people and their chosen representatives . " Black would often lecture his colleagues , liberal or conservative , on the Supreme Court about the importance of acting within the limits of the Constitution . 
 Third , Black 's absolutism led him to enforce the rights of the Constitution , rather than attempting to define a meaning , scope , or extent to each right . Black expressed his view on the Bill of Rights in his opinion in the 1947 case , Adamson v. California , which he saw as his " most significant opinion written : " 
 " I cannot consider the Bill of Rights to be an outworn 18th century ' strait jacket . ' ... Its provisions may be thought outdated abstractions by some . And it is true that they were designed to meet ancient evils . But they are the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to century wherever excessive power is sought by the few at the expense of the many . In my judgment the people of no nation can lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted , enforced , and respected ... I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment — to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights . To hold that this Court can determine what , if any , provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced , and if so to what degree , is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution . 
 = = = Judicial restraint = = = 
 Black intensely believed in judicial restraint and reserved the power of making laws to the legislatures , often scolding his more liberal colleagues for what he saw as judicially created legislation . Conservative justice John M. Harlan II would say of Black : " No Justice has worn his judicial robes with a keener sense of the limitations that go with them . " Black advocated a narrow role of interpretation for justices , opposing a view of justices as social engineers or <unk> of the Constitution . Black opposed enlarging constitutional liberties beyond their literal or historic " plain " meaning , as he saw his more liberal colleagues do . However , he also condemned the actions of those to his right , such as the conservative Four Horsemen of the 1920s and 1930s , who struck down much of the New Deal 's legislation . 
 Black forged the 5 – 2 majority in the 1967 decision Fortson v. Morris , which cleared the path for the Georgia State Legislature to choose the governor in the deadlocked 1966 race between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Howard Callaway . Whereas Black voted with the majority under strict construction to uphold the state constitutional provision , his colleagues Douglas and Abe Fortas dissented . According to Douglas , Georgia tradition would guarantee a Maddox victory though he had trailed Callaway by some three thousand votes in the general election returns . Douglas also saw the issue as a continuation of the earlier decision Gray v. Sanders , which had struck down Georgia 's County Unit System , a kind of electoral college formerly used to choose the governor . Black argued that the U.S. Constitution does not dictate how a state must choose its governor . " Our business is not to write laws to fit the day . Our task is to interpret the Constitution , " Black explained . 
 = = = <unk> and originalism = = = 
 Black was noted for his advocacy of a textualist approach to constitutional interpretation . He took a " literal " or absolutist reading of the provisions of the Bill of Rights and believed that the text of the Constitution is absolutely determinative on any question calling for judicial interpretation , leading to his reputation as a " textualist " and as a " strict constructionist " . While the text of the constitution was an absolute limitation on the authority of judges in constitutional matters , within the confines of the text judges had a broad and unqualified mandate to enforce constitutional provisions , regardless of current public sentiment , or the feelings of the justices themselves . 
 Thus , Black refused to join in the efforts of the justices on the Court who sought to abolish capital punishment in the United States , whose efforts succeeded ( temporarily ) in the term immediately following Black 's death . He claimed that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment 's reference to takings of " life " , and to " capital " crimes , meant approval of the death penalty was implicit in the Bill of Rights . He also was not persuaded that a right of privacy was implicit in the Ninth or Fourteenth amendments , and dissented from the Court 's 1965 Griswold decision which invalidated a conviction for the use of contraceptives . Black said " It belittles that [ Fourth ] Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but ' privacy ' ... ' privacy ' is a broad , abstract , and ambiguous concept ... The constitutional right of privacy is not found in the Constitution . " 
 Justice Black rejected reliance on what he called the " mysterious and uncertain " concept of natural law . According to Black that theory was vague and arbitrary , and merely allowed judges to impose their personal views on the nation . Instead , he argued that courts should limit themselves to a strict analysis of the actual text of the Constitution . Black was , in addition , an opponent of the " living constitution " theory . In his dissent to Griswold ( 1965 ) , he wrote : 
 I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written , sometimes in <unk> strains , about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times . The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time , and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes . For myself , I must , with all deference , reject that philosophy . The Constitution makers knew the need for change , and provided for it . Amendments suggested by the people 's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification . That method of change was good for our Fathers , and , being somewhat old @-@ fashioned , I must add it is good enough for me . 
 Thus , some have seen Black as an originalist . David Strauss , for example , hails him as " [ t ] he most influential originalist judge of the last hundred years . " Black insisted that judges rely on the intent of the Framers as well as the " plain meaning " of the Constitution 's words and phrases ( drawing on the history of the period ) when deciding a case . 
 Black additionally called for judicial restraint not usually seen in Court decision @-@ making . The justices of the Court would validate the supremacy of the legislature in public policy @-@ making , unless the legislature was denying people constitutional freedoms . Black stated that the legislature " was fully clothed with the power to govern and to maintain order . " 
 = = = Federalism = = = 
 Black held an expansive view of legislative power , whether that be state or federal , and would often vote against judicial review of state laws that could be struck down under the Commerce Clause . Previously , during the 1920s and 1930s , the Court had interpreted the commerce clause narrowly , often striking down laws on the grounds that Congress had overstepped its authority . After 1937 , however , the Supreme Court overturned several precedents and affirmed a broader interpretation of the commerce clause . Black consistently voted with the majority in these decisions ; for example , he joined Mulford v. Smith , 307 U.S. 38 ( 1939 ) , United States v. Darby Lumber Co . , 312 U.S. 100 ( 1941 ) , Wickard v. <unk> , 317 U.S. 111 ( 1942 ) , Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States , 379 U.S. 241 ( 1964 ) , and Katzenbach v. McClung , 379 U.S. 294 ( 1964 ) . 
 In several other federalism cases , however , Black ruled against the federal government . For instance , he partially dissented from South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U.S. 301 ( 1966 ) , in which the Court upheld the validity of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . In an attempt to protect the voting rights of African Americans , the act required any state whose population was at least 5 % African American to obtain federal approval before changing its voting laws . Black wrote that the law , 
 ... by providing that some of the States cannot pass state laws or adopt state constitutional amendments without first being compelled to beg federal authorities to approve their policies , so distorts our constitutional structure of government as to render any distinction drawn in the Constitution between state and federal power almost meaningless . 
 Similarly , in Oregon v. Mitchell ( 1970 ) , he delivered the opinion of the court holding that the federal government was not entitled to set the voting age for state elections . 
 In the law of federal jurisdiction , Black made a large contribution by authoring the majority opinion in Younger v. Harris . This case , decided during Black 's last year on the Court , has given rise to what is now known as Younger abstention . According to this doctrine , an important principle of federalism called " comity " — that is , respect by federal courts for state courts — dictates that federal courts abstain from intervening in ongoing state proceedings , absent the most compelling circumstances . The case is also famous for its discussion of what Black calls " Our Federalism , " a discussion in which Black <unk> on 
 proper respect for state functions , a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate state governments , and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways . 
 Black was an early supporter of the " one man , one vote " standard for apportionment set by Baker v. Carr . He dissented in support of this view in Baker 's predecessor case , Colegrove v. Green . 
 = = = Civil rights = = = 
 As a senator , Black filibustered an anti @-@ lynching bill . However , during his tenure on the bench , Black established a record more sympathetic to the civil rights movement . He joined the majority in Shelley v. Kraemer ( 1948 ) , which invalidated the judicial enforcement of racially restrictive covenants . Similarly , he was part of the unanimous Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) Court that struck down racial segregation in public schools . Black remained determined to desegregate the South and would call for the Supreme Court to adopt a position of " immediate desegregation " in 1969 's Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education . 
 Black wrote the court 's majority opinion in Korematsu v. United States , which validated Roosevelt 's decision to intern Japanese Americans on the West Coast during World War II . The decision is an example of Black 's belief in the limited role of the judiciary ; he validated the legislative and executive actions that led to internment , saying " it is unnecessary for us to appraise the possible reasons which might have prompted the order to be used in the form it was . " 
 Black also tended to favor law and order over civil rights activism . This led him to read the Civil Rights Act narrowly . For example , he dissented in a case reversing convictions of sit @-@ in protesters , arguing to limit the scope of the Civil Rights Act . In 1968 he said , “ Unfortunately there are some who think that Negroes should have special privileges under the law . ” Black felt that actions like protesting , singing , or marching for " good causes " one day could lead to supporting evil causes later on ; his sister @-@ in @-@ law explained that Black was " mortally afraid " of protesters . Black opposed the actions of some civil rights and Vietnam War protesters and believed that legislatures first , and courts second , should be responsible for alleviating social wrongs . Black once said he was " vigorously opposed to efforts to extend the First Amendment 's freedom of speech beyond speech , " to conduct . 
 = = = First Amendment = = = 
 Black took an absolutist approach to First Amendment jurisprudence , believing the first words of the Amendment that said " Congress shall make no law ... " Black rejected the creation of judicial tests for free speech standards , such as the tests for " clear and present danger " , " bad tendency " , " gravity of the evil , " " reasonableness , " or " balancing . " Black would write that the First Amendment is " wholly ' beyond the reach ' of federal power to abridge ... I do not believe that any federal agencies , including Congress and the Court , have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are ' more important interests . ' " 
 He believed that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state . During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church @-@ state separation . He delivered the opinion of the court in Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government , but also to the states . 
 Black 's majority opinion in McCollum v. Board of Education ( 1948 ) held that the government could not provide religious instruction in public schools . In Torcaso v. Watkins ( 1961 ) , he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office . Similarly , he authored the majority opinion in Engel v. Vitale ( 1962 ) , which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools . 
 Justice Black is often regarded as a leading defender of First Amendment rights such as the freedom of speech and of the press . He refused to accept the doctrine that the freedom of speech could be curtailed on national security grounds . Thus , in New York Times Co. v. United States ( 1971 ) , he voted to allow newspapers to publish the Pentagon Papers despite the Nixon Administration 's contention that publication would have security implications . In his concurring opinion , Black stated , 
 In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy . The press was to serve the governed , not the governors . The Government 's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government . The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people . Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government . [ ... ] The word ' security ' is a broad , vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment . 
 He rejected the idea that the government was entitled to punish " obscene " speech . Likewise , he argued that defamation laws abridged the freedom of speech and were therefore unconstitutional . Most members of the Supreme Court rejected both of these views ; Black 's interpretation did attract the support of Justice Douglas . 
 However , he did not believe that individuals had the right to speak wherever they pleased . He delivered the majority opinion in Adderley v. Florida ( 1966 ) , controversially upholding a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property . He also dissented from Tinker v. Des Moines ( 1969 ) , in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands ( as a form of protest ) in schools , writing , 
 While I have always believed that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech , I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases . 
 Moreover , Black took a narrow view of what constituted " speech " under the First Amendment ; for him , " conduct " did not deserve the same protections that " speech " did . For example , he did not believe that flag burning was speech ; in Street v. New York ( 1969 ) , he wrote : " It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense . " Similarly , he dissented from Cohen v. California ( 1971 ) , in which the Court held that wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words " Fuck the Draft " was speech protected by the First Amendment . He asserted that this activity " was mainly conduct , and little speech . " 
 As a Justice , Black held the view that the Court should literally enforce constitutional guarantees , especially the First Amendment free speech clause . He was often labeled an ‘ activist ’ because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions . Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power . 
 For these reasons , he was one of the dissenting votes in the case of George <unk> who was prohibited from the Illinois Bar because he refused to denounce communists and refused to give a testimony of his political ideology . Black is quoted as stating : 
 <unk> has not indicated , even remotely , a belief that this country is an oppressive one in which the ' right of revolution ' should be exercised . Quite the contrary , the entire course of his life , as disclosed by the record , has been one of devotion and service to his country — first , in his willingness to defend its security at the risk of his own life in time of war and , later , in his willingness to defend its freedoms at the risk of his professional career in time of peace . 
 In a 1968 public interview , reflecting on his most important contributions , Black put his dissent from Adamson v. California " at the top of the list , but then spoke with great eloquence from one of his earliest opinions in Chambers v. Florida ( 1940 ) . " 
 = = = Criminal procedure = = = 
 Black adopted a narrower interpretation of the Fourth Amendment than many of his colleagues on the Warren Court . He dissented from Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) , in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment 's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure . He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures . Thus , he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment , and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible . 
 Justice Black originally believed that the Constitution did not require the exclusion of illegally seized evidence at trials . In his concurrence to Wolf v. Colorado ( 1949 ) , he claimed that the exclusionary rule was " not a command of the Fourth Amendment but ... a judicially created rule of evidence . " But he later changed his mind and joined the majority in Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) , which applied it to state as well as federal criminal investigations . In his concurrence , he indicated that his support was based on the Fifth Amendment 's guarantee of the right against self @-@ incrimination , not on the Fourth Amendment 's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures . He wrote , " I am still not persuaded that the Fourth Amendment , standing alone , would be enough to bar the introduction into evidence ... seized ... in violation of its commands . " 
 In other instances Black took a fairly broad view of the rights of criminal defendants . He joined the Supreme Court 's landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona ( 1966 ) , which required law enforcement officers to warn suspects of their rights prior to interrogations , and consistently voted to apply the guarantees of the Fourth , Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments at the state level . 
 Black was the author of the landmark decision in Gideon v. Wainwright ( 1963 ) , which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one . Before Gideon , the Court had held that such a requirement applied only to the federal government . 
 = = = Bill of Rights applicable to states , or " incorporation " question = = = 
 One of the most notable aspects of Justice Black 's jurisprudence was the view that the entirety of the federal Bill of Rights was applicable to the states . Originally , the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government , as the Supreme Court ruled in Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) . According to Black , the Fourteenth Amendment , ratified in 1868 , " incorporated " the Bill of Rights , or made it binding upon the states as well . In particular , he pointed to the Privileges or Immunities Clause , " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States . " He proposed that the term " privileges or immunities " encompassed the rights mentioned in the first eight amendments to the Constitution . 
 Black first expounded this theory of incorporation when the Supreme Court ruled in Adamson v. California ( 1947 ) that the Fifth Amendment 's guarantee against self @-@ incrimination did not apply to the states . It was during this period of time that Hugo Black became a disciple of John Lilburne and his claim of ‘ freeborn rights ’ . In an appendix to his dissenting opinion , Justice Black analyzed statements made by those who framed the Fourteenth Amendment , reaching the conclusion that " the Fourteenth Amendment , and particularly its privileges and immunities clause , was a plain application of the Bill of Rights to the states . " 
 Black 's theory attracted the support of Justices such as Frank Murphy and William O. Douglas . However , it never achieved the support of a majority of the Court . The most prominent opponents of Black 's theory were Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II . Frankfurter and Harlan argued that the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate the Bill of Rights per se , but merely protected rights that are " implicit in the concept of ordered liberty , " which was the standard Justice Cardozo had established earlier in Palko v. Connecticut . 
 The Supreme Court never accepted the argument that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the entirety of the Bill of Rights . However , it did agree that some " fundamental " guarantees were made applicable to the states . For the most part , during the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s , only First Amendment rights ( such as free exercise of religion and freedom of speech ) were deemed sufficiently fundamental by the Supreme Court to be incorporated . 
 However , during the 1960s , the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further , making almost all guarantees of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states . Thus , although the Court failed to accept Black 's theory of total incorporation , the end result of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated . Today , the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments , the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment , the Eighth Amendment 's protection against excessive bail , and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment , as interpreted , that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts . 
 = = = Due process clause = = = 
 Justice Black was well known for his rejection of the doctrine of substantive due process . Most Supreme Court Justices accepted the view that the due process clause encompassed not only procedural guarantees , but also " fundamental fairness " and fundamental rights . Thus , it was argued that due process included a " substantive " component in addition to its " procedural " component . 
 Black , however , believed that this interpretation of the due process clause was unjustifiably broad . In his dissent to Griswold , he charged that the doctrine of substantive due process " takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom , and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination . " Instead , Black advocated a much narrower interpretation of the clause . In his dissent to In re Winship , he analyzed the history of the term " due process of law " , and concluded : " For me , the only correct meaning of that phrase is that our Government must proceed according to the ' law of the land ' — that is , according to written constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by court decisions . " 
 Black 's view on due process drew from his reading of British history ; to him , due process meant all persons were to be tried in accordance with the Bill of Rights ' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws . Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons , regardless of wealth , age , or race . Black 's view of due process was restrictive in the sense that it was premised on equal procedures ; it did not extend to substantive due process . This was in accordance with Black 's literalist views . Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights , but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution . 
 None of Black 's colleagues shared his interpretation of the due process clause . His chief rival on the issue ( and on many other issues ) was Felix Frankfurter , who advocated a substantive view of due process based on " natural law " — if a challenged action did not " shock the conscience " of the jurist , or violate British concepts of fairness , Frankfurter would find no violation of due process of law . John M. Harlan II largely agreed with Frankfurter , and was highly critical of Black 's view , indicating his " continued bafflement at ... Black 's insistence that due process ... does not embody a concept of fundamental fairness " in his Winship concurrence . 
 = = = Voting rights = = = 
 Black was one of the Supreme Court 's foremost defenders of the " one man , one vote " principle . He delivered the opinion of the court in Wesberry v. Sanders ( 1964 ) , holding that the Constitution required congressional districts in any state to be approximately equal in population . He concluded that the Constitution 's command " that Representatives be chosen ' by the People of the several States ' means that as nearly as is practicable one man 's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another 's . " Likewise , he voted in favor of Reynolds v. Sims ( 1964 ) , which extended the same requirement to state legislative districts on the basis of the equal protection clause . 
 At the same time , Black did not believe that the equal protection clause made poll taxes unconstitutional . Thus , he dissented from the Court 's ruling in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections ( 1966 ) invalidating the use of the poll tax as a qualification to vote . He criticized the Court for exceeding its " limited power to interpret the original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause " and for " giving that clause a new meaning which it believes represents a better governmental policy . " 
 = = = Equal Protection Clause = = = 
 By the late 1940s , Black believed that the Fourteenth Amendment 's due process clause was a constitutional prohibition against any state governmental actions that discriminated on the basis of race in an invidious or capricious manner . Black saw only race and the characteristics of <unk> as the " suspect " categories that were addressed and protected by equal protection . Black believed that the equal protection clause could not be introduced as a means to invalidate state action , unless that action involved civil rights or racial discrimination . Black would maintain this view to his death , saying that race discrimination litigation merited strict scrutiny , whereas all other state @-@ action litigation did not . Black reserved the power to change the meaning and the scope of due process to the legislature . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 Justice Black admitted himself to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland , in August 1971 , and subsequently retired from the Court on September 17 . He suffered a stroke two days later and died on September 25 . 
 Services were held at the National Cathedral , and over 1 @,@ 000 persons attended . Pursuant to Justice Black ’ s wishes , the coffin was “ simple and cheap ” and was displayed at the service to show that the costs of burial are not reflective of the worth of the human whose remains were present . 
 His remains were interred at the Arlington National Cemetery . He is one of twelve Supreme Court justices buried at Arlington . The others are Harry Andrew Blackmun , William J. Brennan , Arthur Joseph Goldberg , Thurgood Marshall , Potter Stewart , William O. Douglas , Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . , Chief Justice William Howard Taft , Chief Justice Earl Warren , Chief Justice Warren Burger , and Chief Justice William Rehnquist . Justice Black is buried to the right of the main cemetery entrance , and up a hill , 200 yards behind the Taft monument . Black 's headstone is " identical in size and shape to the tens of thousands of military headstones in Arlington . " It says simply , " Hugo Lafayette Black , Captain , U. S. Army " . 
 President Richard Nixon first considered nominating Hershel Friday to fill the vacant seat , but changed his mind after the American Bar Association found Friday unqualified . Nixon then nominated Lewis Powell , who was confirmed by the Senate .

 = 1970 Canada hurricane = 
 The 1970 Canada hurricane was an unnamed tropical cyclone that brought impact to Bermuda and Newfoundland . The fourth hurricane and ninth tropical storm of the annual hurricane season , this system developed northeast of the Bahamas as a subtropical depression on October 12 . While tracking northeastward , the system intensified , becoming a subtropical storm on the following day . The subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone on October 16 , and strengthened into a hurricane about twelve hours later . The hurricane later bypassed Bermuda , before further intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Thereafter , the hurricane accelerated rapidly northeastward , and made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland as a Category 1 hurricane . It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on October 17 . 
 The system produced tropical storm force winds on Bermuda , which caused the suspension of schools , transportation , and interrupted businesses , although minimal structural damage occurred . Light rainfall was also reported on the island . Hurricane force winds were observed throughout Newfoundland , which caused damage to structures , though mostly limited to broken windows . Rough seas damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp on the Atlantic coast of the island . The cost of damage on the Burin Peninsula was estimated to be in the thousands of dollars , although the specific figure in unknown . Heavy rainfall was also reported in the region , with precipitation in Quebec reaching nearly 5 inches ( 130 mm ) . On the French Territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , several buildings and houses lost their roof due to strong winds .

 On October 11 , 1970 , satellite images indicated that a tropical depression developed north of Hispaniola . However , according to post @-@ analysis , a subtropical depression actually formed on October 12 at 1200 UTC . The depression slowly intensified over the next few days , and became a subtropical storm on October 12 , thought this was operationally unnoticed by the National Hurricane Center . By October 13 , satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with the depression merged with a weak stationary front . As a result , the National Hurricane Center no longer considered it purely tropical and classified the system as a " <unk> storm " on October 14 . Later that day , the National Hurricane Center began issuing special bulletins for the storm , indicating the possibility of the system acquiring tropical characteristics . 
 Early on October 16 , satellite imagery indicated that the storm was developing a cloud pattern typical of a normal tropical cyclone . In addition , Reconnaissance aircraft flight data indicated that a warm core was developing . As a result , the system had acquired enough characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on that day . Later that day , the storm strengthened enough to be upgraded to a hurricane at 1200 UTC . Six hours later , the system passed just west of Bermuda , although winds were well below hurricane force on the island . Spiral cloud bands and an eye feature were observed on radars as the hurricane bypassed the island . The warm core persisted into October 17 , which indicated that the hurricane was fully tropical for at least 30 – 36 hours . Early on October 17 , the National Hurricane Center discontinued bulletins on the system , while it was located about 150 miles ( 240 km ) northeast of Bermuda . 
 At 0600 UTC on October 17 , the system intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Six hours later , the hurricane attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 974 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) .

 In June 1997 , Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense . Lynne Spears asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures . Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels , therefore she needed a professional demo . He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton ; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer . Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels , returning to Kentwood the same day . Three of the labels rejected her , arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls , and " there wasn 't going to be another Madonna , another Debbie Gibson , or another Tiffany . " Two weeks later , executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph .

" They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month , who reportedly shaped her voice from " lower and less poppy " delivery to " distinctively , unmistakably Britney . " After hearing the recorded material , president Clive Calder ordered a full album .

" She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm , Sweden , where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998 , with producers Max Martin , Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub , among others .

Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record .

" The track was produced by Denniz Pop , Martin and Rami , and was also mixed by Martin at Cheiron Studios . Thomas Lindberg played the guitar , while Johan Carlberg played the bass guitar .

The show pitted one @-@ hit wonders who generally had their moments of fame in the 1980s against each other to play their own hits and a currently popular cover song . The favorites were chosen by audience voting . The American version of the show also aired on NBC later in the year , and it was also hosted by Kay . In the 2012 poll created by The Official Chart Company and ITV to discover The Nation 's Favourite Number 1 Single of all @-@ time , " … Baby One More Time " was listed as the seventh favorite song by the United Kingdom . 
 Spears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career . Rolling Stone magazine wrote : " One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century , " she " spearheaded the rise of post @-@ millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank " . Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported : " Spears is famously one of the ' oldest ' teenagers pop has ever produced , almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination . Many 19 @-@ year @-@ olds haven 't even started working by that age , whereas Britney , a former Mouseketeer , was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full @-@ time career . While other little girls were putting posters on their walls , Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall . Whereas other children develop at their own pace , Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry " . 
 Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork noted " songs like Nirvana 's " Smells Like Teen Spirit " , Dr. Dre 's " Nothing But a G Thang " , and Britney Spears 's " ... Baby One More Time " altered the landscape of pop culture so quickly in large part because they were delivered to all corners of the U.S. simultaneously by MTV . [ ... ] MTV 's ability to place a song and musician into the pop music conversation was unparalleled at the time , and by the end of the decade that meant absurd levels of both financial and creative commitment to music videos . " PopMatters writer Evan Sawdey commented that Spears 's concept for the music video of the song was the one responsible for her immediate success , saying that , as a result , the singer " scored a massive No. 1 single , inadvertently started the late ' 90s teen pop boom , and created a public persona for herself that was simultaneously kid @-@ friendly and pure male fantasy . Her videos got played on both MTV and the Disney Channel at the same time , showing just how well Spears ( and her armies of PR handlers ) managed to walk that fine line between family @-@ friendly pop idol and unabashed sex object .

 = Saturn = 
 Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second @-@ largest in the Solar System , after Jupiter . It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth . Although only one @-@ eighth the average density of Earth , with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive . Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture ; its astronomical symbol ( <unk> ) represents the god 's sickle . 
 Saturn 's interior is probably composed of a core of iron – nickel and rock ( silicon and oxygen compounds ) . This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen , an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium , and finally outside the <unk> line a gaseous outer layer . Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere . Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn 's planetary magnetic field , which is weaker than Earth 's , but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn 's larger size . Saturn 's magnetic field strength is around one @-@ twentieth of Jupiter 's . The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast , although long @-@ lived features can appear . Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1 @,@ 800 km / h ( 500 m / s ) , higher than on Jupiter , but not as high as those on Neptune . 
 Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs and that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust . Sixty @-@ two moons are known to orbit Saturn , of which fifty @-@ three are officially named . This does not include the hundreds of moonlets comprising the rings . Titan , Saturn 's largest moon , and the second @-@ largest in the Solar System , is larger than the planet Mercury , although less massive , and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Saturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium ( ' gas ' ) . It lacks a definite surface , though it may have a solid core . Saturn 's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid ; that is , it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator . Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10 % : 60 @,@ 268 km versus 54 @,@ 364 km , respectively . Jupiter , Uranus , and Neptune , the other giant planets in the Solar System , are also oblate but to a lesser extent . Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water — about 30 % less . Although Saturn 's core is considerably denser than water , the average specific density of the planet is 0 @.@ 69 g / cm3 due to the atmosphere . Jupiter has 318 times the Earth 's mass , while Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth , Together , Jupiter and Saturn hold 92 % of the total planetary mass in the Solar System . 
 On 8 January 2015 , NASA reported determining the center of the planet Saturn and its family of moons to within 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) . 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium , most of Saturn 's mass is not in the gas phase , because hydrogen becomes a non @-@ ideal liquid when the density is above 0 @.@ 01 g / cm3 , which is reached at a radius containing 99 @.@ 9 % of Saturn 's mass . The temperature , pressure , and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core , which causes hydrogen to transition into a metal in the deeper layers . 
 Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter , having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles . This core is similar in composition to the Earth , but more dense . Examination of Saturn 's gravitational moment , in combination with physical models of the interior , allowed French astronomers Didier <unk> and Tristan Guillot to place constraints on the mass of Saturn 's core . In 2004 , they estimated that the core must be 9 – 22 times the mass of the Earth , which corresponds to a diameter of about 25 @,@ 000 km . This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer , followed by a liquid layer of helium @-@ saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude . The outermost layer spans 1 @,@ 000 km and consists of gas . 
 Saturn has a hot interior , reaching 11 @,@ 700 ° C at its core , and it radiates 2 @.@ 5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun . Jupiter 's thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin – Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression , but this alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn , because it is less massive . An alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the " raining out " of droplets of helium deep in Saturn 's interior . As the droplets descend through the lower @-@ density hydrogen , the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn 's outer layers depleted of helium . These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core . 
 = = = Atmosphere = = = 
 The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96 @.@ 3 % molecular hydrogen and 3 @.@ 25 % helium by volume . The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun . The quantity of elements heavier than helium is not known precisely , but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System . The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19 – 31 times the mass of the Earth , with a significant fraction located in Saturn 's core region . 
 Trace amounts of ammonia , acetylene , ethane , propane , phosphine and methane have been detected in Saturn 's atmosphere . The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals , while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide ( <unk> ) or water . Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere , leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion . This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn 's annual seasonal cycle . 
 = = = = Cloud layers = = = = 
 Saturn 's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter 's , but Saturn 's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator . The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter . Saturn 's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s . Since then , Earth @-@ based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made . 
 The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure . In the upper cloud layers , with the temperature in the range 100 – 160 K and pressures extending between 0 @.@ 5 – 2 bar , the clouds consist of ammonia ice . Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2 @.@ 5 bar and extend down to 9 @.@ 5 bar , where temperatures range from 185 – 270 K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice , lying in the pressure range 3 – 6 bar with temperatures of 290 – 235 K. Finally , the lower layers , where pressures are between 10 – 20 bar and temperatures are 270 – 330 K , contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution . 
 Saturn 's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long @-@ lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter . In 1990 , the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn 's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters and in 1994 , another , smaller storm was observed . The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot , a unique but short @-@ lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year , roughly every 30 Earth years , around the time of the northern hemisphere 's summer solstice . Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876 , 1903 , 1933 and 1960 , with the 1933 storm being the most famous . If the periodicity is maintained , another storm will occur in about 2020 . 
 The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System 's planets , after Neptune 's . Voyager data indicate peak easterly winds of 500 m / s ( 1800 km / h ) . In images from the Cassini spacecraft during 2007 , Saturn 's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue , similar to Uranus . The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering . <unk> has shown that Saturn 's south pole has a warm polar vortex , the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System . Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally − 185 ° C , temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as − 122 ° C , suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn . 
 = = = = North pole hexagonal cloud pattern = = = = 
 A persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78 ° N was first noted in the Voyager images . The sides of the hexagon are each about 13 @,@ 800 km ( 8 @,@ 600 mi ) long , which is longer than the diameter of the Earth . The entire structure rotates with a period of <unk> <unk> 24s ( the same period as that of the planet 's radio emissions ) which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn 's interior . The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere . The pattern 's origin is a matter of much speculation . Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere . Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids . 
 = = = = South pole vortex = = = = 
 HST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream , but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave . NASA reported in November 2006 that Cassini had observed a " hurricane @-@ like " storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall . Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth . For example , images from the Galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter . 
 The south pole storm may have been present for billions of years . This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth , and it has winds of 550 km / h . 
 = = = = Other features = = = = 
 Cassini has observed a series of cloud features nicknamed " String of Pearls " found in northern latitudes . These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers . 
 = = = Magnetosphere = = = 
 Saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple , symmetric shape – a magnetic dipole . Its strength at the equator – 0 @.@ 2 gauss ( 20 µT ) – is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth 's magnetic field . As a result , Saturn 's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter 's . When Voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere , the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii , or 1 @.@ 1 million km ( 712 @,@ 000 mi ) , although it enlarged within several hours , and remained so for about three days . Most probably , the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter – by currents in the liquid metallic @-@ hydrogen layer called a metallic @-@ hydrogen dynamo . This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun . The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn 's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan 's outer atmosphere . Saturn 's magnetosphere , like Earth 's , produces aurorae . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1 @.@ 4 billion kilometres ( 9 AU ) . With an average orbital speed of 9 @.@ 69 km / s , it takes Saturn 10 @,@ 759 Earth days ( or about 29 1 ⁄ 2 years ) , to finish one revolution around the Sun . The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2 @.@ 48 ° relative to the orbital plane of the Earth . The perihelion and aphelion distances are , respectively , 9 @.@ 022 and 10 @.@ 053 AU , on average . The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions ( as in Jupiter 's case ) . 
 Astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn . System I has a period of 10 hr 14 min 00 sec ( 844 @.@ 3 ° / d ) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone , the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt . The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to System I. All other Saturnian latitudes , excluding the north and south polar regions , are indicated as System II and have been assigned a rotation period of 10 hr 38 min 25 @.@ 4 sec ( 810 @.@ 76 ° / d ) . System III refers to Saturn 's internal rotation rate . Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys , it has been assigned a rotation period of 10 hr 39 min 22 @.@ 4 sec ( 810 @.@ 8 ° / d ) . Because it is close to System II , it has largely superseded it . 
 A precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive . While approaching Saturn in 2004 , Cassini found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably , to approximately 10 hr 45 min 45 sec ( ± 36 sec ) . The latest estimate of Saturn 's rotation ( as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole ) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini , Voyager and Pioneer probes was reported in September 2007 is 10 hr 32 min 35 sec . 
 In March 2007 , it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn 's rotation rate . This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn 's moon Enceladus . The water vapor emitted into Saturn 's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn 's magnetic field , slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet . 
 = = Natural satellites = = 
 Saturn has 62 known moons , 53 of which have formal names . In addition , there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40 – 500 meters in Saturn 's rings , which are not considered to be true moons . Titan , the largest moon , comprises more than 90 % of the mass in orbit around Saturn , including the rings . Saturn 's second @-@ largest moon , Rhea , may have a tenuous ring system of its own , along with a tenuous atmosphere . 
 Many of the other moons are small : 34 are less than 10 km in diameter and another 14 between 10 and 50 km in diameter . Traditionally , most of Saturn 's moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology . Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere , in which a complex organic chemistry occurs . It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes . 
 On 6 June 2013 , scientists at the IAA @-@ CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan , a possible precursor for life . On 23 June 2014 , NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud , associated with comets , and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times . 
 Saturn 's moon Enceladus , which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets , has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life . Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite 's salt @-@ rich particles having an " ocean @-@ like " composition that indicates most of Enceladus 's expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water . 
 In April 2014 , NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon , within the A Ring , of the planet Saturn , which was imaged by Cassini on 15 April 2013 . 
 = = = Planetary rings = = = 
 Saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique . The rings extend from 6 @,@ 630 km to 120 @,@ 700 km outward from Saturn 's equator , average approximately 20 meters in thickness and are composed of 93 % water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7 % amorphous carbon . The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10 m . While the other gas giants also have ring systems , Saturn 's is the largest and most visible . 
 There are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings . One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn . The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed . Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus 's geysers . 
 In the past , astronomers once thought the rings formed alongside the planet when it formed billions of years ago . Instead , the age of these planetary rings is probably some hundreds of millions of years . 
 Beyond the main rings at a distance of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring , which is tilted at an angle of 27 ° to the other rings and , like Phoebe , orbits in retrograde fashion . 
 Some of the moons of Saturn , including Pandora and Prometheus , act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out . Pan and Atlas cause weak , linear density waves in Saturn 's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses . 
 = = History of observation and exploration = = 
 There have been three main phases in the observation and exploration of Saturn . The first era was ancient observations ( such as with the naked eye ) , before the invention of the modern telescopes . Starting in the 17th century progressively more advanced telescopic observations from Earth have been made . The other type is visitation by spacecraft , either by orbiting or flyby . In the 21st century observations continue from the Earth ( or Earth @-@ orbiting observatories ) and from the Cassini orbiter at Saturn . 
 = = = Ancient observations = = = 
 Saturn has been known since prehistoric times . In ancient times , it was the most distant of the five known planets in the Solar System ( excluding Earth ) and thus a major character in various mythologies . Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn . In ancient Roman mythology , the god Saturnus , from which the planet takes its name , was the god of agriculture . The Romans considered Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus . The Greeks had made the outermost planet sacred to Cronus , and the Romans followed suit . ( In modern Greek , the planet retains its ancient name Cronus — <unk> : Kronos . ) 
 The Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn 's orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition . In Hindu astrology , there are nine astrological objects , known as <unk> . Saturn , one of them is known as " Shani " and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life . Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the " earth star " ( <unk> ) . This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements . 
 In ancient Hebrew , Saturn is called ' <unk> ' . Its angel is <unk> . Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is <unk> ( <unk> ) and its spirit ( darker aspect ) is <unk> ( <unk> ) . In Ottoman Turkish , Urdu and Malay , its name is ' <unk> ' , derived from Arabic <unk> . 
 = = = European observations ( 17th – 19th centuries ) = = = 
 Saturn 's rings require at least a 15 @-@ mm @-@ diameter telescope to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Galileo first saw them in 1610 . He thought of them as two moons on Saturn 's sides . It was not until Christiaan Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted . Huygens discovered Saturn 's moon Titan ; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons : Iapetus , Rhea , Tethys and Dione . In 1675 , Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division . 
 No further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when William Herschel discovered two further moons , Mimas and Enceladus . The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion , which has a resonance with Titan , was discovered in 1848 by a British team . 
 In 1899 William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe , a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do . Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit . During the early 20th century , research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere – a feature unique among the Solar System 's moons .

 = = = = Pioneer 11 flyby = = = = 
 Pioneer 11 carried out the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979 , when it passed within 20 @,@ 000 km of the planet 's cloud tops . Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons , although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail . The spacecraft also studied Saturn 's rings , revealing the thin F @-@ ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle ( towards the Sun ) , meaning that they contain fine light @-@ scattering material . In addition , Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan . 
 = = = = Voyager flybys = = = = 
 In November 1980 , the Voyager 1 probe visited the Saturn system . It sent back the first high @-@ resolution images of the planet , its rings and satellites . Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time . Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan , increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon . It proved that Titan 's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths , therefore no surface details were seen . The flyby changed the spacecraft 's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System . 
 Almost a year later , in August 1981 , Voyager 2 continued the study of the Saturn system . More close @-@ up images of Saturn 's moons were acquired , as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings . Unfortunately , during the flyby , the probe 's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost . Saturn 's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft 's trajectory towards Uranus . 
 The probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet 's rings , as well as the small Maxwell Gap ( a gap within the C Ring ) and Keeler gap ( a 42 km wide gap in the A Ring ) . 
 = = = = Cassini – Huygens spacecraft = = = = 
 On 1 July 2004 , the Cassini – Huygens space probe performed the SOI ( Saturn Orbit Insertion ) maneuver and entered orbit around Saturn . Before the SOI , Cassini had already studied the system extensively . In June 2004 , it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe , sending back high @-@ resolution images and data . 
 Cassini 's flyby of Saturn 's largest moon , Titan , has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains . The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on 25 December 2004 . Huygens descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005 , sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing . Cassini has since conducted multiple flybys of Titan and other icy satellites . 
 Since early 2005 , scientists have been tracking lightning on Saturn . The power of the lightning is approximately 1 @,@ 000 times that of lightning on Earth . 
 In 2006 , NASA reported that Cassini had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in geysers on Saturn 's moon Enceladus . Images had shown jets of icy particles being emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon 's south polar region . According to Andrew Ingersoll , California Institute of Technology , " Other moons in the Solar System have liquid @-@ water oceans covered by kilometers of icy crust . What 's different here is that pockets of liquid water may be no more than tens of meters below the surface . " Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus . In May 2011 , NASA scientists at an Enceladus Focus Group Conference reported that Enceladus " is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it " . 
 Cassini photographs have led to other significant discoveries . They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring , outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E rings . The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus . In July 2006 , Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan 's north pole , the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007 . In March 2007 , additional images near Titan 's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas , the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea . In October 2006 , the probe detected an 8 @,@ 000 km diameter cyclone @-@ like storm with an eyewall at Saturn 's south pole . 
 From 2004 to 2 November 2009 , the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites . Its primary mission ended in 2008 when the spacecraft had completed 74 orbits around the planet . The probe 's mission was extended to September 2010 and then extended again to 2017 , to study a full period of Saturn 's seasons . 
 In April 2013 Cassini sent back images of a hurricane at the planet 's north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth , with winds faster than 530 km / h . 
 On 19 July 2013 , " The Day the Earth <unk> " , Cassini was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and the Moon ( and , as well , Venus and Mars ) as part of a natural light , multi @-@ image portrait of the entire Saturn system . It was the first time NASA informed the people of Earth that a long @-@ distance photo was being taken in advance . 
 = = Observation = = 
 Saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth , the other four being Mercury , Venus , Mars and Jupiter . ( Uranus and occasionally 4 Vesta are visible to the naked eye in dark skies . ) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright , yellowish point of light with an apparent magnitude of usually between + 1 and 0 . It takes approximately 29 @.@ 5 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac . Most people will require an optical aid ( very large binoculars or a small telescope ) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn 's rings , in which clear resolution is present . Twice every Saturnian year ( roughly every 15 Earth years ) , the rings briefly disappear from view , due to the way in which they are angled and because they are so thin . Such a " disappearance " will next occur in 2025 , but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for any ring @-@ crossing observation to be possible . 
 Saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at , or near , opposition , the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180 ° , and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky . A Saturnian opposition occurs every year — approximately every 378 days — and results in the planet appearing at its brightest . However , both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits , which means their distances from the Sun vary over time , and therefore so do their distances from each other , hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the other . Also , Saturn appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible . For example , during the opposition of 17 December 2002 , Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth , even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003 . 
 Also , from time to time Saturn is occulted by the Moon ( that is , the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky ) . As with all the planets in the Solar System , occultations of Saturn occur in “ seasons ” . Saturnian occultations will take place 12 or more times over a 12 @-@ month period , followed by about a five @-@ year period in which no such activity is registered . Australian astronomy experts Hill and Horner explain the seasonal nature of Saturnian occultations : 
 This is the result of the fact that the moon ’ s orbit around the Earth is tilted to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun – and so most of the time , the moon will pass above or below Saturn in the sky , and no occultation will occur . It is only when Saturn lies near the point that the moon ’ s orbit crosses the “ plane of the ecliptic ” that occultations can happen – and then they occur every time the moon swings by , until Saturn moves away from the crossing point .

 = Smooth hammerhead = 
 The smooth hammerhead ( Sphyrna zygaena ) is a species of hammerhead shark , and part of the family Sphyrnidae . This species is named " smooth hammerhead " because of the distinctive shape of the head , which is flattened and laterally extended into a hammer shape ( called the " cephalofoil " ) , without an indentation in the middle of the front margin ( hence " smooth " ) . Unlike other hammerheads , this species prefers temperate waters and occurs worldwide at medium latitudes . In the summer , these sharks migrate towards the poles following cool water masses , sometimes forming schools numbering in the hundreds to thousands . 
 The second @-@ largest hammerhead shark after the great hammerhead shark , the smooth hammerhead can measure up to 5 m ( 16 ft ) long . It is an active predator that takes a wide variety of bony fishes and invertebrates , with larger individuals also feeding on sharks and rays . As in the rest of its family , this shark is viviparous and gives birth to litters of 20 – 40 pups . A relatively common shark , it is captured , intentionally or otherwise , by many commercial fisheries throughout its range ; its fins are extremely valuable for use in shark fin soup . This shark is potentially dangerous and has likely been responsible for a few attacks on humans , though it is less likely to encounter swimmers than other large hammerhead species due to its temperate habitat .

 The Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus , known as the " father of taxonomy " , originally described the smooth hammerhead as Squalus zygaena in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae , without designating a type specimen . The name was later changed to Sphyrna zygaena . The specific epithet zygaena originates from the Greek word <unk> , meaning " yoke " , referring to the shape of its head . The Greek name <unk> had already been used for the hammerhead shark by Aristotle in the second book of his History of Animals . Other common names for this species include common hammerhead , common smooth hammerhead , round @-@ headed hammerhead , or simply hammerhead . 
 Studies based on morphology have generally regarded the smooth hammerhead as one of the more derived members of its family , grouped together with the scalloped hammerhead ( S. lewini ) and the great hammerhead ( S. mokarran ) . Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have concluded differently : while the smooth and great hammerheads are closely related , they are not as closely related to the scalloped hammerhead as the other Sphyrna species . Furthermore , the smooth hammerhead is among the more basal hammerhead species , indicating that the first hammerheads to evolve had large cephalofoils . 
 = = Description = = 
 The second @-@ largest hammerhead next to the great hammerhead , the smooth hammerhead typically measures 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 – 11 @.@ 5 ft ) long , with a maximum recorded length and weight of 5 m ( 16 ft ) and 400 kg ( 880 lb ) respectively . The smooth hammerhead differs from other large hammerheads in the shape of its cephalofoil , which has a curved front margin without an indentation in the center . The cephalofoil is wide but short , measuring 26 – 29 % of the body length across . The nostrils are located near the ends of the cephalofoil , with long grooves running towards the center . There are 26 – 32 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 25 – 30 tooth rows in the lower jaw . Each tooth is triangular in shape , with smooth to weakly serrated edges . 
 The body is streamlined , without a dorsal ridge between the two dorsal fins . The first dorsal fin is moderately tall and falcate ( sickle @-@ like ) in shape , with a rounded tip . The pectoral and pelvic fins are not falcate , rather having nearly straight rear margins . The anal fin is larger than the second dorsal fin , with long free rear tip and a strong notch in the rear margin . The dermal denticles are densely packed , each with 5 – 7 horizontal ridges ( 3 in juveniles ) leading to a W @-@ shaped rear margin . The back is dark brownish gray to olive in color , in contrast to the simple brown of most other hammerheads , becoming lighter on the flanks . The belly is white , and sometimes the pectoral fins have dark edges underneath . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Of the hammerhead sharks , the smooth hammerhead is the species most tolerant of temperate water , and occurs worldwide to higher latitudes than any other species . In the Atlantic , it occurs from Nova Scotia to the Virgin Islands and from Brazil to southern Argentina in the west , and from the British Isles to Côte d 'Ivoire , including the Mediterranean Sea , in the east . In the Indian Ocean , it is found off South Africa , India , and Sri Lanka . In the western Pacific , it occurs from the Gulf of Tonkin to southern Japan and Siberia , as well as off Australia and New Zealand . In the central and eastern Pacific , it occurs off the Hawaiian Islands , California , Panama , the Galapagos Islands , Ecuador , and Chile . This species is usually considered to be <unk> ( absent from the tropics ) in distribution , though there are rare reports from tropical waters such as in the Gulf of Mannar off India , and off southern Mozambique . Its presence in the tropics is difficult to determine due to confusion with other hammerhead species . 
 Compared to the scalloped and great hammerheads , the smooth hammerhead stays closer to the surface , in water less than 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep . However , it has been recorded diving to a depth of 200 m ( 660 ft ) . It prefers inshore waters such as bays and estuaries , but is sometimes found in the open ocean over the continental shelf , and around oceanic islands . This shark has also been reported entering freshwater habitats , such as the Indian River in Florida . In the summer , smooth hammerheads migrate poleward to stay in cooler water , heading back towards the equator in winter . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Adult smooth hammerheads are either solitary or form small groups . They may come together in great numbers during their annual migrations ; schools of over a hundred juveniles under 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) long have been observed off the eastern Cape of South Africa , and schools thousands strong have been reported off California . During hot summer weather , they can be seen swimming just below the surface with their dorsal fins exposed . Young smooth hammerheads are preyed upon by larger sharks such as the dusky shark ( Carcharhinus obscurus ) ; adults have been observed being consumed by killer whales ( Orcinus orca ) off New Zealand . Known parasites of the smooth hammerhead include the nematodes <unk> <unk> and <unk> spp . 
 The smooth hammerhead is an active @-@ swimming predator that feeds on bony fishes , rays , sharks ( including of its own species ) , cephalopods , and to a lesser extent crustaceans such as shrimp , crabs , and barnacles . They readily scavenge from fishing lines . In some areas , stingrays are a favored prey and comprise a majority of its diet . The venomous barbs of stingrays are often found lodged in and around the mouths of these sharks ; one specimen examined contained 95 such spines . In northern Europe , the smooth hammerhead feeds on herring and seabass , while in North America it takes Spanish mackerel and menhaden . Off South Africa , smooth hammerheads feed on squid such as Loligo vulgaris and small schooling fish such as pilchard over the deep coral reefs at the edge of the continental shelf , with individuals over 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) long taking increasing numbers of smaller sharks and rays . Off Australia , squid are the most important prey , followed by bony fish . 
 Like other hammerheads , the smooth hammerhead is viviparous : once the young exhaust their supply of yolk , the empty yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment . Females bear relatively large litters of 20 – 50 pups after a gestation period of 10 – 11 months . Birthing occurs in shallow coastal nurseries , such as Bulls Bay in North Carolina . The pups measure 50 – 61 cm ( 20 – 24 in ) long at birth ; females reach maturity at 2 @.@ 7 m ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) long and males at 2 @.@ 1 – 2 @.@ 5 m ( 6 @.@ 9 – 8 @.@ 2 ft ) long , depending upon locality . Off South Africa , newly mated females have been caught in February and females with full @-@ term embryos in November ; off the east coast of Australia , birthing takes place between January and March , with ovulation taking place around the same time . This shark is thought to live for 20 years or more . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The smooth hammerhead is potentially dangerous to humans . As of 2008 , the International Shark Attack File lists 34 attacks attributable to large hammerhead sharks , 17 of them unprovoked ( 1 fatal ) . However , due to the smooth hammerhead 's occurrence in temperate regions where people are less likely to enter the water , it was likely responsible for a minority of these attacks . Off southern California , this species has been reported to steal catches from sport fishers and divers . 
 Smooth hammerheads are caught by commercial fisheries throughout the world , including those off the United States ( East and West Coasts ) , Brazil , Spain , Taiwan , the Philippines , southwestern Australia , and western Africa , primarily using gillnets and longlines . Fishery catches of smooth hammerheads are difficult to quantify due to a frequent lack of distinction between them and other large hammerheads . The meat is sold fresh , dried and salted , or smoked , though in most markets it is considered undesirable and there are reports of poisoning . Much more valuable are the fins , which have the highest rating for use in shark fin soup and often leads to captured sharks being finned at sea . Additionally , the liver oil is used for vitamins , the skin for leather , and the offal for fishmeal . This shark is also used in Chinese medicine . 
 Many other fisheries from every ocean also take smooth hammerheads as bycatch , and they are caught in some numbers by recreational anglers . Smooth hammerheads are also killed by entanglement in shark nets used to protect beaches . Fewer than 10 smooth hammerheads were caught annually in the nets off KwaZulu @-@ Natal , South Africa , from 1978 – 1990 . In contrast , in the nets off New South Wales , Australia , smooth hammerheads comprised 50 % of the 4 @,@ 715 sharks captured from 1972 – 1990 . At present , this species remains relatively common and has been assessed as " Vulnerable ( VU ) " by the World Conservation Union . Off New Zealand , it is a prohibited target species and is the most abundant shark along the northwest coast . It also does not appear to have been negatively impacted by fishing off southern Australia . Off the eastern United States , catches of this species are regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) Atlantic shark Fishery Management Plan ( FMP ) , under which it is classified as a Large Coastal Shark ( LCS ) . In 2013 smooth hammerhead and other great elasmobranchs were added to Appendix 2 of CITES , bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation . 
 = Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies = 
 Dona Teresa Cristina ( 14 March 1822 – 28 December 1889 ) , nicknamed " the Mother of the Brazilians " , was the Empress consort of Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil , who reigned from 1831 to 1889 . Born a Princess of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in present @-@ day southern Italy , she was the daughter of King Don Francesco I ( Francis I ) of the Italian branch of the House of Bourbon and his wife Maria Isabel ( Maria Isabella ) . It was long believed by historians that the Princess was raised in an ultra @-@ conservative , intolerant atmosphere which resulted in a timid and unassertive character in public and an ability to be contented with very little materially or emotionally . Recent studies revealed a more complex character , who despite having respected the social norms of the era , was able to assert a limited independence due to her strongly opinionated personality as well as her interest in learning , sciences and culture . 
 The Princess was married by proxy to Pedro II in 1843 . Her spouse 's expectations had been raised when a portrait was presented that depicted Teresa Cristina as an idealized beauty , but he was displeased by his bride 's plain looks upon their first meeting later that year . Despite a cold beginning , the couple 's relationship improved as time passed , due primarily to Teresa Cristina 's patience , kindness , generosity and simplicity . These traits also helped her win the hearts of the Brazilian people , and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism . She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and Italian immigration to Brazil . 
 The marriage between Teresa Cristina and Pedro II never became passionately romantic , although a bond based upon family , mutual respect and fondness did develop . The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor 's positions and never interposed with her own views in public . She remained silent on the topic of his suspected extra @-@ marital relationships — including a liaison with her daughters ' governess . In turn , she was treated with unfailing respect and her position at Court and home was always secure . Of the four children Teresa Cristina bore him , two boys died in infancy and a daughter of typhoid fever at the early age of 24 . 
 She , along with the remaining members of the Imperial Family , was sent into exile after a coup d 'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889 . Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina 's spirit and health . Grieving and ill , she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest little more than a month after the monarchy 's collapse . She was greatly loved by her subjects , both during her lifetime and afterwards . She was even respected by the Republicans who overthrew the Empire . Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil 's political history , Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior , but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth = = = 
 Teresa Cristina was the daughter of the then @-@ Duke of Calabria , who later became King Don Francesco I ( Francis I ) of the Two Sicilies . Through her father , she was a member of the House of Bourbon @-@ Two Sicilies , also known as Bourbon @-@ Naples , the Italian branch of the Spanish Bourbons . She was a descendant of France 's " Sun King " , Louis XIV in the male line through his grandson , Don Felipe V ( Philip V ) of Spain . Teresa Cristina 's mother was the Infanta Doña Maria Isabel ( Maria Isabella ) , daughter of King Don Carlos IV ( Charles IV ) of Spain , and a younger sister of Doña Carlota Joaquina — who was the wife of King Dom João VI of Portugal and the paternal grandmother of Teresa Cristina 's future husband . 
 Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples , Teresa Cristina became an orphan when her father died in 1830 . Her mother is said to have neglected her after marrying a young officer in 1839 . Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation , in an environment of religious superstition , intolerance and conservatism . It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character , unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother . She has even been depicted as unassertive , and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself . 
 Some historians have more recently held to a modified view of both the Neapolitan Bourbon court as a reactionary regime and of the extent of Teresa Cristina 's passivity . Historian Aniello Angelo <unk> states that the maligned interpretation of the Neapolitan Bourbons traces its origin to perspectives generated during the 19th century il Risorgimento ( Italian unification ) following the 1861 conquest of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies by the Kingdom of Sardinia . Teresa Cristina is revealed in her personal papers as a strong @-@ headed character . She " was not a submissive woman but instead a person who respected the roles imposed by the ethics and values of her own times . " 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Upon learning that the young emperor of Brazil , Dom Pedro II , sought a wife , the government of the Two Sicilies offered the hand of Teresa Cristina . It also sent Pedro II a painting that greatly embellished the princess , which prompted him to accept the proposal . A proxy wedding was held on 30 May 1843 in Naples , Pedro II being represented by his fiancée 's brother Prince Leopold , Count of Syracuse . A small Brazilian fleet composed of a frigate and two corvettes departed for the Two Sicilies on 3 March 1843 to escort the new Empress of Brazil . She arrived on Rio de Janeiro on 3 September 1843 . Pedro II immediately rushed to board the ship and greet his bride . Upon seeing this impetuous gesture , the crowds cheered and guns fired deafening salutes . Teresa Cristina fell in love with her new husband at first sight . 
 The 17 @-@ year @-@ old Pedro II was , for his part , clearly and greatly disappointed . His first impressions were only of her physical flaws — and of how much her appearance differed from the portrait which had been sent to him . Physically , she had dark brown hair and brown eyes , was short , slightly overweight , walked with a pronounced limp and , while not ugly , neither was she pretty . According to historian Pedro Calmon , Teresa Cristina had no true limp , but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked . Pedro II 's high expectations were crushed , and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show . After a short interval , he left the ship . Perceiving his disillusionment , she burst into tears , lamenting that " the emperor did not like me ! " Although a proxy marriage had already been performed , an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro . 
 Although the marriage had been strained from the beginning , Teresa Cristina continued striving to be a good wife . Her constancy toward fulfilling her duty , along with the birth of children , softened Pedro II 's attitude . The two discovered shared interests , and their concern for and delight in their children created a sense of family happiness . That they were sexually active and compatible is witnessed by the series of pregnancies which ensued . After the birth of their first son in February 1845 , the Empress bore children in July 1846 , July 1847 , and July 1848 — named Afonso , Isabel , Leopoldina and Pedro , respectively . 
 = = Empress consort of Brazil = = 
 = = = Domestic life = = = 
 Teresa Cristina had grown to be a vital part of Pedro II 's family life and routine . She never filled the roles of romantic lover or intellectual partner , however . Her devotion to the Emperor remained firm , though she feared being supplanted . She continued to appear with the Emperor in public , and he continued to treat her with respect and consideration . She was not rejected or slighted , but the relationship had changed . Pedro II treated her more as a close friend and companion than as a wife . 
 The long @-@ held view is that the Empress accepted the circumscribed role in which she found herself , and that her life , duty and purpose were tied to her position as the Emperor 's wife . However , her personal letters reveal that she could be <unk> , sometimes at odds with her husband , and had a life of her own — albeit somewhat restricted . In a letter written on 2 May 1845 she stated : " I wait for the moment when we will meet , good Pedro , and seek forgiveness for all that I did to you during these days . " In another letter of 24 January 1851 , she acknowledged her difficult temperament : " I am not irritated at you [ Pedro II ] and you should forgive me because this is my character . " 
 Her friendships were limited to her ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting , and in particular Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa . She was well liked by her attendants , a good judge of the character of visitors and courtiers , unpretentious , generous , kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother . She dressed and acted modestly , only wearing jewelry for occasions of state , and gave the impression of being somewhat sad . She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters , reading , doing needlework , and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects . She possessed a beautiful voice , and often practiced her singing skills . Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls . 
 Teresa Cristina did not lack intellectual interests , and she had developed passions for the arts , music and — in particular — archaeology . The Empress began assembling a collection of archaeological artifacts from her earliest days in Brazil , and she exchanged hundreds of others with her brother , King Don Ferdinando II ( Ferdinand II ) . She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and many of the artifacts — dated from the Etruscan civilization and the Ancient Roman period — found were brought to Brazil . The Empress also aided in recruiting Italian physicians , engineers , professors , pharmacists , nurses , artists , artisans and qualified workers with the goal of improving public education and public health in Brazil . 
 = = = Rivalry with the Countess of Barral = = = 
 The relationship between Teresa Cristina and Pedro II never became passionately romantic . However , a bond based upon family , mutual respect and fondness did develop . The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor 's positions . She was silent on the subject of his relationships with other women , suspected or otherwise . In turn , she was treated with utmost respect and there was no question of her position ever being threatened or called into question . No more children were born after July 1848 , even after the death of her two sons in infancy . A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty , wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide . 
 Teresa Cristina found ignoring her husband 's secret infidelities — hidden from the public , though not always from the Empress — more difficult after Pedro II named an aia ( governess ) for their daughters on 9 November 1856 . The person chosen was Luísa de Barros , Countess of Barral , the Brazilian @-@ born wife of a French nobleman . Barral possessed all the traits that Pedro II most admired in a woman : she was charming , vivacious , elegant , sophisticated , educated and confident . Charged with the education and upbringing of the young princesses , Barral soon captured the hearts of both Pedro II and his eldest daughter , Isabel . Leopoldina was not won over and disliked the Countess . Although Barral " may not have escaped Pedro II 's embraces " , she " certainly avoided his bed . " 
 Nonetheless , the Emperor 's infatuation with the Countess sometimes put Teresa Cristina in an awkward position , as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why Pedro II kept nudging Barral 's foot during their class . The Countess 's increasing intimacy with her husband and daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina . Although she feigned ignorance of the situation , it did not pass unnoticed . She wrote in her diary that Barral " wished to make me tell her that I did not like her , but I did not say either yes or no . " Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress " could not disguise that she detested Barral . "

 The death of her daughter Leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 February 1871 devastated the small Imperial Family . Pedro II decided on a trip to Europe that same year to " cheer up " his wife among other reasons ( as stated in his own words ) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina 's four small boys , who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s . The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887 . Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil , " dedicating herself to her family , religious devotions , and charitable works . " In fact , visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories . Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy . Everyone she had known from her youth was gone . As she wrote in 1872 : " I do not know how to tell what was the impression I had upon seeing again , after 28 years , my fatherland and not to find anyone for whom I cared . " 
 The Empress remained strong @-@ willed even after years of marriage . Pedro II revealed in a letter written to the Countess of Barral in early 1881 that : " The [ container ] with the earrings which you mentioned , has been the cause for much recrimination on the part of someone [ Teresa Cristina ] who thinks that I have been to blame for their disappearance . " Her son @-@ in @-@ law , Prince Gaston , Count of Eu , wrote a letter recounting how she had accidentally broken her arm in October 1885 : " On Monday 26 when crossing the library on the way to dinner with the emperor who as usual preceded her by a few steps ( and with whom , I infer from what she told us , she was arguing as she sometimes does ) , she caught her foot in a file under a table and fell down flat face forward . " Nonetheless , she continued to express undiminished love for her husband . 
 The tranquil domestic routine ended when an Army faction rebelled and deposed Pedro II on 15 November 1889 , ordering the entire Imperial Family to leave Brazil . Upon hearing the order to depart , an officer told the Empress : " Resignation , my lady . " She replied to him : " I have it always , but how not to weep having to leave this land forever ! " According to historian Roderick J. Barman , the " events of November 15 , 1889 , broke her emotionally and physically . " The Empress " loved Brazil and its inhabitants . She desired nothing more than to end her days there . Aged 66 and plagued by both cardiac asthma and arthritis , she now faced the prospect of accompanying her husband in unceasing movement across the face of Europe , spending her last years virtually alone in alien and uncomfortable lodgings . " Having been ill during almost the entire voyage across the Atlantic , Teresa Cristina and her family arrived in Lisbon , Portugal , on 7 December . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 From Lisbon the Imperial couple went on to Porto . Isabel and her family departed to Spain on a trip . On 24 December , the Imperial Family received official news that they had been banished forever from the country . Up until that point , they had only been requested to leave with no indication as to how long they were to stay away . The " news broke D. Teresa Cristina 's will to live . " Pedro II wrote in his journal on 28 December 1889 : " Hearing the Empress complain I went to see what it was . She is cold with a pain in her sides ; but she does not have any fever . " As the day passed , Teresa Cristina 's breathing became increasingly labored , and the failure of her respiratory system led to cardiac arrest and death at 2 : 00 pm . 
 As she lay dying , Teresa Cristina said to Maria Isabel de Andrade Pinto , Baroness of <unk> ( sister @-@ in @-@ law of Joaquim Marques Lisboa , Marquis of Tamandaré ) : " Maria Isabel , I do not die of illness , I die of sorrow and of regret ! " Her last words were : " I miss my daughter [ Isabel ] and my grandchildren . I can not embrace her for the last time . Brazil , beautiful land ... To there I can not return " . The streets of Porto were crowded with people gathered to witness her funeral procession . By request of her husband , Teresa Cristina 's body was carried to the Church of São Vicente de Fora near Lisbon , where it was interred in the Braganza Pantheon . Her remains , along with Pedro II 's , were later repatriated to Brazil in 1921 with much fanfare and pomp . They were given a final resting place in the Cathedral of Petrópolis in 1939 . 
 The news of her death produced sincere mourning in Brazil . The Brazilian poet and journalist Artur Azevedo wrote of the general view toward Teresa Cristina after her death : " I never spoke to her , but also never passed her without <unk> removing my hat and bowing myself , not to the Empress , but to the sweet and honest figure of a poor , almost humble , <unk> . I saw many extremist republicans do the same . " He continued : " They called her the mother of the Brazilians , and we all really attributed to her a kind of a filial veneration . That is the truth . " 
 Newspapers in Brazil also reported her death . The Gazeta de Notícias ( News Gazette ) commented : " Who was this saintly lady , we do not need to repeat it . All Brazil knows that , in this blow which hurt the former Emperor profoundly , it is remembered that she was justly and universally proclaimed the mother of the Brazilians . " The Jornal do Commercio ( Commercial Journal ) wrote : " For forty and six years Dona Teresa Cristina lived in the Brazilian fatherland which she sincerely loved , and during that long time never , anywhere in this vast country , was her name pronounced except in praise and words of regard . " It concluded : " Next to her husband , who was for a long time the head of the Brazilian nation , her influence was known to be felt only for the good . " 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Teresa Cristina has been given a less than prominent place in Brazil 's history . Historian Aniello Angelo <unk> said that the Empress , nicknamed " by her contemporaries as ' Mother of the Brazilians ' , " is " completely unknown in Italy and little studied in Brazil " . According to his view , the few existing sources relegate her to having " lived in the shadow of her husband , dedicating herself to her daughters ' education , to home affairs , to charity . " The resulting image " is of a woman of limited culture , blank , silent , who compensated with kindness and virtues of the heart the lack of physical attributes . " And this is the view that has come to be enshrined in history and the popular imagination , despite being not quite a true representation of Teresa Cristina , since she was a well learned and willful woman . 
 According to historian Eli Behar , Teresa Cristina became notable " for her discretion , which kept her far from being associated with any political movement ; and for her tenderness and charity , which earned her the cognomen ' Mother of the Brazilians ' . " A similar opinion is voiced by Historian <unk> Antunes , who said that she " was beloved by Brazilians , who defined her , for her discretion , as the ' silent empress ' , and yet regarded her as ' the mother of the Brazilians ' . " He also praised the Empress for her sponsorship of cultural and scientific development : she " promoted culture in various ways , bringing from Italy artists , intellectuals , scientists , botanists , musicians , thus contributing to the progress and enrichment of the nation 's cultural life . " This view is shared by historian Eugenia <unk> , who argued that , thanks to her , Brazil now has the largest classical archaeological collection in Latin America . 
 Just prior to his own death , Pedro II donated most of his possessions to the Brazilian government , which were later divided between the Brazilian National Archives , the Imperial Museum of Brazil , the National Library of Brazil and the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute . Pedro II imposed only one condition : that the gift was to be named in honor of his late wife , and so it is known as the " Teresa Cristina Maria Collection " . The collection is registered by UNESCO as part of the heritage of humanity in its Memory of the World Programme . Finally , Teresa Cristina is remembered in the names of several Brazilian cities , including <unk> ( in Rio de Janeiro ) , Teresina ( capital of Piauí ) , Cristina ( in Minas Gerais ) and <unk> ( in Maranhão ) .

 = Geoffrey ( archbishop of York ) = 
 Geoffrey ( c . 1152 – 12 December 1212 ) , sometimes called Geoffrey Plantagenet , <unk> , or <unk> , was an illegitimate son of Henry II , King of England , who became bishop @-@ elect of Lincoln and archbishop of York . The identity of his mother is uncertain , but she may have been named Ykenai . Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173 , though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189 . In 1173 – 1174 , he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half @-@ brothers ; this campaign led to the capture of William , King of Scots . By 1182 , Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop ; he chose to resign and became Chancellor instead . He was the only one of Henry II 's sons present at the king 's death . 
 Geoffrey 's half @-@ brother Richard I nominated him archbishop of York after succeeding to the throne of England , probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne . After some dispute Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191 . He soon became embroiled in a conflict with William Longchamp , Richard 's regent in England , after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France . Geoffrey claimed sanctuary in the town , but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in Dover Castle . Subsequently a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office , and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese . The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half @-@ brothers : first Richard and then John , who succeeded to the English throne in 1199 . Geoffrey also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops , his cathedral chapter , and other clergy in his diocese . His last quarrel with John was in 1207 , when the archbishop refused to allow the collection of a tax and was driven into exile in France . He died there five years later . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Geoffrey was probably born in about 1152 , before his father Henry , later Henry II of England , married Eleanor of Aquitaine , and was likely named after his paternal grandfather , Geoffrey of Anjou . Although he is often given the surname " Plantagenet " in modern histories , that name was not in use during his lifetime . The date of his birth is determined by statements of Gerald of Wales that he was barely 20 when elected bishop in 1173 , and by the fact that he was about 40 when consecrated archbishop in 1191 . His mother 's identity is unclear . The medieval chronicler Walter Map claimed she was a whore named Ykenai , and that he was not actually Henry 's son . This is the only contemporary source that gives her name , and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey , the information must be judged carefully . Instead , Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight . Another possibility for Geoffrey 's mother is Rosamund Clifford , but most of the evidence for this is circumstantial . It is assumed that Geoffrey was the eldest of Henry 's children , legitimate or illegitimate . 
 Geoffrey was brought up with Henry 's legitimate children . There is no evidence that Henry tried to deny Geoffrey 's paternity , although Walter Map said that Henry 's acknowledgment was done " improperly and with little discretion " . Geoffrey had a brother named Peter , who appears to have been his maternal half @-@ brother , as Peter is generally considered unlikely to have been Henry 's son . 
 Geoffrey was Archdeacon of Lincoln in the diocese of Lincoln by September 1171 , and probably retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop @-@ elect in 1175 . He also held a prebend , an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter , in the diocese of London , but there is little evidence that he executed the duties of either office . There are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in Northampton , and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s . He also acted as a papal judge @-@ delegate at that time . Pope Alexander III initially refused to confirm Geoffrey 's selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173 , prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office . He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175 , but he was not ordained at that time , as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric . Geoffrey 's youth was one of Alexander 's objections to Geoffrey 's election , and the pope only confirmed the office under duress . Another potential problem was Geoffrey 's illegitimacy , which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office , but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation . 
 In 1173 and early 1174 Geoffrey fought a military campaign in northern England in support of his father 's attempts to subdue the Scots , who were supporting the rebellion by Geoffrey 's legitimate half @-@ brothers against their father . The campaign resulted in the capture of William the Lion , the King of Scots , at the Battle of Alnwick and also helped to compel Hugh du Puiset , the Bishop of Durham , to pledge fealty to Henry II . During the campaign , Geoffrey captured several castles held by Roger Mowbray , a supporter of the Scottish king . It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey " My other sons are the real bastards . ... This is the only one who 's proved himself legitimate ! " After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175 , the bishop @-@ elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175 . He subsequently went to study at Tours , where he probably befriended Peter of Blois , a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St Wilfrid to Geoffrey . The bishop @-@ elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln , including two bells for the bell tower . While Geoffrey was the bishop @-@ elect at Lincoln , it appears that Adam , Bishop of St Asaph , carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln , as Geoffrey had not been consecrated and was unable to perform those functions . Nevertheless , he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items . Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries , in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father . In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey was never going to be ordained or consecrated , and demanded that the bishop @-@ elect 's position be regularised , either through consecration as bishop or through resignation . 
 = = Chancellor = = 
 Geoffrey formally resigned the see of Lincoln on 6 January 1182 , at Marlborough in England , rather than be ordained as Pope Lucius III had ordered . Henry had named him Chancellor of England in 1181 , after Geoffrey indicated he was going to resign the bishopric in February 1181 . Although Geoffrey resigned the episcopal office , he continued to hold benefices in plurality , which was normally contrary to canon law . These offices included the Treasurer of York from 1182 , the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183 , and probably the Archdeaconry of East Riding . Henry also gave him two continental castles , one in Anjou and one in Touraine , along with lands in England and Normandy worth 1000 marks a year . Although Geoffrey held the office of Chancellor , he appears in only few documents , mainly between 1182 and 1185 . After 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187 , and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father 's domains . Peter of Blois wrote that several monarchs considered Geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land , and that he was actually offered the throne of Jerusalem by Heraclius , the Patriarch of Jerusalem . It is possible that Geoffrey 's non @-@ appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father 's domains in pursuit of these ambitions . During Geoffrey 's term of office as Chancellor Walter de Coutances served as his " seal @-@ keeper " ; the need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to the likelihood that Geoffrey 's time as Chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father . William Longchamp fulfilled the same assistant role for the archdeaconry at Rouen . 
 Following the declaration of war on Henry by Prince Richard and King Philip II of France in 1187 , Geoffrey was given command of a quarter of the English royal army . He and his father were driven from Le Mans , Henry 's birthplace , in 1189 . Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry 's death , unwilling to witness his father 's humiliation , but he did help nurse him during his final days . Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester , and Geoffrey used his father 's seal to make appointments to York after Henry 's death . Geoffrey then escorted Henry 's body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial . He was the only one of Henry II 's sons present at his death . 
 = = Archbishop = = 
 = = = First difficulties = = = 
 Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189 , within days of taking the throne ; the formal election took place on 10 August . What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne , and why , as well as the exact chronology of events , is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts . Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York , but another chronicler , Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates . However the election occurred , Geoffrey 's consecration did not take place until much later , and soon after his election , he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor . A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York , Hubert Walter , as archbishop . 
 Richard probably gave York to Geoffrey in the hope of forcing him to become a full priest , and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne . Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected to be out of the country on crusade . The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath , the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard 's efforts to keep Geoffrey 's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check . But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey 's appointment , claiming that because the Dean of York , Hubert Walter , and some others of the chapter had not been present , the election was invalid . Walter 's election to York was supported by Richard 's mother , Eleanor of Aquitaine , whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband 's affairs . Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric , and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16 September . At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York : he made Henry Marshal the dean ; Burchard du Puiset , a relative of Hugh du Puiset , became treasurer ; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey . Geoffrey objected to these appointments , and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest . The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard 's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese , and thus unable to challenge for the English throne . The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey , in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives . 
 Geoffrey 's ordination as a priest took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189 , in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn . Geoffrey then went to York , but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office . This stance was supported by most of the York cathedral chapter . Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury . It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey 's election was secured in December , when Giovanni d <unk> , the papal legate , not only confirmed the election , but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey . But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments , and pay a fine of £ 2000 before his lands were restored , although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment . 
 In early 1190 Geoffrey ordered a halt to religious ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service . Richard , who was in Normandy preparing to go on the Third Crusade , ordered Geoffrey to the king 's presence in Normandy . Although Hugh du Puiset , who was Justiciar , was hampering Geoffrey 's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine , Richard insisted on immediate full payment . When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re @-@ confiscated his lands , increased the amount of the fine , and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years . The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey 's election , thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June . Geoffrey 's estates were returned to him in July , after paying 800 marks of his fine . 
 = = = Consecration and more difficulties = = = 
 Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191 , at Tours in France , by Bartholomew , the Archbishop of Tours , after the papacy agreed to allow the consecration . This permission was secured by the intervention of the king and his mother , Eleanor of Aquitaine . Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard 's support as part of an effort to secure a counter @-@ weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor , William Longchamp , about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily . Geoffrey received his pallium , the symbol of an archbishop 's authority , at his consecration . In September 1191 , after the consecration , he attempted to go to York , but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp , and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover , was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle . Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard , but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival . Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury , and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey 's arrest . But the actions of Longchamp 's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor 's arrest of Geoffrey , even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents . One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket , who had been dragged from an altar and martyred . The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge , between Reading and Windsor ; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship , and Hugh of Lincoln , the Bishop of Lincoln , excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary . Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191 . 
 While still embroiled in his conflict with Longchamp , Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset , probably over Geoffrey 's authority in Puiset 's diocese of Durham , one of those subject to York . The dispute dragged on for years , with many appeals to Rome and the king . York had been vacant for several years , and Puiset had grown used to having untrammelled authority in the northern archdiocese . After Geoffrey 's consecration , he summoned Puiset to a provincial synod in late September 1191 , at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities . Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod , and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey . An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset , who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust . Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192 , when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey 's authority over Durham . 
 Geoffrey caused offence by his attempts to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury , thus implying that his diocese was superior or at least equal to Canterbury in rank . In pursuit of this rivalry between York and Canterbury , Geoffrey was the first archbishop of York to style himself " Primate of England " , in opposition to the Canterbury title of " Primate of all England " . He also attempted to subordinate Clementhorpe Priory to <unk> Abbey , which provoked an appeal from Prioress Alice of Clementhorpe to the papacy . Probably owing to Pope Celestine III 's dislike of Geoffrey , Hubert Walter was given a papal legateship that included Geoffrey 's province , something that had not been usual in the preceding years , and which presented Geoffrey with some difficulties in his dealings with the ecclesiastical hierarchy . But Geoffrey was on friendly terms with Prince John ; the historian G. V. Scammell has suggested that Geoffrey 's consecration allowed John to feel that Geoffrey was no longer a rival for the throne , thus paving the way for good relations between the two half @-@ brothers . 
 Geoffrey long faced opposition from some members of his cathedral chapter led by Henry Marshal , Burchard du Puiset , and Roger of London . They objected to his having given a large part of York 's treasury toward Richard 's ransom , and to some of his appointments in the church of York . Charges of simony , extortion , and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey , who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once , and locked the canons out of church . Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York ; his first choice , his half @-@ brother Peter , was opposed by the cathedral chapter . Geoffrey 's second choice , Simon of Apulia , the chancellor of York , refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man , Philip of Poitou . Simon was supported by the cathedral chapter , who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey 's opposition . An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon travelled to King Richard in Germany . The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany to resolve the issue . Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy , and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York . 
 = = = Quarrels with John , Hubert Walter and Richard = = = 
 When Prince John rebelled in 1193 , Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset put aside their feud to quash the uprising . Geoffrey strengthened Doncaster 's defences and went to the aid of Puiset , who was besieging Tickhill Castle . In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself . Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the primacy of England , which Canterbury claimed and York disputed . Walter 's decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England . Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month . King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation , and even went so far as to restore some of his confiscated estates . Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar ; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey 's actions , which led to Geoffrey 's estates being confiscated once again . Geoffrey appealed to the king , who was then in Maine ; Richard over @-@ ruled Walter , restored Geoffrey 's estates , and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow . 
 In January 1195 Geoffrey was ordered to appear in Rome to answer various charges , under the threat of suspension from office if he did not appear by 1 June . Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed , including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing chrism on a dungheap in protest . Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey 's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey 's estates once more . This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a legatine council at York in June 1195 . Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November , but was still unable to attend , which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey 's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln . Hugh protested , and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23 December 1195 , finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him . He travelled to Rome in 1196 , where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope . 
 Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy while the archbishop was attempting to return to England . Richard forbade him from administering York , and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198 . An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing , after Geoffrey refused to approve the king 's appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees that they would be approved by the papacy . Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28 April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king . Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval . 
 = = Under John = = 
 After John succeeded Richard in 1199 , he decided to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates , but continued to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome . Some of Geoffrey 's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices , and for a short time peace reigned in York . But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey 's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York , and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200 . For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king , and the two appear to have been on good terms , a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200 . 
 In October 1200 Geoffrey refused to allow the collection of carucage , a tax on land , on his property , and his lands were confiscated in retaliation . He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire , James of <unk> , who had ravaged Geoffrey 's lands in revenge . In November 1200 , Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln 's funeral , which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates , but the archbishop 's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart . In January 1201 , John made peace with his half brother , but it did not last , as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected . John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard 's reign , which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace , which occurred in May 1201 . But it was short @-@ lived ; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out , but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates . Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese , with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement . Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were Guisborough Priory , Meaux Abbey , and Fountains Abbey . Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices , but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house . 
 Geoffrey submitted to John in 1206 , and his lands were returned to him . But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile . Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese , but the king confiscated Geoffrey 's estates in retaliation . Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent , who ordered John to restore Geoffrey 's possessions , but in the meantime the archbishop had fled to France . A medieval chronicler , Geoffrey of Coldingham , stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Geoffrey died while still in exile at <unk> in Normandy on 12 December 1212 . He was buried at a Grandmontine monastery near Rouen , where he had been living for a few years . His tomb was still extant in 1767 , when the inscription on it was recorded by an antiquary . He may have become a monk before his death . 
 Although his archiepiscopate was mainly marked by the conflicts in which he engaged , Geoffrey also managed to institute some administrative reforms in his diocese , creating the office of chancellor . He also inspired loyalty from some of his household members , many of whom witnessed his charters , and although he made enemies of several of the suffragan bishops , clergy and religious houses in his diocese , he also secured the friendship and support of other clergy , including Pope Innocent III and Hugh of Lincoln . Although Walter Map declared that Geoffrey was " full of faults and devoid of character " , he remained loyal to his father until Henry 's death . A modern @-@ day historian , Thomas Jones , summed up Geoffrey 's character with the phrase " quarrelsome and undiplomatic " . Another historian , J. C. Holt , stated that Geoffrey was through his career " a perpetual source of danger , quarrelling now with de Puiset , now with the Yorkshire sheriffs , ever ready to attack the judicial and fiscal superiority of the Crown . " 
 Geoffrey 's ambitions may have included becoming King of England , which may account for some of the harshness that his two legitimate half @-@ brothers displayed towards him . His military abilities , displayed in the rebellion of 1173 – 1174 , as well his custody of castles near Tours , would have also fed into Richard 's disquiet over Geoffrey 's possible intentions . Geoffrey was known to be ambitious , which led the historian D. L. <unk> to call him a " formidable bastard " . The historian Ralph Turner said of Geoffrey that " he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth " and that he had " inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets " . 
 Geoffrey was a patron of scholarship , and employed scholars throughout his life , one of whom , Honorius of Kent , Geoffrey appointed Archdeacon of Richmond . Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter and wrote a legal work on canon law . The Leiden St Louis Psalter is a lavishly illuminated psalter made for the archbishop , probably in northern England in the 1190s , which passed into the hands of Blanche of Castile after Geoffrey 's death , and , as religious manuscripts often were , was used to teach the future saint King Louis IX of France how to read , as recorded by a 14th @-@ century inscription . After the king 's death it passed through several royal owners , regarded as a relic of the saint , before reaching the University Library at Leiden in 1741 . 
 = The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu = 
 " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " is the eighth episode of the first season of the American animated science fiction television series Star Trek : The Animated Series . It first aired on NBC on October 27 , 1973 , and was written by Larry Brody , who had originally pitched the idea for the third season of Star Trek : The Original Series . However , according to Brody the dialogue was mostly re @-@ written by series creator Gene Roddenberry . 
 Set in the 23rd century , the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk ( voiced by William Shatner ) and the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise . In this episode , while exploring the center of the galaxy , the crew of the Enterprise are transported to the planet Megas @-@ Tu by an alien named Lucien , where magic and witchcraft are normal . Kirk and the crew are placed on trial by the inhabitants in response to the Salem Witch Trials . 
 The original pitch by Brody featured God rather than the Devil , but this was changed after the idea was rejected by NBC executives . Critics have written positively about the episode , praising the design work for the magical effects . It was compared to The Original Series episode " Plato 's Stepchildren " , but was thought to be an improvement . Following the broadcast , a novelization of " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " was created by Alan Dean Foster , and it has been released on a variety of home media formats . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On stardate 1254 @.@ 4 , while exploring near the center of the galaxy , the Federation starship USS Enterprise is caught inside an energy / matter vortex and all her computer systems fail . A being named Lucien ( voiced by James Doohan ) appears on the bridge , repairs the ship 's systems and takes the crew to explore his planet , Megas @-@ Tu . 
 On this planet , magic and witchcraft are quite normal . The Megans are an ageless species that had , at one time , lived on Earth , and were responsible for the legends about witches . During this time , the Enterprise crew begin to experiment with magic : Lt. Hikaru Sulu ( voiced by George Takei ) conjures up a beautiful woman while Science Officer Spock ( voiced by Leonard Nimoy ) creates a Vulcan chess game . Lucien , their guide , warns the crew that their experiments would draw unwanted attention , but it is too late . The crew are transported to a location on the planet that appears to be Salem during the middle of a witch trial . 
 The Megans are determined to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch @-@ trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here . Kirk comes out in support of Lucien 's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans . Lucien 's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans ' world . While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691 , the Megans ignore his words . At the end of the trial , Kirk offers his life to save Lucien 's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain 's gesture that they spare Lucien , and tell the Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet . They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe , while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer . 
 = = Production = = 
 In 1969 , writer Larry Brody pitched a number of story ideas for the third season of Star Trek : The Original Series . He was unsure about how far these stories ideas were taken through the production team , and whether or not series creator Gene Roddenberry had ever seen them . Amongst the ideas was the plot that later became " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " . Three years later in 1972 , Brody was invited by producer D.C. Fontana to pitch ideas for an episode of Star Trek : The Animated Series . When he arrived to pitch to Fontana , she instead ushered him into a room with Roddenberry . The Star Trek creator was pleased with the idea for " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " , saying that they had tried to do a magic based episode ( " <unk> " ) in the second season of The Original Series but he was unsatisfied with the effects due to the budgetary constraints . 
 At this point the plot concerned the crew of the Enterprise coming across God in space , something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime 's executives . He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead . Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script . Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately , wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series . 
 Roddenberry took the God idea to the NBC executives , who were concerned with the " blinding flash of light " representing God . They rejected the inclusion of God , and the production crew realized that they needed to move the episode in the direction of magic rather than religion . Brody re @-@ wrote the story to include the Devil instead of God . The script went through several re @-@ writes , with Fontana and Brody meeting to discuss the changes that Roddenberry had requested . Brody later regretted not speaking to Roddenberry directly , as at times he didn 't understand what changes he was being asked to make . Fontana was aware of the controversial content of the episode , and later said that some people felt that " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " dealt with the Devil sympathetically , but believed that it was good . 
 Following the submission of the script , Roddenberry re @-@ wrote the dialogue to the extent that Brody didn 't recognise any of it when he received the final version . However , Brody 's name remained credited on it . Afterwards , he was invited to attend the cast recording session for the episode , where he met the actors including Shatner and Nimoy . " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " was one of two episodes of The Animated Series previously pitched for live @-@ action Star Trek , the other being David Gerrold 's " More Tribbles , More Troubles " . Brody later wrote the episode " Tattoo " for the second season of Star Trek : Voyager . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " was first broadcast on NBC on October 27 , 1973 . Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross , in their book Trek Navigator ( 1998 ) , consider " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " to be one of the best animated episodes . They explained that while it was quite ambitious and heady for a Saturday morning children 's program , " it 's somehow appropriate that Star Trek is able to pull it off successfully . " They compared this episode to the live action Star Trek episode " Plato 's Stepchildren " where Kirk and his crew also gain superpowers , saying it was " a better episode , as Kirk pleads humanity 's case to the Megans . " They highlighted that the episode depicts Kirk successfully defending Lucifer from banishment and noting that he will not fall prey to legendary superstitions and at the end of the episode following Kirk 's successful defense . They gave the episode three out of four stars . 
 In his column " One Trek Mind " for the official Star Trek website , published in December 2014 , Jordan Hoffman described the episode as " quite beautiful to look at " but also " weirdest " episode of the franchise . Hoffman said that the magical battle between Kirk and the Megan prosecutor was " indescribable " , and compared one scene to having Kirk " trapped inside a giant wrapper of Fruit Stripe gum " . He thought that the revelation of Lucien as the Devil and the punchline ending to the episode could not be repeated in modern television . 
 In January 2014 , Witney Seibold when writing for Crave Online , said that " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " was the best episode of The Animated Series . Seibold said that it opened up a number of questions , such as " Does the most evil creature in existence deserve rights as an individual ? " , and added that the action sequence where Captain Kirk fires lightning out of his hands was " really cool " . However , Michelle Erica Green in her March 2011 review for TrekNation described the episode as so bad that she thought fans only watched it to play drinking games . Following her review , she planned to return to pretending that the " terrible " " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " never existed at all . 
 The episode was expanded by Alan Dean Foster in the novel Star Trek : Log 3 alongside the episodes " Once Upon a Planet " and " Mudd 's Passion " . " The Magicks of Megas @-@ tu " was released on LaserDisc as part of the series set . The first release of Star Trek : The Animated Series on DVD was through fan made productions . The official DVD release was on November 21 , 2006 in the United States , which was a single release containing all episodes from both seasons of the television show . 
 = Lovebird ( song ) = 
 " Lovebird " is a song recorded by British singer @-@ songwriter Leona Lewis for her third studio album Glassheart ( 2012 ) . It was written by Bonnie McKee , Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke , and produced by Josh Abrahams , Ammo and Oligee . " Lovebird " was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles and is a power ballad , incorporating a piano and synth @-@ driven melody . The lyrics consist of Lewis informing her past lover that enough time has passed since their relationship for her to have moved on and to have developed as a person . Critics praised Lewis ' vocal performance , likening the her technical abilities to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston . The musical structure of the song was heavily compared to one of her previous singles , " Bleeding Love " , along with songs performed by Adele . The accompanying music video shows Lewis trying to escape from a giant bird cage . 
 To promote " Lovebird " , Lewis performed the song on talk shows Daybreak and Loose Women in the United Kingdom , in addition to singing competition La Voz in Spain . Nonetheless , " Lovebird " sold fewer than 600 copies upon its release , failing to attain one of the top 200 chart positions on the UK Singles Chart ; however , two weeks after the release of Glassheart , " Lovebird " peaked at number 22 on the South Korea Gaon Single Chart due to strong digital download sales .

 On New Years Day 2012 , a low quality snippet of " Lovebird " leaked under the title " Love Birds " . After the song leaked , Lewis expressed her frustration at the song being available for listening to on the Internet , stating : " I 'm sad that one of my songs leaked . As an artist that holds music dear to my heart I would 've liked to share it with u [ sic ] when it 's ready . I hope that you feel it like I do and when it 's time to be released you 'll still support it in the right way . Thank u [ sic ] for the love . " That same month , it was announced that the album was expected to be released on 26 March 2012 . Record executive Simon Cowell later publicly give his support for Glassheart , saying to Lewis that , although there had been a lengthy wait of two years for new music , the album was " sensational " , and that Lewis had " never sounded better . "

 In October 2012 , " Trouble " was released as Glassheart 's lead single .

However , when Lewis appeared as a special guest performer at the London Oxford Street Christmas light switch @-@ on event on 5 November 2012 , she introduced " Lovebird " as the second single and performed it for the first time . It was later confirmed by Sony Music that " Lovebird " had replaced " Fireflies " as the album 's second single , and that it would be released as the lead single for the album in Europe . " Lovebird " was made available for download in Finland , the Netherlands , Portugal and Switzerland on 16 November 2012 . It was released in France , Italy and Spain a few days later on 19 November 2012 .

 " Lovebird " was written by Bonnie McKee , Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke , and produced by Josh Abrahams , Oligee , and Coleman ( under his production name , Ammo ) . The song was engineered by Ryan Williams , assisted by Daniela Rivera . " Lovebird " was mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta , Georgia and mastered by Colin Leonard at SING Mastering using SING Technology , both located in Atlanta . The song was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles . " Lovebird " is a power ballad of three minutes and thirty seconds . The song 's musical structure bears strong resemblances to one of Lewis ' previous singles , " Bleeding Love " , from her début studio album Spirit ( 2007 ) . The track opens with a piano introduction similar to that on " Bleeding Love " , and features an " instantly hummable chorus " . Lewis informs her lover in the lyrics – with the lines " But the time went on , the wind has blown , and I have grown " – that enough time has passed since their relationship started for her to have developed as a person . As power ballad beats and " airy synths " play , she sings " Your <unk> 's flying away / Cos my heart 's been stuck in a cage " . The hook consists of Lewis singing " I 've got to sing my song , so pretty / Dum , dum , <unk> " .

 Mike Wass , a writer for Idolator , wrote that " Lovebird " was one of the two best songs on Glassheart , along with the title track . He further commented that it had strong radio potential , and that it would be successful if it were to be released in the United States , as it sounds like a " clone " of " Bleeding Love " . Digital Spy critic Lewis Corner felt that the song was reminiscent of " Bleeding Love " as well as " Better in Time " . Although he noted that Lewis ' vocal performance on " Lovebird " is very impressive , as with all her material , he was unsure of why it was included on the final cut of the album due to Glassheart having " bigger " songs on it , which were likely to chart better . The Mirror 's Clemmie Moodie thought that although the recording is a " catchy " song , it does not compare to " Bleeding Love " , but noted that it does contain " lyrical gems " , including “ Your <unk> 's flyin ’ away , ’ cos my heart 's been stuck in a cage " . Hermoine Hoby , writing on behalf of The Observer , wrote that Lewis appears to be following in the footsteps of singer @-@ songwriter Adele , due to the inclusion of " big heartfelt ballads " such as " Lovebird " and " Fireflies " on Glassheart . For Hoby , Lewis ' vocals are just as " technically irreproachable " as Whitney Houston 's and Mariah Carey 's .

 Lewis performed " Lovebird " for the first time at the switching @-@ on of the Christmas lights at Oxford Street in London on 5 November 2012 ; she also performed " Trouble " . The singer performed the song live on Daybreak on 23 November 2012 , on Loose Women on 29 November 2012 and again on 8 December 2012 at the National Lottery Awards . To promote the song in Spain , Lewis sung " Lovebird " on La Voz in December 2012 . 
 The song 's accompanying music video was filmed in November 2012 and premiered on 5 December 2012 . The video has a metaphorical theme , and features Lewis in a giant bird cage in a dimly lit room , wearing the long ivory sleeved dress and " jewelled eye decorations " . Some scenes show the singer in a shadow and darker settings , while others are light and colourful . For most of the video , Lewis ponders about being able to escape her cage and experience freedom . At the end of the video , she realises that the cage is in fact unlocked and she is able to leave her confine , and leaves . Lucy Buckland for the Daily Mail felt that Lewis looks " positively mournful " in the video , and that while it may not be the best advert for feminism , she looks " beautiful " .

 Upon the release of Glassheart , " Lovebird " debuted on the South Korea Digital International Singles chart at number 73 in the issue dated 24 November 2012 .

On the South Korea Download International Singles chart , the song debuted at number 68 , with sales of 4 @,@ 310 , on 24 November 2012 , and peaked at number 22 the following week , with sales of 10 @,@ 413 . In the United Kingdom , " Lovebird " was given an impact date of 9 December 2012 , meaning it was only available to purchase as an album track rather than a traditional separate single release . In the chart week immediately after , " Lovebird " sold fewer than 600 copies , meaning it failed to attain one of 200 chart positions on the UK Singles Chart . As a result , " Lovebird " became Lewis ' lowest selling single of her career thus far , and her first release to not chart in the UK . According to the The Mirror there was " no real marketing force " behind the single and it " failed to capture the imagination of radio bosses " . The newspaper concluded that " most people , unless they have the album , have never heard the song " and this was due to a lack of airplay .

 = Freedom from Fear ( painting ) = 
 Freedom from Fear is the last of the well @-@ known Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell . The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms , which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6 , 1941 . This work was published in the March 13 , 1943 , issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day , Stephen Vincent Benét . The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain .

 Freedom from Fear is the last of a series of four oil paintings entitled Four Freedoms , painted by Norman Rockwell . The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6 , 1941 ; the speech itself is often called the Four Freedoms . The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter , and it became part of the charter of the United Nations . The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post , accompanied by essays from noted writers , on four consecutive weeks in early 1943 : Freedom of Speech ( February 20 ) , Freedom of Worship ( February 27 ) , Freedom from Want ( March 6 ) and Freedom from Fear ( March 13 ) . Eventually , the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government 's Second War Bond Drive . 
 The Blitz was a period of sustained strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War . Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941 , sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids . Beginning on 7 September 1940 , London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights . Overall , more than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz , and more than 40 @,@ 000 civilians were killed , almost half of them in London .

 The painting shows children resting safely in their beds , oblivious to the perils of this world , as their parents look on . Their mother tucks them in while their father holds a newspaper describing the horrors of the ongoing conflict . However , his attention is fully on his children and not on the alarming headlines . According to another view , the children are already asleep , and their parents are checking on them in their shared narrow bed before they themselves turn in for the night . The father appears as the " classic Rockwell onlooker " who serves as a viewer within the painting . Since he is holding his glasses , we assume that he has finished reading the Bennington Banner in his hand . The newspaper 's headline reads " Bombings Ki ... Horror Hit " , referencing the Blitz . In the background is a lit hallway and a stairway leading to the first floor . 
 According to Rockwell , who did not really care much for the work , the theme " was based on a rather smug idea . Painted during the bombing of London , it was supposed to say , ' Thank God we can put our children to bed with a feeling of security , knowing they will not be killed in the night . ' "

 The models for the work were Jim Martin , Mrs. Edgar Lawrence ( Dorothy ) , and two children of Rockwell 's carpenter Walt Squires , all neighbors of Rockwell in Arlington , Vermont . At Rockwell 's request , the Bennington Banner produced a dummy edition to use for this work . Freedom from Fear was published in the March 13 , 1943 Issue of The Saturday Evening Post with a matching essay by Stephen Vincent Benét as part of the Four Freedoms series . Coincidentally , the day it was published , poet , novelist , and short @-@ story writer Benét died .

 This painting is the only one of the Four Freedoms which had been newly created prior to the commissioning of the series . It had originally been created to depict the Battle of Britain , but went unpublished by The Saturday Evening Post . The United States Department of the Treasury toured Rockwell 's Four Freedoms paintings around the country after their publication in 1943 . The Four Freedoms Tour raised over $ 130 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in war bond sales . Rockwell 's Four Freedoms paintings were also reproduced as commemorative covers for postage stamps sold during the War Bond shows .

 The scene has been described as overly intimate . Both the arrangement of the furniture and the lighting contribute to this intimacy . Deborah Solomon describes the scene as having " some of the feeling of a French interior , with lovely haut @-@ art touches . Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal stated " This reference to the war is so specific that it conveys little about fear or Roosevelt 's plan for universal disarmament . Rockwell just could not get his hands around these airy abstractions . "
