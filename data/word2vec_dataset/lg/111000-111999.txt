 = Siege of Sidney Street = 
 The Siege of Sidney Street of January 1911 , also known as the Battle of Stepney , was a gunfight in the East End of London between a combined police and army force and two Latvian revolutionaries . The siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in December 1910 , with an attempted jewellery robbery at Houndsditch in the City of London by a gang of immigrant Latvians which resulted in the murder of three policemen , the wounding of two others , and the death of George Gardstein , the leader of the Latvian gang . 
 An investigation by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein 's accomplices , most of whom were arrested within two weeks . The police were informed that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney . The police evacuated local residents from the environs , and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out . Armed with inferior weapons , the police sought assistance from the army . The siege lasted for about six hours . Towards the end of the stand @-@ off , the building caught fire ; no single cause has been identified . One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control . While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins — in which they found the two bodies — the building collapsed , killing one of the firemen , Superintendent Charles Pearson . 
 The siege marked the first time that the police had requested army assistance in London to deal with an armed stand @-@ off . It was also the first siege in Britain to be caught on camera , as the events were filmed by Pathé News . Some of the footage included images of the then Home Secretary , Winston Churchill . His presence caused a political row over the level of his operational involvement . At the subsequent trial in May 1911 of those arrested for the Houndsditch jewellery robbery , all but one of the accused were acquitted ; the sole conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal . The events were fictionalised in film — in The Man Who Knew Too Much ( 1934 ) and The Siege of Sidney Street ( 1960 ) — and novels . On the centenary of the events two tower blocks in Sidney Street were named after Peter the Painter , one of the minor members of the gang who was probably not present at either Houndsditch or Sidney Street . The murdered policemen and the fireman who died are commemorated by memorial plaques . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Immigration and demographics in London = = = 
 In the 19th century Tsarist Russia was home to about five million Jews , the largest Jewish community at the time . Subjected to religious persecution and violent pogroms , many emigrated and between 1875 and 1914 around 150 @,@ 000 arrived in the United Kingdom , mostly in England . The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants — mostly poor and semi @-@ skilled or unskilled — settled in the East End of London . The concentration of Jewish immigrants into some areas was almost 100 per cent of the population , and a study undertaken in 1900 showed that Houndsditch and Whitechapel were both identified as a " well @-@ defined intensely Jewish district " . 
 Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries , many of whom were unable to adapt to life in the politically less oppressive London . The social historian William J. Fishman writes that " the <unk> ( crazy ) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape " , although the terms " socialist " and " anarchist " had been conflated in the minds of the British press , who used the terms interchangeably to refer to those with revolutionary beliefs . A leading article in The Times described the Whitechapel area as one that " harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too hospitable shore . And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife . " 
 From the turn of the century , gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of <unk> and refugees from Odessa , and various revolutionary factions were active in the area . One event , the Tottenham Outrage of January 1909 , by two revolutionary Russians in London — Paul <unk> and Jacob Lepidus — was an attempt to rob a payroll van , which left two dead and twenty injured . The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia : the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities . 
 The influx of émigrés , and the rising rates of violent crime associated with it , led to popular concerns and comments in the press . The government passed the Aliens Act 1905 in an attempt to reduce immigration . The popular press reflected the opinions of many at the time ; a leading article in the Manchester Evening Chronicle supported the bill to bar " the dirty , destitute , diseased , verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil . " The journalist Robert Winder , in his examination of immigration into Britain , opines that the Act " gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant " . 
 = = = Latvian émigré gang = = = 
 By 1910 Russian émigrés met regularly at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street , Stepney . Many of its members were not anarchists , and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora , most of whom were Jewish . The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not anarchists — although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions . Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia . All had extreme left @-@ wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice . 
 The probable leader of the group was George Gardstein , whose real name was likely to have been <unk> or <unk> , although he used the aliases Garstin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Morin and Levi . Gardstein , who probably was an anarchist , had been accused of murder and acts of terrorism in Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London . Another member of the group , Jacob ( or Yakov ) Peters , had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker . He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of his fingernails . <unk> Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by Cossacks . Fritz Svaars was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences , but escaped each time . He had travelled through the United States , where he undertook a series of robberies , before arriving in London in June 1910 . 
 Another member was " Peter the Painter " , a nickname for an unknown figure , possibly named Peter <unk> ( or <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ) , or Janis <unk> . Bernard Porter , in a brief sketch in the Dictionary of National Biography , writes that no firm details are known of the anarchist 's background and that " None of the ... biographical ' facts ' about him ... is altogether reliable . " William ( or Joseph ) Sokoloff ( or Sokolow ) was a Latvian who had been arrested in Riga in 1905 for murder and robbery before travelling to London . Another of the group 's members was Karl Hoffman — whose real name was Alfred <unk> — who had been involved in revolutionary and criminal activities for several years , including gun @-@ running . In London he had practiced as a decorator . John Rosen — real name John Zelin or <unk> — came to London in 1909 from Riga and worked as a barber , while another member of the gang was Max Smoller , also known as Joe Levi and " <unk> the Jew " . He was wanted in his native Crimea for several jewel robberies . 
 = = = Policing in the capital = = = 
 Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839 , the capital was policed by two forces , the Metropolitan Police , who held sway over most of the capital , and the City of London Police , who were responsible for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries . The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service , and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force . Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary , who in 1911 was the 36 @-@ year @-@ old rising politician Winston Churchill . 
 While on the beat , or in the course of their normal duties , the officers of both the City of London and Metropolitan forces were provided with only with a short wooden truncheon for protection . When they faced armed opponents — as was the case in Sidney Street — the police were issued with Webley and Bull Dog revolvers , shotguns and small @-@ bore rifles fitted with .22 Morris @-@ tube barrels , the last of which were more commonly used on small indoor shooting galleries . 
 = = Houndsditch murders , December 1910 = = 
 At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller , using the name Joe Levi , visited Exchange Buildings , a small cul @-@ de @-@ sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch . He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings ; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month , saying he needed it for storage . The gang were unable to rent number 10 , which was directly behind their target , 119 Houndsditch , the jeweller 's shop owned by Mr H S Harris . The safe in the jeweller 's was reputed to contain between £ 20 @,@ 000 and £ 30 @,@ 000 worth of jewellery , although Harris 's son later stated the total was only around £ 7 @,@ 000 . Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment , including a 60 foot ( 18 @.@ 25 m ) length of India rubber gas hose , a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools , including diamond @-@ tipped drills . 
 With the exception of Gardstein , the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed . Bernard Porter , writing in the Dictionary of National Biography , considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and , in all likelihood , were two of those that shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary . Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night , while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present . Donald Rumbelow , a former policeman who wrote a history of the events , considers that those present consisted of Gardstein , Smoller , Peters and Dubof , with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day , which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars . Rumbelow considers a third group on standby , staying at Hoffman 's lodgings , to have comprised Hoffman , Rosen and Osip Federoff , an unemployed locksmith . Rumbelow also considers that present at the events — either as lookouts or in unknown capacities — were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva . 
 On 16 December , working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings , the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop ; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December . At around 10 : 00 that evening , returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch , Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour 's property . Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises . Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch , where he could hear the noise , which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further . At 11 : 00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings — the only property with a light on in the back . The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately . So as not to rouse the man 's concerns , Piper asked him " is the <unk> in ? " The man answered in broken English that she was out , and the policeman said he would return later . 
 Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul @-@ de @-@ sac . As the policeman approached him , the man walked away ; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 70 m ) , pale and fair @-@ haired . When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats — constables Woodhams and Choate — who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report . By 11 : 30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality , each armed with his wooden truncheon . Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11 , unaware that Piper had already done so , which alerted the gang . The door was answered by Gardstein , who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there . Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English ; Gardstein left the door half @-@ closed and disappeared inside . Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams ; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs , they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs . The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property , and he agreed . As Bentley moved forward , the back door opened and one of the gang exited , firing from a pistol as he did so ; the man on the stairs also began firing . Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck — the second round severing his spine . Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg , which broke his femur ; both collapsed . Although they survived , neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries . 
 As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul @-@ de @-@ sac , other police intervened . Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice , once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters : he died instantly . Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun , but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg . Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein 's assistance , shooting Choate twelve times in the process , but Gardstein was also wounded ; as the policeman collapsed , Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices , who included Peters . As these men , aided by an unknown woman , made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy , a passer @-@ by , whom they threatened at pistol @-@ point . He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details ; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman , and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends . The group , which included Peters , went to Svaars ' and Peter the Painter 's lodgings at 59 Grove Street ( now Goldring Street ) , off Commercial Road , where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang 's associates , Luba Milstein ( Svaars ' mistress ) and Sara Trassjonsky . As they left Gardstein on the bed , Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress , either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker , or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest . 
 Other policemen arrived in Houndsditch , and began to attend to the wounded . Tucker 's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital ( now the Royal London Hospital ) in Whitechapel Road . Choate was also taken there , where he was operated on , but he died at 5 : 30 am on 17 December . Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew 's Hospital . He was half @-@ conscious on arrival , but recovered enough to be able to have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events . At 6 : 45 pm on 17 December his condition worsened , and he died at 7 : 30 . The killings of Tucker , Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime . 
 = = Investigation , 17 December 1910 – 2 January 1911 = = 
 The City of London police informed the Metropolitan force , as their protocol demanded , and both services issued revolvers to the detectives involved in the search . The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search . There was a lack of foreign language skills in the police , who did not have any Russian , Latvian or Yiddish speakers on the force . 
 In the early hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became increasingly concerned as Gardstein 's condition worsened , and they sent for a local doctor , explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend . The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest — it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart . The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital , but he refused ; with no other course open to him , the doctor sold them pain medication and left . The Russian was dead by 9 : 00am that morning . The doctor returned at 11 : 00 am and found the body . He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before , and so reported the death to the coroner , not the police . At mid @-@ day the coroner reported the death to the local police who , led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley , went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse . Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered , and she was soon found by the police , hastily burning papers ; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry . Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End , particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area . Wensley , who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area , subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation . 
 Gardstein 's body was removed to a local mortuary where his face was cleaned , his hair brushed , his eyes opened and his photograph taken . The picture , and descriptions of those who had helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings , were distributed on posters in English and Russian , asking locals for information . About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End , spreading details of those they were looking for . A local landlord , Isaac Gordon , reported one of his lodgers , Nina Vassilleva , after she had told him she had been one of the people living at Exchange Buildings . Wensley questioned the woman , finding anarchist publications in her rooms , along with a photograph of Gardstein . Information began to come in from the public and the group 's associates : on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home , and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured . 
 On 22 December a public memorial service took place for Tucker , Bentley and Choate at St Paul 's Cathedral . King George V was represented by Edward Wallington , his Groom in Waiting ; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London . The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings . An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul 's environs , and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect ; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street . After the service , when the coffins were being transported on an eight @-@ mile ( 13 km ) journey to the cemeteries , it was estimated that 750 @,@ 000 people lined the route , many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed . 
 Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December . Isaac Levy , who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings , identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein . It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events . The following day Federoff , Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected to the murder of the three policemen , and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop . All three pleaded not guilty . 
 On 27 December the poster bearing Gardstein 's picture was seen by his landlord , who alerted police . Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street , Stepney and found knives , a gun , ammunition , false passports and revolutionary publications . Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court . In addition to Federoff , Peters and Dubof , present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky . With some of the defendants having a low standard of English , interpreters were used throughout the proceedings . At the end of the day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911 . 
 On New Year 's Day 1911 the body of Léon <unk> , a Russian Jewish immigrant , was found on Clapham Common in South London . He had been badly beaten and two S @-@ shaped cuts , both two inches long , were on his cheeks . The case became connected in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street , although the evidence at the time for the link was scant . The historian F G Clarke , in his history of the events , located information from another Latvian who stated that <unk> had been killed not because he was one of the informers who had passed on information , but because he was planning to pass the information on , and the act was a pre @-@ emptive one , designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists . 
 The posters of Gardstein proved effective , and late on New Year 's Day a member of the public came forward to provide information about Svaars and Sokoloff . The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street , along with a lodger , Betty Gershon , who was Sokoloff 's mistress . The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present . A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps . Wensley , high @-@ ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott @-@ Bower , the Commissioner of the City Police , were present . 
 = = Events of 3 January = = 
 Just after midnight on 3 January , 200 police officers from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street . Armed officers were placed at number 111 , directly opposite number 100 , and throughout the night the residents of the houses on the block were roused and evacuated . Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon , claiming that she was needed by her sick husband . When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters ; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated . Number 100 was now empty of all residents , apart from Svaars and Sokoloff , neither of whom seemed to be aware of the evacuation . 
 The police 's operating procedure — and the law which governed their actions — meant they were unable to open fire without being fired upon first . This , along with the structure of the building , with a narrow , winding stairwell up which police would have to pass , meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt . It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action . At about 7 : 30 am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100 , which elicited no response ; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men . Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police . A police sergeant was wounded in the chest : he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops , and taken to the London Hospital . Some members of the police returned fire , but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges , and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff . 
 By 9 : 00 am it was apparent that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition . The police officers in charge on the scene , Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark , contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard . He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards , who were stationed at the Tower of London . It was the first time that the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege . Twenty @-@ one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10 : 00 am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite . The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage . 
 Churchill arrived on the scene at 11 : 50 am to observe the incident at first hand ; he later reported that he thought the crowd were unwelcoming to him , as he heard people asking " Oo let ' em in ? " , in reference to the Liberal Party 's immigration policy that had allowed the influx from Russia . Churchill 's role during the siege is unclear . His biographers , Paul Addison and Roy Jenkins , both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police , although a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were " a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions " . In a subsequent letter to The Times , Churchill clarified his role while he was present : 
 I did not interfere in any way with the dispositions made by the police authorities on the spot . I never overruled those authorities nor overrode them . From beginning to end the police had an absolutely free hand . ... I did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers . I was not consulted as to whether they should be sent for . 
 Shooting between the two sides reached a peak between 12 : 00 and 12 : 30 pm , but at 12 : 50 smoke was seen coming from the building 's chimneys and from the second floor windows ; it has not been established how the fire was started , whether by accident or design . The fire slowly spread , and by 1 : 30 it had taken a firm hold and had spread to the other floors . A second detachment of Scots Guards arrived , bringing with them a Maxim machine gun , which was never used . Shortly afterwards Sokoloff put his head out of the window ; he was shot by one of the soldiers and he fell back inside . The senior officer of the London Fire Brigade present on the scene sought permission to extinguish the blaze , but was refused . He approached Churchill in order to have the decision overturned , but the Home Secretary approved the police decision . Churchill later wrote : 
 I now intervened to settle this dispute , at one moment quite heated . I told the fire brigade officer on my authority as Home Secretary that the house was to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading . 
 By 2 : 30 pm the shooting from the house had ceased . One of the detectives present walked close to the wall and pushed the door open , before retreating . Others police officers , and some of the soldiers , came out and waited for the men to exit . None did , and as part of the roof collapsed , it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead ; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire . At 2 : 40 Churchill left the scene , at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13 @-@ pounder field artillery pieces . When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames , they soon located Sokoloff 's body , which was extracted . A wall collapsed on a group of five firemen , who were all taken to the London Hospital . One of the men , Superintendent Charles Pearson , had a fractured spine ; he died six months after the siege as a result of his injuries . After shoring up the building , the firemen resumed their search of the premises . At around 6 : 30 pm the second body — that of Svaars — was found ; it was taken to the mortuary . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The siege was captured by Pathé News cameras — one of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film — and it included footage of Churchill in attendance . When the newsreels were screened in cinemas , Churchill was booed with shouts of " shoot him " from audiences . His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition , Arthur Balfour , remarked , " He [ Churchill ] was , I understand , in military phrase , in what is known as the zone of fire — he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives . I understand what the photographer was doing , but what was the right hon . Gentleman doing ? That I neither understood at the time , nor do I understand now . " Jenkins suggests that he went simply because " he could not resist going to see the fun himself " . 
 An inquest was held in January into the deaths at Houndsditch and Sidney Street . The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the conclusion that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff , and that Tucker , Bentley and Choate had been murdered by Gardstein and others in the course of the burglary attempt . Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street , Hackney , and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February . The committal proceedings spread from December 1910 — with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing — to March 1911 , and included Hoffman from 15 February . The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings . In February Milstein was discharged on the basis there was insufficient evidence against her ; Hoffman , Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis . The case against the four remaining arrested gang members was heard at the Old Bailey by Mr Justice Grantham in May . Dubof and Peters were accused with Tucker 's murder , Dubof , Peters , Rosen and Vassilleva were charged with " feloniously harbouring a felon guilty of murder " , and for " conspiring and agreeing together and with others unknown to break and enter the shop of Henry Samuel Harris with intent to steal his goods . " The case lasted for eleven days ; there were problems with the proceedings because of the language difficulties and the chaotic personal lives of the accused . The case resulted in acquittals for all except Vassilleva , who was convicted of conspiracy in the burglary . She was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment , although her conviction was later overturned on appeal . 
 After the high levels of criticism aimed at the Aliens Act , Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation , and proposed the Aliens ( Prevention of Crime ) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule . The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected , and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard @-@ line measures " You know as well as I do that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions . " The bill did not become law . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The inadequacy of the police 's firepower led to criticism in the press , and on 12 January 1911 several alternative weapons were tested . The trials resulted in the decision by the Metropolitan Police to replace the Webley revolver with the Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi @-@ automatic pistol later that year ; the City of London Police followed suit with the same choice in 1912 . 
 The members of the group dispersed after the events . Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again . It was assumed he left the country , and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards , although none were confirmed . Jacob Peters returned to Russia , rose to be deputy head of the Cheka , the Soviet secret police , and was executed in Joseph Stalin 's 1938 purge . Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum . Her eventual fate and date of death are not known . Dubof , Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records , although Vassilleva remained living in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963 . Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris , after which he disappeared ; Milstein later emigrated to live in the United States . 
 The siege was the inspiration for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock 's original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much , while the whole story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street . The siege has also been the fictional inspiration for two novels , The Siege of Sidney Street ( 1960 ) by F <unk> and A Death Out of Season ( 1973 ) by Emanuel <unk> . 
 In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street , Peter House and Painter House , even though Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events , and was not present at the siege . The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an " anti @-@ hero " . The decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation , although a council spokesman said that " There is no evidence that Peter the Painter killed the three policemen , so we knew we were not naming the block after a murderer . ... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street . " In December 2010 , on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch , a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location . Three weeks later , on the anniversary of the siege , a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson , the fireman who died as the building collapsed on him . 
 = Delaware Route 41 = 
 Delaware Route 41 ( DE 41 ) is a highway in northwestern New Castle County , Delaware . Its southern terminus is at DE 2 and DE 62 in Prices Corner . From DE 2 , the road passes through suburban areas along Newport Gap Pike , intersecting DE 34 in Brandywine Springs and DE 48 in Hockessin . Its northern terminus is the Pennsylvania state line just north of Hockessin , and it continues on as Pennsylvania Route 41 ( PA 41 ) to Gap . 
 DE 41 was originally chartered as the Gap and Newport Turnpike in the 19th century . In the 1920s and 1930s , this road was upgraded to a state highway . DE 41 was designated by 1936 to run from U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 , now DE 9 / DE 273 ) in New Castle north to the Pennsylvania border in Hockessin . In the 1950s , DE 141 became concurrent with the route from New Castle to north of Newport . DE 41 was removed from the DE 141 concurrency in the 1970s and was realigned to follow DE 2 east to an interchange with DE 141 in the 1980s , with the old alignment south of DE 2 becoming DE 62 . In 2015 , the southern terminus was cut back to its current location , removing the concurrency with DE 2 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 DE 41 begins at an intersection with DE 2 in Prices Corner , heading northwest along Newport Gap Pike . South of DE 2 , Newport Gap Pike continues southeast as DE 62 . DE 41 is a two @-@ lane divided highway before it crosses the Wilmington and Western Railroad and the Red Clay Creek . The route becomes an undivided road and continues through a mix of residential neighborhoods and woodland . The road comes to an intersection with DE 34 ( Faulkland Road ) in Brandywine Springs . Past this junction , DE 41 continues northwest , with stretches alternating between divided and undivided highway , towards Hockessin . 
 In Hockessin , DE 41 meets the western terminus of DE 48 ( Lancaster Pike ) , onto which it merges . The Lancaster Pike alternates between a divided highway and a two @-@ lane undivided road . DE 41 turns to the west @-@ northwest and passes to the northeast of the Sanford School <unk> it enters business areas and becomes a three @-@ lane divided highway with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes . The median turns into a center left @-@ turn lane as the road runs past more development and crosses the Wilmington and Western Railroad again . The southbound direction narrows to one lane at the Yorklyn Road intersection . The road briefly becomes a divided highway at the Valley Road junction . After leaving the center of Hockessin , the route becomes a three @-@ lane undivided road , with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane . The road passes homes , eventually narrowing back to two lanes . DE 41 reaches the Pennsylvania border , where Gap Newport Pike continues northwest as PA 41 . 
 DE 41 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 20 @,@ 665 vehicles at the Yorklyn Road intersection to a low of 12 @,@ 611 vehicles at the <unk> Church Road intersection . The entire length of DE 41 is part of the National Highway System . 
 = = History = = 
 What is now DE 41 was originally chartered as the Gap and Newport Turnpike on January 30 , 1808 , an extension of the 1807 @-@ chartered turnpike in Pennsylvania that was to run from Gap , Pennsylvania southeast to Newport , Delaware . By 1920 , this road was maintained by the county . The road north of Lancaster Pike was proposed as a state highway four years later . A year later , a state highway was completed on what would become DE 41 between New Castle and Prices Corner . Plans were underway in 1927 to replace the outdated swing bridge over the Christina River in Newport . Contracts for this project were awarded the following year . The replacement bridge over the Christina River , a bascule bridge , opened on December 1 , 1929 . In 1927 , plans were made to replace the grade crossing at the Pennsylvania Railroad line ( now Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor ) in Newport with an underpass under the tracks . Work on this underpass began in 1929 . The crossing under the Pennsylvania Railroad was finished and opened to traffic in June 1930 . In 1929 , the Gap Road was upgraded to a state highway . 
 DE 41 was designated to run from US 40 ( now DE 9 / DE 273 ) in New Castle north to PA 41 at the Pennsylvania border in Hockessin by 1936 . It followed Basin Road north to Newport , James Street through Newport , and the Newport Gap Pike north of there . By 1952 , DE 141 was designated to run concurrent with DE 41 from New Castle to north of Newport . In 1954 , plans were made to replace the intersection with US 13 / US 40 in Basin Corner with a modified cloverleaf interchange in an effort to reduce traffic congestion . Construction on the interchange began in September of that year . The interchange between US 13 / US 40 and DE 41 / DE 141 was completed in 1956 . 
 In April 1954 , work began to improve DE 41 between the DE 48 intersection and the Pennsylvania border . These improvements constructed a bypass of Hockessin and added truck lanes on steep grades . This project was scheduled for completion in July 1955 . The new northbound lanes of DE 41 / DE 141 through the I @-@ 95 interchange opened in November 1962 , at which point construction on the southbound lanes began . The southbound lanes of DE 41 / DE 141 opened in June 1964 , enabling directional flow of DE 41 / DE 141 through the interchange . 
 The southern terminus of DE 41 was truncated to DE 141 north of Newport by 1971 , eliminating the concurrency with that route . By 1981 , DE 41 was realigned to follow DE 2 to end at an interchange with DE 141 , with DE 62 being designated along the former DE 41 south of DE 2 . In 2015 , the Delaware Department of Transportation proposed cutting back the southern terminus of DE 41 from the interchange with DE 141 to the intersection with DE 2 and Newport Gap Pike , eliminating the concurrency with DE 2 . This change was made in order to reduce sign clutter and also reduce truck traffic along the southern portion of DE 41 . A public workshop on the proposal was held and changes were made in summer 2015 .

 " In Marge We Trust " is the twenty @-@ second episode of The Simpsons ' eighth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 27 , 1997 . It was written by Donick Cary and directed by Steven Dean Moore . The episode guest stars Sab Shimono as Mr. Sparkle , Gedde Watanabe as the factory worker , Denice Kumagai and Karen Maruyama as dancers , and Frank Welker as the baboons . In the episode , Marge replaces Reverend Lovejoy as the town 's moral adviser while Homer explores the mystery of why his face appears on a Japanese @-@ language detergent box . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Reverend Lovejoy 's sermon on " constancy " almost sends the entire congregation to sleep . After church Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield dump to dispose of their old Christmas tree , where they find a box of Japanese dishwasher detergent known as Mr. Sparkle . The face of the character on the box of the detergent strongly resembles Homer . Meanwhile , Marge becomes concerned with Lovejoy 's lack of enthusiasm about helping people . He explains to Marge that he was enthusiastic about the ministry and helping his fellow man when he first arrived in Springfield . However , his passion for helping people gradually degraded as he dealt with Ned Flanders and his constant complaints over trivial and common issues . Marge begins working for the Church as " The Listen Lady " , listening to people 's problems and helping solve them . Reverend Lovejoy soon realizes his inadequacy and begins to feel depressed . While he is alone in the church the stained glass images of saints appear and chastise him for doing little to inspire his congregation . 
 Homer , disturbed by the box of Mr. Sparkle , contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaidō , Japan for information . He is sent a promotional video for Mr. Sparkle , which consists of a TV commercial . At the end of the video , the mascot is shown to be a result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates , Matsumura <unk> and <unk> Heavy Manufacturing Concern . Their mascots , a smiling anime fish and light bulb , merge to form Mr. Sparkle . Thus , Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence . 
 Ned Flanders calls Marge for help . Jimbo , Dolph , and Kearney are hanging around outside the Leftorium , making Ned worried that they will start causing trouble . Marge suggests that he shoo them away . The trio are about to leave , but when he goes and asks them to , they decide to harass him instead . Ned calls Marge again , whilst he is standing on a chair with the three boys circling him on their <unk> , so she suggests that he " lay down the law " , and when one of the boys snips the phone cord , Marge assumes that Ned has hung up and that everything is fine . 
 The next morning , Maude informs Marge that Ned is missing , having been chased around by the boys throughout the night . Marge realizes that she may be partially responsible for his disappearance . Marge goes to Reverend Lovejoy for help , and the two of them track Ned to the zoo , where Japanese tourists think Homer is Mr. Sparkle . Jimbo , Dolph , and Kearney have abandoned their pursuit , but now Ned is trapped in the baboon exhibit . While the Simpson family looks on , Reverend Lovejoy rescues Ned in the baboons ' food cart . Now that he feels useful again , Reverend Lovejoy rediscovers his passion for his job , regaling his congregation with the tale of Ned 's rescue . 
 = = Production = = 
 By season 8 , the show had begun to explore episodes revolving around secondary characters . Reverend Lovejoy was selected for this episode because , aside from being noted as " the priest who didn 't care " , he had not had much character development . This was the first episode that Donick Cary wrote for The Simpsons . He was disappointed that his first story was about " Marge 's crisis with faith . " The trip to the dump was inspired by Donick Cary 's youth , in which he would often go " dump picking " . This led to the writers deciding to have Homer 's face on a discarded box , which became the Mr. Sparkle subplot . To help create the advertisement , the writers watched videos of many Japanese commercials . An original scene from Lovejoy 's flashback showed that Jasper Beardley preceded him as minister of the First Church of Springfield . The solution for how Mr. Sparkle resembles Homer was written by George Meyer , after hours of time had been spent trying to come up with a realistic ending . Matsumura <unk> was named after Ichiro Matsumura , a friend of David X. Cohen . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original broadcast , " In Marge We Trust " finished 25th in ratings for the week of April 21 – 27 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately 9 @.@ 8 million viewing households . It was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files and King of the Hill . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , said : " A rare case of both storylines being worthy of full episodes in their own right , this is a cracking episode which highlights the unduly neglected Rev. Lovejoy and makes you realize Homer isn 't the only one ready to kill Ned Flanders ! Great stuff . " In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly article , Matt Groening ranked it as his fifth favorite in the history of the show . Josh Weinstein described it as one of the best of the season , as well as being one of the most underrated episodes of all time . He also described the Mr. Sparkle commercial as his all @-@ time favorite sequence . The fake Fruity <unk> Bar commercial from the film Serenity was partially inspired by the Mr. Sparkle advertisement . Since 2009 , the show 's new opening sequence includes Mr. Sparkle detergent with Marge 's supermarket purchases .

 George Howard Brett ( 7 February 1886 – 2 December 1963 ) was a United States Army Air Forces General during World War II . An Early Bird of Aviation , Brett served as a staff officer in World War I. In 1941 , following the outbreak of war with Japan , Brett was appointed Deputy Commander of a short @-@ lived major Allied command , the American @-@ British @-@ Dutch @-@ Australian Command ( ABDACOM ) , which oversaw Allied forces in South East Asia and the South West Pacific . In early 1942 , he was put in charge of United States Army Forces in Australia , until the arrival of Douglas MacArthur . Brett then commanded all Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area . In November 1942 , he was appointed commander of the US Caribbean Defense Command and remained in this post for the rest of the war . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George Howard Brett was born in Cleveland , Ohio on 7 February 1886 , the second of five children of William Howard Brett , a notable librarian , and his wife Alice née Allen . George 's older brother Morgan graduated with the United States Military Academy at West Point class of 1906 , and served for many years as an ordnance officer , retiring in 1932 as a colonel . The family was unable to secure a second West Point appointment , so George Brett graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1909 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Philippine Scouts on 22 March 1910 . While in the Philippines he transferred to the US Cavalry on 10 August 1911 , joining the 2nd Cavalry . 
 Brett returned to the United States in May 1912 and was first stationed at Fort Bliss . In December 1913 , he moved to Fort Ethan Allen where he became friends with a fellow lieutenant of the 2nd Cavalry , Frank M. Andrews , who was engaged to the daughter of Brigadier General James Allen . While serving as one of Andrews ' groomsmen , Brett met Mary Devol , one of the bridesmaids , and the daughter of another Army officer , Major General Carroll A. Devol . Brett married Mary Devol in Denver on 1 March 1916 . Influenced by Allen and Andrews , Brett transferred to the Aviation Section , U.S. Signal Corps on 2 September 1916 . He attended aviation school and on graduation in 1916 was assigned to the office of the Chief Signal Officer in Washington , D.C. where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916 and captain on 15 May 1917 .

 Brett departed for the Western Front in November 1917 but suffered a case of appendicitis , resulting in the loss of his flight status . After making a partial recovery , he served in France as senior materiel officer under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell , attaining the temporary rank of major on 7 June 1918 . After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington , D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918 , Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at <unk> .

 Brett was posted to Kelly Field , Texas , in December 1918 , where he commanded the Aviation General Supply Depot until February 1919 , when he became the maintenance and supply officer at the Air Service Flying School . He commanded the Air Service depot in Morrison , Virginia for a month in October 1919 before being assigned to the office of the Director of the Air Service in Washington , DC , where his rank of major became permanent in 1920 . That year he took command of Crissy Field . His first son , the future United States Air Force Lieutenant General Devol " Rock " Brett , was born at nearby Letterman Army Hospital at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1923 . 
 From 1924 to 1927 Brett was stationed at the intermediate depot at Fairfield , Ohio , where he was the officer in charge of the field service section . Starting in June 1927 he attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field , Virginia , after which he was selected for the two @-@ year Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas . He commanded Selfridge Field , Michigan for time before returned to Fort Leavenworth as an Air Corps instructor from 1933 to 1935 . After 16 years as a major , he was finally promoted to lieutenant colonel and was selected to attend the Army War College . On graduation , he became commander of the 19th Wing , then stationed in the Panama Canal Zone , with the temporary rank of brigadier general . While he was stationed there , his eldest daughter Dora married his aide , the future general , Bernard A. Schriever . 
 On his return from Panama , Brett reverted to his permanent rank of lieutenant colonel . He was briefly stationed in Menlo Park , California , before moving to Langley , Virginia , where he became chief of staff to his old friend Frank Andrews , now the commander of GHQ Air Force . In February 1939 Brett moved to Wright Field as assistant to the chief of the United States Army Air Corps , also serving as commandant of the Air Corps Engineering School and the chief of the Materiel Division . Once again he held the rank of brigadier general before being promoted to major general on 1 October 1940 .

 When his immediate superior , Major General Henry H. " Hap " Arnold , was temporarily transferred to the Army General Staff in November 1939 , Brett acted as Chief of the Air Corps . In May 1941 , he formally became Chief of the Air Corps for a four @-@ year term , but the June 1941 reorganisation that made Arnold the Chief of United States Army Air Forces made the post of Chief of the Air Corps somewhat redundant . Brett was sent to the United Kingdom to determine how the Army Air Forces could better support Royal Air Force Lend @-@ Lease requirements . His recommendation that American labor and facilities be established in the United Kingdom to handle the repair , assembly , and equipping of American aircraft created a stir on both sides of the Atlantic , and was ultimately disapproved by Arnold on the grounds that the personnel and equipment were not available . Brett next paid a visit to the Middle East where his outspoken criticism of arrangements there antagonised his hosts to the extent that the British Ambassador to Egypt , Sir Miles Lampson , complained about him to the Foreign Secretary , Sir Anthony Eden . Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder noted that " the charms of General Brett ’ s company were beginning to pall . After a talk with him on the afternoon of 25 September I wondered in my journal how he and all the American visitors could lay down the law about things of which they knew next to nothing . " As a result , Brett was ordered to return to the United States in December .

 The outbreak of war between the United States and Japan in December 1941 changed things and Brett received new orders . He first flew to Rangoon and then , in the company of the Sir Archibald Wavell , the British Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , India , on to Chungking where the two met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek . They obtained a promise of Chinese troops to assist in the defence of Burma . Near Rangoon , Wavell 's and Brett ’ s aircraft was attacked by Japanese aircraft and they were forced to make an emergency landing at a friendly aerodrome in Burma . The area was then bombed by the Japanese , but neither general was harmed . Brett was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the American @-@ British @-@ Dutch @-@ Australian Command ( ABDA ) , under Wavell , on 1 January 1942 , and was promoted to lieutenant general on 7 January 1942 . He arrived in Darwin on 28 December 1941 . In January he moved to <unk> in West Java , where Wavell established his headquarters . The rapid advance of Japanese forces through South East Asia had soon split the Allied @-@ controlled area in two . Brett departed Java for Australia on 23 February 1942 , reaching Melbourne the next day , where he resumed command of US Army Forces in Australia . ABDA was formally dissolved on 25 February . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 Already , General Douglas MacArthur had also been ordered to Australia . Brett received warning from the Chief of Staff , General George Marshall that MacArthur would call on him to send a flight of long @-@ range bombers to Mindanao . The only aircraft that Brett could find were B @-@ 17s of the 19th Bombardment Group which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaigns . Brett approached Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary , the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area , to ask for a loan of some of twelve newly arrived navy B @-@ 17s . Leary refused . Brett therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group 's old planes . Only one , a B @-@ 17 with no brakes piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease , made it to Mindanao ; two turned back with engine trouble , while a fourth ditched in the sea , its crew managing to escape . MacArthur was incensed and sent a message to Marshall . A message from Washington , D.C. persuaded Leary to release four new B @-@ 17s to Brett and these aircraft reached Mindanao on 16 March 1942 and managed to bring MacArthur and his party to Australia . Despite the lack of brakes , Pease also made it back , carrying sixteen refugees . 
 It fell to Brett to telephone Prime Minister John Curtin and inform him of MacArthur 's arrival . Although Curtin was unaware of MacArthur 's impending arrival , and had expected that Brett would command American forces in Australia , he was persuaded to issue a recommendation that MacArthur be made Supreme Commander South West Pacific Area . While Brett considered that he was on " very friendly terms " with Curtin , Brett felt that Curtin was " more interested in keeping the party line on wages , hours and working conditions than in the threat posed by the Japanese . " General George Kenney later recalled that 
 I think he [ Brett ] made his initial mistake in sort of spurning this Labor government crowd and taking up with the conservative crowd , who had been ousted by the Labor Party and who were not going to get back into power . But Brett figured they were , so he accepted entertainment from them and entertained them in return and became quite close to them . They , in turn , <unk> him along and told him they knew he was going to be the commanding general of all the Allied Forces in Australia ... Yes , and he believed it , which was too bad . 
 The April 1942 reorganisation that established the Southwest Pacific Area reduced the United States Army Forces in Australia to a supply and administrative organisation that would soon be renamed the Services of Supply . Brett instead became commander of Allied Air Forces , Southwest Pacific Area , with his headquarters in Melbourne . One of MacArthur 's first orders to Brett was for a bombing mission to the Philippines , an order which was delivered personally by MacArthur 's chief of staff , Major General Richard K. Sutherland . Brett protested that his planes were worn out , his men were tired , losses might be high , and the Philippines were lost anyway . Sutherland told him the MacArthur wanted the mission carried out . Brett delegated it to Brigadier General Ralph Royce , who led the mission in person . Brett awarded Royce the Distinguished Service Cross . Henceforth , communications with Sutherland would be handled by Brett 's chief of staff , Air Vice Marshal William Bostock . MacArthur personally wrote a reprimand to Brett . Further disagreements between MacArthur and Brett followed . On 6 July 1942 Marshall radioed MacArthur to offer him Major General George Kenney or Brigadier General Jimmy Doolittle as a replacement for Brett . MacArthur selected Kenney . Brett returned to the United States in his B @-@ 17 , " The <unk> " , on 4 August 1942 . The day before , General MacArthur awarded him the Silver Star " for gallantry in action in air reconnaissance in the combat zone , Southwest Pacific Area , during the months of May , June and July 1942 .

 After a time with no command , Brett was appointed commander of the US Caribbean Defense Command and the US Army 's Panama Canal Department in succession to Lieutenant General Frank M. Andrews in November 1942 . In 1945 , the Inspector General , Lieutenant General Daniel Isom Sultan , investigated a series of allegations against Brett regarding the misuse of Army funds and property . He reported to the General Marshall that most of the charges were distortions of mission @-@ related events and expenditures , that the remaining allegations had no basis in fact , and that no further action be taken . Brett requested voluntary retirement and retired on 30 April 1945 with the rank of major general , only to be immediately recalled to active duty the next day as a temporary lieutenant general and as Commanding General of the Caribbean Defense Command and Panama Canal Department . On 10 October 1945 , Brett handed over command to Lieutenant General Willis D. <unk> . For his service in Panama , Brett was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal . The citation noted " his broad grasp of military strategy and superior knowledge of air and ground tactics " and that " he succeeded admirably in impressing the republics of Central and South America with the importance and necessity of hemispheric solidarity , imbued them with American ideals , coordinated their use of arms and equipment and indoctrinated them with American training methods — all of which fostered continued improvement in the relations between all America republics . " After spending time as a patient in Brooke General Hospital , he reverted to retired status on 10 May 1946 but was later advanced to the grade of lieutenant general on the United States Air Force retired list by an Act of Congress on 29 June 1948 .

 = Pale crag martin = 
 The pale crag martin ( Ptyonoprogne obsoleta ) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family that is resident in northern Africa and in southwestern Asia east to Pakistan . It breeds mainly in the mountains , but also at lower altitudes , especially in rocky areas and around towns . Unlike most swallows , it is often found far from water . It is 12 – 13 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 1 in ) long , with mainly brown plumage , paler @-@ toned on the upper breast and underwing coverts , and with white " windows " on the spread tail in flight . The sexes are similar in appearance , but juveniles have pale fringes to the upperparts and flight feathers . It was formerly considered to be the northern subspecies of the rock martin of southern Africa , although it is smaller , paler , and whiter @-@ throated than that species . The pale crag martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a slow flight with much gliding . Its call is a soft twitter . 
 This martin builds a deep bowl nest on a sheltered horizontal surface , or a neat quarter @-@ sphere against a vertical rock face or wall . The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers , and may be built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man @-@ made structures such as buildings and bridges . It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years . This species is often a solitary breeder , but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations . The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches , and are incubated by both adults for 16 – 19 days prior to hatching . Both parents then feed the chicks . Fledging takes another 22 – 24 days , although the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight . 
 The pale crag martin is caught in flight by several fast , agile falcon species , such as hobbies , and it sometimes carries parasites , but it faces no major threats . Because of its range of nearly 6 million km2 ( 2 @.@ 3 million sq mi ) and a large and apparently increasing population , it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The pale crag martin was first formally described in 1850 by German ornithologist Jean Cabanis as <unk> obsoleta , using a specimen collected from near Cairo , Egypt . It was moved to the new genus Ptyonoprogne , created by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach , in the same year . The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek ptuon ( φτυον ) , " a fan " , referring to the shape of the opened tail , and Procne ( Πρόκνη ) , a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow . The specific name obsoleta means " worn " in Latin . 
 The Ptyonoprogne species are members of the swallow family of birds , and are classed as members of the Hirundininae subfamily , which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . These groups are the " core martins " , including burrowing species like the sand martin ; the " nest @-@ adopters " , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities ; and the " mud nest builders " . The Ptyonoprogne species construct open mud nests and therefore belong to the last group . Hirundo species also build open nests , Delichon house martins have a closed nest , and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows have retort @-@ like closed nests with an entrance tunnel . 
 The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo , and is sometimes included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resemble those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow . However , a DNA analysis showed that if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag martins , it should include all the mud @-@ builder genera . Conversely , if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus , as is normally the case , Cecropis , Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off . The pale crag martin 's nearest relatives are the other members of the genus , the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia , the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa , and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris . 
 The pale crag martin was formerly often treated as the small , pale northern subspecies of the rock martin , but it is now usually considered to be a separate species . The changes in size and colour are continuous , so the evidence for separate species is not strong , although some rock martins can weigh more than twice as much as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin . The average weight for P. o. fusciventris is 22 @.@ 4 g ( 0 @.@ 79 oz ) against 10 g ( 0 @.@ 35 oz ) for P. o. obsoleta . There do not appear to be any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia . 
 In areas of Pakistan where its range overlaps with that of the dusky crag martin , the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude . Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin , which is found high in the Himalayas , but where both occur in Iran , the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats . In North Africa , the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level . The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise . If they were shown to do so , it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are several subspecies differing in plumage shade or size , although the differences are clinal , and races interbreed where their ranges meet . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pale crag martin of the nominate subspecies P. o. obsoleta is 12 – 13 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 1 in ) long with light brown upperparts , becoming paler on the lower back , and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers . It has a pale grey throat , upper breast and underwing coverts , and the rest of the underparts are a dirty white . The eyes are brown , the small bill is mainly black , and the legs are brownish @-@ pink . The wing length averages 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 4 @.@ 55 in ) and the tail averages 4 @.@ 8 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) . The sexes are similar in appearance , but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers . The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed in the table above . 
 This martin moults early , with adults having completely replaced their feathers by late August . Juveniles moult somewhat later , and their old primary feathers are retained even when the body has mainly adult plumage . 
 The pale crag martin 's flight is slow , with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat @-@ winged glides , and it is more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin . It is a quiet bird ; the song is a muffled twitter , and other calls include a trrt resembling the call of the common house martin , a nasal <unk> , and a high pitched twee contact call . 
 The pale crag martin is much drabber than most African swallows , and confusion is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins of the genus Riparia . It is 15 % smaller , paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin , and has smaller tail spots . It is smaller , paler , and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin . In the far east of its range , the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin . Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown @-@ throated sand martin , the pale crag martin is more robust , has white tail spots , and lacks a breast band . Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light , particularly with juveniles . The fast flight of the brown @-@ throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The pale crag martin breeds in suitable habitats throughout northern Africa and through the Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan . It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding . In addition , there is some short @-@ range movement , including martins from southern Arabia crossing the Red Sea and wintering alongside the local breeding birds in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa , and non @-@ breeding P. f. <unk> and P. f. <unk> joining rock martins in Mali and Mauritania . In Pakistan , the breeding range of the subspecies P. f. <unk> overlaps with that of the dusky crag martin , although that species breeds at much lower levels , and in North Africa P. f. obsoleta occupies desert habitats whilst the Eurasian crag martin is found in the mountains . The pale crag martin has been recorded as a vagrant in Bahrain , Qatar , Kuwait , and Sri Lanka , although its occurrence in the last country is treated as unproven in a 2011 field guide . The martin has been claimed to visit Turkey , but this is also disputed . 
 The natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs , gorges and caves up to 3 @,@ 700 m ( 12 @,@ 000 ft ) above sea level , but this martin also breeds in lowlands , especially if rocks or buildings are available , and may be found far from water . This species readily uses man @-@ made structures as a substitute for natural precipices , and has bred on houses in southern Israel since the 1970s . In Egypt it may breed near monuments like Abu Simbel or in desert towns such as Aswan . It uses towns , bridges and cliffs in Ethiopia , and tower blocks in Arabia . In the breeding season , the martin needs mud or wet soil to construct its nests , and this is normally readily found near human habitations . This species appears to be scarce in some forested and coastal areas with high humidity , in which the red @-@ rumped swallow tends to be the common hirundine . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Pale crag martin pairs often nest alone , especially in the Sahara , although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form . This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against conspecifics and other species . In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions , but in northwest Africa February to April is normal , and in Asia nesting is from April to June . Two broods are common , and three have been raised in a season . 
 The nest , built by both adults over several weeks , is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with feathers and soft , dry grass , hair , sheep ’ s wool or plant down . It may be a half @-@ cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff , or shaped as a bowl like that of the barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge . The nest may be built on a rock cliff face , in a crevice or on a man @-@ made structure , and is re @-@ used for the second brood and in subsequent years . Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia , and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins , red @-@ rumped swallows , and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines ' nests . In buildings , nests are usually constructed against concrete , which provides adhesion similar to that of rock , but metal walls are sometimes used , and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports . Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings , and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen . Artificial nests are readily used , and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi . 
 The clutch is usually two or three buff @-@ white eggs blotched with sepia or grey @-@ brown , particularly at the wide end . The average egg size for Asian birds was 19 @.@ 3 x 12 @.@ 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 76 x 0 @.@ 51 in ) with a weight of 1 @.@ 7 g ( 0 @.@ 06 oz ) . Both adults incubate the eggs for 16 – 19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly . The fledging time can vary from 22 – 24 days to 25 – 30 days , though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food . If a nest is destroyed , or the breeding attempt otherwise fails , a replacement clutch may be laid , typically with fewer eggs . Two nests in Arabia were used in spring and again in the autumn , but it is not known if the same pair were involved . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The pale crag martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight , although it will occasionally feed on the ground . Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory , flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills . Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas . Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt , relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns . When not breeding , they may also hunt low over open ground . The insects caught depend on what is locally available , but may include mosquitoes , flies , Hymenoptera , ants and beetles . This martin often feeds alone , but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects , and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant , such as agricultural areas , wetlands and sewage works . The pale crag martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface , although at least some of its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes . Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry , rocky areas in which the pale crag martin nests , so there is little competition for food . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Some falcons have the speed and agility to catch swallows and martins in flight , and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon , Taita falcon , African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby . Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts , which sometimes forcibly take over martins ' nests . 
 The <unk> tick Hyalomma marginatum was found in pale crag martin nests on a sarcophagus and an ancient tomb in Egypt . This tick has been implicated in the transmission of <unk> virus , a pathogenic arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes . Another <unk> tick , Argas africolumbae , was found in a nest of the closely related rock martins in Kenya . The nasal mite Ptilonyssus <unk> was found in a pale crag martin in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad . 
 = = Status = = 
 The pale crag martin has a very large range of 5 @.@ 9 million km2 ( 2 @.@ 29 million sq mi ) . The total population is unknown , but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt . It has an expanding range and increasing population . Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is not considered to be threatened , and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 This species is locally common in Algeria , scarce in Morocco , and scarce in Pakistan . It has colonised southern Israel , where it breeds on houses , in the 1970s , and large numbers may occur outside the breeding season in Saudi Arabia and Oman . Population estimates include 10 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 pairs breeding in Egypt , 10 @,@ 000 pairs in the United Arab Emirates , and an Arabian winter population of up to 150 @,@ 000 birds in flocks that sometimes contain 300 – 500 birds . A large breeding range expansion in the Arabian Peninsula has been aided by the use of high @-@ rise buildings as nesting sites , and possibly a greater supply of insects from agricultural land . Breeding is now regular in Abu Dhabi , and Qatar 's tall buildings may be the next site for colonisation . The pale crag martin first bred in Iraq in 2009 . 
 = Grus ( constellation ) = 
 Grus ( / <unk> / , or colloquially / <unk> / ) is a constellation in the southern sky . Its name is Latin for the crane , a type of bird . It is one of twelve constellations conceived by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman . Grus first appeared on a 35 @-@ cm ( 14 in ) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer 's star atlas Uranometria of 1603 . French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave Bayer designations to its stars in 1756 , some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus . The constellations Grus , Pavo , Phoenix and Tucana are collectively known as the " Southern Birds " . 
 The constellation 's brightest star , Alpha Gruis , is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1 @.@ 7 @-@ magnitude blue @-@ white star . Beta Gruis is a red giant variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2 @.@ 3 and a maximum magnitude of 2 @.@ 0 . Six star systems have been found to have planets : the red dwarf Gliese 832 is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system . Another — WASP @-@ 95 — has a planet that orbits every two days . Deep @-@ sky objects found in Grus include the planetary nebula IC <unk> , also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula , and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet . 
 = = History = = 
 The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus ( the southern fish ) , with Gamma Gruis seen as part of the fish 's tail . The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius , who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman , who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition , known as the Eerste Schipvaart , to the East Indies . Grus first appeared on a 35 @-@ cm diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius . Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer 's Uranometria of 1603 . De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name Den <unk> , " The Heron " , but Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus . 
 An alternative name for the constellation , <unk> ( Latin " flamingo " ) , was used briefly during the early 17th century , seen in the 1605 work Cosmographiae <unk> by Paul <unk> of Leiden University and a c . 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den <unk> . Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally , who had worked with both of these people . Grus and the nearby constellations Phoenix , Tucana and Pavo are collectively called the " Southern Birds " . 
 The stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China . In Chinese astronomy , Gamma and Lambda Gruis may have been included in the tub @-@ shaped asterism <unk> , along with stars from Piscis Austrinus . In Central Australia , the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them , east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps . Alpha and Beta Gruis , along with Fomalhaut , Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca , were all claimed by the Arrernte . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Grus is bordered by Piscis Austrinus to the north , Sculptor to the northeast , Phoenix to the east , Tucana to the south , Indus to the southwest , and Microscopium to the west . Bayer straightened the tail of Piscis Austrinus to make way for Grus in his Uranometria . Covering 366 square degrees , it ranks 45th of the 88 modern constellations in size and covers 0 @.@ 887 % of the night sky . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is " Gru " . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined as a polygon of 6 segments . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 21h <unk> and 23h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 36 @.@ 31 ° and − 56 @.@ 39 ° . Grus is located too far south to be seen by observers in the British Isles and the northern United States , though it can easily be seen from Florida or California ; the whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 33 ° N.

 Keyser and de Houtman assigned twelve stars to the constellation . Bayer depicted Grus on his chart , but did not assign its stars Bayer designations . French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions . In 1879 , American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa , Nu , Omicron and Xi , which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations . Lacaille considered them too faint , while Gould thought otherwise . Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium . Conversely , Gould dropped Lacaille 's Sigma as he thought it was too dim . 
 Grus has several bright stars . Marking the left wing is Alpha Gruis , a blue @-@ white star of spectral type <unk> and apparent magnitude 1 @.@ 7 , around 101 light @-@ years from Earth . Its traditional name , Alnair , means " the bright one " and refers to its status as the brightest star in Grus . Alnair is around 380 times as luminous and has over 3 times the diameter of the Sun . Lying 5 degrees west of Alnair , denoting the Crane 's heart is Beta Gruis , a red giant of spectral type M5III . It has a diameter of 0 @.@ 8 astronomical units ( AU ) ( if placed in the Solar System it would extend to the orbit of Venus ) located around 170 light @-@ years from Earth . It is a variable star with a minimum magnitude of 2 @.@ 3 and a maximum magnitude of 2 @.@ 0 . An imaginary line drawn from the Great Square of Pegasus through Fomalhaut will lead to Alnair and Beta Gruis . 
 Lying in the northwest corner of the constellation and marking the crane 's eye is Gamma Gruis , a blue @-@ white subgiant of spectral type <unk> and magnitude 3 @.@ 0 lying around 211 light @-@ years from Earth . Also known as Al <unk> , it has finished fusing its core hydrogen and has begun cooling and expanding , which will see it transform into a red giant . 
 There are several naked @-@ eye double stars in Grus . Forming a triangle with Alnair and Beta , Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components — Delta1 and Delta2 — are separated by 45 arcseconds . Delta1 is a yellow giant of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4 @.@ 0 , 309 light @-@ years from Earth , and may have its own magnitude 12 orange dwarf companion . Delta2 is a red giant of spectral type <unk> and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3 @.@ 99 and 4 @.@ 2 , located 325 light @-@ years from Earth . It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of our sun . Mu Gruis , composed of <unk> and <unk> , is also an optical double — both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2 @.@ 5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. <unk> is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4 @.@ 8 located around 275 light @-@ years from Earth , while <unk> the dimmer at magnitude 5 @.@ 11 lies 265 light @-@ years distant from Earth . Pi Gruis , an optical double with a variable component , is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2 . Pi1 is a semi @-@ regular red giant of spectral type S5 , ranging from magnitude 5 @.@ 31 to 7 @.@ 01 over a period of 191 days , and is around 532 light @-@ years from Earth . One of the brightest S @-@ class stars to Earth viewers , it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10 @.@ 9 with sunlike properties , being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V . The pair make up a likely binary system . Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type <unk> @-@ IV located around 130 light @-@ years from Earth , and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5 @.@ 6 . Marking the right wing is Theta Gruis , yet another double star , lying 5 degrees east of Delta1 and Delta2 . 
 RZ Gruis is a binary system of apparent magnitude 12 @.@ 3 with occasional dimming to 13 @.@ 4 , whose components — a white dwarf and main sequence star — are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8 @.@ 5 to 10 hours . It belongs to the UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems , where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars . The system is poorly understood , though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V . These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts , yet they have not been observed to have erupted themselves . The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events . CE Gruis ( also known as Grus V @-@ 1 ) is a faint ( magnitude 18 – 21 ) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star ; in this case the two are so close they are tidally locked . Known as polars , material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf , but rather streams directly onto it . 
 Six star systems are thought to have planetary systems . <unk> Gruis is a yellow star of magnitude 6 @.@ 0 located around 106 light @-@ years away . It may be a main sequence star or be just beginning to depart from the sequence as it expands and cools . In 2002 the star was found to have a planetary companion . HD <unk> , HD <unk> and WASP @-@ 95 are yellow sunlike stars discovered to have two planets , a planet and a remote red dwarf , and a hot Jupiter respectively ; this last — WASP @-@ <unk> — completes an orbit round its sun in a mere two days . Gliese 832 is a red dwarf of spectral type <unk> and apparent magnitude 8 @.@ 66 located only 16 @.@ 1 light @-@ years distant ; hence it is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System . A Jupiter @-@ like planet — Gliese 832 b — orbiting the red dwarf over a period of 9 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 4 years was discovered in 2008 . WISE <unk> − <unk> is a brown dwarf of spectral type Y , and hence one of the coolest star @-@ like objects known . It has been calculated as being around 26 light @-@ years distant from Earth .

 Nicknamed the spare @-@ tyre nebula , IC <unk> is a planetary nebula located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis . Around 3000 light @-@ years distant , it is expanding at 50 kilometres a second , one of the fastest rates of expansion of all planetary nebulae . 
 Northeast of Theta Gruis are four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet . These galaxies are NGC <unk> , NGC <unk> , NGC <unk> , and NGC <unk> . The latter three galaxies occupy an area of sky only 10 arcminutes across and are sometimes referred to as the " Grus Triplet , " although all four are part of a larger loose group of galaxies called the IC 1459 Grus Group . NGC <unk> and <unk> are exhibiting high starburst activity ; this is thought to have arisen because of the tidal forces from interacting . Located on the border of Grus with Piscis Austrinus , IC 1459 is a peculiar E3 giant elliptical galaxy . It has a fast <unk> stellar core , and shells and ripples in its outer region . The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 11 @.@ 9 and is around 80 million light years distant . 
 NGC <unk> is a barred spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 10 @.@ 4 @.@ located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet . Approximately 37 @.@ 5 million light years distant , it is about 100 @,@ 000 light years in diameter , has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the Milky Way . Two ultraluminous X @-@ ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC <unk> . SN <unk> was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova , one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum , but this emission later became undetectable and was replaced by lines of oxygen , magnesium and calcium , as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova . A massive star of spectral type F , A or B is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN <unk> , which was believed to have been a Wolf – Rayet star . 
 Located near Alnair is NGC <unk> , a face @-@ on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located approximately 71 @.@ 7 million light years from Earth . It has an apparent magnitude of 12 @.@ 1 . Appearing undisturbed in visible light , it shows signs of having undergone a collision or merger when viewed at longer wavelengths , with disturbed patterns of ionized hydrogen including a filament of gas around 64 @,@ 000 light @-@ years long . It is part of a group of ten galaxies . 
 NGC <unk> is a spiral galaxy discovered by British astronomer John Herschel during observations at the Cape of Good Hope in October 1834 . The galaxy has a visual magnitude of 11 @.@ 7 and is approximately 122 million light years distant from Earth . 
 = Pedro del Valle = 
 Lieutenant General Pedro Augusto del Valle ( August 28 , 1893 — April 28 , 1978 ) was a United States Marine Corps officer who became the first Hispanic to reach the rank of Lieutenant General . His military career included service in World War I , Haiti and Nicaragua during the Banana Wars of the 1920s , in the seizure of Guadalcanal , and later as Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division during World War II . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Del Valle was born on August 28 , 1893 in San Juan , Puerto Rico when the island was still under Spanish colonial rule . He was related to Dr. Francisco del Valle , a surgeon who had served as mayor of San Juan from 1907 to 1910 . In 1900 , two years after the Spanish – American War , the del Valle family moved to Maryland where they became U.S. citizens ( The Jones Act of 1917 later gave United States Citizenship to all Puerto Ricans born on the island ) . He received his primary and secondary education in Maryland . 
 On June 17 , 1911 , after he graduated from high school , del Valle received an appointment by George Radcliffe Colton , who served from 1909 to 1913 as the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico , to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland . Del Valle graduated from the academy in June 1915 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of the Marine Corps on June 5 , 1915 .

 = = = The Banana Wars & pre @-@ World War II = = = 
 Pedro del Valle helped the Marine Corps in the capture of Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic , in 1916 , for which he was awarded his first Legion of Merit . Del Valle commanded the Marine detachment on board the USS Texas ( BB @-@ 35 ) in the North Atlantic during World War I. In 1919 , he participated in the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet . Later he served as " Aide @-@ de @-@ camp " to Major General Joseph Henry Pendleton after serving on a tour of sea duty aboard the USS Wyoming ( BB @-@ 32 ) . His job included an inspection tour of the West Indies in the company of General Pendleton . 
 In 1926 , del Valle served with the Gendarmerie of Haiti for three years and , during that time , he also became active in the war against Augusto César Sandino in Nicaragua . In 1929 , he returned to the United States and attended the Field Officers Course at the Marine Corps School in MCB Quantico , Virginia . 
 In 1931 , Brigadier General Randolph C. Berkeley appointed del Valle to the " Landing Operations Text Board " in Quantico , the first organizational step taken by the Marines to develop a working doctrine for amphibious assault . In 1932 , he wrote an essay titled " Ship @-@ to @-@ Shore in Amphibious Operations " which was published in the Marine Corps Gazette . In his essay , he stressed the importance of a coordinated amphibious assault and of an execution of an opposed landing . 
 He worked as an intelligence officer in Havana , Cuba in 1933 under Admiral Charles Freeman , following the Cuban Sergeant 's Revolt . From 1935 – 1937 , del Valle was Assistant Naval Attache , attached to the American Embassy to Italy in Rome . While on duty , del Valle participated as an observer with the Italian Forces during the Second Italo @-@ Abyssinian War . The experiences which del Valle gained as an observer led him to author the book " Roman Eagles Over Ethiopia " where he describes the events leading up to the Italian expedition and the complete movements of combat operations by the Italian Army under Generals De Bono , Badoglio , and Graziani . In 1939 , he was ordered to attend the Army War College in Washington , D.C. and after graduating was named Executive Officer of the Division of Plans and Policies , USMC . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 On March 1941 , del Valle became the commanding officer of the 11th Marine Regiment , ( artillery ) . Upon the outbreak of World War II , del Valle led his regiment and participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign , providing artillery support for the 1st Marine Division . In the Battle of the Tenaru , the firepower provided by del Valle 's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers before they ever reached the Marine positions . The attackers were killed almost to the last man . The outcome of the battle was so stunning that the Japanese commander , Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki , committed seppuku shortly afterwards . Major General Alexander Vandegrift , impressed with del Valle 's leadership recommended his promotion and on October 1 , 1942 , del Valle became a brigadier general . Vandegrift retained del Valle as head of the 11th Marines , the only time that the regiment has ever had a general as their commanding officer . In 1943 , he served as Commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and the Russell and Florida Islands . 
 On April 1 , 1944 , del Valle , as Commanding General of the Third Corps Artillery , III Marine Amphibious Corps , took part in the Battle of Guam and was awarded an award star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit . The men under his command did such a good job with their heavy artillery that no one man could be singled out for commendation . Instead , each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle which was carried in their record books . 
 In late October 1944 , he succeeded Major General William H. Rupertus as Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division , being personally greeted in his new command by Colonel Lewis Burwell " Chesty " Puller . At the time , the 1st Marine Division was training on the island of Pavuvu for the invasion of Okinawa . He subsequently led the division throughout the campaign . Del Valle was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership during the battle and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa .

 After World War II ended , del Valle was ordered back to Headquarters Marine Corps , where he was named Inspector General , a position which he held until he retired on January 1 , 1948 . On February 19 , 1946 New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez and del Valle held a meeting with President Harry S. Truman in the White House , in which Chavez recommended del Valle for the position of governor of Puerto Rico . From 1898 to 1942 , the governors of the island were officials appointed by the President of the United States . Local Puerto Rican politicians , such as Luis Muñoz Marín , opposed the naming of del Valle in favor of Jesús T. Piñero ; to which Del Valle eventually asked President Truman to withdraw his name among those considered for the position . The first civilian and native Puerto Rican appointed governor of Puerto Rico thus became Piñero in 1946 . If Congress had not approved legislation in 1947 allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor , del Valle may have been appointed to the governorship .

 After retiring from the Marine Corps , del Valle worked as a representative of ITT in the company 's office in Cairo , Egypt . After some time with the company he was named president of ITT for all South America in Buenos Aires , Argentina , a position that he held until 1951 . 
 Believing that the United States was in danger of a communist threat , del Valle tried to convince the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense to form a vigilante minuteman group . He also believed that the CIA should operate behind Russian and Chinese lines . After his ideas were turned down , he decided to form his own group . In 1953 , del Valle met with LtCol John H. Hoffman , LtCol Eugene Cowles <unk> , Brigadier General Bonner Fellers , and Major General Claire Chennault ( USAF ) to form the " Defenders of the American Constitution " ( DAC ) . DAC 's main goal was to purge the United States of any communist influence . The idea behind the group was to organize the citizens in each state as vigilantes against sabotage and other forms of treason , then link them up in some national headquarters . Del Valle ran for governor of Maryland in 1953 and was defeated in his attempt to be nominated in the Republican primary election . The controversial views shared by some of the members of " DAC " was to blame for the organization 's decline in popularity . On April 12 , 1961 , del Valle invoked The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( an antisemitic hoax ) during a speech before the United States Daughters of 1812 , in an attempt to " prove " that Communism and Socialism were introduced to Russia by an " Invisible Government " whose intention was to destroy that country . Del Valle also belonged to a group known as the Sons of Liberty , established in 1967 in Annapolis , Maryland and named after the secret patriotic society which directed the actions of the Boston Tea Party on December 13 , 1773 . 
 Lieutenant General Pedro del Valle was married to Katharine Nelson ( 1890 – 1983 ) . He died on April 28 , 1978 in Annapolis , Maryland and was buried in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery and <unk> . After del Valle ’ s death at age 85 , the DAC ceased to exist .

 Among Lieutenant General Pedro del Valle 's decorations and medals were the following : 
 = September 11 attacks = 
 The September 11 attacks ( also referred to as 9 / 11 ) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al @-@ Qaeda on the United States on the morning of September 11 , 2001 . The attacks killed 2 @,@ 996 people and injured over 6 @,@ 000 others and caused at least $ 10 billion in property and infrastructure damage and $ 3 trillion in total costs . 
 Four passenger airliners operated by two major U.S. passenger air carriers ( United Airlines and American Airlines ) — all of which departed from airports on the northeastern United States bound for California — were hijacked by 19 al @-@ Qaeda terrorists . Two of the planes , American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers , respectively , of the World Trade Center complex in New York City . Within an hour and 42 minutes , both 110 @-@ story towers collapsed , with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex , including the 47 @-@ story 7 World Trade Center tower , as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures . A third plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon ( the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense ) in Arlington County , Virginia , leading to a partial collapse of the building 's western side . The fourth plane , United Airlines Flight 93 , initially was steered toward Washington , D.C. , but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers . A total of 2 @,@ 996 people , including the 19 hijackers , were killed and more than 6 @,@ 000 others injured . It was the deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in the history of the United States , with 343 and 72 killed respectively . 
 Suspicion for the attack quickly fell on al @-@ Qaeda . The United States responded to the attacks by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had harbored al @-@ Qaeda . Many countries strengthened their anti @-@ terrorism legislation and expanded the powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks . Although al @-@ Qaeda 's leader , Osama bin Laden , initially denied any involvement , in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks . Al @-@ Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel , the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , and sanctions against Iraq as motives . Having evaded capture for almost a decade , bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. military in May 2011 . 
 The destruction of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets , closing Wall Street until September 17 and the civilian airspace in the U.S. and Canada until September 13 . Many closings , evacuations , and cancellations followed , out of respect or fear of further attacks . Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was completed in May 2002 , and the Pentagon was repaired within a year . On November 18 , 2006 , construction of One World Trade Center began at the World Trade Center site . The building was officially opened on November 3 , 2014 . Numerous memorials have been constructed , including the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City , the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County , Virginia , and the Flight 93 National Memorial in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania .

 = = = Al @-@ Qaeda = = = 
 The origins of al @-@ Qaeda can be traced to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan . Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen to resist the Soviets . Under the guidance of Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri , bin Laden became more radical . In 1996 , bin Laden issued his first fatwā , calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia . 
 In a second fatwā in 1998 , bin Laden outlined his objections to American foreign policy with respect to Israel , as well as the continued presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War . Bin Laden used Islamic texts to exhort Muslims to attack Americans until the stated grievances are reversed . Muslim legal scholars " have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries " , according to bin Laden . 
 = = = = Osama bin Laden = = = = 
 Bin Laden , who orchestrated the attacks , initially denied but later admitted involvement . Al Jazeera broadcast a statement by bin Laden on September 16 , 2001 , stating , " I stress that I have not carried out this act , which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation . " In November 2001 , U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad , Afghanistan . In the video , bin Laden is seen talking to Khaled al @-@ Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks . On December 27 , 2001 , a second bin Laden video was released . In the video , he said , " It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam . ... It is the hatred of crusaders . Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice , aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel , which kills our people . ... We say that the end of the United States is imminent , whether Bin Laden or his followers are alive or dead , for the awakening of the Muslim <unk> ( nation ) has occurred " , but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for the attacks . The transcript refers several times to the United States specifically targeting Muslims . 
 Shortly before the U.S. presidential election in 2004 , in a taped statement , bin Laden publicly acknowledged al @-@ Qaeda 's involvement in the attacks on the U.S. and admitted his direct link to the attacks . He said that the attacks were carried out because , " we are free ... and want to regain freedom for our nation . As you undermine our security we undermine yours . " Bin Laden said he had personally directed his followers to attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon . Another video obtained by Al Jazeera in September 2006 shows bin Laden with Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh , as well as two hijackers , Hamza al @-@ Ghamdi and Wail al @-@ Shehri , as they make preparations for the attacks . The U.S. never formally indicted bin Laden for the 9 / 11 attacks but he was on the FBI 's Most Wanted List for the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , and Nairobi , Kenya . After a 10 @-@ year manhunt , bin Laden was killed by American special forces in a compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan on May 2 , 2011 .

 The journalist <unk> Fouda of the Arabic television channel Al Jazeera reported that , in April 2002 , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed admitted his involvement , along with Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh . The 9 / 11 Commission Report determined that the animosity towards the United States felt by Mohammed , the principal architect of the 9 / 11 attacks , stemmed from his " violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel " . Mohammed was also an adviser and financier of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the uncle of Ramzi Yousef , the lead bomber in that attack . 
 Mohammed was arrested on March 1 , 2003 , in Rawalpindi , Pakistan , by Pakistani security officials working with the CIA , then transported to Guantanamo Bay and interrogated using methods including waterboarding . During U.S. hearings at Guantanamo Bay in March 2007 , Mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks , stating he " was responsible for the 9 / 11 operation from A to Z " and that his statement was not made under duress .

 In " Substitution for Testimony of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed " from the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui , five people are identified as having been completely aware of the operation 's details . They are bin Laden , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh , Abu <unk> al @-@ <unk> , and Mohammed Atef . To date , only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted for the attacks . 
 On September 26 , 2005 , the Spanish high court sentenced Abu <unk> to 27 years in prison for conspiracy on the 9 / 11 attacks and being a member of the terrorist organization al @-@ Qaeda . At the same time , another 17 al @-@ Qaeda members were sentenced to penalties of between six and eleven years . On February 16 , 2006 , the Spanish Supreme Court reduced the Abu <unk> penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the conspiracy was not proven . 
 Also , in 2006 , Moussaoui , who some originally suspected might have been the assigned 20th hijacker , was convicted for the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy . He is serving a life sentence without parole in the United States . <unk> el @-@ <unk> , an associate of the Hamburg @-@ based hijackers , is serving 15 years in Germany for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks . 
 The Hamburg cell in Germany included radical Islamists who eventually came to be key operatives in the 9 / 11 attacks . Mohamed Atta , Marwan al @-@ Shehhi , Ziad Jarrah , Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh , and Said <unk> were all members of al @-@ Qaeda 's Hamburg cell . 
 = = = Motives = = = 
 Osama bin Laden 's declaration of a holy war against the United States , and a 1998 fatwā signed by bin Laden and others , calling for the killing of Americans , are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation . In bin Laden 's November 2002 " Letter to America " , he explicitly stated that al @-@ Qaeda 's motives for their attacks include : 
 U.S. support of Israel 
 support for the " attacks against Muslims " in Somalia 
 support of Russian " atrocities against Muslims " in Chechnya 
 pro @-@ American governments in the Middle East ( who " act as your agents " ) being against Muslim interests 
 support of Indian " oppression against Muslims " in Kashmir 
 the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia 
 the sanctions against Iraq 
 After the attacks , bin Laden and al @-@ Zawahiri released additional video tapes and audio tapes , some of which repeated those reasons for the attacks . Two particularly important publications were bin Laden 's 2002 " Letter to America " , and a 2004 video tape by bin Laden . 
 Bin Laden interpreted Muhammad as having banned the " permanent presence of infidels in Arabia " . In 1996 , bin Laden issued a fatwā calling for American troops to leave Saudi Arabia . In 1998 , al @-@ Qaeda wrote , " for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places , the Arabian Peninsula , plundering its riches , dictating to its rulers , humiliating its people , terrorizing its neighbors , and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples . " 
 In a December 1999 interview , bin Laden said he felt that Americans were " too near to Mecca " , and considered this a provocation to the entire Muslim world . One analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , al @-@ Qaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit to suicide missions . 
 In the 1998 fatwā , al @-@ Qaeda identified the Iraq sanctions as a reason to kill Americans , condemning the " protracted blockade " among other actions that constitute a declaration of war against " Allah , his messenger , and Muslims . " The fatwā declared that " the ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it , in order to liberate the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque of Mecca from their grip , and in order for their [ the Americans ' ] armies to move out of all the lands of Islam , defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim . " 
 Bin Laden claimed , in 2004 , that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in 1982 , when he witnessed Israel 's bombardment of high @-@ rise apartment buildings during the 1982 Lebanon War . Some analysts , including Mearsheimer and Walt , also claim that one motivation for the attacks was U.S. support of Israel . In 2004 and 2010 , bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U.S. support of Israel , although most of the letter expressed bin Laden 's disdain for President Bush and bin Laden 's hope to " destroy and bankrupt " the U.S. 
 Other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin Laden and al @-@ Qaeda , including western support of Islamic and non @-@ Islamic authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia , Iran , Egypt , Iraq , Pakistan and northern Africa , and the presence of western troops in some of these countries . Some authors suggest the " humiliation " resulting from the Islamic world falling behind the Western world – this discrepancy rendered especially visible by the globalization trend and a desire to provoke the U.S. into a broader war against the Islamic world in the hope of motivating more allies to support al @-@ Qaeda . Similarly , others have argued that 9 / 11 was a strategic move with the objective of provoking America into a war that would incite a pan @-@ Islamic revolution . 
 = = = Planning of the attacks = = = 
 The idea for the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who first presented it to Osama bin Laden in 1996 . At that time , bin Laden and al @-@ Qaeda were in a period of transition , having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan . The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden 's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point , as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States . 
 In late 1998 or early 1999 , bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot . A series of meetings occurred in early 1999 , involving Mohammed , bin Laden , and his deputy Mohammed Atef . Atef provided operational support for the plot , including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers . Bin Laden overruled Mohammed , rejecting some potential targets such as the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles because , " there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation " . 
 Bin Laden provided leadership and financial support for the plot , and was involved in selecting participants . Bin Laden initially selected Nawaf al @-@ Hazmi and Khalid al @-@ Mihdhar , both experienced jihadists who had fought in Bosnia . Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States in mid @-@ January 2000 . In spring 2000 , Hazmi and Mihdhar took flying lessons in San Diego , California , but both spoke little English , performed poorly with flying lessons , and eventually served as secondary – or " muscle " – hijackers . 
 In late 1999 , a group of men from Hamburg , Germany arrived in Afghanistan , including Mohamed Atta , Marwan al @-@ Shehhi , Ziad Jarrah , and Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh . Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated , could speak English , and had experience living in the West . New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al @-@ Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot 's license . Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing . 
 Hanjour arrived in San Diego on December 8 , 2000 , joining Hazmi . They soon left for Arizona , where Hanjour took refresher training . Marwan al @-@ Shehhi arrived at the end of May 2000 , while Atta arrived on June 3 , 2000 , and Jarrah arrived on June 27 , 2000 . Bin al @-@ Shibh applied several times for a visa to the United States , but as a Yemeni , he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa and remain as an illegal immigrant . Bin al @-@ Shibh stayed in Hamburg , providing coordination between Atta and Mohammed . The three Hamburg cell members all took pilot training in South Florida . 
 In spring 2001 , the secondary hijackers began arriving in the United States . In July 2001 , Atta met with bin al @-@ Shibh in Spain , where they coordinated details of the plot , including final target selection . Bin al @-@ Shibh also passed along bin Laden 's wish for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible . Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi officials who were family members , or used fraudulent passports to gain entry . 
 = = = Intelligence before the attacks = = = 
 In late 1999 , al @-@ Qaeda associate <unk> contacted Mihdhar , telling him to meet him in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia ; Hazmi and Abu Bara al Yemeni would also be in attendance . The NSA intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting , Mihdhar , and the name " Nawaf " ( Hazmi ) . While the agency feared that " Something nefarious might be afoot , " it took no further action . The CIA had already been alerted by Saudi intelligence to the status of Mihdhar and Hazmi as al @-@ Qaeda members , and a CIA team broke into Mihdhar 's Dubai hotel room and discovered that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa . While Alec Station alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact , it did not share this information with the FBI . The Malaysian Special Branch observed the January 5 , 2000 , meeting of the two al @-@ Qaeda members , and informed the CIA that Mihdhar , Hazmi , and <unk> were flying to Bangkok , but the CIA never notified other agencies of this , nor did it ask the State Department to put Mihdhar on its watchlist . An FBI liaison to Alec Station asked permission to inform the FBI of the meeting , but was told that " ' This is not a matter for the FBI . ' " 
 By late June , senior counter @-@ terrorism official Richard Clarke and CIA director George Tenet were " convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come , " although the CIA believed that the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel . In early July , Clarke put domestic agencies on " full alert , " telling them that " Something really spectacular is going to happen here ... soon . " He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments , and the Defense Department to go to " Threat Condition Delta . " Clarke would later write that " Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States ... in [ the ] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States ... They had specific information about individual terrorists ... None of that information got to me or the White House . " 
 On July 13 , Tom Wilshire , a CIA agent assigned to the FBI 's international terrorism division , emailed his superiors at the CIA 's Counterterrorism Center ( CTC ) , requesting permission to inform the FBI that Hazmi was in the country and that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa . However , the CIA never responded . 
 The same day in July , <unk> Gillespie , an FBI analyst working in the CTC , was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting . She was not told of the participants ' presence in the U.S. However , the CIA did give Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism , but did not tell her their significance . The <unk> database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators . When shown the photos , the FBI were refused more details on their significance , and also did not receive Mihdhar 's date of birth or passport number . In late August 2001 , Gillespie told the INS , the State Department , the Customs Service , and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists , but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo , which hindered their efforts . 
 Also in July , a Phoenix @-@ based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters , Alec Station , and to FBI agents in New York , alerting them to " the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges . " The agent , Kenneth Williams , suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training . In July , Jordan alerted the U.S. that al @-@ Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S. ; " months later , " Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack 's codename was " The Big Wedding , " and that it involved airplanes . 
 On August 6 , the CIA 's Presidential Daily Brief , designated " For the President Only , " was entitled " Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S. " The memo noted that " The FBI information ... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks . " 
 In mid @-@ August , one Minnesota flight school alerted the FBI to Zacarias Moussaoui , who had asked " suspicious questions . " The FBI found that he was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan , and the INS arrested him for overstaying his French visa . However , their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of probable cause . 
 The failures in intelligence @-@ sharing were attributed to 1995 Justice Department policies limiting intelligence sharing , combined with CIA and NSA reluctance in revealing " sensitive sources and methods " such as tapped phones . Testifying before the 9 / 11 Commission in April 2004 , then @-@ Attorney General John Ashcroft recalled that the " single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents . " Clarke also wrote that " There were failures in the organizations ... failures to get information to the right place at the right time ... "

 Early on the morning of September 11 , 2001 , 19 hijackers took control of four commercial airliners ( two Boeing 757 and two Boeing 767 ) en route to California ( three headed to LAX in Los Angeles , and one to SFO in San Francisco ) after takeoffs from Logan International Airport in Boston , Massachusetts ; Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark , New Jersey ; and Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun and Fairfax counties in Virginia . Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled . 
 The four flights were : 
 American Airlines Flight 11 : a Boeing 767 aircraft , departed Logan Airport at 7 : 59 a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers , not including five hijackers . The hijackers flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 8 : 46 a.m. 
 United Airlines Flight 175 : a Boeing 767 aircraft , departed Logan Airport at 8 : 14 a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of nine and 51 passengers , not including five hijackers . The hijackers flew the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 9 : 03 a.m. 
 American Airlines Flight 77 : a Boeing 757 aircraft , departed Washington Dulles International Airport at 8 : 20 a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of six and 53 passengers , not including five hijackers . The hijackers flew the plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County , Virginia , at 9 : 37 a.m. 
 United Airlines Flight 93 : a Boeing 757 aircraft , departed Newark International Airport at 8 : 42 a.m. en route to San Francisco , with a crew of seven and 33 passengers , not including four hijackers . As passengers attempted to subdue the hijackers , the aircraft crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , at 10 : 03 a.m. 
 Media coverage was extensive during the attacks and aftermath , beginning moments after the first crash into the World Trade Center . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 At 8 : 46 a.m. , five hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern façade of the World Trade Center 's North Tower ( 1 WTC ) , and at 9 : 03 a.m. , another five hijackers crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern façade of the South Tower ( 2 WTC ) . Five hijackers flew American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon at 9 : 37 a.m. A fourth flight , United Airlines Flight 93 , under the control of four hijackers , crashed near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , southeast of Pittsburgh , at 10 : 03 a.m. after the passengers fought the hijackers . Flight 93 's target is believed to have been either the Capitol or the White House . Flight 93 's cockpit voice recorder revealed crew and passengers tried to seize control of the plane from the hijackers after learning through phone calls that Flights 11 , 77 , and 175 had been crashed into buildings that morning . Once it became evident to the hijackers that the passengers might regain control of the plane , the hijackers rolled the plane and intentionally crashed it . 
 Some passengers and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin <unk> service and mobile phones provided details : several hijackers were aboard each plane ; they used mace , tear gas , or pepper spray to overcome attendants ; and some people aboard had been stabbed . Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots , flight attendants , and one or more passengers . According to the 9 / 11 Commission 's final report , the hijackers had recently purchased multi @-@ function hand tools and assorted Leatherman @-@ type utility knives with locking blades , which were not forbidden to passengers at the time , but were not found among the possessions left behind by the hijackers . A flight attendant on Flight 11 , a passenger on Flight 175 , and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs , but one of the passengers said he thought the bombs were fake . The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites , and the 9 / 11 Commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake . 
 Three buildings in the World Trade Center collapsed due to fire @-@ induced structural failure . The South Tower collapsed at 9 : 59 a.m. after burning for 56 minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel . The North Tower collapsed at 10 : 28 a.m. after burning for 102 minutes . When the North Tower collapsed , debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building ( 7 WTC ) , damaging it and starting fires . These fires burned for hours , compromising the building 's structural integrity , and 7 WTC collapsed at 5 : 21 p.m. The west side of the Pentagon sustained significant damage . 
 At 9 : 42 a.m. , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) grounded all civilian aircraft within the continental U.S. , and civilian aircraft already in flight were told to land immediately . All international civilian aircraft were either turned back or redirected to airports in Canada or Mexico , and were banned from landing on United States territory for three days . The attacks created widespread confusion among news organizations and air traffic controllers . Among the unconfirmed and often contradictory news reports aired throughout the day , one of the most prevalent said a car bomb had been detonated at the U.S. State Department 's headquarters in Washington , D.C. Another jet — Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 — was suspected of having been hijacked , but the aircraft responded to controllers and landed safely in Cleveland , Ohio . 
 In an April 2002 interview , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh , who are believed to have organized the attacks , said Flight 93 's intended target was the United States Capitol , not the White House . During the planning stage of the attacks , Mohamed Atta , the hijacker and pilot of Flight 11 , thought the White House might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from Hani Hanjour ( who hijacked and piloted Flight 77 ) . Mohammed said al @-@ Qaeda initially planned to target nuclear installations rather than the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , but decided against it , fearing things could " get out of control " . Final decisions on targets , according to Mohammed , were left in the hands of the pilots . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 The attacks resulted in the deaths of 2 @,@ 996 people and the injuries of 6 @,@ 000 + others . The death toll included 265 on the four planes ( from which there were no survivors ) , 2 @,@ 606 in the World Trade Center and in the surrounding area , and 125 at the Pentagon . Nearly all of those who perished were civilians with the exceptions of 343 firefighters , 72 law enforcement officers , 55 military personnel , and the 19 terrorists who died in the attacks . After New York , New Jersey lost the most state citizens , with the city of Hoboken having the most citizens that died in the attacks . More than 90 countries lost citizens in the September 11 attacks . The attacks of September 11 , 2001 , marked it the worst terrorist attack in world history and the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 . 
 In Arlington County , Virginia , 125 Pentagon workers lost their lives when Flight 77 crashed into the western side of the building . Of these , 70 were civilians and 55 were military personnel , many of them who worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy . The Army lost 47 civilian employees , six civilian contractors , and 22 soldiers , while the Navy lost six civilian employees , three civilian contractors , and 33 sailors . Seven Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) civilian employees were also among the dead in the attack , as well as an Office of the Secretary of Defense ( OSD ) contractor . Lieutenant General Timothy Maude , an Army Deputy Chief of Staff , was the highest @-@ ranking military official killed at the Pentagon . 
 In New York City , more than 90 % of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact . In the North Tower , 1 @,@ 355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation , fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames , or were killed in the building 's eventual collapse . The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape . 107 people below the point of impact died as well . 
 In the South Tower , one stairwell , Stairwell A , was left intact after Flight 175 hit , allowing 14 people located on the floors of impact ( including one man who saw the plane coming at him ) and four more from the floors above to escape . New York City 911 operators who received calls from individuals inside the tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded and as a result , told callers not to descend the tower on their own . In total 630 people died in that tower , fewer than half the number killed in the North Tower . Casualties in the South Tower were significantly reduced by some occupants deciding to start evacuating as soon as the North Tower was struck . 
 At least 200 people fell or jumped to their deaths from the burning towers ( as exemplified in the photograph The Falling Man ) , landing on the streets and rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below . Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue , but the roof access doors were locked . No plan existed for helicopter rescues , and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching . A total of 411 emergency workers died as they tried to rescue people and fight fires . The New York City Fire Department ( FDNY ) lost 343 firefighters , including a chaplain and two paramedics . The New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) lost 23 officers . The Port Authority Police Department ( <unk> ) lost 37 officers . Eight emergency medical technicians ( EMTs ) and paramedics from private emergency medical services units were killed . 
 Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. , an investment bank on the 101st – 105th floors of the North Tower , lost 658 employees , considerably more than any other employer . Marsh Inc . , located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93 – 100 , lost 358 employees , and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed . The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) estimated that about 17 @,@ 400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex at the time of the attacks . Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14 @,@ 154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8 : 45 a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings . 
 Weeks after the attack , the death toll was estimated to be over 6 @,@ 000 , more than twice the number of deaths eventually confirmed . The city was only able to identify remains for about 1 @,@ 600 of the World Trade Center victims . The medical examiner 's office collected " about 10 @,@ 000 unidentified bone and tissue fragments that cannot be matched to the list of the dead " . Bone fragments were still being found in 2006 by workers who were preparing to demolish the damaged Deutsche Bank Building . In 2010 , a team of anthropologists and archaeologists searched for human remains and personal items at the Fresh Kills Landfill , where seventy @-@ two more human remains were recovered , bringing the total found to 1 @,@ 845 . DNA profiling continues in an attempt to identify additional victims . The remains are being held in storage in Memorial Park , outside the New York City Medical Examiner 's facilities . It was expected that the remains would be moved in 2013 to a repository behind a wall at the 9 / 11 museum . In July 2011 , a team of scientists at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner was still trying to identify remains , in the hope that improved technology will allow them to identify other victims . On March 20 , 2015 , the <unk> victim was identified . There are still 1 @,@ 113 victims who have not been identified . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 Along with the 110 @-@ floor Twin Towers , numerous other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged , including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church . The North Tower , South Tower , the Marriott Hotel ( 3 WTC ) , and 7 WTC were completely destroyed . The U.S. Customs House ( 6 World Trade Center ) , 4 World Trade Center , 5 World Trade Center , and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged . The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later , starting in 2007 . The two buildings of the World Financial Center also suffered damage . 
 The Deutsche Bank Building across Liberty Street from the World Trade Center complex was later condemned as uninhabitable because of toxic conditions inside the office tower , and was deconstructed . The Borough of Manhattan Community College 's Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway was condemned due to extensive damage in the attacks , and is being rebuilt . Other neighboring buildings ( including 90 West Street and the Verizon Building ) suffered major damage but have been restored . World Financial Center buildings , One Liberty Plaza , the Millenium Hilton , and 90 Church Street had moderate damage and have since been restored . Communications equipment on top of the North Tower was also destroyed , but media stations were quickly able to reroute the signals and resume their broadcasts . 
 The Pentagon was severely damaged by the impact of American Airlines Flight 77 and ensuing fires , causing one section of the building to collapse . As the airplane approached the Pentagon , its wings knocked down light poles and its right engine hit a power generator before crashing into the western side of the building . The plane hit the Pentagon at the first @-@ floor level . The front part of the fuselage disintegrated on impact , while the mid and tail sections kept moving for another fraction of a second . Debris from the tail section penetrated furthest into the building , breaking through 310 feet ( 94 m ) of the three outermost of the building 's five rings . 
 = = = Rescue efforts = = = 
 The New York City Fire Department deployed 200 units ( half of the department ) to the World Trade Center . Their efforts were supplemented by numerous off @-@ duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians . The New York City Police Department sent Emergency Service Units and other police personnel , and deployed its aviation unit . Once on the scene , the FDNY , the NYPD , and the <unk> did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians . As conditions deteriorated , the NYPD aviation unit relayed information to police commanders , who issued orders for its personnel to evacuate the towers ; most NYPD officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed . With separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies , warnings were not passed along to FDNY commanders . 
 After the first tower collapsed , FDNY commanders issued evacuation warnings ; however , due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems , many firefighters never heard the evacuation orders . 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene . Within hours of the attack , a substantial search and rescue operation was launched . After months of around @-@ the @-@ clock operations , the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002 .

 = = = Immediate response = = = 
 At 8 : 32 a.m. , FAA officials were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and they in turn notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) . NORAD scrambled two F @-@ 15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8 : 53 a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials , NORAD had 9 minutes ' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked , and no notice about any of the other flights before they crashed . After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit , more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9 : 30 a.m. At 10 : 20 a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked . However , these instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action . Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition , knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets , the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes , possibly ejecting at the last moment . 
 For the first time in U.S. history , <unk> was invoked , thus stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the world . The FAA closed American airspace to all international flights , causing about five hundred flights to be turned back or redirected to other countries . Canada received 226 of the diverted flights and launched Operation Yellow Ribbon to deal with the large numbers of grounded planes and stranded passengers . 
 The 9 / 11 attacks had immediate effects upon the American people . Police and rescue workers from around the country took leaves of absence , traveling to New York City to help recover bodies from the twisted remnants of the Twin Towers . Blood donations across the U.S. surged in the weeks after 9 / 11 . 
 The deaths of adults in the attacks resulted in over 3 @,@ 000 children losing a parent . Subsequent studies documented children 's reactions to these actual losses and to feared losses of life , the protective environment in the aftermath of the attacks , and effects on surviving caregivers . 
 = = = Domestic reactions = = = 
 Following the attacks , President Bush 's approval rating soared to 90 % . On September 20 , 2001 , he addressed the nation and a joint session of the United States Congress regarding the events of September 11 and the subsequent nine days of rescue and recovery efforts , and described his intended response to the attacks . New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani 's highly visible role won him high praise in New York and nationally . 
 Many relief funds were immediately set up to assist victims of the attacks , with the task of providing financial assistance to the survivors of the attacks and to the families of victims . By the deadline for victim 's compensation on September 11 , 2003 , 2 @,@ 833 applications had been received from the families of those who were killed . 
 Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders were implemented soon after the attacks . However , Congress was not told that the United States had been under a continuity of government status until February 2002 . 
 In the largest restructuring of the U.S. government in contemporary history , the United States enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002 , creating the Department of Homeland Security . Congress also passed the USA PATRIOT Act , saying it would help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes . Civil liberties groups have criticized the PATRIOT Act , saying it allows law enforcement to invade the privacy of citizens and that it eliminates judicial oversight of law enforcement and domestic intelligence . In an effort to effectively combat future acts of terrorism , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) was given broad powers . NSA commenced warrantless surveillance of telecommunications , which was sometimes criticized since it permitted the agency " to eavesdrop on telephone and e @-@ mail communications between the United States and people overseas without a warrant " . In response to requests by various intelligence agencies , the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court permitted an expansion of powers by the U.S. government in seeking , obtaining , and sharing information on U.S. citizens as well as non @-@ U.S. people from around the world . 
 = = = = Hate crimes = = = = 
 Shortly after the attacks , President Bush made a public appearance at Washington 's largest Islamic Center and acknowledged the " incredibly valuable contribution " that millions of American Muslims made to their country and called for them " to be treated with respect . " However , numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians were reported in the days following the attacks . Sikhs were also targeted because Sikh males usually wear turbans , which are stereotypically associated with Muslims . There were reports of attacks on mosques and other religious buildings ( including the firebombing of a Hindu temple ) , and assaults on people , including one murder : Balbir Singh Sodhi , a Sikh mistaken for a Muslim , was fatally shot on September 15 , 2001 , in Mesa , Arizona . 
 According to an academic study , people perceived to be Middle Eastern were as likely to be victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time . The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims , Arabs , and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin . A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together , documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17 . Various crimes such as vandalism , arson , assault , shootings , harassment , and threats in numerous places were documented . 
 = = = = Muslim American response = = = = 
 Muslim organizations in the United States were swift to condemn the attacks and called " upon Muslim Americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families " . These organizations included the Islamic Society of North America , American Muslim Alliance , American Muslim Council , Council on American @-@ Islamic Relations , Islamic Circle of North America , and the Shari 'a Scholars Association of North America . Along with monetary donations , many Islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance , food , and shelter for victims . 
 = = = International reactions = = = 
 The attacks were denounced by mass media and governments worldwide . Across the globe , nations offered pro @-@ American support and solidarity . Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries , and Afghanistan , condemned the attacks . Iraq was a notable exception , with an immediate official statement that , " the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity " . While the government of Saudi Arabia officially condemned the attacks , privately many Saudis favored bin Laden 's cause . As in the United States , the aftermath of the attacks saw tensions increase in other countries between Muslims and non @-@ Muslims . 
 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 condemned the attacks , and expressed readiness to take all necessary steps to respond and combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with their Charter . Numerous countries introduced anti @-@ terrorism legislation and froze bank accounts they suspected of al @-@ Qaeda ties . Law enforcement and intelligence agencies in a number of countries arrested alleged terrorists . 
 British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain stood " shoulder to shoulder " with the United States . A few days later , Blair flew to Washington to affirm British solidarity with the United States . In a speech to Congress , nine days after the attacks , which Blair attended as a guest , President Bush declared " America has no truer friend than Great Britain . " Subsequently , Prime Minister Blair embarked on two months of diplomacy to rally international support for military action ; he held 54 meetings with world leaders and travelled more than 40 @,@ 000 miles ( 60 @,@ 000 km ) . 
 Tens of thousands of people attempted to flee Afghanistan following the attacks , fearing a response by the United States . Pakistan , already home to many Afghan refugees from previous conflicts , closed its border with Afghanistan on September 17 , 2001 . Approximately one month after the attacks , the United States led a broad coalition of international forces to overthrow the Taliban regime from Afghanistan for their harboring of al @-@ Qaeda . Though Pakistani authorities were initially reluctant to align themselves with the United States against the Taliban , they permitted the coalition access to their military bases , and arrested and handed over to the U.S. over 600 suspected al @-@ Qaeda members . 
 The U.S. set up the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to hold inmates they defined as " illegal enemy combatants " . The legitimacy of these detentions has been questioned by the European Union and human rights organizations . 
 On September 25 , 2001 , Iran 's fifth president , Mohammad Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary , Jack Straw , said : " Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11 . " He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran ( since 1979 ) , the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities . He also stated that " Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists . " According to Radio <unk> 's website , when the attacks ' news was released , some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran , which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran ( US interests protecting office in Iran ) , to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning . This piece of news at Radio <unk> 's website also states that in 2011 , on the anniversary of the attacks , United States Department of State , published a post at its blog , in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people 's kindness on those harsh days . After the attacks , both the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran , condemned the attacks . BBC and Time magazine published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens at their websites . According to Politico magazine , following the attacks , Sayyed Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader of Iran , " suspended the usual ' Death to America ' chants at Friday prayers " temporarily .

 At 2 : 40 p.m. in the afternoon of September 11 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was issuing rapid orders to his aides to look for evidence of Iraqi involvement . According to notes taken by senior policy official Stephen Cambone , Rumsfeld asked for , " Best info fast . Judge whether good enough hit S.H. " ( Saddam Hussein ) " at same time . Not only UBL " ( Osama bin Laden ) . Cambone 's notes quoted Rumsfeld as saying , " Need to move swiftly – Near term target needs – go massive – sweep it all up . Things related and not . " In a meeting at Camp David on September 15 the Bush administration rejected the idea of attacking Iraq in response to 9 / 11 . 
 The NATO council declared the attacks on the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter . This marked the first invocation of Article 5 , which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind . Australian Prime Minister John Howard who was in Washington D.C. during the attacks invoked Article IV of the ANZUS treaty . The Bush administration announced a War on Terror , with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al @-@ Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks . These goals would be accomplished by imposing economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists , and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing . 
 On September 14 , 2001 , the U.S. Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists . Still in effect , it grants the President the authority to use all " necessary and appropriate force " against those whom he determined " planned , authorized , committed or aided " the September 11th attacks , or who harbored said persons or groups . 
 On October 7 , 2001 , the War in Afghanistan began when U.S. and British forces initiated aerial bombing campaigns targeting Taliban and al @-@ Qaeda camps , then later invaded Afghanistan with ground troops of the Special Forces . This eventually led to the overthrow of the Taliban rule of Afghanistan on December 9 , 2001 by U.S. led coalition forces . Conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgency and the Afghan forces backed by NATO Resolute Support Mission is ongoing . The Philippines and Indonesia , among other nations with their own internal conflicts with Islamic terrorism , also increased their military readiness . 
 The military forces of the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran cooperated with each other to overthrow Taliban regime which had had conflicts with the government of Iran . Iran 's Quds Force helped US forces and Afghan rebels in 2001 uprising in Herat .

 Hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2 @,@ 500 contaminants , including known carcinogens , were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers . Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero . The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks , citing national security , but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre @-@ September 11 levels until June 2002 . 
 Health effects extended to residents , students , and office workers of Lower Manhattan and nearby Chinatown . Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust , and the victims ' names were included in the World Trade Center memorial . Approximately 18 @,@ 000 people have been estimated to have developed illnesses as a result of the toxic dust . There is also scientific speculation that exposure to various toxic products in the air may have negative effects on fetal development . A notable children 's environmental health center is currently analyzing the children whose mothers were pregnant during the WTC collapse , and were living or working nearby . A study of rescue workers released in April 2010 found that all those studied had impaired lung functions , and that 30 – 40 % were reporting little or no improvement in persistent symptoms that started within the first year of the attack . 
 Years after the attacks , legal disputes over the costs of illnesses related to the attacks were still in the court system . On October 17 , 2006 , a federal judge rejected New York City 's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers , allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city . Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks . Christine Todd Whitman , administrator of the EPA in the aftermath of the attacks , was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe . Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area . 
 The United States Congress passed the James L. Zadroga 9 / 11 Health and Compensation Act on December 22 , 2010 , and President Barack Obama signed the act into law on January 2 , 2011 . It allocated $ 4 @.@ 2 billion to create the World Trade Center Health Program , which provides testing and treatment for people suffering from long @-@ term health problems related to the 9 / 11 attacks . The WTC Health Program replaced preexisting 9 / 11 @-@ related health programs such as the Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the WTC Environmental Health Center program . 
 According to a new study , pregnant women living near the World Trade Center during the 9 / 11 terror attacks experienced higher @-@ than @-@ normal negative birth outcomes . The study by Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs found that these mothers were more likely to give birth prematurely and deliver babies with low birth weights . Their babies were also more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care units after birth ( especially baby boys ) , according to the study led by the Wilson School 's Janet Currie and Hannes <unk> .

 The attacks had a significant economic impact on United States and world markets . The stock exchanges did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17 . Reopening , the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( <unk> ) fell 684 points , or 7 @.@ 1 % , to <unk> , a record @-@ setting one @-@ day point decline . By the end of the week , the <unk> had fallen 1 @,@ 369 @.@ 7 points ( 14 @.@ 3 % ) , at the time its largest one @-@ week point drop in history . In 2001 dollars , U.S. stocks lost $ 1 @.@ 4 trillion in valuation for the week . 
 In New York City , about 430 @,@ 000 job @-@ months and $ 2 @.@ 8 billion dollars in wages were lost in the three months after the attacks . The economic effects were mainly on the economy 's export sectors . The city 's GDP was estimated to have declined by $ 27 @.@ 3 billion for the last three months of 2001 and all of 2002 . The U.S. government provided $ 11 @.@ 2 billion in immediate assistance to the Government of New York City in September 2001 , and $ 10 @.@ 5 billion in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs . Also hurt were small businesses in Lower Manhattan near the World Trade Center , 18 @,@ 000 of which were destroyed or displaced , resulting in lost jobs and their consequent wages . Assistance was provided by Small Business Administration loans , federal government Community Development Block Grants , and Economic Injury Disaster Loans . Some 31 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 square feet ( 2 @,@ 960 @,@ 000 m2 ) of Lower Manhattan office space was damaged or destroyed . Many wondered whether these jobs would return , and if the damaged tax base would recover . Studies of the economic effects of 9 / 11 show the Manhattan office real @-@ estate market and office employment were less affected than first feared , because of the financial services industry 's need for face @-@ to @-@ face interaction . 
 North American air space was closed for several days after the attacks and air travel decreased upon its reopening , leading to a nearly 20 % cutback in air travel capacity , and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling U.S. airline industry . 
 The September 11 attacks also led to the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as additional homeland security spending , totaling at least $ 5 trillion .

 The impact of 9 / 11 extends beyond geopolitics into society and culture in general . Immediate responses to 9 / 11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family , higher church attendance , and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of flags . The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists , and the attacks have subsequently been used as background , narrative or thematic elements in film , television , music and literature . Already @-@ running television shows as well as programs developed after 9 / 11 have reflected post @-@ 9 / 11 cultural concerns . 9 / 11 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena , despite lack of support from expert scientists , engineers , and historians . 9 / 11 has also had a major impact on the religious faith of many individuals ; for some it strengthened , to find consolation to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief ; others started to question their faith or lost it entirely , because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion . 
 The culture of America succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof , as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation . Psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel . 
 = = = Government policies toward terrorism = = = 
 As a result of the attacks , many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism . In Germany , where several of the 9 / 11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country 's liberal asylum policies , two major anti @-@ terrorism packages were enacted . The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany . The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement . Canada passed the Canadian Anti @-@ Terrorism Act , that nation 's first anti @-@ terrorism law . The United Kingdom passed the Anti @-@ terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 . New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 . 
 In the United States , the Department of Homeland Security was created by the Homeland Security Act to coordinate domestic anti @-@ terrorism efforts . The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers , including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge , to monitor telephone communications , e @-@ mail , and Internet use by terror suspects , and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions . The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes , and assigned sky marshals to flights . Further , the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government , rather than airports , responsible for airport security . The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage , causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy .

 = = = FBI = = = 
 Immediately after the attacks , the Federal Bureau of Investigation started <unk> , the largest criminal inquiry in the history of the United States . At its height , more than half of the FBI 's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half @-@ million leads . The FBI concluded that there was " clear and irrefutable " evidence linking al @-@ Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks . 
 The FBI was quickly able to identify the hijackers , including leader Mohamed Atta , when his luggage was discovered at Boston 's Logan Airport . Atta had been forced to check two of his three bags due to space limitations on the 19 @-@ seat commuter flight he took to Boston . Due to a new policy instituted to prevent flight delays , the luggage failed to make it aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as planned . The luggage contained the hijackers ' names , assignments and al @-@ Qaeda connections . " It had all these Arab @-@ language ( sic ) papers that amounted to the Rosetta stone of the investigation " , said one FBI agent . Within hours of the attacks , the FBI released the names and in many cases the personal details of the suspected pilots and hijackers . On September 27 , 2001 , they released photos of all 19 hijackers , along with information about possible nationalities and aliases . Fifteen of the men were from Saudi Arabia , two from the United Arab Emirates , one from Egypt , and one from Lebanon . 
 By midday , the U.S. National Security Agency and German intelligence agencies had intercepted communications pointing to Osama bin Laden . Two of the hijackers were known to have travelled with a bin Laden associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan . He and others were part of a terrorist cell in Hamburg . One of the members of the Hamburg cell was discovered to have been in communication with Khalid Sheik Mohammed who was identified as a member of al @-@ Qaeda . 
 Authorities in the United States and Britain also obtained electronic intercepts , including telephone conversations and electronic bank transfers , which indicate that Mohammed Atef , a bin Laden deputy , was a key figure in the planning of the 9 / 11 attacks . <unk> were also obtained that revealed conversations that took place days before September 11 between bin Laden and an associate in Pakistan . In those conversations , the two referred to " an incident that would take place in America on , or around , September 11 " and they discussed potential repercussions . In another conversation with an associate in Afghanistan , bin Laden discussed the " scale and effects of a forthcoming operation . " These conversations did not specifically mention the World Trade Center or Pentagon , or other specifics . 
 = = = CIA = = = 
 The Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) conducted an internal review of the agency 's pre @-@ 9 / 11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism . He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9 / 11 hijackers , Nawaf al @-@ Hazmi and Khalid al @-@ Mihdhar , as they entered the United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI . In May 2007 , senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public . One of the backers , Senator Ron Wyden said , " The American people have a right to know what the Central Intelligence Agency was doing in those critical months before 9 / 11 . "

 In February 2002 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence formed a joint inquiry into the performance of the U.S. Intelligence Community . Their 832 page report released in December 2002 detailed failings of the FBI and CIA to use available information , including about terrorists the CIA knew were in the United States , in order to disrupt the plots . The joint inquiry developed its information about possible involvement of Saudi Arabian government officials from non @-@ classified sources . Nevertheless , the Bush administration demanded 28 related pages remain classified . In December 2002 the inquiry 's chair Bob Graham ( D @-@ FL ) revealed in an interview that there was " evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States . " September 11th victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material from the Congressional inquiry and demanded an independent commission . September 11th victim families , members of congress and the Saudi Arabian government are still seeking release of the documents . In June 2016 , CIA chief John Brennan says that he believes 28 redacted pages of a congressional inquiry into 9 / 11 will soon be made public , and that they will prove that the government of Saudi Arabia had no involvement in the September 11 attacks .

 The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States ( 9 / 11 Commission ) , chaired by Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton , was formed in late 2002 to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks , including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks . On July 22 , 2004 , the Commission issued the 9 / 11 Commission Report . The report detailed the events of 9 / 11 , found the attacks were carried out by members of al @-@ Qaeda , and examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks . Formed from an independent bipartisan group of mostly former Senators , Representatives , and Governors , the commissioners explained , " We believe the 9 / 11 attacks revealed four kinds of failures : in imagination , policy , capabilities , and management " . The Commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks , and in 2011 was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented . 
 = = = Collapse of the World Trade Center = = = 
 The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) investigated the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7 WTC . The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place , and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction . The investigation into the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7 WTC was completed in August 2008 . 
 NIST found that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers ' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that , had this not occurred , the towers likely would have remained standing . A 2007 study of the north tower 's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that , since the plane 's impact had stripped off much of the structure 's thermal insulation , the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless of the number of columns cut or damaged by the impact . 
 The director of the original investigation stated that , " the towers really did amazingly well . The terrorist aircraft didn 't bring the buildings down ; it was the fire which followed . It was proven that you could take out two thirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand . " The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors , making the floors sag . The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward . With the damage to the core columns , the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings , causing them to collapse . Additionally , the report found the towers ' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones . NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7 WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently " caused a critical support column to fail , initiating a fire @-@ induced progressive collapse that brought the building down " .

 On the day of the attacks , New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani stated : " We will rebuild . We 're going to come out of this stronger than before , politically stronger , economically stronger . The skyline will be made whole again . " 
 The damaged section of the Pentagon was rebuilt and occupied within a year of the attacks . The temporary World Trade Center PATH station opened in late 2003 and construction of the new 7 World Trade Center was completed in 2006 . Work on rebuilding the main World Trade Center site was delayed until late 2006 when leaseholder Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed on financing . The construction of One World Trade Center began on April 27 , 2006 , and reached its full height on May 20 , 2013 . The spire was installed atop the building at that date , putting 1 WTC 's height at 1 @,@ 776 feet ( 541 m ) and thus claiming the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . One WTC finished construction and opened on November 3 , 2014 . 
 On the World Trade Center site , three more office towers are expected to be built one block east of where the original towers stood . Construction has begun on all three of these towers . 
 = = Memorials = = 
 In the days immediately following the attacks , many memorials and vigils were held around the world , and photographs of the dead and missing were posted around Ground Zero . A witness described being unable to " get away from faces of innocent victims who were killed . Their pictures are everywhere , on phone booths , street lights , walls of subway stations . Everything reminded me of a huge funeral , people quiet and sad , but also very nice . Before , New York gave me a cold feeling ; now people were reaching out to help each other . " 
 One of the first memorials was the Tribute in Light , an installation of 88 searchlights at the footprints of the World Trade Center towers . In New York , the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was held to design an appropriate memorial on the site . The winning design , Reflecting Absence , was selected in August 2006 , and consists of a pair of reflecting pools in the footprints of the towers , surrounded by a list of the victims ' names in an underground memorial space . 
 The Pentagon Memorial was completed and opened to the public on the seventh anniversary of the attacks in 2008 . It consists of a landscaped park with 184 benches facing the Pentagon . When the Pentagon was repaired in 2001 – 2002 , a private chapel and indoor memorial were included , located at the spot where Flight 77 crashed into the building . 
 In Shanksville , a permanent Flight 93 National Memorial is planned to include a sculpted grove of trees forming a circle around the crash site , bisected by the plane 's path , while wind chimes will bear the names of the victims . A temporary memorial is located 500 yards ( 457 m ) from the crash site . New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center and mounted on top of a platform shaped like the Pentagon . It was installed outside the firehouse on August 25 , 2008 . Many other permanent memorials are elsewhere . Scholarships and charities have been established by the victims ' families , and by many other organizations and private figures . 
 On every anniversary , in New York City , the names of the victims who died there are read out against a background of somber music . The President of the United States attends a memorial service at the Pentagon , and asks Americans to observe Patriot Day with a moment of silence . Smaller services are held in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , which are usually attended by the President 's spouse . 
 = Loyalty to Loyalty = 
 Loyalty to Loyalty is the second studio album by American indie rock band Cold War Kids . It was released on September 23 , 2008 by Downtown Records . 
 Following the success of their debut album Robbers & Cowards and spending the rest of 2007 touring across North America and Europe , the band started recording new material for their next album over the course of four months . Taking its title from the paper of the same name by American philosopher Josiah Royce , Loyalty to Loyalty carries a darker tone than its previous album by having a more experimental sound throughout and songs that deal with philosophies and politics , including suicide , crisis of faith , public security and job satisfaction . 
 The album received a generally positive reception but critics said it was uneven in terms of songwriting and performance . Loyalty to Loyalty debuted at number 21 on the Billboard 200 and spawned two singles : " Something Is Not Right with Me " and " I 've Seen Enough " , the former was voted number 38 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2008 . To promote the album , the band toured across North America , Europe and Australia with appearances at music festivals and talk shows .

 Cold War Kids released their debut album Robbers & Cowards on October 11 , 2006 . The album garnered a largely positive reception from critics , but Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media criticized the band for its songwriting , melodies and Christian symbolism , saying that " Robbers and Cowards insults our intelligence a few times too often . " Cat Dirt Sez of the San Diego CityBeat said that Hogan 's review was an example of lazy journalism , with lead guitarist Jonnie Russell saying that the reviewer wanted a wittier approach to the album rather than a thoughtful assessment of it . To promote the album , the band spent most of 2007 touring across North America and Europe through appearances at music festivals and talk shows . Bassist Matt Maust said that touring exhausted the band and that they were eager to return to the studio to write new material for their next album . 
 Loyalty to Loyalty 's title comes from a paper of the same name by American philosopher Josiah Royce , in which he challenged Friedrich Nietzsche 's ideas about " will to power " and the übermensch , " saying that the ultimate pursuit of mankind should be to live in community and embrace each other , not to try to trample each other and rise to the top . " Maust said that he could relate to that phrase with the band saying that it 's " very similar to how [ we ] conduct ourselves , the way that [ we ] write songs and the way that [ we ] view each other in the band . No one person is writing for the other person , but we are loyal to each other . We 're loyal to loyalty . " For the recording process , Maust explained that they took four months to experiment with deeper and grittier sounds they were comfortable with , compared to the first record that took eight days to create that carried " a much more polished , for @-@ radio sound . " He also commented that the overall dark tone throughout the album was the cause of constant touring across Europe , but said that it did more good than harm for the band because it led to them crafting songs that weren 't written from the perspective of being on the road . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 For the techniques used to craft the overall sound of the album , August Brown of the Los Angeles Times described the band foregoing the use of full chords and verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse structures in favor of " distant guitar effects , crunchy bass grooves and <unk> of percussion . " Regarding the songs from the album , Maust said that lead singer Nathan Willett 's lyrics were a mixture of folk tales and topical stories , stating that " a lot of people say the last record was more about yesteryear . This [ new record ] has some of that , but it 's much more today . The characters are people from today . " The thirteen tracks off the album deal with a variety of philosophies and politics that range from contemplating suicide , crisis of faith , alienation , anonymity , public security and job satisfaction . 
 Opening track " Against Privacy " was described by Willett as a " bohemian manifesto " made by a person with an affinity for the arts and wanting to live on an art commune . " Mexican Dogs " was written by the band during a trip in Mexico City where they saw a pack of unnamed three @-@ legged dogs running wild across the field . Maust said that he saw it as a metaphor for how the band operates as a whole , saying it 's " the way we conduct business as a band and art as a band . The way we write songs is very community oriented and very democratic . " The overall sound of the track is reminiscent of boogie rock . The track " Every Valley Is Not a Lake " was a song that was left off Robbers & Cowards . It tells the story about a mother lecturing her daughter about going wild in the world and the consequences she may face if not careful . The song utilizes jazz piano for its melodies . " Something Is Not Right with Me " is an upbeat track about a person losing touch with the revolving world and its constant changes from people to technology . Critics described the song as having " Stones @-@ styled bluesy licks " and " Lodger @-@ era Bowie rhythms . " 
 " Welcome to the Occupation " is about a teacher limited with his career who strives to be an artist . Willett was inspired by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song , saying that it didn 't give him " a lot of creative space to really be very inspired to be a teacher . " " Golden Gate Jumpers " is about a woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away . The tracks " Avalanche in B " and " I 've Seen Enough " were originally conceived by the band as one @-@ long track but instead cut into two songs . The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when it is coming straight towards you . The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session . " Every Man I Fall For " is about a woman 's perspective on relationships . Inspired by his own mother 's relationship with men , Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion , saying that it 's " important to me in ways , because it was something I always saw in relationships ; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat these women and how they operate in relationships . " 
 " Dreams Old Men Dream " was inspired by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man . It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he wished he had done before . " On the Night My Love Broke Through " was the last song made for the album that was recorded live . It was inspired by the works of German @-@ American poet Charles Bukowski . " Relief " is written from the perspective of a person that questions God 's way of controlling the Earth and handling its inhabitants . God himself answers the person 's question when Willett sings , " Flash flood , you got too comfortable , so I showed you , who 's really in control . " The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of " mid @-@ era Radiohead . " The album closer , " <unk> " , was inspired by a case involving Russian @-@ American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita . Willett said that it is " an apt word for the way history seeps into his songwriting today . " 
 = = Singles and promotion = = 
 The band released a one @-@ minute long " teaser " for the album on their YouTube page on June 25 , 2008 . The album 's lead single , " Something Is Not Right with Me " , first appeared on the Cold War Kids Myspace page in July 2008 and was given an official release on September 1 , 2008 through iTunes . It debuted and peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart ; their second top 40 hit on that chart . A music video directed by Sophie Muller was created for the single and premiered on the band 's YouTube page on September 17 , 2008 . The song was voted number 38 in the Triple J Hottest 100 , 2008 . A second single , " I 've Seen Enough " , was released on October 22 , 2008 but failed to chart . Two music videos were created to promote the single . The first video was directed by Vern Moen and shot in black @-@ and @-@ white , premiering on the band 's YouTube page on February 23 , 2009 . The second video was a collaboration with director Sam Jones ( who had previously directed I Am Trying to Break Your Heart : A Film About Wilco ) and his production company Tool of North America . The video was interactive and involved each band member playing his instrument solo on a dark stage , with the viewers given free rein to choose which instruments were played and to make their own mixes of the song . The video was nominated in the ' Online Film & Video ' category for Best Use of Interactive Video at the 2010 Webby Awards and won the People 's Choice Award . 
 On July 25 , the band announced a 55 @-@ city nationwide tour to promote Loyalty to Loyalty ahead of its release , beginning with Byron Bay 's Splendour in the Grass festival and finishing at Paris ' Bataclan . The tour was marked with several festival appearances at <unk> and Outside Lands . During that tour , they made television appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! , The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson .

 Loyalty to Loyalty received generally favorable reviews but music critics were divided by the band 's musical departure and Nathan Willett 's delivery in terms of performance and songwriting . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 66 , based on 20 reviews . 
 James McMahon of NME praised the band for their production and songwriting , concluding with " Almost in defiance of poor sales and cult following , <unk> and their charming second album embody everything you hoped music might be . " Bart <unk> of Paste found the album " [ to be ] more interesting than Robbers and Cowards , " praising the band for the new direction in their sound and calling it " a better @-@ than @-@ solid album from a band that seemed equipped to someday make a classic one . " Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone commended the band for continuing with their blues rock sound , saying that " Cold War Kids attack their songs with unusual intensity , infusing even the most nourish , unsettling songs – fractured narratives about hipster <unk> and suicide – with a feeling enchantment . " 
 Rudy Klap of Sputnikmusic gave praise to the production and songwriting , singling out " Golden Gate Jumpers " with having " one of the record 's best lyrics and melodies , " but was critical of Willett 's performance saying that " his voice can turn from interesting and fresh to grating and intolerable with just a few misplaced falsettos . " Heather Phares of AllMusic was also critical about Willett throughout the album , finding his voice " unfettered to the point of grating ( " Something Is Not Right with Me " ) " and lyrics to be " overworked instead of clever ( " Against Privacy " ) " but found some of the songs carried sharp songwriting skills ( " Golden Gate Jumpers " ) and flair ( " I 've Seen Enough " ) concluding that " Cold War Kids deserve credit for their ambitions , but there 's a fine line between trying hard and trying too hard . More often than not , Loyalty to Loyalty takes a disappointing stumble on it . " 
 Chris Mincher of The A.V. Club was disappointed with the album , finding it stripped of its songwriting and control in lead singer Nathan Willett 's voice from their debut album . Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk found the album lacking in terms of instrumentals and songwriting saying , " It 's easy to see the great ideas from previous songs at work here , but there seems to be an intentional restraint placed on the band 's likeable pop inclinations . " The Guardian criticized the album for its lackluster blues rock production and Willett 's performance , saying " his voice is too drearily clean @-@ cut to deliver a true emotional punch . " Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media felt that the album was hampered by the band 's uninspired musicianship and songwriting and the hype surrounding them , saying that " Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed , but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses , Loyalty To Loyalty is proof that their detractors can say the same thing .

 = = Plot = = 
 Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) finds managing her household without her husband Jim ( John Krasinski ) to be more difficult than anticipated , as she struggles with duties such as taking out the trash . Her already frazzled condition worsens when she finds lice on her daughter Cece , leaving her no choice but to wash all the clothing in the house . At work the next day , she notices Meredith Palmer ( Kate Flannery ) frantically scratching her head , and realizes she may have transferred the lice from Cece to the office . She initiates an investigation and Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) finds that all of the employees except Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) , Nellie Bertram ( Catherine Tate ) , Phyllis Vance ( Phyllis Smith ) , and Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) have lice . Given her disregard for cleanliness , the employees assume Meredith is responsible ; Pam defends her but neglects to admit her guilt . To eliminate the lice , Meredith shaves her head .

 USA Today writer Whitney Matheson called the episode " the funniest ep this season " and that " it also ranks as one of the best since Steve Carell 's departure in 2011 " . She lauded Flannery 's performance , writing that " the actress has never made me laugh harder than on last night 's episode " . Mark Trammell of TV Equals called the episode " excellent " ; he was particularly pleased with the episode 's humor . Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode four out of five stars and said that it allowed Meredith , who until the episode had been " a mostly one @-@ dimensional source of promiscuity jokes " to have " two dimensions for once " . He also applauded Fischer 's performance , writing that it " would make for a terrific Emmy submission episode " . 
 <unk> Zaman of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B " and criticized its excessive narrative threads . She felt that Pam and Jim 's separation brought " out the worst in them " , but that " the same situations that force Jim and Pam to confront their flaws reveal the overlooked strengths of a couple of less prominent characters " . She also wrote that the ending was " touching " because it humanized Meredith and made her out as a " badass " . Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a score of 7 @.@ 8 out of 10 , denoting a " good " episode . She felt that the final scenes with Pam and Meredith singing were " a nice callback to the show 's glory days " and made the ending feel " layered and grounded " . White also applauded the short sequence that showed many of the office staff <unk> going about their day with mayonnaise on their heads , noting that the pacing was reminiscent of the first season when the episodes " had room to breathe " . White , however , did feel that Jim 's storyline was too reminiscent of the story arc in the fifth season when Pam went to art school . 
 Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote an extremely negative review of the episode and called it " terrible " . He felt that Pam 's behavior due to Jim being gone was uncalled for . Furthermore , he felt that Dwight " swung too far into the territory that is known as ' annoying caricature ' " . Campbell did , however , write highly of Ellie Kemper , saying that " she 's played [ her character ] funnily and warmly as anyone else " . Several reviewers argued that the episode functioned as a filler episode . Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called it the " epitome of filler " . ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx wrote that " if everyone were in the same location this would be a bottle episode " . Furthermore , Darryl 's subplot was mostly criticized . Tedder wrote that while " it 's fine to have a story line where someone pursues something and then realizes it wasn 't what it was cracked up to be " he wished that the show had actually developed Val as a character . White wrote that she did not enjoy seeing " this manipulative version of Darryl " because it contrasted with his earlier characterization in episodes like " The Deposition " . Zaman called the subplot " surprising " .

 Christina Milian is the self @-@ titled debut studio album by American singer Christina Milian released by Def Soul on October 9 , 2001 . Its release was postponed because of the September 11 attacks , which occurred just two weeks before its release date . Her label opted to release it later that year in Europe , but due to changing music trends , Milian decided not to release the album domestically . 
 Milian made her first professional musical appearance on Ja Rule 's single " Between Me and You " , which led to a record deal with Def Soul and The Inc . Records in 2000 . Milian traveled to Sweden where she collaborated with several producers , most notably Bloodshy & Avant , who helmed five tracks . Milian co @-@ wrote eleven of the twelve songs on the album , taking inspiration from personal experiences . The album 's musical style is mostly dance and R & B , and critics noted similarities to her contemporaries Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera . Milian was displeased by Def Soul 's portrayal of her image , which she felt was constantly changing and confusing the audience . 
 The critical response to Christina Milian was mixed ; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single " AM to PM " , while others found that it lacked original ideas . The album peaked at number 23 in the UK , selling a total of 101 @,@ 986 copies , and achieved Silver certification . Internationally , the album also charted in the Netherlands , Sweden and France . The album spawned two singles , " AM to PM " and When You Look at Me " , which charted worldwide .

 When Milian moved to Los Angeles at the age of 13 , she wanted to be in the record business , but did not know how to obtain a recording contract . After living in Los Angeles for six months , Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney " Darkchild " Jerkins . Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once he heard her sing , they began working together . For a year and a half , Milian went into a studio everyday and worked with Jerkins , which is where she started meeting people in the record business . 
 Milian began writing songs at the age of seventeen because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract . According to Milian , every time she recorded a song , the producer would refuse to give her the demo , or would write lyrics that she did not agree with . She felt that she had to write a song , record a demo , and send it out on her own . 
 Milian made her first professional musical appearance on Ja Rule 's second studio album Rule 3 : 36 , performing vocals on the song " Between Me and You " . The song was released as the album 's lead single in 2000 , peaking at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 , and in the top thirty of the UK Singles Chart . Milian then co @-@ wrote and performed backing vocals for the track " Play " for Jennifer Lopez 's album J.Lo ( 2001 ) . " Play " was released as the second single from the album and was a commercial success , peaking at number 3 in the UK and number 18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 .

 Following her collaboration with Ja Rule , Milian signed a deal with Island Def Jam Music Group in 2000 . Milian traveled to Sweden and recorded her self @-@ titled debut album , working with the popular producers of that time . Milian collaborated with Bloodshy & Avant , Jermaine Dupri , Focus , Irv Gotti , Mark Hill , Montell Jordan and Evan Rogers . Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times later suggested that instead of launching her career off the success of " Between Me and You " , and by recording in Sweden without the " platinum production touch " of Irv Gotti , the owner of The Inc . Records , the momentum created by the song had evaporated . Milian received writing credit for eleven of the twelve songs on the album . It was during the production of the album that Milian had first started to write songs , and wrote about things that she could relate to at the time . 
 Milian described the sound of the album as " hip hop under @-@ toned with nice , pop melodies " , and later said the genre of the album was " bubble @-@ gum pop " . She described lead single " AM to PM " as a " very pop " and " fun , party / club song " . The genre of the album was described by one critic as " light @-@ hearted , energetic R & B pop tunes " . Critics compared Milian to Janet Jackson and Aaliyah . Sonically , the album was said to stick " rigidly to the <unk> @-@ snorting pop formula of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera " . One reviewer compared Milian to other singers of her generation , and found that " while Spears has gone raunchy with ' I Love Rock ' n ' Roll ' , Christina Aguilera down and dirty on Stripped , and even clean @-@ cut Mandy Moore has brashly cut her hair Felicity @-@ style , Milian still seems young and real . " The critic also compared Milian to Beyoncé Knowles , " while Beyonce is shaking her bootylicious body like crazy on ' Crazy In Love ' , Milian is simply enjoying becoming a young star . " 
 Many live instruments were used during the album 's production , especially violin . Milian named " You Make Me Laugh " one of her favorite songs on the album . It was the first song written by Milian for the album , and she worked with Bloodshy for the song 's production . The album 's second and final single , " When You Look at Me " , was written by Milian . Using her school days as the inspiration for the song , Milian said that " when I was growing up , I found people were always trying to label me . The first day of school it would be like ' Here comes this girl all dressed up . She thinks she 's all that ' and they didn 't even know me . The message behind ' When You Look At Me ' is never judge a book by its cover . " Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album , however she did not want to put him " on just any song " , and wanted to make sure it was the right song for him . Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track " A Girl Like Me " , but he ended up rapping on " Get Away " . Milian co @-@ wrote the track " Twitch " with R & B singer Montell Jordan , which explains that men have a certain twitch of their shoulders whenever they tell lies .

 The critical response to the album was mixed to generally positive . Imran Ahmed of the New Musical Express enjoyed " genius single ' AM to PM ' " , and praised the tracks " Got to Have You " and " When You Look at Me " . Ahmed guessed that " beneath the froth , there 's a certain depth of soul " in Milian , and thought " Get Away " had similar excellent results to her previous collaboration with Ja Rule , " Between Me and You " . The reviewer also commended the lyrics of " Twitch " , which he thought was " remarkable for being what may be the first ever song about someone with a facial tic " . Ahmed was impressed that alongside the impressive production credit list , it was " still Milian 's name that tops the list of executive producers " , and predicted , " genius can 't be more than a few albums away " . Contrastingly , Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie described the album as " relentlessly ordinary " , and suggested that Milian needed original ideas . The reviewer felt that apart from " AM to PM " and " You Make Me Laugh " there was nothing above the average . Lynch said that if Milian " really wants to compete with the big girls , she badly needs to spice up her tired formula . " 
 A reviewer for Dawn commended the album for being " full of danceable , likeable tracks , and even the occasional , successful ballad like ' Until I Get Over You ' " . The reviewer called the album to be " a refreshing change with its charming lyrics and teen outlook " . " AM to PM " was said to hint at " quite a lot of talent " , and was praised for its " slick lyrics , a fast pace , and a phat vibe " . The reviewer also praised " When You Look at Me " , " Get Away " , and " Got to Have You " . Carmen Meyer of iafrica.com found the " smooth , groovy and refreshing " album to be filled " with light @-@ hearted and catchy tracks , which can be enjoyed either in a club , your car or even when chilling at home . " She commented on the album 's tracks , which ranged from " melodic and heart @-@ rending ballads to funky dance beats that are bound to keep you moving " .

 When Lisa writes a letter to the International Olympic Committee , they decide that Springfield will be home to the next Olympics . To honor the Olympics , there is a contest for the games ' mascot . Homer creates a mascot for the Olympic Games named <unk> , the Springfield Spring , which becomes the mascot ( much to Patty and Selma 's dismay , who created a mascot named <unk> the Cigarette ) and everyone in Springfield prepares for the games . When the IOC inspects the town , things go well until Bart does a stand @-@ up comedy routine that insults foreign nations , which only Principal Skinner , Homer , and the children find funny . In response , the IOC decides not to let Springfield have the Olympics anymore ( they award it to Shelbyville , who presumably and chronologically lost it to Sydney ) , and Superintendent Chalmers blames Skinner for putting Bart on stage with his racy jokes . Skinner initially keeps his case strong by telling Chalmers that the comedy worked well during rehearsal , but to prevent losing his job , he makes every one of the school 's students do 20 hours of community service . After sending Milhouse to collect medical waste on the beach and leaving Martin to start a basketball program between inter @-@ city gangs , Skinner has Bart assigned to work at the Springfield Retirement Castle , where Lisa also works voluntarily . Bart is dismayed at how little the seniors are allowed to do . 
 Meanwhile , Homer gets 1 @,@ 000 springs he intended to sell as Olympic mascots .

Bart takes the seniors on a trip on the town and on a boat ride , and Lisa is initially shocked to see these things happen , but nevertheless , she is quite impressed by what Bart does for the seniors . The seniors have fun until their boat crashes into Mr. Burns 's schooner . The boat begins to sink and the seniors turn on Bart , but Grampa defends him , saying Bart gave them the best fun they have had in years . However , the springs that Homer flushed down the toilet save them , causing the boat to bob up at the surface long enough for the Coast Guard to rescue everyone . Bart finishes his community service time , but decides to help the seniors still enjoy themselves .

 " The Old Man and the " C " Student " was directed by Mark Kirkland and was the first episode Julie Thacker wrote for The Simpsons . It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 25 , 1999 . The episode 's plot was based on a " disastrous " school program , in which students had to participate in community service in order to be allowed to advance to the next grade . Thacker , whose oldest daughter was a student at the school , was signed up to do community service at an old folks home in the town they lived in . It became the inspiration for the episode 's A @-@ story , while the B @-@ story , which involved Homer selling springs , was conceived by Thacker 's husband Mike Scully , an executive producer and the showrunner for the episode . 
 In a scene in the episode , Lenny gets one of Homer 's springs stuck in his eye . Lenny 's eye injuries have since become a running gag , and " The Old Man and the " C " Student " " started the trend " , according to Thacker . The " clunky , Up With People @-@ type " dance that the students perform for the Olympic jury was partly demonstrated during the animatic by Simpsons writer George Meyer . When Meyer later watched the episode , he found out , to his " horror " , that he had been given a choreographer credit at the end of the episode . The episode features American fitness expert Jack Lalanne as himself . In the DVD commentary for the episode , Scully stated that Lalanne was " very funny " and that he " gave a great performance " . Lalanne 's lines were recorded separately from the series main cast members . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode title is a reference to the novel and film " The Old Man and the Sea " . In the beginning of the episode , a sign reading " International Olympic Committee " can be seen . The logo below the text parodies the logo of the real International Olympic Committee . Because they did not want to " upset " the committee , the Simpsons staff slightly altered the logo by changing the colors and not making the rings interlock . In a scene in the episode , the old people can be seen watching an edited and over @-@ dubbed version of the 1939 film Gone With the Wind . The nurse that works in the old folks home is based on Nurse Ratched from the American drama film One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . The film is referenced again in a scene where Bart takes the old folks on a boat trip and a scene where a Native American chief in the old folk 's home throws a dishwasher through a window , and jumps out , mirroring the last scene in the film . The character then returns , and hands Lisa a pamphlet that reads " Prop 217 " . The pamphlet is a reference to Proposition 217 , a proposition that allowed Native Americans to operate casinos in certain states . It is also a reference to the day Scully and Thacker met , which was on February 17 . The scene in which Smithers is drawing a portrait of Mr Burns is a reference to the 1997 drama film Titanic . The scene where the old people celebrate their escape from the home is a reference to a sequence from The Beatles ' 1964 film A Hard Day 's Night . Both are set to the group 's song " Can 't Buy Me Love " , although in the episode the song is a cover performed by NRBQ . During the end credits , an album cover reading " A Bart Day 's Night " , a reference to The Beatles ' album A Hard Day 's Night , the film 's soundtrack , is shown . " Can 't Buy Me Love " also plays over the end credits .

 = Lynching of Jesse Washington = 
 Jesse Washington , a teenage black farmhand , was lynched in Waco , Texas , on May 15 , 1916 , in what became a well @-@ known example of racially motivated lynching . Washington was convicted of raping and murdering Lucy Fryer , the wife of his white employer in rural Robinson , Texas . There were no eyewitnesses to the crime , but during his interrogation by the McLennan County sheriff he signed a confession and described the location of the murder weapon . 
 Washington was tried for murder in Waco , in a courtroom filled with furious locals . He entered a guilty plea and was quickly sentenced to death . After his sentence was pronounced , he was dragged out of the court by observers and lynched in front of Waco 's city hall . Over 10 @,@ 000 spectators , including city officials and police , gathered to watch the attack . There was a celebratory atmosphere at the event , and many children attended during their lunch hour . Members of the mob castrated Washington , cut off his fingers , and hung him over a bonfire . He was repeatedly lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours . After the fire was extinguished , his charred torso was dragged through the town and parts of his body were sold as souvenirs . A professional photographer took pictures as the event unfolded , providing rare imagery of a lynching in progress . The pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco . 
 Although the lynching was supported by many Waco residents , it was condemned by newspapers around the United States . The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) hired Elisabeth Freeman to investigate ; she conducted a detailed probe in Waco , despite the reluctance of many residents to speak about the event . After receiving Freeman 's report on the lynching , NAACP co @-@ founder and editor W. E. B. Du Bois published an in @-@ depth report featuring photographs of Washington 's charred body in The Crisis , and the NAACP featured his death in their anti @-@ lynching campaign . Although Waco had been regarded as a modern , progressive city , the lynching demonstrated that it still tolerated racial violence ; the event was nicknamed the " Waco horror " . The city subsequently gained a reputation for racism , but city leaders prevented violence on several occasions in subsequent decades . Historians have noted that Washington 's death helped alter the way that lynching was viewed ; the publicity it received curbed public support for the practice , which became viewed as barbarism rather than as an acceptable form of justice . In the 1990s and 2000s , some Waco residents lobbied for a monument to the lynching , an idea that has failed to garner wide support in the city . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , a significant number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States , primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia , Mississippi , and Texas . Between 1890 and 1920 , about 3 @,@ 000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs , usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks . Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans , to whom they attributed a criminal nature . Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures . Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society , opponents of the practice emerged , including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . 
 In 1916 , Waco , Texas , was a prosperous city with a population of more than 30 @,@ 000 . After it became associated with crime in the 19th century , community leaders sought to change its reputation , sending delegations across the U.S. to promote it as an idyllic locale . By the 1910s , Waco 's economy had become strong and the city had gained a pious reputation . A black middle class had emerged in the area , along with two black colleges . In the mid @-@ 1910s , blacks comprised about twenty percent of the Waco population . In her 2006 study of lynching , journalist Patricia Bernstein describes the city as then having a " thin veneer " of peace and respectability . Racial tension was present in the city : local newspapers often emphasized crimes committed by African Americans , and Sank Majors , a black man , was hanged from a bridge near downtown Waco in 1905 . A small number of anti @-@ lynching activists lived in the area , including the president of Waco 's Baylor University . In 1916 , several factors led to an increase in local racism , including the screening of The Birth of a Nation , a movie that promoted white supremacy and glorified the Ku Klux Klan , and the sale of photographs of a recently lynched black man in Temple , Texas .

 In Robinson , Texas , Lucy Fryer was murdered while alone at her house on May 8 , 1916 . She and her husband George were English immigrants , and had become well respected in the rural community where they operated a farm . News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff , Samuel Fleming , who immediately investigated with a team of law enforcement officers , a group of local men , and a doctor . The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt @-@ force trauma to the head . The local men suspected that Jesse Washington , a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old black man who had worked on the Fryers ' farm for five months , was responsible ; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy 's body was discovered . That night , sheriff 's deputies traveled to Washington 's home , finding him in front of the house wearing blood @-@ stained overalls . He attributed the stains to a nosebleed . Jesse , his brother William , and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff 's department ; although Jesse 's parents and brother were released after a short time , he was held for further interrogation . His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer 's death , but offered contradictory details about his actions . Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder . 
 On May 9 , Fleming took Washington to Hill County to prevent vigilante action . The Hill County sheriff , Fred Long , questioned Washington with Fleming ; Washington told them he had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules , and described the murder weapon and its location . Long brought Washington to Dallas , Texas , while Fleming returned to Robinson . Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated . In Dallas , Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the rape and murder of Fryer ; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers . Newspapers sensationalized the murder , describing Fryer 's attempts to resist Washington 's attack , although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist . A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail , but dispersed after they did not find Washington . Nevertheless , a local paper praised their effort . That night , a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer . 
 On May 11 , a grand jury was assembled in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington ; the trial was scheduled for May 15 . The Times @-@ Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington 's fate . Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm ; his address was well received . Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers . His lawyers prepared no defense , and noted that he appeared placid in the days before the trial . 
 = = Trial and lynching = = 
 On the morning of May 15 , Waco 's courthouse quickly filled to capacity in anticipation of the trial : the crowd nearly prevented some jurors from entering . Observers also filled the sidewalks around the courthouse ; over two thousand spectators were present . Attendees were almost entirely white , but a few quiet members of Waco 's black community were present . As Washington was led into the courtroom , one audience member pointed a gun at him , but was quickly overpowered . As the trial commenced , the judge attempted to keep order , insisting that the audience remain silent . Jury selection proceeded quickly : the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution . Bernstein states that the trial had a " kangaroo @-@ court atmosphere " . The judge asked Washington for a plea , and explained the potential sentences . Washington muttered a response , possibly " yes " , interpreted by the court as a guilty plea . The prosecution described the charges , and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryer 's body . The doctor discussed how Fryer died , but did not mention rape . The prosecution rested , and Washington 's attorney asked him whether he had committed the offense . Washington replied , " That 's what I done [ sic ] " and quietly apologized . The lead prosecutor addressed the courtroom and declared that the trial had been conducted fairly , prompting an ovation from the crowd . The jury was then sent to deliberate . 
 After four minutes of deliberation , the jury 's foreman announced a guilty verdict and a sentence of death . The trial lasted about one hour . Court officers approached Washington to escort him away , but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators , who seized Washington and dragged him outside . Washington initially fought back , biting one man , but was soon beaten . A chain was placed around his neck and he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob ; on the way downtown , he was stripped , stabbed , and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects . By the time he arrived at city hall , a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building . Washington , <unk> and covered in blood , was doused with oil , hung from the tree by a chain , and then lowered to the ground . Members of the crowd cut off his fingers , toes , and genitals . The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death . German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering . Washington attempted to climb the chain , but was unable to , owing to his lack of fingers . The fire was extinguished after two hours , allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching , including Washington 's bones and links of the chain . One attendee kept part of Washington 's genitalia ; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington 's head to sell as souvenirs . By the time that the fire was extinguished , parts of Washington 's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred . His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town . Washington 's remains were transported to Robinson , where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it . 
 The lynching drew a large crowd , including the mayor and the chief of police , although lynching was illegal in Texas . Sheriff Fleming told his deputies not to stop the lynching , and no one was arrested after the event . Bernstein speculates that his actions were motivated by a desire to harshly deal with crime to help his candidacy for re @-@ election that year . Mayor John <unk> may have also encouraged the mob owing to the belief that a lynching would be politically beneficial . The crowd numbered 15 @,@ 000 at its peak . Telephones helped spread word of the lynching , allowing spectators to gather more quickly than was previously possible . Local media reported that " shouts of delight " were heard as Washington burned , although they noted that some attendees disapproved . The Waco Semi @-@ Weekly Tribune maintained that a number of black Waco residents attended , a claim that historian Grace Hale of the University of Virginia sees as dubious . Waco residents , who likely had no connection with the rural Fryer family , comprised most of the crowd . Some people from nearby rural communities traveled to the city before the trial to witness the events . As the lynching occurred at midday , children from local schools walked downtown to observe , some climbing into trees for a better view . Many parents approved of their children 's attendance , hoping that the lynching would reinforce a belief in white supremacy . Some Texans saw participation in a lynching as a rite of passage for young men . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Fred Gildersleeve , a Waco @-@ based professional photographer , arrived at city hall shortly before the lynching , possibly at the mayor 's request , and photographed the event . His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress , rather than typical lynching photography , which only shows dead victims . Gildersleeve 's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington 's body ; some may have been taken by an assistant . Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents , some as young as twelve , gathered around Washington 's body . The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities . Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew that no one would be prosecuted for Washington 's death . Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out @-@ of @-@ town relatives , several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them , fearing that the images would come to characterize the town . 
 In the days after the lynching , newspapers fiercely condemned the event . Within a week , news of the lynching was published as far away as London . A New York Times editorial opined that , " in no other land even pretending to be civilized could a man be burned to death in the streets of a considerable city amid the savage exultation of its inhabitants " . In the New York Age , James Weldon Johnson described the members of the lynch mob as " lower than any other people who at present inhabit the earth " . Although many southern newspapers had previously defended lynching as a defense of civilized society , after Washington 's death , they did not cast the practice in such terms . The Montgomery Advertiser wrote that , " no savage was ever more cruel ... than the men who participated in this horrible , almost unbelievable episode " . In Texas , the Houston Chronicle and the Austin American criticized the lynch mob , but spoke highly of Waco . The Morning News of Dallas reported the story , but did not publish an accompanying editorial . In Waco , the Times @-@ Herald refrained from editorializing about the lynching . The Waco Morning News briefly noted their disapproval of the lynching , focusing their criticism on papers they felt had attacked the city unfairly . They cast the condemnatory editorials in the aftermath of the lynching as " Holier than thou " remarks . A writer for the Waco Semi @-@ Weekly Tribune defended the lynching , stating that Washington deserved to die and that blacks should view Washington 's death as a warning against crime . The paper later carried an editorial from the Houston Post condemning the lynching , characterizing the column as part of an attack on the city . 
 Some Waco residents condemned the lynching , including local ministers and leaders of Baylor University . The judge who presided over Washington 's trial later stated that members of the lynch mob were " murderers " ; the jury 's foreman told the NAACP that he disapproved of their actions . Some people who witnessed the lynching recorded persistent nightmares and psychological trauma . A few citizens contemplated staging a protest against the lynching , but declined to do so owing to concerns about reprisals or the appearance of hypocrisy . After the lynching , town officials maintained that it was attended by a small group of malcontents . Although their claim is contradicted by photographic evidence , several histories of Waco have repeated this assertion . There were no negative repercussions for <unk> or Police Chief John McNamara : although they made no attempt to stop the mob , they remained well respected in Waco . As was common with such attacks , no one was prosecuted for the lynching . 
 Although leaders of Waco 's black community gave public condolences to the Fryer family , they complained about Washington 's lynching only in private . One exception was the Paul Quinn Weekly newspaper , of Texas ' Paul Quinn College — an all @-@ black institution — which published several articles that criticized the lynch mob and city leadership . In one article , the author proclaimed that Jesse Washington was innocent and George Fryer was guilty . A. T. Smith , the paper 's editor , was subsequently convicted of libel . George Fryer also sued the college for libel ; his vehemence caused some Robinson residents to suspect that he played a part in his wife 's death . Bernstein states that it is " highly unlikely " that George Fryer played a role in Lucy 's murder , but notes that there is the " shadow of a possibility " that he bore some guilt . 
 = = NAACP investigation and campaign = = 
 The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman , a women 's suffrage activist from New York City , to investigate the lynching . She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there . After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May , she began her assignment in Waco , posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching . She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event . She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve , who was initially reluctant to provide them . Although she feared for her safety , she enjoyed the challenge of the investigation . When speaking with city leaders , Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north . Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders . Local African Americans , however , gave her a warm reception . 
 Fleming and the judge who presided over the trial each spoke with her ; both argued that they did not deserve blame for the lynching . A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate , and that all attempts to teach him to read had been futile . Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington 's lynching , although many disliked that his body was mutilated . She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer , a saloonkeeper , and several employees of an ice company . The NAACP did not publicly identify them . Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer , and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him . 
 W. E. B. Du Bois was incensed by news of the attack , saying " any talk of the triumph of Christianity , or the spread of human culture , is idle twaddle as long as the Waco lynching is possible in the United States " . After receiving Freeman 's report , he placed an image of Washington 's body on the cover of an issue of The Crisis , the NAACP 's newsletter , which discussed the event . The issue was titled " The Waco Horror " and was published as an eight @-@ page supplement to the July edition . Du Bois popularized " Waco Horror " as a name for Washington 's lynching ; the Houston Chronicle and the New York Times had previously used the word " horror " to describe the event . In 1916 , The Crisis had a circulation of about 30 @,@ 000 , three times the size of the NAACP 's membership . Although the paper had campaigned against lynching in the past , this issue was the first that contained images of an attack . The NAACP 's board was initially hesitant to publish such graphic content , but Du Bois insisted on doing so , arguing that uncensored coverage would push white Americans to support change . In addition to images , the issue included accounts of the lynching that Freeman obtained from Waco residents . Du Bois wrote The Crisis ' article on the lynching ; he edited and organized Freeman 's report for publication , although she was not named in the issue . The article concluded with a call to support the anti @-@ lynching movement . The NAACP distributed the report to hundreds of newspapers and politicians , a campaign that led to wide condemnation of the lynching . Many white observers were disturbed by the southerners who celebrated the lynching . The Crisis included more images of lynchings in subsequent issues . Washington 's death received continued discussion in The Crisis . Oswald Garrison Villard wrote in a later edition of the paper that " the crime at Waco is a challenge to our American civilization " . 
 Other black newspapers also carried significant coverage of the lynching , as did liberal papers such as The New Republic and The Nation . Freeman traveled around the U.S. to speak to audiences about her investigation , maintaining that a shift in public opinion could accomplish more than legislative actions . Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington 's , the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre . Leaders of the NAACP hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington 's death , but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost . 
 The NAACP had struggled financially around that time . Their anti @-@ lynching campaign saw some success in raising funds , but it was scaled back as the U.S. entered World War I. NAACP president Joel Elias Spingarn later stated that the group 's campaign placed " lynching into the public mind as something like a national problem " . In her 2006 study of lynching , Bernstein describes this anti @-@ lynching campaign as the " barest beginnings of a battle that would last many years " . 
 The number of lynchings in the U.S. increased in the late 1910s . Additional lynchings occurred in Waco in the 1920s , partially owing to the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan . By the late 1920s , however , Waco authorities had begun to protect blacks from lynching , as in the case of Roy Mitchell . Authorities feared that negative publicity generated by lynchings — such as the NAACP 's campaign following Washington 's death — would hinder their efforts to attract investors . The NAACP fought to portray lynching as a savage , barbaric practice , an idea which eventually gained traction in the public mind . Bernstein credits the group 's efforts with helping to end " the worst public atrocities of the racist system " in the Waco region . 
 = = Analysis and legacy = = 
 In 2011 , Berg concluded that Washington probably murdered Fryer , but doubted that he raped her . The same year , Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued that Washington was probably innocent of both charges . Bernstein notes that Washington 's motives have never been established . She also states that his confession could have been coerced , and that the murder weapon — perhaps the strongest evidence against him — could have been planted by authorities . 
 Bernstein states that Washington 's lynching was a unique event because it occurred in a city with a reputation for progressiveness , but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture . Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators . William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington 's lynching , maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated . Hale posits that Washington 's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching , demonstrating its acceptance in modernized , 20th @-@ century cities . She notes that Washington 's lynching illustrates how technological innovations , such as telephones and inexpensive photographs , could empower lynch mobs but also increase society 's condemnation of their actions . 
 In their 2004 study of lynching , Peter <unk> and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice , arguing Waco residents felt a sense of collective righteousness after Washington 's death , as they saw him as the presence of evil in the community . Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging , drawing , and quartering people convicted of high treason . 
 Amy Louise Wood of Illinois State University writes that the event was " a defining moment in the history of lynching , " arguing that with Washington 's death , " lynching began to sow the seeds of its own collapse . " Although the spectacle of violent mob attacks had previously benefited white supremacists , Wood contends that after Washington 's death was publicized , the anti @-@ lynching movement included images of racially motivated brutality in their campaigns . Carrigan notes that Washington 's death may have received more public attention than any other lynching in the United States , and sees the event as a " turning point in the history of mob violence in Central Texas " . Although the outcry it provoked did not end the practice , it helped bring an end to public support of such attacks by city leaders . Carrigan states that the lynching was " the most infamous day in the history of central Texas " until the Waco siege of 1993 . 
 After the practice of lynching was suppressed in central Texas , it received little attention from local historians . However , Waco developed a reputation for racism — propagated in part by American history textbooks — to the vexation of the city 's white residents . In the years following the lynching , African Americans often held Waco in disdain , and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution . White leaders of Waco took a non @-@ violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement , possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again . 
 Blues musician Sammy Price recorded a version of " Hesitation Blues " that referenced Washington 's lynching . Price lived in Waco as a child , possibly at the time of Washington 's death . Waco @-@ based novelist Madison Cooper featured a lynching , thought to be based on Washington 's death , as a key event in his 1952 novel <unk> , Texas . 
 In the 1990s , Lawrence Johnson , a member of Waco 's city council , viewed pictures of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum , and began to lobby for a monument to the lynching . In 2002 , Lester Gibson , another member of the city council , proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched . He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city . The ideas were discussed , but proved unfruitful . In the 2000s , the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce ; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker on the site of the lynching . Some descendants of Fryer objected to the proposed memorial .

 = Love Kraft = 
 Love Kraft is the seventh studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals , released on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom . The album was recorded in Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and was something of a departure for the band , with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point . In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible . The album 's name was taken from a sex shop , Love Craft , near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries ' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft . 
 Critical response was generally positive with some reviews claiming the album was the best of the group 's career . However , a few reviewers expressed reservations that Love Kraft was " merely a very good Super Furry Animals effort " and was not as impressive as the band 's previous records . The track " Lazer Beam " was released as a single and reached # 28 in the UK Singles Chart . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Love Kraft was recorded in Figueres , a small city in Catalonia , Spain . According to Rhys the band found themselves in the " unusual " position of recording their seventh album together and began looking at groups who had made lots of records , such as Fleetwood Mac and The Beach Boys . These bands had made " foreign records " ( Tusk and Holland respectively ) so the Super Furries decided to do the same although on " a much tighter budget . " Leaving their usual Cardiff studio behind had an effect on the songs according to Rhys : 
 The band did a lot of experimenting and arranging in Cardiff before going into the studio , as a result of which Love Kraft was recorded in just three weeks . Drummer Dafydd Ieuan also attributes the album sessions ' speedy conclusion to producer Mario Caldato Jr. who was very good at keeping the group together and on the right track . 
 The album represented a departure from the band 's previous working methods : although all five members had always contributed to the development of the songs , Gruff Rhys had been the main songwriter . On Love Kraft this was no longer the case , as Rhys , Huw Bunford , Dafydd Ieuan and Cian Ciaran all contributed songs and lead vocals . The group also abandoned their usual practise of picking songs on their individual merit , instead choosing tracks that would work well together and " create a sound that was as cohesive as possible " . Of the " 30 @-@ 40 " songs written by band members the group chose " the more introspective ones " which meant that some of Rhys 's tracks were left off the album as they were " energetic and poppy " and " didn 't really fit in with everybody else 's work " . 
 Several ' found sounds ' were recorded and used on the album including the buzzing of a Brazilian electrical substation , the sound of pool balls being rubbed against each other and a recording of Huw Bunford jumping into a swimming pool . The latter opens the album , preceding the intro to " Zoom ! " . 
 Love Kraft was mixed in a suburb of Rio de Janeiro at the request of Brazilian born Caldato . According to Rhys the band toyed with the idea of using Latin musical elements and had fantasies of " Marcos Valle doing backing vocals , and getting Rogerio Duprat to arrange the strings " but ultimately thought it would be a " bit too embarrassing " and actively tried not to make a " Brazilian sounding " record . This point was echoed by Guto Pryce in an interview with Birmingham 's Metro although he conceded that " in Rio music is everywhere . The beats and rhythms are non @-@ stop so that probably seeped into our minds as a subconscious influence . " 
 The album is named after a sex shop , Lovecraft Limited , near the <unk> Management offices on Cowbridge Road , Cardiff and is also a reference to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft . In a 2005 interview with The Daily Telegraph , Gruff Rhys explained that the name also stems from the fact that the record has " a general warm glow of love " and that it was originally conceived as a " love record " before " some of the lyrics went completely off the rails " .

 Love Kraft was released on CD , SACD , vinyl and as a digital download on 22 August 2005 in the United Kingdom and was the band 's last release for Sony 's Epic imprint before they moved to independent label Rough Trade . The album reached # 19 in the UK Albums Chart . In America the album was released on 13 September 2005 by Beggars Banquet US . " Lazer Beam " was the only track to be released as a single from the album , reaching # 28 in the UK Singles Chart . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 The album received a generally positive reaction from critics . British newspaper The Guardian described Love Kraft as the band 's " best album yet " and musicOMH claimed it to be " the greatest realisation of the Super Furry vision to date " . Uncut was similarly impressed calling the album " perhaps the defining record of [ the band 's ] career " while Yahoo Music UK thought Love Kraft was " perfect pop " . 
 The NME had reservations however , stating that although the album is " easily as engaging and full of the wild possibilities of pop music as anything else in their peerless canon " it is " not quite up there with Radiator due to its brace of shonky ballad filler ( " <unk> " and " Cabin Fever " ) " . Writing for Allmusic , Stephen Thomas Erlewine was largely impressed with Love Kraft but admitted to being disappointed that it is " merely a very good Super Furry Animals effort , with few surprises outside of its alluring sleek " . The band 's singer , Gruff Rhys , has described the album as " the most beautiful record we 've made ... really orchestral and fairly timeless " .

 The Super Furry Animals played numerous festivals in Great Britain prior to Love Kraft 's release including Scotland 's T in the Park , Oxegen , the Secret Garden Party in Cambridge and the V Festival , warming up for these dates with a small show at Barry Memorial Hall on 22 July 2005 . A gig at Somerset House in London on 8 July 2005 went ahead despite coming just one day after the 7 / 7 bombings caused Queens of the Stone Age to cancel their show at the venue . 
 Following the release of Love Kraft in the United Kingdom the Super Furry Animals played Bestival on the Isle of Wight before embarking on an 11 date tour of the UK and Ireland , beginning at the University of East Anglia in Norwich on 14 September 2005 and ending on 27 September at Dublin 's Olympia Theatre venue . A month long tour of Canada and the United States followed , starting on 1 November in Montreal and ending in San Diego on 1 December . 
 The band experienced a " very different atmosphere " at initial shows on the Love Kraft tour , when they played the " slow " songs from the album . This contributed to their decision to make follow up Hey Venus ! a " rowdy pop record " .

 Laden with copper , sisal and general cargo , Fort Stikine departed from Gibraltar on 11 January 1944 as a member of Convoy MKS <unk> . The convoy , of twenty merchant ships and five escorting warships , made a rendezvous at sea with Convoy SL 145 the next day . The combined convoy arrived at Liverpool on 24 January . 
 Fort Stikine loaded at Birkenhead , Cheshire . Her cargo was described as general cargo ; it consisted 1 @,@ 396 long tons ( 1 @,@ 418 t ) of flares and signal rockets , incendiary bombs , mines , shells and torpedoes . These were bound for Bombay , India . A container with 31 crates each containing four gold bars was loaded in № 2 hold . Each gold bar weighed 28 pounds ( 12 @.@ 70 kg ) . She was also carrying twelve Supermarine Spitfire aircraft , some gliders and a further quantity of explosives that were destined to be offloaded at Karachi , India . 
 Fort Stikine joined Convoy OS <unk> , which departed from Liverpool on 23 February 1944 . The convoy , consisting of 49 merchant ships escorted by twelve warships , split at sea on 5 March . The two convoys thus formed were OS 69 , which arrived at Freetown on 15 March ; and Convoy KMS <unk> , which arrived at Gibraltar on 6 March .

Having reached Aden on 23 March , she sailed the same day for Karachi , arriving on 30 March . 
 To replace the cargo offloaded at Karachi , 8 @,@ 700 bales of raw cotton were loaded , along with various quantities of fish manure , resin , rice , scrap iron , sulphur , and timber . Added to this were 1 @,@ 000 barrels of lubricating oil . The ship 's captain was concerned about having to take the flammable items but was told that they had to go . A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused . The ship 's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives , but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice . In 1942 , the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton . A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust . This was not the case , although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so . Before the ship sailed , the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked . <unk> were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested . Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi . Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB 74 , which had departed from Bandar Abbas , Iran on 6 April . The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April . 
 = = Loss = = 
 Fort Stikine arrived at Bombay in the early morning of 12 April . Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10 : 00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday . The practice of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels in the event of an enemy air raid on a port . Also , the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war . At the time , explosives were graded as Category A , B , or C. Category A explosives , such as those carried on board Fort Stikine , were the most dangerous . These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters , and not directly to the quayside . 
 Unloading of Fort Stikine began with the lubricating oil , followed by the fish manure . An extra gang of stevedores were employed on this task , which continued through the night of 13 – 14 April . At midday on 13 April , lighters arrived for the explosives . Minor engine repairs also started at that time , rendering the ship unable to move under her own power . At 12 : 30 , the Chief Officer of Fort <unk> noticed smoke issuing from the ventilators of the № 2 hold of Fort Stikine . This was also seen a short time later by a <unk> gunner on board Iran . Despite being seen by these ( and other ) witnesses , everyone assumed that the situation was under control . The alarm was not raised until 13 : 45 . The fire pump in the ship 's engine room was started and the firefighting operation began . 
 With crew members and stevedores abandoning ship , it was realised by the dock authorities that there was a problem on board Fort Stikine . A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more fire engines to be sent for . Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre , initially only two engines were sent . Those on board Fort Stikine were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured blindly into the hold . With the arrival of the two fire appliances , there were now eleven hoses in use . Captain Oberst , of the Indian Army Ordnance Corps arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation . He was in charge of the explosives only after they had been landed . A meeting was held on board between the ship 's officers , Oberst , and Commander Longmore of the Royal Indian Navy , the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay . It was stated by Oberst that Fort Stikine had explosives equivalent to 150 Blockbuster bombs on board and that the ship should be scuttled . Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded , but he doubted that the ship would sink in that condition . More fire appliances arrived , bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32 @.@ by 14 : 45 , ammunition in № 2 hold was exploding . Colonel Sadler , the General Manager of the docks at Bombay , was sent for . He arrived at 14 : 50 and suggested that Fort Stikine should be removed from the docks , which would have required the use of tugs due to Fort Stikine being disabled . An argument developed and Colonel Sadler 's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could be taken out of port . 
 Shortly after 15 : 00 , two fireboats , the Doris and <unk> , arrived . A further nine hoses were played on the ship . Neither of the two people who could have taken overall charge of the situation were <unk> , and none of those on board Fort Stikine were willing to take charge . Firefighting continued , but at 15 : 50 a flame erupted from the hold , reaching higher than the ship 's mast . The order was given to abandon ship , with some jumping from the ship onto the quayside , and others into the water . At 16 : 06 , an explosion occurred on board Fort Stikine . The ship was split in two , with her boiler found half a mile ( 800m ) away . The explosion caused a tsunami within the dock , which deposited one vessel on the quayside . At 16 : 33 , a second explosion occurred . The cargo ship <unk> had her stern blown off . It landed about 200 yards ( 180 m ) away . This explosion also wrecked the cargo liner Baroda . 
 = = = Investigation = = = 
 The accident was investigated by the authorities at Bombay . The report was released on 11 September 1944 and concluded that the fire and subsequent explosion on Fort Stikine was an accident . Sabotage was ruled out . The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed , with 476 injured . Civilian casualties were in excess of 500 killed , with 2 @,@ 408 treated in hospital .

 A Trip to the Moon ( French : Le Voyage dans la Lune ) is a 1902 French silent film directed by Georges Méliès . Inspired by a wide variety of sources , including Jules Verne 's novels From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon , the film follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a cannon @-@ propelled capsule , explore the Moon 's surface , escape from an underground group of Selenites ( lunar inhabitants ) , and return to Earth with a captive Selenite . It features an ensemble cast of French theatrical performers , led by Méliès himself in the main role of Professor Barbenfouillis , and is filmed in the overtly theatrical style for which Méliès became famous . 
 The film was an internationally popular success on its release , and was extensively pirated by other studios , especially in the United States . Its unusual length , lavish production values , innovative special effects , and emphasis on storytelling were markedly influential on other film @-@ makers and ultimately on the development of narrative film as a whole . Scholars have commented upon the film 's extensive use of <unk> and anti @-@ imperialist satire , as well as on its wide influence on later film @-@ makers and its artistic significance within the French theatrical féerie tradition . Though the film disappeared into obscurity after Méliès 's retirement from the film industry , it was rediscovered around 1930 , when Méliès 's importance to the history of cinema was beginning to be recognized by film devotees . An original hand @-@ colored print was discovered in 1993 and restored in 2011 . 
 A Trip to the Moon was named one of the 100 greatest films of the 20th century by The Village Voice , ranked 84th . The film remains the best @-@ known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès , and the moment in which the capsule lands in the Moon 's eye remains one of the most iconic and frequently referenced images in the history of cinema . It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the science fiction film genre and , more generally , as one of the most influential films in cinema history . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At a meeting of the <unk> Club , its president , Professor Barbenfouillis , proposes a trip to the Moon . After addressing some dissent , five other brave astronomers — Nostradamus , <unk> , Omega , <unk> , and <unk> — agree to the plan . They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet , and a huge cannon to shoot it into space . The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of " marines " , most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors ' outfits . The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches , and it hits him in the eye . 
 Landing safely on the Moon , the astronomers get out of the capsule ( without the need of space suits ) and watch the Earth rise in the distance . Exhausted by their journey , they unroll their blankets and sleep . As they sleep , a comet passes , the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star , old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet , and Phoebe , goddess of the Moon , appears seated in a crescent @-@ moon swing . Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers , and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms . One astronomer opens his umbrella ; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself . 
 At this point , a Selenite ( an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon , named after one of the Greek moon goddesses , Selene ) appears , but it is killed easily by an astronomer , as the creatures explode if they are hit with force . More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded . The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king . An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground , causing him to explode . 
 The astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites , and five get inside . The sixth astronomer , Barbenfouillis himself , uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge on the Moon and into space . A Selenite tries to seize the capsule at the last minute . Astronomer , capsule , and Selenite fall through space and land in an ocean on Earth , where they are rescued by a ship and towed ashore . The final sequence ( missing from some prints of the film ) depicts a celebratory parade in honor of the travelers ' return , including a display of the captive Selenite and the unveiling of a commemorative statue bearing the motto " Labor omnia <unk> " . 
 = = Cast = = 
 When A Trip to the Moon was made , film actors performed anonymously and no credits were given ; the practice of supplying opening and closing credits in films was a later innovation . Nonetheless , the following cast details can be reconstructed from available evidence : 
 Georges Méliès as Professor Barbenfouillis . Méliès , a pioneering French film @-@ maker and magician now generally regarded as the first person to recognize the potential of narrative film , had already achieved considerable success with his film versions of Cinderella ( 1899 ) and Joan of Arc ( 1900 ) . His extensive involvement in all of his films as director , producer , writer , designer , technician , publicist , editor , and often actor makes him one of the first cinematic auteurs . Speaking about his work late in life , Méliès commented : " The greatest difficulty in realising my own ideas forced me to sometimes play the leading role in my films ... I was a star without knowing I was one , since the term did not yet exist . " All told , Méliès took an acting role in at least 300 of his 520 films . 
 <unk> <unk> as Phoebe ( the woman on the crescent moon ) . Méliès discovered <unk> in the 1890s , when she was performing as a singer at the cabaret L 'Enfer . She also appeared in his 1899 adaption of Cinderella .
