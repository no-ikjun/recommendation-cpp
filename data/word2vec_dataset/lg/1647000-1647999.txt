 Mutsu 's eight 45 @-@ caliber 41 @-@ centimeter guns were mounted in two pairs of twin @-@ gun , superfiring turrets fore and aft . Numbered one through four from front to rear , the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of − 2 to + 35 degrees . The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute . A special Type 3 Sankaidan incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . The turrets aboard the Nagato @-@ class ships were replaced in the mid @-@ 1930s using those stored from the unfinished Tosa @-@ class battleships . While in storage the turrets were modified to increase their range of elevation to − 3 degrees to + 43 degrees , which increased the guns ' maximum range from 30 @,@ 200 to 37 @,@ 900 meters ( 33 @,@ 000 to 41 @,@ 400 yd ) . 
 The ship 's secondary armament of twenty 50 @-@ caliber 14 @-@ centimeter guns was mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure . The manually operated guns had a maximum range of 20 @,@ 500 metres ( 22 @,@ 400 yd ) and fired at a rate of six to ten rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defense was provided by four 40 @-@ caliber 8 @-@ centimeter 3rd Year Type AA guns in single mounts . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . The ship was also fitted with eight 533 @-@ millimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , four on each broadside , two above water and two submerged . 
 Around 1926 , the four above @-@ water torpedo tubes were removed and the ship received three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast . The 76 mm AA guns were replaced by eight 40 @-@ caliber 127 @-@ millimeter dual @-@ purpose guns in 1932 , fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 meters ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 meters ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Vickers two @-@ pounder light AA guns were also added to the ship in 1932 . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees , which gave them a ceiling of 4 @,@ 000 meters ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) . They had a maximum rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . 
 The two @-@ pounders were replaced by 1941 by 20 license @-@ built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in five twin @-@ gun mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark Stille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15 @-@ round magazines . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt was 305 mm ( 12 in ) thick and tapered to a thickness of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) at its bottom edge ; above it was a strake of 229 mm ( 9 in ) armor . The main deck armor was 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) while the lower deck was 75 mm ( 3 in ) thick . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 305 mm on the face , 230 – 190 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) on the sides , and 152 – 127 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 0 in ) on the roof . The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick , while the casemates of the 140 mm guns were protected by 25 mm armor plates . The sides of the conning tower were 369 mm ( 14 @.@ 5 in ) thick . 
 The new 41 cm turrets installed during Mutsu 's reconstruction were more heavily armored than the original ones . Face armor was increased to 460 mm ( 18 in ) , the sides to 280 mm ( 11 in ) , and the roof to 250 – 230 mm ( 10 – 9 in ) . The armor over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm on the upper deck and 25 mm on the upper armored deck . These additions increased the weight of the ship 's armor to 13 @,@ 032 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 826 long tons ) , 32 @.@ 6 percent of her displacement . In early 1941 , in preparation for war , Mutsu 's barbette armor was reinforced with 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armor plates above the main deck and 215 mm ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) plates below it . 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 Mutsu had an additional boom added to the mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship . In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3 , and a collapsible crane was installed in a portside sponson the following year ; the ship was equipped to operate two or three floatplanes , although no hangar was provided . The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 . A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K , added in 1939 – 40 . Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943 . 
 = = = Fire control and sensors = = = 
 The ship was fitted with a 10 @-@ meter ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinder in the forward superstructure . Additional six @-@ meter ( 19 ft 8 in ) and three @-@ meter ( 9 ft 10 in ) anti @-@ aircraft rangefinders were also fitted , although the date is unknown . The rangefinders in No. 2 and 3 Turrets were replaced by 10 @-@ meter units in 1932 – 33 . 
 Mutsu was initially fitted with a Type 13 fire @-@ control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I , but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925 . It controlled the main and secondary guns ; no provision was made for anti @-@ aircraft fire until the Type 31 fire @-@ control director was introduced in 1932 . A modified Type 14 fire @-@ control system was tested aboard her sister ship Nagato in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 94 . A new anti @-@ aircraft director , also called the Type 94 , used to control the 127 mm AA guns , was introduced in 1937 , although when Mutsu received hers is unknown . The 25 mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937 .

 Mutsu , named for Mutsu Province , was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 June 1918 and launched on 31 May 1920 . Funding for the ship had partly come from donations from schoolchildren . While Mutsu was still fitting out , the American government called a conference in Washington , D.C. late in 1921 to forestall the massively expensive naval arms race that was developing between the United States , the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan . The Washington Naval Conference convened on 12 November and the Americans proposed to scrap virtually every capital ship under construction or being fitting out by the participating nations . Mutsu was specifically listed among those to be scrapped even though she had been commissioned a few weeks earlier . This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegates ; they agreed to a compromise that allowed them to keep Mutsu in exchange for scrapping the obsolete dreadnought Settsu , with a similar arrangement for several American Colorado @-@ class dreadnoughts that were fitting out . Mutsu was commissioned on 24 October 1921 with Captain <unk> Komaki in command . Captain Seiichi <unk> assumed command on 18 November and the ship was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December . Mutsu hosted Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp , Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten , on 12 April 1922 during the prince 's visit to Japan . 
 On 4 September 1923 , Mutsu loaded supplies at <unk> Bay , Kyushu , for the victims of the Great Kantō earthquake . With her sister Nagato , she sank the hulk of the obsolete battleship Satsuma on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in Tokyo Bay , in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty . Captain Mitsumasa Yonai , later Prime Minister of Japan , assumed command on 10 November . The ship was transferred to the reserve on 1 December 1925 . Mutsu served as flagship of Emperor Hirohito during the 1927 naval maneuvers and fleet review . Captain <unk> Yoshida relieved Captain <unk> Hori on 10 December 1928 . On 29 March 1929 , the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3 , together with three light cruisers . 
 Mutsu 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was upgraded during 1932 . Upon completion , she was assigned to Battleship Division 1 of the 1st Fleet , and again served as the Emperor 's flagship during the annual maneuvers and fleet review in 1933 . The ship was placed in reserve on 15 November and began her lengthy reconstruction . This was completed on 30 September 1936 and Mutsu rejoined the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December 1936 . In August 1937 , she transported 2 @,@ 000 men of the 11th Infantry Division to Shanghai during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . Her floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to Sasebo the following day . On 15 November 1938 , Captain Aritomo Gotō assumed command of the ship . Mutsu was placed in reserve from 15 December 1938 to 15 November 1939 . She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war ; as part of this work , she was fitted with external degaussing coils and additional armor for her barbettes . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 During the war Mutsu saw limited action , spending much of her time in home waters . On 8 December 1941 , she sortied for the Bonin Islands , along with Nagato , the battleships Hyūga , Yamashiro , Fusō , Ise of Battleship Division 2 , and the light carrier Hōshō as distant support for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 18 January 1942 , Mutsu towed the obsolete armored cruiser Nisshin as a target for the new battleship Yamato , which promptly sank her . 
 In June 1942 Mutsu , commanded by Rear Admiral Gunji Kogure , was assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway , together with Yamato , Nagato , Hosho , the light cruiser Sendai , nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships . Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June , Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island , and into a night engagement with his surface forces , but the American forces withdrew and Mutsu saw no action . After rendezvousing with the remnants of the Striking Force on 6 June , about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to Mutsu . She arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June . 
 On 14 July , Mutsu was transferred to Battleship Division 2 and then to the Advance Force of the 2nd Fleet on 9 August . Two days later , the ship departed Yokosuka accompanied by the cruisers Atago , Takao , Maya , Haguro , Yura , Myōkō , the seaplane tender Chitose and escorting destroyers to support operations during the Guadalcanal Campaign . They arrived at Truk on 17 August . On 20 August , while sailing from Truk to rendezvous with the main body of Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo 's 3rd Fleet , Mutsu , the heavy cruiser Atago , and escorting destroyers unsuccessfully attempted to locate the escort carrier USS Long Island in response to a flying boat detecting the American ship . 
 During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 27 August , Mutsu , assigned to the Support Force , fired four shells at enemy reconnaissance aircraft during what was her first and only action of the war . Following her return to Truk on 2 September , a group of skilled AA gunnery officers and men were detached to serve as instructors to ground @-@ based naval anti @-@ aircraft gunners stationed in Rabaul . During October Mutsu off @-@ loaded surplus fuel oil to the fleet oil tanker <unk> Maru , allowing the tanker to refuel other ships involved in Guadalcanal operations . On 7 January 1943 , Mutsu steamed from Truk via Saipan to return to Japan together with the carrier Zuikaku , the heavy cruiser Suzuya and four destroyers . Mutsu left Hashirajima for Kure on 13 April , where she prepared to sortie to reinforce the Japanese garrisons in the Aleutian Islands in response to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands . The operation was cancelled the next day and the ship resumed training . 
 = = = Loss = = = 
 On 8 June 1943 , Mutsu was moored in the Hashirajima fleet anchorage , with 113 flying cadets and 40 instructors from the <unk> Naval Air Group aboard for familiarization . At 12 : 13 the magazine of her No. 3 turret exploded , destroying the adjacent structure of the ship and cutting her in half . A massive influx of water into the machinery spaces caused the 150 @-@ meter ( 490 ft ) forward section of the ship to capsize to starboard and sink almost immediately . The 45 @-@ meter ( 148 ft ) stern section upended and remained floating until about 02 : 00 hours on 9 June before sinking , coming to rest a few hundred feet south of the main wreck at coordinates 33 ° 58 ′ N 132 ° 24 ′ E. 
 The nearby Fusō immediately launched two boats which , together with the destroyers <unk> and Wakatsuki and the cruisers Tatsuta and Mogami , were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1 @,@ 474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu ; 1 @,@ 121 men were killed in the explosion . Only 13 of the visiting aviators were among the survivors . 
 After the explosion , as the rescue operations commenced , the fleet was alerted and the area was searched for Allied submarines , but no traces were found . To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship coming so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort , Mutsu 's destruction was declared a state secret . Mass cremations of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking . Captain <unk> Miyoshi 's body was recovered by divers on 17 June , but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944 . Both he and his second in command , Captain Ono Koro , were posthumously promoted to Rear Admiral , as was normal practice . To further prevent rumors from spreading , healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean . Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force . Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the Mariana Islands , where most were killed in 1944 during the battle for the island . 
 At the time of the explosion , Mutsu 's magazine contained a number of 16 @-@ inch Type 3 " <unk> " incendiary shrapnel shells , which had caused a fire at the Sagami arsenal several years earlier due to improper storage . Because they might have been the cause of the explosion , the Minister of the Navy , Admiral Shimada <unk> , immediately ordered the removal of Type 3 shells from all IJN ships carrying them , until the conclusion of the investigation into the loss . 
 = = Investigation into the loss = = 
 A commission led by Admiral Kōichi Shiozawa was convened three days after the sinking to investigate the loss . The commission considered a number of possible causes : 
 Sabotage by enemy secret agents . Given the heavy security at the anchorage and lack of claims of responsibility by the Allies , this could be discounted . 
 Sabotage by a disgruntled crewman . While no individual was named in the commission 's final report , its conclusion was that the cause of the explosion was most likely a crewman in No. 3 turret who had recently been accused of theft and was believed to be suicidal . 
 A midget or fleet submarine attack . Extensive searches immediately following the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage ; consequently , this possibility was quickly discounted . Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish @-@ brown fireball , which indicated a magazine explosion ; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers . 
 Accidental explosion within a magazine . While the Mutsu carried many projectiles , immediate suspicion focused on the Type 3 anti @-@ aircraft shell as it was believed to have caused a fire before the war at the Sagami arsenal . Known as a " <unk> @-@ dan " or " <unk> " , these were fired by the main armament and contained 900 to 1 @,@ 200 25 mm diameter steel tubes ( depending upon sources ) , each containing an incendiary charge . Tests were conducted at <unk> Naval Proving Ground on several shells salvaged from No. 3 turret and on shells from the previous and succeeding manufacturing batches . Using a specially built model of the Mutsu 's No. 3 turret , the experiments were unable to induce the shells to explode under normal conditions . 
 The commission issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June , well before the divers had completed their investigation of the wreck , and concluded that the explosion was the result of a disgruntled seaman . Historian Mike Williams put forward an alternative theory of fire : 
 " A number of observers noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it , just before the explosion . Compared with other nations ' warships in wartime service , Japanese battleships contained a large amount of flammable materials including wooden decking , furniture , and insulation , as well as cotton and wool bedding . Although she had been modernized in the 1930s , some of the Mutsu 's original electrical wiring may have remained in use . While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility , a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black @-@ powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion . " 
 = = Salvage operations = = 
 Divers were brought into the area to retrieve bodies and to assess the damage to the ship . Prior to diving on the wreck they were allowed to familiarize themselves on board Mutsu 's sister ship , Nagato . The Navy leadership initially gave serious consideration to raising the wreck and rebuilding her , although these plans were dropped after the divers completed their survey of the ship on 22 July . Thus Mutsu was struck from the Navy List on 1 September . As part of the investigation , Dive @-@ boat No. <unk> , a small Nishimura @-@ class search and rescue submarine , explored the wreck on 17 June with a crew of seven officers . While crawling on the harbor bottom , it became snagged on the wreckage and its crew nearly suffocated before they managed to free themselves and surface . In July 1944 , the oil @-@ starved IJN recovered 580 metric tons ( 570 long tons ; 640 short tons ) of fuel from the wreck . 
 The 1 @.@ 2 @-@ meter ( 3 ft 11 in ) diameter chrysanthemum crest , symbol of the Imperial Throne , was raised in 1953 , and one of the 140 mm casemate guns was raised in 1963 and donated to the Yasukuni Shrine . In 1970 , the <unk> Salvage Company began recovery operations that lasted until 1978 and recovered about 75 % of the ship . The two aft turrets were raised in 1970 and 1971 . The salvagers retrieved 849 bodies of crewmen lost during the explosion . In 1995 , the Mutsu Memorial Museum declared that no further salvage operations were planned . 
 The only significant portion of the ship that remains is a 35 @-@ meter ( 114 ft 10 in ) long section running from the bridge structure forward to the vicinity of No. 1 turret . The highest portion of the ship is 12 meters ( 39 ft 4 in ) below the surface .

 In addition to the 140 mm gun donated to the Yasukuni Shrine , now on display at the Yasukuni Museum , the following items recovered over the years can be viewed at various museums and memorials in Japan : 
 Many artifacts are displayed at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa @-@ Cho . This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of <unk> @-@ Ōshima which opened in July 1970 . To make room for a new road , this museum was moved in April 1994 to a new building . Since 1963 , a memorial service has been held here every year on 8 June in honor of the crew . 
 The fully restored No. 4 turret is on display on the grounds of the former Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima . This is the ship 's original turret , removed during her refit in the 1930s . 
 The left @-@ side 410 mm gun from No. 3 turret is displayed outside the Yamato Museum in <unk> Park , Kure . This park also contains one of Mutsu 's 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft 6 in ) diameter propellers , a rudder and an anchor . 
 One 410 mm gun from No. 3 turret is on display at the Museum of Maritime Science , Shinagawa , in Tokyo . 
 A rudder and a section of propeller shaft were on display at the <unk> Art Museum until it closed circa 1991 . Their current whereabouts are now unknown .

 = = Plot = = 
 In Helena , Montana , Richie Szalay is chasing a spaceship . As the spaceship stops , it dumps a naked female and cloaks itself . The woman is later revealed to be Theresa Hoese , who was abducted the same time as Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) . Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) , John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) visit Hoese in the hospital to get information about Mulder 's whereabouts . 
 Later in a motel , they interrogate Szalay , whose friend Gary had been abducted just before Mulder ; Szalay was investigating the UFO reports in Montana in an attempt to find him . Doggett reports that fresh footprints from Nike shoes were noted in the area Hoese was found , making Doggett skeptical about Szalay 's claims to alien sightings . Meanwhile , Jeremiah Smith has assumed the form of a doctor and arranges for Hoese to be transferred . Having learned of Hoese 's disappearance , Doggett calls Agent Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) . Reyes assists in the investigation , believing that Mulder may have joined a UFO cult . In a derelict compound , Smith cures Hoese of her injuries , as observed by a man called Absalom . 
 Reyes ' car stalls just before she sees a UFO . Stopping , she sees Smith and Absalom taking a body . She also finds Gary 's body . Reyes is able to retrieve the license plate number on the truck used to kidnap the abductee . It is later revealed that it belongs to Travis Clayton Moberly , better known as Absalom , the leader of a doomsday cult . The FBI storms the cult 's compound , and arrests Absalom , but Smith is not found . Absalom tells Scully and Doggett that he has been saving abductees that had been left for dead by the aliens . Examining video of the compound raid , Scully , Reyes and Doggett watch Smith step through a doorway and transform into Agent Doggett . Doggett is stunned , and the agents realize that Smith is still in the compound . 
 Scully runs into the cult compound and , identifying Smith by his Nike shoes , tells him she knows who he is and what he 's doing . She is distracted when Skinner tells her they 've found Mulder 's body in the woods . Scully sees Mulder 's lifeless body and races back to the compound hoping that Smith can heal him , but a UFO directs a beam of light into the room where he is being held ; when she enters the room , he is gone . Distraught , Scully yells , " This is not happening ! " , and weeps .

 " This Is Not Happening " marked the return of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder . After settling his contract dispute with Fox , Duchovny had quit full @-@ time participation in the show after the seventh season . In order to explain Mulder 's absence , Duchovny 's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale , " Requiem . " After several rounds of contractual discussions , Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 season eight episodes . " This Is Not Happening " marked the fifth appearance of Duchovny in the eighth season : his character had appeared in cameos in " Within " and " Without " , as well as in flashbacks in " The Gift " and " Per Manum . " 
 The opening scene required the crew of The X @-@ Files to create a UFO chase . In order to do this , the scene was filmed entirely in a mountainous area that was lit up to give the shot a more alien @-@ like feel . The UFO that seen flying at the opening of the scene was actually a helicopter , disguised using various techniques . A so @-@ called " cloaking @-@ effect " , created on a computer and consisting mostly of digital fog and " wiggled lights " , was used to make the " spaceship " appear and then suddenly disappear . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 This episode marked the first appearance of Monica Reyes , played by Annabeth Gish , who would become a main character in season nine . The character was developed and introduced due to Gillian Anderson 's possible departure at the end of the eighth season . Although Anderson would remain on until the end , Gish later became a series regular . When creating the character , series creator Chris Carter wanted to give the character a personality who had much in common with both Fox Mulder and Dana Scully . At the same time , however , Carter wanted the character to be different from Scully 's character in a way that Doggett was different from Mulder , saying , " as much as Robert Patrick was unlike Mulder , we needed someone who was equally unlike Scully . " Gish later noted that , " Chris really wanted Monica to be a sunny force , which is hard to play sometimes . But it 's a natural instinct for me ; I can find happiness in the midst of darkness . " 
 The casting process for Monica Reyes was unconventional . Gish received a call from her agent , who informed her that The X @-@ Files were looking for a new female character . Gish applied for the part , but instead of having to a do a reading , she only had to meet with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz . After receiving the part , Gish 's first shot was scheduled four in the morning ; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee .

 " This Is Not Happening " premiered on February 25 , 2001 on American television on Fox . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 7 , meaning that it was seen by 9 @.@ 7 % of the nation 's estimated households . It was watched by 9 @.@ 91 million households and 16 @.@ 9 million viewers , making it the highest @-@ rated episode of the season , as well as the highest @-@ rated episode of the series since the seventh season episode " The Sixth Extinction " .

The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 4 – Super Soldiers , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc . 
 Critical reception to " This Is Not Happening " was mostly positive . Todd VanDerWerff of The A. V. Club awarded the episode a " A – " and called it " one of the strongest episodes of the season , give or take a Monica Reyes . " He applauded the reintroduction of Jeremiah Smith — a character he felt " the show had mostly forgotten about " — and wrote highly of Scott as Absalom , calling him a " one of the episode 's highlights . " VanDerWerff also wrote that the episode , along with the previous episode " Per Manum " was a showcase for Anderson 's acting ability . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode five stars out of five . The two noted , and praised , that the true tragedy of the episode is the fact that , despite her increased role as the reluctant believer , the way Scully deals with Absalom and Jeremiah Smith " in a strictly scientific way " , instead of taking the " leap of faith " , prevents her from finding and saving Mulder in time . 
 Not all reviews were positive . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She called the episode " unexciting " and concluded that the final scene was " anti @-@ climactic " . In addition , Vitaris noted that the introduction of Monica Reyes was not satisfactorily explained .

 Development of " Push the Button " began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their fourth studio album , Taller in More Ways ( 2005 ) . American producer and songwriter Dallas Austin collaborated with the group during the album 's initial stages of development . He visited London to work with them , although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in Atlanta , Georgia . Austin wrote five tracks for the album , including " Push the Button " , which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes . According to group member Heidi Range , the song was " the very last thing " completed for the album . 
 " Push the Button " was conceptualised after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin . Buchanan told Jess Cartner @-@ Morley of The Guardian that she made advances towards the man , but he was unaware of her intentions : " I really liked this guy , so I 'd be like , there 's this good movie coming out , you know , dropping hints . And he 'd be like , that movie sounds great , let me know what it 's like if you go see it . I knew he liked me too but he just wasn 't getting what I was trying to say . " Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to " push that button " or she would eventually move on . 
 Mutya Buena , another member of the Sugababes , clarified Buchanan 's encounter with the artist to Hot Press magazine 's Jackie Hayden , saying : " We all knew there was something going on between them at the time , but we try to give each other space . " She described " Push the Button " as a song " with meaning and real life references " , and characterised it as having a " street vibe " . Austin produced the song , which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings , London . " Push the Button " was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios , London , in collaboration with Richard Edgeler . Rick <unk> engineered the song . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Push the Button " is an uptempo electropop and R & B song . AllMusic 's K. Ross Hoffman called it an " electropop club ditty " , while Joe Muggs of The Daily Telegraph noted that Austin 's production combines " raucous " electropop with " slick " American R & B. According to the digital sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation , " Push the Button " was composed in the key of A @-@ flat major using common time , with a fast @-@ paced tempo of 126 beats per minute . The song 's instrumentation is composed of drums , keys , a guitar and a bass guitar . 
 The production consists of various computer beats and electronic effects . The song contains an ascending bridge incorporated into the chorus , which consists of the lines : " If you 're ready for me boy / You 'd better push the button and let me know / Before I get the wrong idea and go . " Lyrically , the song is about a woman 's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man . Joe <unk> of Stylus Magazine described Buena 's delivery of the lyric " my sexy ass " as " carefree " , and noted that the lyrics adapt an " idiosyncratic approach " to the English language . Musically , " Push the Button " received comparisons to the sound of pop group Abba .

 Sarawak ( / <unk> / ; Malay : [ <unk> ] ) , nicknamed Bumi <unk> ( " Land of the hornbills " ) , is one of the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo ( Sabah being the other state ) . This territory has a certain level of autonomy in administration , immigration , and judiciary which differentiates it from the Malaysian Peninsula states . Sarawak is situated in northwest Borneo , bordering the state of Sabah to the northeast , Kalimantan , the Indonesian portion of Borneo , to the south , and surrounding the independent state of Brunei . The capital city , Kuching , is the economic centre of the state and the seat of the Sarawak state government . Other cities and towns in Sarawak include Miri , Sibu , and Bintulu . As of the 2015 census in Malaysia , the state 's population is 2 @,@ 636 @,@ 000 . Sarawak has an equatorial climate with tropical rainforests and abundant animal and plant species . The state has several prominent cave systems at Gunung Mulu National Park . Rajang River is the longest river in Malaysia ; Bakun Dam , one of the largest dams in Southeast Asia , is located on one of its tributaries . Mount <unk> is the highest point in Sarawak . 
 Earliest human settlements in Sarawak date back to 40 @,@ 000 years ago at the Niah Caves . The state had a trading relationship with China during the 8th to 13th century AD . It came under the influence of the Bruneian Empire in the 16th century . The state was governed by the Brooke family in the 19th and 20th centuries . During World War II , the state was occupied by the Japanese for three years before being ceded as a British Crown Colony in 1946 . On 22 July 1963 , Sarawak was granted self @-@ government by the British . Following this , Sarawak became one of the founding members of the Federation of Malaysia ( established on 16 September 1963 ) alongside North Borneo ( now Sabah ) , Singapore ( expelled in 1965 ) , and the Federation of Malaya ( Peninsular Malaysia or West Malaysia ) . However , the federation was opposed by Indonesia , and this led to the three @-@ year Indonesia – Malaysia confrontation . The state also experienced a communist insurgency from 1960 to 1990 . 
 The state exhibits notable diversity in ethnicity , culture , and language . The head of state is the Governor , also known as Yang di @-@ Pertua Negeri , while the head of government is the Chief Minister . The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and has the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia . The state is divided into administrative divisions and districts . English and Malay are the only two official languages of the state ; there is no official religion . Sarawak State Museum is the oldest museum in Borneo . The state is known for its traditional musical instrument , the <unk> . The Rainforest World Music Festival ( RWMF ) is one of the premier music events in Malaysia . Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia to celebrate the Gawai Dayak festival . 
 Sarawak has abundant natural resources , and its economy is strongly export @-@ oriented , mainly in oil and gas , timber , and oil palm . Other industries are manufacturing , energy , and tourism . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The official explanation of the word " Sarawak " is that it is derived from the Sarawak Malay word <unk> , which means antimony . Another popular but unofficial explanation is that it is an acronym from the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim ( uncle to the Sultan of Brunei ) , Saya <unk> pada <unk> ( I surrender it to you ) when he gave Sarawak to James Brooke in 1841 . However , such an explanation has several flaws because the territory had already been named Sarawak even before the arrival of Brooke , and the word <unk> never existed in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 The first foragers visited the West Mouth of Niah Caves ( located 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) southwest of Miri ) 40 @,@ 000 years ago when Borneo was connected to the mainland of Southeast Asia . The landscape around the Niah Caves was drier and more exposed than it is now . <unk> , the Niah Caves were surrounded by a combination of closed forests with bush , parkland , swamps , and rivers . The foragers were able to survive in the rainforest through hunting , fishing , and gathering molluscs and edible plants . This is evidenced by the discovery of a modern human skull , nicknamed " Deep Skull " , in a deep trench uncovered by Tom Harrisson in 1958 ; this is also the oldest modern human skull in Southeast Asia . The skull probably belongs to a 16- to 17 @-@ year @-@ old adolescent girl . A Manis <unk> ( Asian giant pangolin ) bone that had not developed into a fossil , dated to 30 @,@ 000 BC , was found nearby as well as in the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial sites inside the Niah Caves . The area around the Niah Caves has been designated the Niah National Park . 
 Other archaeological sites have since been discovered in the central and southern regions of Sarawak . Another excavation by Tom Harrisson in 1949 unearthed a series of Chinese ceramics at Santubong ( near Kuching ) that date to the Tang and the Song dynasties in the 8th to 13th century AD . It is possible that Santubong was an important seaport in Sarawak during the period , but its importance declined during the Yuan dynasty , and the port was deserted during Ming dynasty . Other archaeological sites in Sarawak include the Kapit , Song , Serian , and Bau districts . 
 = = = Bruneian empire = = = 
 During the 16th century , the area of Sarawak now known as Kuching was known to Portuguese cartographers as <unk> , one of the five great seaports on the island of Borneo . It was under the influence of the Bruneian Empire and was self @-@ governed under Sultan Tengah . By the early 19th century , Sarawak had become a loosely governed territory under the control of the Brunei Sultanate . The Bruneian empire had authority only along the coastal regions of Sarawak held by semi @-@ independent Malay leaders . Meanwhile , the interior hinterland of Sarawak was mainly dominated by tribal wars fought by Iban , Kayan , and Kenyah people who were aggressive in their territorial expansions . Following the discovery of antimony ore in the region now known as Kuching , Pangeran <unk> Mahkota ( a representative of the Sultan of Brunei ) began to develop the area between 1824 and 1830 . When antimony production increased , the Brunei Sultanate demanded higher taxes from Sarawak ; this led to civil unrest and chaos . In 1839 Sultan Omar Ali <unk> II ( 1827 – 1852 ) , the Sultan of Brunei , ordered Pangeran Muda Hashim ( uncle to the Sultan of Brunei ) to restore order ; it was around this time that James Brooke ( a British explorer ) arrived in Sarawak . Pangeran Muda Hashim initially requested assistance in the matter , but Brooke refused . However , he agreed to the request in his next visit to Sarawak in 1841 . Pangeran Muda Hashim signed a treaty in 1841 surrendering Sarawak to Brooke . On 24 September 1841 , Pangeran Muda Hashim bestowed the title of governor on James Brooke . In 1846 Brooke effectively became the Rajah of Sarawak and founded the White Rajah Dynasty of Sarawak after the death of Pangeran Muda Hashim . 
 = = = Brooke dynasty = = = 
 Brooke ruled the area and expanded the territory northwards until his death in 1868 . He was succeeded by his nephew Charles <unk> Johnson Brooke , who in turn was succeeded by his son , Charles Vyner Brooke , on the condition that Charles should rule in consultation with Vyner Brooke 's brother Bertram Brooke . Both James and Charles Brooke signed treaties with Brunei as a strategy to expand the territorial boundaries of Sarawak . In 1861 the Bintulu region was ceded to James Brooke . In 1883 Sarawak was extended to the Baram River ( near Miri ) . Limbang was acquired in 1885 and later added to Sarawak in 1890 . The expansion of Sarawak was completed in 1905 when Lawas was ceded to the Brooke government . Sarawak was divided into five divisions , corresponding to territorial boundaries of the areas acquired by the Brookes through the years . Each division was headed by a Resident . Sarawak was recognised as an independent state by the United States in 1850 and the United Kingdom in 1864 . The state issued its first currency as the Sarawak dollar in 1858 . However , in the Malaysian context , the Brooke is viewed as a colonialist . 
 The Brooke dynasty ruled Sarawak for a hundred years as " White Rajahs " . The dynasty adopted the policy of paternalism to protect the interests of the indigenous population and their overall welfare . The Brooke government established a Supreme Council consisting of Malay chiefs who advised the Rajahs on all aspects of governance . The first General Council meeting took place at Bintulu in 1867 . The Supreme Council is the oldest state legislative assembly in Malaysia . Meanwhile , the Ibans and other Dayak people were hired as militia . The Brooke dynasty also encouraged the immigration of Chinese merchants for economic development in the state , especially in the mining and agricultural sectors . Western capitalists were restricted from entering the state while Christian missionaries were tolerated . Piracy , slavery , and headhunting were also banned . Borneo Company Limited was formed in 1856 . It was involved in a wide range of businesses in Sarawak such as trade , banking , agriculture , mineral exploration , and development . 
 The original residence of James Brooke was a Malay house built in Kuching . In 1857 Hakka Chinese gold miners from Bau , under the leadership of Liu Shan Bang , destroyed Brooke 's residence . James Brooke escaped and organised a bigger army together with Charles Brooke and his Malayo @-@ Iban supporters . A few days later , Brooke 's army was able to cut off the escape route of the Chinese rebels . The Chinese rebels were annihilated after two months of fighting . The Brookes subsequently built a new government house by the Sarawak River at Kuching which is presently known as the Astana . An anti @-@ Brooke faction at the Brunei Court was defeated in 1860 at Mukah . Other notable rebellions that were successfully quashed by the Brookes include those led by an Iban leader <unk> ( 1853 – 1863 ) , and a Malay leader named Syarif <unk> ( 1860 – 1862 ) . As a result , a series of forts were built around Kuching to consolidate the Rajah 's power . These include Fort Margherita , which was completed in 1879 . In 1891 Charles <unk> Brooke established the Sarawak Museum , the oldest museum in Borneo . 
 In 1941 , during the centenary celebration of the Brooke rule in Sarawak , a new constitution was introduced to limit the power of the Rajah and to allow the Sarawak people to play a greater role in the functioning of the government . However , the draft constitution contained irregularities , including a secret agreement drawn up between Charles Vyner Brooke and British government officials , in which Vyner Brooke ceded Sarawak as a British Crown Colony in return for a financial compensation to him and his family . 
 = = = Japanese occupation and Allied liberation = = = 
 The Brooke government , under the leadership of Charles Vyner Brooke , established several airstrips in Kuching , Oya , Mukah , Bintulu , and Miri for preparations in the event of war . By 1941 , the British had withdrawn its defending forces from Sarawak and returned to Singapore . With Sarawak now unguarded , the Brooke regime decided to adopt a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri would be destroyed and Kuching airfield held as long as possible before being eventually destroyed . Meanwhile , Japanese forces decided to seize British Borneo to guard their eastern flank in the Malayan Campaign and to facilitate their invasion of Sumatra and West Java . A Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 ( eight days into the Malayan Campaign ) and conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941 . British forces led by Lieutenant Colonel C. M. Lane decided to retreat to Singkawang in Dutch Borneo bordering Sarawak . After ten weeks of fighting in Dutch Borneo , the Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942 . When the Japanese invaded Sarawak , Charles Vyner Brooke had already left for Sydney ( Australia ) while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp . 
 Sarawak remained part of the Empire of Japan for three years and eight months . Sarawak , together with North Borneo and Brunei , formed a single administrative unit named Kita <unk> ( Northern Borneo ) under the Japanese 37th Army headquartered in Kuching . Sarawak was divided into three provinces , namely : Kuching @-@ shu , Sibu @-@ shu , and Miri @-@ shu , each under their respective Japanese Provincial Governor . Basically , the Japanese retained pre @-@ war administrative machinery and assigned Japanese for government positions . The administration of Sarawak 's interior was left to the native police and village headmen , under Japanese supervision . Though the Malays were typically receptive toward the Japanese , other indigenous tribes such as the Iban , Kayan , Kenyah , Kelabit and Lun Bawang maintained a hostile attitude toward them because of policies such as compulsory labour , forced deliveries of foodstuffs , and confiscation of firearms . The Japanese did not resort to strong measures in clamping down on the Chinese population because the Chinese in the state were generally apolitical . However , a considerable number of Chinese moved from urban areas into the less accessible interior to lessen contact with the Japanese . 
 Allied forces later formed the Z Special Unit to sabotage Japanese operations in Southeast Asia . Beginning in March 1945 , Allied commanders were parachuted into Borneo jungles and established several bases in Sarawak under an operation codenamed " <unk> " . Hundreds of indigenous people were trained to launch offensives against the Japanese . Intelligence gathered from the operations helped Allied forces ( headed by Australia ) to reconquer Borneo in May 1945 through Operation Oboe Six . This led to the surrender of the Japanese to the Australian forces on 10 September 1945 at Labuan , followed by the official surrender ceremony at Kuching aboard the Australian Corvette HMAS Kapunda on the next day . Sarawak was immediately placed under British Military Administration until April 1946 . 
 = = = British crown colony = = = 
 After the war , the Brooke government did not have enough resources to rebuild Sarawak . Charles Vyner Brooke was also not willing to hand over his power to his heir apparent , Anthony Brooke ( his nephew , the only son of Bertram Brooke ) because of serious differences between them . Besides , Vyner Brooke 's wife , Sylvia Brett , also tried to discredit Anthony Brooke while trying to install her own daughter to the throne . Therefore , Vyner Brooke decided to cede the sovereignty of Sarawak to the British Crown . A Cession Bill was put forth in the Council Negri ( now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly ) and was debated for three days . The bill was passed on 17 May 1946 with a narrow majority ( 19 versus 16 votes ) . Supporters of the bill were mostly European officers , while the Malays opposed the bill . This caused hundreds of Malay civil servants to resign in protest , sparking an anti @-@ cession movement and the assassination of the second colonial governor of Sarawak Sir Duncan Stewart by Rosli Dhobi . 
 Anthony Brooke opposed the cession of the Rajah 's territory to the British Crown . However , he was linked to anti @-@ <unk> groups in Sarawak , especially after the assassination of Sir Duncan Stewart . Anthony Brooke continued to claim sovereignty as Rajah of Sarawak even after Sarawak became a British Crown colony on 1 July 1946 . For this he was banished from Sarawak by the colonial government and was allowed to return only 17 years later for a nostalgic visit , when Sarawak became part of Malaysia . In 1950 all anti @-@ cession movements in Sarawak ceased after a clamp @-@ down by the colonial government . In 1951 Anthony relinquished all his claims to the Sarawak throne after he used up his last legal avenues at the Privy Council . 
 = = = Self @-@ government and the Federation of Malaysia = = = 
 On 27 May 1961 , Tunku Abdul Rahman , the prime minister of the Federation of Malaya , announced a plan to form a greater federation together with Singapore , Sarawak , Sabah and Brunei , to be called Malaysia . This plan caused the local leaders in Sarawak to be wary of Tunku 's intentions in view of the great disparity in socioeconomic development between Malaya and the Borneo states . There was a general fear that without a strong political institution , the Borneo states would be subjected to Malaya 's colonisation . Therefore , various political parties in Sarawak emerged to protect the interests of the communities they represented . On 17 January 1962 , the Cobbold Commission was formed to gauge the support of Sarawak and Sabah towards the federation . Between February and April 1962 , the commission met more than 4 @,@ 000 people and received 2 @,@ 200 memoranda from various groups . The Commission reported divided support among the Borneo population . However , Tunku interpreted the figures as 80 percent support for the federation . Sarawak drafted an 18 @-@ point agreement to safeguard its interests in the federation . On 26 September 1962 , Sarawak Council Negri passed a resolution that supported the federation with a condition that the interests of the Sarawak people would not be compromised . On 23 October 1962 , five political parties in Sarawak formed a united front that supported the formation of Malaysia . Sarawak was officially granted self @-@ government on 22 July 1963 , and later formed the federation of Malaysia with Malaya , North Borneo , and Singapore on 16 September 1963 . 
 The Malaysian federation had drawn opposition from the Philippines , Indonesia , Brunei People 's Party , and Clandestine Communist Organisation ( CCO ) . The Philippines and Indonesia claimed that the British would be " <unk> " the Borneo states through the federation . Meanwhile , A. M. <unk> , leader of the Brunei People 's Party , instigated the Brunei Revolt in December 1962 to prevent Brunei from joining the Malaysian federation . <unk> seized Limbang and Bekenu before being defeated by British military forces sent from Singapore . Claiming that the Brunei revolt was solid evidence of opposition to the Malaysian federation , Indonesian President Sukarno ordered a military confrontation with Malaysia , sending armed volunteers and later military forces into Sarawak . Sarawak became a flashpoint during the Indonesia – Malaysia confrontation between 1962 and 1966 . Such confrontation gained little support from Sarawakians except for CCO . Thousands of CCO members went into Kalimantan and underwent training with Communist Party of Indonesia . During the confrontation period , around 10 @,@ 000 to 150 @,@ 000 British troops were stationed in Sarawak , together with Australian and New Zealand troops . When Suharto replaced Sukarno as the president of Indonesia , negotiations was restarted between Malaysia and Indonesia which led to the end of the confrontation on 11 August 1966 . In 1967 a new agreement was signed which required anyone who wished to cross the Sarawak – Kalimantan border to have a border pass endorsed at border control posts . 
 After the formation of the Peoples ' Republic of China in 1949 , the ideology of Maoism started to penetrate Chinese schools in Sarawak . The first communist group in Sarawak was formed in 1951 , with its origins in the Chung Hua Middle School ( Kuching ) . The group was succeeded by the Sarawak Liberation League ( SLL ) in 1954 and later by the CCO . Its activities spread from schools to trade unions and farmers . The activities of the CCO were mainly concentrated in the southern and central regions of Sarawak . It also successfully penetrated a political party named the Sarawak United Peoples ' Party ( SUPP ) . The CCO tried to realise a communist state in Sarawak through constitutional means but during the confrontation period , it resorted to armed struggle against the government . Weng Min <unk> and Bong Kee Chok were the two notable leaders of the CCO . Following this , the Sarawak government started to establish New Villages along the Kuching – Serian road to prevent the community from helping the communists . The CCO formally set up the North Kalimantan Communist Party ( NKCP ) in 1970 . In 1973 , Bong surrendered to chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya 'kub ; this significantly reduced the strength of the communist party . However , Weng , who had directed the CCO from China since the mid @-@ 1960s , called for armed struggle against the government , which after 1974 continued in the Rajang Delta . In 1989 the Malayan Communist Party ( MCP ) signed a peace agreement with the government of Malaysia . This caused the NKCP to reopen negotiations with the Sarawak government , which led to a peace agreement on 17 October 1990 . Peace was restored in Sarawak after the final group of 50 communist guerrillas laid down their arms .

 The head of the Sarawak state is the Yang di @-@ Pertua Negeri ( also known as <unk> or State Governor ) , a position largely symbolic in nature , appointed by the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong ( king ) of Malaysia . The <unk> appoints the chief minister as the head of government . Generally , the leader of the party that commands the majority of the Legislative Assembly of the state is appointed as the chief minister . Elected representatives are known as state assemblymen . The state assembly passes laws on subjects that are not under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Malaysia such as land administration , employment , forests , immigration , merchant shipping and fisheries . The state government is constituted by the chief minister and his cabinet ministers and assistant ministers . 
 To protect the interests of the Sarawakians in the Malaysian federation , special safeguards have been included in the Constitution of Malaysia . Sarawak has the power to control the entry and residence of non @-@ Sarawakians and non @-@ Sabahans . Only those lawyers who reside in Sarawak can practice law there . The High Court in Sarawak is independent of the High Court in Peninsular Malaysia . The chief minister of Sarawak must be consulted before the appointment of the chief judge of the Sarawak High Court . There are also Native Courts in Sarawak . Sarawak receives special grants from the federal government and charges its own sales tax . Natives in Sarawak enjoy special privileges such as quotas and employment in public service , scholarships , university placements , and business permits . Local governments in Sarawak are independent of the local authority laws enacted by the Malaysian parliament . 
 Major political parties in Sarawak can be divided into three categories : native non @-@ Muslim , native Muslim , and non @-@ native ; parties , however , may also include members from more than one group . The first political party , the Sarawak United Peoples ' Party ( SUPP ) , was established in 1959 , followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak ( <unk> ) ( in 1960 ) and the Sarawak National Party ( SNAP ) ( in 1961 ) . Other major political parties such as Parti <unk> Sarawak ( <unk> ) appeared by 1962 . Sarawak has been the political stronghold of the ruling Alliance Party and , later , its successor the Barisan Nasional ( BN ) coalition since the formation of Malaysia in 1963 . Stephen Kalong Ningkan ( of the SNAP ) was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections . However , he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi <unk> ( of the <unk> ) with the help of the Malaysian federal government , causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis . The political climate in the state was stable until the 1987 Ming Court Affair , a political coup initiated by Abdul Taib Mahmud 's uncle to topple the Taib @-@ led BN coalition . However , the coup was unsuccessful and Taib was able to retain his chief ministerial status . 
 In 1970 the first Sarawak state election was held , with members of the Council Negri ( now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly ) being directly elected by the voters . This election also marked the beginning of ethnic Melanau domination in Sarawak politics by Abdul Rahman Ya 'kub and Abdul Taib Mahmud . In the same year , the North Kalimantan Communist Party ( NKCP ) was formed , which mounted guerilla warfare against the newly elected Sarawak state government . The party was dissolved after the signing of a peace agreement in 1990 . 1973 saw the birth of Parti <unk> Bumiputera <unk> ( <unk> ) following a merger of several parties . This party would later become the backbone of the Sarawak BN coalition . Since 1983 a Dayak @-@ based party , the SNAP , has fragmented into several splinter parties due to recurrent leadership crises . Sarawak originally held state elections together with national parliamentary elections . However , the then chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya 'kub delayed the dissolution of the state assembly by a year to prepare for the challenges posed by opposition parties and to solve the seat allocations for the newly admitted SNAP party into the Sarawak BN . This made Sarawak the only state in Malaysia to hold state elections separate from the national parliamentary elections since 1979 . 
 In 1978 , the Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) was the first West Malaysia @-@ based party to open its branches in Sarawak . This party derived the majority of its support from urban centres since the 2006 state election and became the largest opposition party in Sarawak . In 2010 , it formed the Pakatan Rakyat coalition with the Parti Keadilan Rakyat ( PKR ) and the Parti Islam Se @-@ Malaysia ( PAS ) ; the latter two parties had become active in Sarawak between 1996 and 2001 . Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia where Peninsular @-@ based component parties in the BN coalition , especially the UMNO , have not been active in Sarawak politics .

 Unlike other states in West Malaysia , Sarawak is divided into divisions rather than districts . Each division is headed by one resident . Currently , the state is divided into 12 divisions : 
 = = = = Districts = = = = 
 The divisions are further divided into districts , each of which is headed by a district officer ; each district is divided into subdistricts , each headed by a Sarawak Administrative Officer ( SAO ) . Currently , there are around 39 districts in the state . There is also one Development Officer for each Division and District to implement development projects . For each district , the state government appoints a village headman ( known as <unk> kampung or penghulu ) for each village . The 39 local governments in Sarawak are under the jurisdiction of the Sarawak Ministry of Local Government and Community Development . The list of divisions , districts , and subdistricts is shown in the table below : 
 = = Security = = 
 The first paramilitary armed forces in Sarawak , a regiment formed by the Brooke regime in 1862 , were known as the Sarawak Rangers . The regiment had helped the Brookes to pacify the state , and taken part in guerilla warfare against the Japanese , in the Malayan Emergency and the Sarawak Communist Insurgency against the communists . The regiment is famed for its jungle tracking skills . Following the formation of Malaysia , the regiment was absorbed into the Malaysian military forces and is now known as the Royal Ranger Regiment . In 1888 Sarawak , together with neighbouring North Borneo , and Brunei , became British protectorates , whereby the responsibility for foreign policy was handed over to the British in exchange for military protection . Sarawak security was also the responsibility of Australia and New Zealand . After the formation of Malaysia , the Malaysian federal government is solely responsible for foreign policy and military forces in the country . 
 = = = Territorial disputes = = = 
 Sarawak has seen several territorial disputes , including with Malaysia 's neighbours Brunei and Indonesia , as well as with China over the ownership of islands in the South China Sea . In 2009 a dispute over Limbang District was settled with Brunei , which dropped its claim over the territory . Sarawak claimed the James Shoal ( Beting <unk> ) and Luconia Shoals ( Beting Raja <unk> / Patinggi Ali ) as part of its exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) . Meanwhile , there are several Sarawak – Kalimantan border issues yet to be settled with Indonesia . 
 = = Environment = = 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 The total land area of Sarawak is nearly 124 @,@ 450 square kilometres ( 48 @,@ 050 sq mi ) , and lies between the northern latitudes 0 ° 50 ′ and 5 ° and eastern longitudes 109 ° 36 ′ and 115 ° 40 ′ E. Sarawak makes up 37 @.@ 5 percent of the total area of Malaysia . It contains large tracts of tropical rainforest with abundant plant and animal species . 
 The state of Sarawak has 750 kilometres ( 470 mi ) of coastline , interrupted in the north by about 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) of Bruneian coast . Sarawak is separated from Kalimantan Borneo by ranges of high hills and mountains that are part of the central mountain range of Borneo . These become loftier to the north , and are highest near the source of the Baram River at the steep Mount Batu <unk> and Mount Mulu . Mount <unk> is the highest point in Sarawak . Lambir Hills National Park is known for its various waterfalls . The world 's largest underground chamber , the Sarawak Chamber , is located inside the Gunung Mulu National Park . Other attractions in the park include the Deer Cave ( the largest cave passage in the world ) and the Clearwater Cave ( the longest cave system in Southeast Asia ) . The national park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Sarawak is generally divided into three ecoregions . The coastal region is rather low @-@ lying and flat with large areas of swamp and other wet environments . Beaches in Sarawak include : Pasir Panjang and Damai beaches in Kuching , Tanjung Batu beach in Bintulu , and Tanjung Lobang and Hawaii beaches in Miri . The hill region accounts for most of the inhabited land and are where most of the cities and towns are found . The ports of Kuching and Sibu are built some distance from the coast on rivers . Bintulu and Miri are close to the coastline where the hills stretch right to the South China Sea . The third region is the mountainous region along the Kalimantan – Borneo border and with the Kelabit ( Bario ) , Murut ( Ba 'kelalan ) and Kenyah ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) highlands in the north . 
 The major rivers in Sarawak are : the Sarawak River , Lupar River , <unk> River , and Rajang River . The Sarawak River is the main river flowing through Kuching . The Rajang River is the longest river in Malaysia , measuring 563 kilometres ( 350 mi ) including <unk> River , its tributary . To the north , the Baram River , Limbang River , and <unk> River drain into the Brunei Bay . 
 Sarawak has a tropical geography with an equatorial climate . It experiences two monsoon seasons : a northeast monsoon and a southwest monsoon . The northeast monsoon occurs between November and February , causing heavy rainfall ; the southwest monsoon sees less rainfall . The climate is stable throughout the year except for the two monsoons . The average daily temperature varies from 23 ° C ( 73 ° F ) in the morning to 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) in the afternoon , with Miri having the lowest average temperatures in comparison to other major towns in Sarawak . Miri additionally has the most hours of sunshine ( more than six hours a day ) , while other areas receive sunshine for five to six hours a day . Humidity is usually high , exceeding 68 percent . The annual rainfall varies between 330 centimetres ( 130 in ) and 460 centimetres ( 180 in ) , spanning 220 days a year . <unk> and <unk> make up 60 percent of the land , while <unk> accounts for 12 percent of the Sarawak land area . Alluvium is found in the coastal and riverine regions while 12 percent of the Sarawak land area is covered with peat swamp forest . 
 Sarawak can be divided into two geological regions : the Sunda Shield , which extends southwest from the Batang Lupar River ( near Sri Aman ) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak , and the <unk> region , which extends northeast to the Batang Lupar River , forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak . The oldest rock in southern Sarawak is schist , which was formed during the Carboniferous and Lower Permian times . While the youngest igneous rock in this region is andesite , found at Sematan . Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late Cretaceous period . Several types of stone that can be found in central and northern Sarawak are shale , sandstone , and chert . 
 Landscapes of Sarawak 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 The Sarawak coastline is covered with mangrove and <unk> forests . It forms two percent of the total forested area in Sarawak , most commonly found in the estuarine areas of Kuching , Sarikei , and Limbang . The major trees found here include : <unk> ( Rhizophora ) , <unk> palm ( <unk> <unk> ) , and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . Peat swamp forests that cover 16 percent of the forested land are concentrated in southern Miri and the lower Baram Valley . The main trees in the peat swamp forests are : <unk> ( <unk> bancanus ) , meranti ( Shorea species ) , and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> forest occupies five percent of the total forest area , while Dipterocarpaceae forests occupy mountainous areas . Several plant species have been studied for their medicinal properties . 
 The Sarawak rainforest has one of the highest concentrations of species per unit area in the world . The state has about 185 species of mammals , 530 species of birds , 166 species of snakes , 104 species of lizards , and 113 species of amphibians . The state also accounts for 19 percent of the mammals , 6 percent of the birds , 20 percent of the snakes and 32 percent of the lizards as endemic species . These species are largely found in Totally Protected Areas . There are 2 @,@ 000 tree species , 1 @,@ 000 species of orchids , 757 species of ferns , and 260 species of palm . The state is also the habitat of endangered animals , including the <unk> pygmy elephant , proboscis monkey , orangutans and rhinoceroses . Matang Wildlife Centre , Semenggoh Nature Reserve , and <unk> <unk> Wildlife Sanctuary are noted for their orangutan protection programmes . Talang – Satang National Park is notable for its turtle conservation initiatives . Birdwatching is a common activity in various national parks such as Gunung Mulu National Park , Lambir Hills National Park , and <unk> National Park . Miri – Sibuti National Park is known for its coral reefs and Gunung Gading National Park for its Rafflesia flowers . Bako National Park , the oldest national park in Sarawak , is known for its 275 species of proboscis monkeys , and Padawan Pitcher Garden for its various carnivorous pitcher plants . The Rhinoceros hornbill is the state bird of Sarawak . 
 The Sarawak state government has enacted several laws to protect its forests and endangered wildlife species , including the Forests Ordinance 1958 , Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998 , and Sarawak Natural Parks and Nature Reserves Ordinance . Some of the protected species are the orangutan , green turtle , flying lemur , and piping hornbill . Under the Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998 , Sarawak natives are given permissions to hunt for a restricted range of wild animals in the jungles but should not possess more than 5 kilograms ( 11 lb ) of meat . The Sarawak Forest Department was established in 1919 to conserve forest resources in the state . Following international criticism of the logging industry in Sarawak , the state government decided to downsize the Sarawak Forest Department and created the Sarawak Forestry Corporation in 1995 . The Sarawak Biodiversity Centre was set up in 1997 for the conservation , protection , and sustainable development of biodiversity in the state . 
 = = = = Conservation issues = = = = 
 The percentage of current forest cover in Sarawak has been controversial . The then chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud claimed that the state has 70 percent forest cover in 2011 and 48 percent in 2012 . However , in 2012 his cabinet minister claimed that the forest cover was 80 percent . The Sarawak government also planned to preserve 60 percent forest cover in the coming years . The Sarawak Forest Department held that the forest cover was 80 percent in 2012 . In contrast , foreign media asserted that Sarawak has lost 90 percent of its forest cover with a mere 3 percent to 5 percent cover left . According to Wetlands International , 10 percent of all Sarawak forests and 33 percent of peat swamp forests were cleared between 2005 and 2010 , which is 3 @.@ 5 times higher than the total rate of deforestation in Asia and 11 @.@ 7 times more than peat swamp deforestation in Asia . 
 Sarawak 's rainforests have been gradually depleted by the demand driven by the logging industry and the introduction of palm oil plantations . The issue of human rights of the Penan and deforestation in Sarawak became an international environmental issue when Swiss activist Bruno Manser entered Sarawak from 1984 until 2000 . Deforestation has affected the life of indigenous tribes , especially the Penan , whose livelihood is heavily dependent on forest produce . This led to several blockades by indigenous tribes during the 1980s and 1990s against logging companies encroaching on their lands . There have also been cases where Native Customary Rights ( NCR ) lands have been given to timber and plantation companies without the permission of the locals . The indigenous people have resorted to legal means to reinstate their NCR rights . In 2001 the High Court of Sarawak fully reinstated the NCR land claimed by the Rumah Nor people , but this was overturned partially in 2005 . However , this case has served as a precedent , leading to more NCR rights being upheld by the high court in the following years . Sarawak 's mega @-@ dams policy such as the Bakun Dam and Murum Dam projects has submerged thousands of hectares of forest and displaced thousands of indigenous people . Since 2013 , the proposed Baram Dam project has been delayed due to ongoing protests from local indigenous tribes . Since 2014 , the Sarawak government under new chief minister <unk> <unk> has started to take action against illegal logging in the state and to diversify the economy of the state . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Sarawak has abundant natural resources . Primary sectors such as mining , agriculture , and forestry accounted for 32 @.@ 8 percent of the state economy in 2013 . The main contributors in the manufacturing industry are food and beverages , wood @-@ based and rattan products , basic metal products , and petrochemical products . Meanwhile , the services sector includes cargo transportation services , air transport , and tourism . From 2000 to 2009 Sarawak had an average annual Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth rate of 5 @.@ 0 percent . Annual GDP growth was volatile from 2006 to 2013 , ranging from <unk> percent ( 2009 ) to 7 @.@ 0 percent ( 2010 ) with a standard deviation of 3 @.@ 3 percent . Sarawak contributed 10 @.@ 1 percent of the GDP of Malaysia for the nine years leading up to 2013 , becoming the third largest contributor after Selangor ( 22 @.@ 2 percent ) and Kuala Lumpur ( 13 @.@ 9 percent ) The GDP of Sarawak has grown from RM 527 million ( US $ 171 @.@ 3 million ) in 1963 to RM 58 billion ( US $ 17 @.@ 4 billion ) in 2013 , rising by 110 times . At the same time , GDP per capita has jumped from RM 688 ( US $ 223 @.@ 6 ) to RM 46 @,@ 000 ( US $ 13 @,@ 800 ) , soaring by 60 times . Sarawak has the third highest GDP per capita [ RM 44 @,@ 437 ( US $ 1331 @.@ 1 ) ] in Malaysia ; after Kuala Lumpur and Labuan . Sarawak state government was able to maintain fiscal surpluses over seven years until 2013 , supported by oil and gas industry which accounted for 34 @.@ 8 percent of the state 's revenue . Sarawak also attracted RM 9 @.@ 6 billion ( US $ 2 @.@ 88 billion ) in foreign investments where 90 percent of the investments went to Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy ( SCORE ) . SCORE is the second largest economic corridor in Malaysia . 
 Strongly export @-@ oriented , the Sarawakian economy is susceptible to global commodity prices . Total exports as a percentage of GDP was more than 100 percent in 2013 while total trade exceeds 130 percent . Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) exports accounted for more than half of the state 's total exports while crude petroleum exports accounted for 20 @.@ 8 percent . Meanwhile , palm oil , <unk> , and sawn timber accounted for 9 @.@ 0 percent of the total exports . Sarawak currently receives 5 percent oil royalty ( percentage of oil production paid by the mining company to the lease owner ) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sarawak territorial waters . Majority of the oil and gas deposits are located offshore next to Bintulu and Miri at <unk> basin , Baram basin , and around Luconia Shoals . Sarawak is also one of the world 's largest exporters of tropical hardwood timber , constituted 65 percent of total Malaysian log exports in 2000 . The last United Nations ( UN ) statistics in 2001 estimated Sarawak 's <unk> exports at an average of 14 @,@ 109 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 498 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 cu ft ) per year between 1996 and 2000 . Oversea @-@ Chinese Banking Corporation ( OCBC Bank ) was the first foreign bank to open its branches in Sarawak in 1955 . Apart from domestic banks , 18 European , 10 Middle Eastern , 11 Asian , and five North American banks have local branches in Sarawak . There are also several Sarawak @-@ based companies involved in various economic sectors such as <unk> Mata Sarawak Berhad ( <unk> ) , Naim Holdings , Rimbunan Hijau , Ta Ann Holdings , Shin Yang , Samling , WTK ( Wong Tuong Kwang ) Holdings and <unk> ( <unk> ) Group . 
 Sarawak consumer price index ( CPI ) is highly correlated with Malaysian CPI , with inflation averaging between 2 @.@ 5 and 3 @.@ 0 percent from 2009 until 2013 with a high in 2008 ( 10 @.@ 0 percent ) and a low in 2009 ( <unk> percent ) . Income inequality in Sarawak has not shown any significant changes from 1980 to 2009 , with the Gini coefficient fluctuating between 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 5 . Sarawak saw a reduction in poverty rate from 56 @.@ 5 percent ( 1975 ) to less than 1 percent ( 2015 ) . Unemployment rate also slipped from 4 @.@ 6 percent ( 2010 ) to 3 @.@ 1 percent ( 2014 ) . 
 = = = Energy = = = 
 Sarawak Energy Berhad ( SEB ) is responsible for generation , transmission , and distribution of electrical power throughout Sarawak . There are three operational dams in Sarawak as of 2015 : Batang Ai Dam , Bakun Dam , and Murum Dam with several others under feasibility study and planning . Sarawak also derive its electrical energy from coal fired power plant and thermal power station using Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) . The total capacity of the state power generation is expected to reach 7 @,@ 000 MW by 2025 . Beside empowering the state , Sarawak Energy also exports electric to neighbouring West Kalimantan in Indonesia . Alternative energy sources such as biomass , tidal , solar , wind , and Micro hydro dams are also being explored for their potential to generate power . 
 The Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy ( SCORE ) was established in 2008 and is planning for further development as far out as 2030 to exploit the abundant energy resources in the state ( Murum Dam , Baram Dam , <unk> Dam , and coal @-@ based power plants ) and to develop 10 high priority industries such as aluminium , glass , steel , oil , fisheries , livestock , timber , and tourism . The Regional Corridor Development Authority ( <unk> ) is the government agency responsible for managing SCORE . The entire central region of Sarawak is covered under SCORE and is to include major areas such as Samalaju ( near Bintulu ) , Tanjung Manis , and Mukah . In 2008 , plans are for Samalaju to be developed as an industrial park , with Tanjung Manis as a halal food hub , and Mukah as the administrative centre for SCORE with a focus on resource @-@ based research and development .

 Tourism plays a major role in the economy of the state contributing 9 @.@ 3 percent of the state 's GDP in 2015 . The Sarawak Tourism Board is responsible for tourism promotion in the state under the purview of the Sarawak Ministry of Tourism . Meanwhile , private tourism sectors are united under the Sarawak Tourism Federation . The Sarawak Convention Bureau is responsible for attracting conventions , conferences , and corporate events to be held in the Borneo Convention Centre Kuching . Most of the foreign visitors come from Brunei , Indonesia , the Philippines , Singapore , and China . The Sarawak Hornbill Tourism Award is held every two years to recognise the best in the tourism sector of the state . The Rainforest World Music Festival ( RWMF ) is the region 's premier " world music " event , attracting more than 20 @,@ 000 people yearly .

Major shopping complexes in Sarawak include The Spring , Boulevard , Hock Lee Centre , City One shopping malls in Kuching , and Bintang Megamall , Boulevard , Imperial Mall , and Miri Plaza shopping malls in Miri . The Sarawak capital of Kuching has been mentioned as one of the retirement destinations in Malaysia . 
 = = Infrastructure = = 
 The overall level of infrastructure development in Sarawak is relatively low compared to that in Peninsular Malaysia . The Sarawak Ministry of Infrastructure Development and Communications ( <unk> ) is responsible for infrastructure and telecommunication development in Sarawak . Sarawak has 21 industrial estates , with four main agencies responsible for their implementation and development . In 2009 , 94 percent of urban areas were supplied with electricity ; the percentage of rural areas supplied with electricity increased from 67 percent in 2009 to 91 percent in 2014 . In terms of telecommunication , in 2013 the coverage of fixed telephone line in Sarawak was 25 @.@ 7 percent , and the percentage of people using mobile phones was 93 @.@ 3 percent .

 = = = Transportation = = = 
 Sarawak has a total of 32 @,@ 091 kilometres ( 19 @,@ 940 mi ) of connected roadways in 2013 , with half of these ( 18 @,@ 003 kilometres ( 11 @,@ 187 mi ) ) being paved state routes , 8 @,@ 313 kilometres ( 5 @,@ 165 mi ) of dirt tracks ( built by timber and plantation companies ) , 4 @,@ 352 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 704 mi ) of gravel roads , and 1 @,@ 424 kilometres ( 885 mi ) of paved federal highway . The primary route in Sarawak is the Pan Borneo Highway , which runs from Sematan , Sarawak , through Brunei to Tawau , Sabah . However , in that the road condition is presently unsatisfactory , due to danger spots , sharp bends , blind spots , potholes , and erosion found along the road , funds from the federal budget have been allocated to upgrade the roads in Sarawak . Under the SCORE economic corridor , more roads were built to the major hydroelectric dams , Bintulu , and Kapit . Major cities and towns in Sarawak provide public transportation services such as buses , taxis , and limousines . Bus service is also available for travel to the neighbouring areas of Sabah , Brunei , and Pontianak ( Indonesia ) . Sarawak uses a dual carriageway with the left @-@ hand traffic rule . It also allows motorists to " turn left when the exit is clear " . 
 Kuching International Airport is the main gateway to Sarawak . Miri Airport serves a limited number of international flights . Other smaller airports such as Sibu Airport , Bintulu Airport , Mukah Airport , Marudi Airport , Mulu Airport , and Limbang Airport provide services to Kuala Lumpur and other domestic destinations in Sarawak . There are also a number of remote airstrips serving rural communities in the state . There are three airlines serving flight routes in Sarawak : Malaysia Airlines , Air Asia , and MASwings . Hornbill Skyways is an aviation company owned by the Sarawak state government . It provides private chartered flights and flight services for state government servants . 
 Sarawak has four primary ports at Kuching , Sibu , Bintulu , and Miri . The Bintulu seaport is under the jurisdiction of the Malaysian federal government . It is also the busiest port in Sarawak , mainly handling LNG products and standard cargo shipping . The remaining ports are under the respective state port authorities . Other ports in Sarawak include Samalaju Industrial Port and Tanjung Manis Industrial Port ( <unk> ) . The combined throughput of the four primary ports was 61 @.@ 04 million freight weight tonnes ( <unk> ) in 2013 . Sarawak has 55 navigable river networks with a combined length of 3 @,@ 300 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 100 mi ) . For centuries , the rivers of Sarawak have been a primary means of transport as well as a route for timber and other agricultural goods moving downriver for export at the country 's major ports . Sibu port is the main hub along the Rajang River , located 113 kilometres ( 70 mi ) from the river 's mouth , handling mainly timber products . However , since the initiation of Tanjung Manis Industrial Port ( <unk> ) further downriver , the total throughput of Sibu port has declined . Express boats are an important means of transport along the rivers of Sarawak . 
 No rail lines have been laid down in Sarawak because of logistical challenges and dispersed population in the state . 
 = = = Healthcare = = = 
 Sarawak has three major government hospitals : Sarawak General Hospital , Sibu Hospital , and Miri Hospital . There are also district hospitals , public health clinics , 1Malaysia clinics , and rural clinics . Besides government @-@ owned hospitals and clinics , there are several private hospitals in Sarawak such as the Normah Medical Specialists Centre , Timberland Medical Specialists Centre , and Sibu Specialist Medical Centre . Sarawak is also a medical tourism destination for Brunei and Indonesian visitors . Universiti Malaysia Sarawak ( UNIMAS ) is the only government university that produces medical graduates in the state . The Sarawak Hospice Society was set up in 1998 to promote hospice care in home settings . Hospital Sentosa is the only mental hospital in Sarawak . 
 Access to good quality healthcare is still a challenge in the rural communities . For villages located outside the operational areas of health clinics , a flying doctor service ( FDS ) is available once a month . Village health promoters are stationed in remote villages after being provided with three weeks of first aid and basic health care training . A variety of traditional medicine practices are still being used by the various communities in Sarawak . 
 In 2015 the doctor @-@ patient ratio in the state was 1 : 1 @,@ 104 – lower than the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recommendation of 1 doctor to 600 patients . In the same year , there were 2 @,@ 237 doctors in Sarawak , with 1 @,@ 759 serving in public sector and 478 in the private sector .

Sarawak has three public universities : Universiti Malaysia Sarawak ( UNIMAS ) , Universiti Teknologi Mara ( UiTM ) Kota Samarahan campus , and Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Campus . Universiti Utara Malaysia ( <unk> ) also set up several off @-@ campus study centres in Kuching and Sibu . Sarawak also has two private universities : Curtin University Sarawak and Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus . Vocational training is also given priority to supply a skilled workforce for the SCORE economic corridor . There are also several community colleges and four teacher training colleges in Sarawak . Batu Lintang Teachers ' Training College is the third oldest of its kind in Malaysia . In 2015 the total teaching workforce in Sarawak was 40 @,@ 593 . 
 Sarawak State Library ( also known as <unk> ) is the largest library in the state . Public and village libraries are found in various towns and cities . 
 = = Demography = = 
 As of the 2015 Malaysian census , the population of Sarawak was 2 @,@ 636 @,@ 000 , making it the fourth most populous state in Malaysia . However , due to the large area of Sarawak , it has the lowest population density in Malaysia , which stands at 20 people per km2 . The average population growth rate per year from 2000 to 2010 was 1 @.@ 8 percent . As of 2014 , 58 percent of the population is urban while 42 percent of the population reside in rural areas . As of 2011 , the crude birth rate in Sarawak was 16 @.@ 3 per 1000 individuals , the crude death rate was 4 @.@ 3 per 1000 population , and the infant mortality rate was 6 @.@ 5 per 1000 live births . 
 People from Sarawak are called Sarawakians . Sarawak has more than 40 sub @-@ ethnic groups , each with its own distinct language , culture and lifestyle . Cities and larger towns are populated predominantly by Malays , Melanaus , Chinese , and a smaller percentage of Ibans and <unk> who have migrated from their home villages for employment opportunities . Generally , Sarawak has six major ethnic groups : Iban , Chinese , Malay , Bidayuh , Melanau , and Orang Ulu . Several minor ethnic groups include : Kedayan , Javanese , Bugis , Murut , and Indian . Sarawak has 150 @,@ 000 registered migrant workers working as domestic workers or in plantation , manufacturing , construction , services and agriculture . However , the total number of illegal immigrants may be as high as 320 @,@ 000 to 350 @,@ 000 people . 
 The term Dayak is commonly used to refer to the Iban people and the Bidayuh . The term is often used in a nationalistic context . In 2015 the Malaysian federal government recognised the use of the term on official forms . Bumiputera ( son of the soil ) refers to the Malays and other indigenous groups in Peninsular Malaysia , Sarawak and Sabah . This group of people generally enjoy special privileges in education , jobs , finance , and political positions . Orang Asal refers to all the indigenous groups in Malaysia excluding Malays . 
 = = = Iban = = = 
 Sarawak has the highest number of Ibans in Borneo , numbering 745 @,@ 400 people . They are also known as Sea Dayaks . The large majority of Ibans practise Christianity . The Ibans originally inhabited the areas around the Rajang basin , but following Brooke 's military expeditions , they gradually moved into northern regions of Sarawak . Iban settlements are usually in the form of a longhouse . The longhouse was a defensive unit in the past , when headhunting was prevalent . Today it remains a ritual symbol among its households . In the past , the Ibans recognised status hierarchy such as raja <unk> ( the rich and the brave ) , orang <unk> ( ordinary people ) , and <unk> ( slaves ) . However , during the Brooke era , Iban society was restructured into formal offices such as <unk> <unk> ( headman ) , penghulu ( regional chief ) , and <unk> ( paramount chief ) . They still observe many of their traditional rituals and beliefs such as Gawai <unk> ( festival of the dead ) and the Gawai Dayak ( Harvest Festival ) . 
 = = = Chinese = = = 
 Chinese traders first came to Sarawak in the 6th century AD . The Chinese population today consists of communities originated from immigrants during the Brooke era . These migrants first worked as labourers inside gold mines at Bau , Sarawak . A variety of dialect groups is found among Sarawak Chinese ; Cantonese , Foochow , Hakka , Hokkien , Teochew , and <unk> ( Putian people ) . They celebrate major cultural festivals such as Hungry Ghost Festival and the Chinese New Year . The majority of Sarawak Chinese are made up from Buddhists and Christians . In Kuching , most of the Chinese settled near the Sarawak River , an area which would later form Chinatown . In 1901 Wong Nai Siong brought his clansmen to settle in Sibu , near the Rajang River . The Chinese later went to work at coal mines and oil fields in Miri · The Sarawak Chinese were influenced by the Kuomintang and later the Communist Party of China before adopting the ideology of Sarawak nationalism after 1963 . 
 = = = Malay = = = 
 The Malays are traditionally fishermen . They chose to build settlements ( Malay villages ) along the river banks . Today , they migrate to urban areas and work in public and private sectors . They are known for their silver and brass crafts , wood carvings , and textiles . Some typical Malay villages are located along the riverside near Fort Margherita , behind the Kuching Mosque , and at the foot of Mount Santubong . Several theories about the origins of the Malays in Sarawak have been proposed . James Brooke purportedly applied the term for the first time on the coast @-@ dwelling indigenous Muslims in Sarawak . However , not all Muslims in Sarawak are Malays . Most of the Melanau tribe also practise Islam . Other theories claim that the Malays came from the Malay Archipelago ( for instance , from Java or Sumatra ) , Arabs from the Middle East , or through cultural and religious conversions of indigenous people of Sarawak . 
 = = = Melanau = = = 
 The Melanaus are native to Sarawak . Most of them come from the coastal town of Mukah . They traditionally live in tall houses , but after adopting a Malay lifestyle , they dwell in villages . They worked as fishermen , boat @-@ builders , and craftsmen . They originally practised paganism and celebrate Kaul festival but today most of them are Muslims . 
 = = = Bidayuh = = = 
 The Bidayuh mainly stayed in the southern part of Sarawak such as <unk> , Bau , Serian , and the Padawan municipality . They are known as Land Dayaks because they traditionally live on steep limestone mountains . They consist of several sub @-@ ethnic groups such as the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and speak mutually unintelligible dialects . Therefore , they accepted English and Malay languages as their common language . They are known for several musical instruments such as gigantic drums and a bamboo percussion instrument known as the <unk> . Like the Ibans , their traditional settlements are longhouses , but they also construct <unk> roundhouses for community meetings . The majority of the Bidayuh practice the Christian faith . 
 = = = Orang Ulu = = = 
 The name Orang Ulu means " upriver people " in the Iban language . It includes numerous tribes who live upstream in Sarawak 's interior such as the Kenyah , Kayan , Lun Bawang , Kelabit , Penan , Bisaya , and <unk> tribes . Formerly <unk> , most of them stay in Bario , Ba 'kelalan , <unk> , and near the drainage basin of the Baram River . They decorate their longhouses with murals and woodcarvings . They are also known for boat building , beadwork and tattooing . Well @-@ known musical instruments from the Orang Ulu are the <unk> ' <unk> and Kenyah 's <unk> ' and Lun Bawang 's bamboo band . The Kelabit and Lun Bawang people are known for their production of fragrant rice . The majority of Orang Ulu are Christians . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Although Islam is the official religion of the federation , Sarawak has no official state religion . However , during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya 'kub , the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong as the head of Islam in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs . With such provisions , Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is also possible . The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial , child custody , betrothal , inheritance , and criminal cases in the state . An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed . 
 Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia where Christians outnumber Muslims . The earliest Christian missionaries in Sarawak were propagated by Church of England ( Anglicans ) in 1848 , followed by Roman Catholics a few years later , and Methodists in 1903 . Such missionaries first took place among the Chinese immigrants before spreading to indigenous animists . Other Christian denominations in Sarawak are Borneo Evangelical Mission ( BEM or <unk> <unk> Borneo , SIB . ) , and Baptists . Indigenous people such as the Iban , Bidayuh , and Orang Ulu have adopted Christianity although they do retain some of their traditional religious rites . Many Muslims come from the Malay , Melanau , and Kayan ethnic groups . Buddhism , Taoism , and Chinese folk religion are predominantly practised by Chinese Malaysians . Other minor religions in Sarawak are Baha 'i , Hinduism , Sikhism , and animism .

 English was the sole official language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 because the first chief minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan opposed the use of the Malay language in Sarawak . In 1974 the new chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya 'kub adopted the Malay language and English as the two official languages of Sarawak . He also changed the medium of instruction in schools from English to Malay . Today , English is used in the courts , state legislative assembly , and certain government agencies in Sarawak . On 18 November 2015 , the Sarawak Chief Minister <unk> <unk> announced the state 's adoption of English as the official language of Sarawak , along with Malay . 
 The Malay language , known as Bahasa Sarawak ( or Sarawak Malay ) , is the main language among the Sarawak Malays and other indigenous tribes . Bahasa Sarawak is a different dialect from that spoken on the peninsula . The Iban language is also widely spoken among 34 percent of the Sarawak population while the Bidayuh language , with six major dialects , is spoken by 10 percent of the population . The Orang Ulu have about 30 different language dialects . The Chinese generally use Standard Chinese although they also use many different dialects such as Hokkien , Hakka , Foochow , and Teochew . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Sarawak exhibits notable diversity in ethnicity , culture , and language . The Sarawakian culture has been influenced by Bruneian Malays of the coastal areas . Substantial cultural influences also came from the Chinese and British cultures . Headhunting was once an important tradition for the Ibans ; the custom is no longer observed . Christianity plays an important role in the daily lives of the Kelabit and Lun Bawang and has changed their ethnic identities . The Penan people were the last indigenous group to abandon their nomadic way of life in the jungle . Interracial marriages are common in the state . 
 Sarawak Cultural Village is located at the foot of Mount Santubong , Kuching . Known as the " living museum " , it showcases the various ethnic groups carrying out traditional activities in their respective traditional houses . Cultural performances are also presented here . The Sarawak State Museum houses a collection of artefacts such as pottery , textiles , and woodcarving tools from various ethnic tribes in Sarawak , and also ethnographic materials of local cultures . The museum building preserves its French architecture . Other museums include the Islamic Heritage Museum , Chinese History Museum , Kuching Cat Museum , Sarawak Textile Museum , Art Museum , Lau King Howe Medical Museum , and Baram Regional Museum . There is also a series of well @-@ preserved forts in Sarawak built during the Brooke regime such as Fort Margherita , Fort Emma , Fort Sylvia , and Fort Alice . 
 The Batang Ai Resort and Bawang Assan Iban longhouses allow the visiting guests to have an overnight stay and to participate in traditional Iban daily activities . Other longhouses include : Iban longhouses in Kapit , Bidayuh longhouses in Kuching , Kelabit longhouses in Bario , Lun Bawang longhouses in Ba 'kelalan , and Melanau wooden houses in Sibu . Main Bazaar and Carpenter Street are the two notable streets in Chinatown , Kuching . India Street in Kuching is notable for its textile products . An Indian – Muslim mosque can be found in the vicinity .

Sarawak Artists Society was established in 1985 to promote local cultures and arts in the form of paintings . Most artists in the post @-@ war Sarawak prefers scenery and nature , traditional dances , and traditional daily activities as their drawing themes . 
 Orang Ulu 's <unk> ( a dug @-@ out guitar ) is the best known traditional musical instrument in Sarawak . It was played for Queen Elizabeth during her official visit to Sarawak in 1972 . It was first introduced to the world during Asian Traditional Performing Arts ( <unk> ) in Japan in 1976 . Other traditional musical instruments are various types of gongs and Kulintang ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) , idiophones , bamboo flutes and zithers . 
 The oral tradition has been part of the culture of the various indigenous groups in Sarawak for generations . It is used for passing on life lessons , traditions , and values to the younger generation . The stories are told repeatedly by the elders to the younger ones , such as in storytelling sessions on special occasions and through traditional performances . Some of these traditional practices are the Iban 's <unk> dances , <unk> ( Iban vocal repertory ) , <unk> ( Iban oral narratives ) , and epic storytelling by the Kayan and Kenyah . The Borneo Literature Bureau existed from 1958 until 1977 ; it encouraged the documentation of local cultures , local authors , and publications in English , Chinese , Malay , Iban and other native languages . The Bureau was replaced by the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka ( <unk> ) in 1977 , which advocated publication only in the Malay language . Documentation of oral traditions has also been done by the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak ( UNIMAS ) and the Sarawak Customs Council . The Sarawak Gazette was first published by the Brooke government in 1870 . It recorded a variety of news in Sarawak related to economics , agriculture , anthropology , and archaeology . The Gazette is still being published today . Hikayat Panglima <unk> ( Story of <unk> the Warrior ) , printed in 1876 at Kuching , is one of the earliest text publications in Borneo . Written by Ahmad <unk> Abdul Hamid , it is also the first novel of Malaysia . The indigenous traditions have also become a source of writing for Sarawak Chinese authors .

 Notable dishes in the state include Sarawak laksa , <unk> mee , and <unk> <unk> . The state is also known for its Sarawak layer cake dessert . Each ethnic group has its own delicacies with different styles of preparing , cooking , and eating food . However , modern technology has altered the way of cooking for native dishes . Examples of ethnic foods are the Iban <unk> ( rice wine ) , Melanau <unk> ( sago palm crackers ) and <unk> ( raw fish mixed with lime juice ) , and Orang Ulu <unk> <unk> ( pudding ) . The traditional food of Sarawak has also been marketed as a culinary tourism product . Examples of locally grown franchise stores in Sarawak are Sugar Bun , Singapore Chicken Rice , and Bing Coffee . Other international foods such as Western food , Indonesian food , Indian food , and Middle Eastern food can also be found here .

 The Sarawak government is popularly believed to exert its influence over the media . Examples of newspapers based in Sarawak are Sin Chew Daily , See Hua Daily News , Borneo Post , and Utusan Borneo . In the 1990s , major newspapers negatively portrayed the timber blockades in Sarawak as detrimental to the state 's growth and development . The Sarawak Tribune was indefinitely suspended in 2006 for publishing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad . The daily was rebooted as the New Sarawak Tribune in 2010 . In 2010 Clare <unk> Brown , sister @-@ in @-@ law of former British prime minister Gordon Brown , set up a Sarawak Report website and a London @-@ based short @-@ wave radio station named Radio Free Sarawak to provide alternative news and views free from the influence of the Sarawak government .

 Sarawakians observe a number of holidays and festivals throughout the year . Apart from national Hari Merdeka and Malaysia Day celebrations , the state also celebrates Sarawak Self @-@ government Day on 22 July and the State Governor 's birthday . Ethnic groups also celebrate their own festivals . The open house tradition allows other ethnic groups to join in the celebrations . Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia to declare the Gawai Dayak celebration a public holiday . It is also the only state in Malaysia that does not gazette the Deepavali celebration as a public holiday . Religious groups are free to hold processions in major towns and cities during festivals . Sarawak and Sabah are the only two states in Malaysia that declare Good Friday a public holiday .

 Sarawak sent its own teams to participate in the 1958 and 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games , and 1962 Asian Games before its athletes started representing Malaysia after 1963 . The Sarawak State Sports Council was formed in 1985 to raise the standard of sports in Sarawak . Sarawak was the host of the Malaysian SUKMA Games in 1990 and for the second time in the 2016 Sukma Games . The state was the overall champion in the 1990 , 1992 , and 1994 SUKMA games . Sarawak also sent teams representing Malaysia at the Southeast Asian Games . Sarawak also contributed one Olympic medal to the total of six medals won by Malaysia from 1992 to 2012 . Sarawak also emerged as the overall champion for 11 consecutive years at the Malaysia Para Games since 1994 . The state also sent athletes to participate in the Special Olympics World Games . 
 There are several stadiums in Sarawak : Sarawak Stadium , Sarawak State Stadium , Stadium <unk> ( Unity Stadium ) , and Sarawak State Hockey Stadium . The Sarawak FA football association was founded in 1974 . It won the Malaysia FA Cup in 1992 and the Malaysia Premier League in 1997 and 2013 . 
 = California State Route 133 = 
 State Route 133 ( SR 133 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California . It connects SR 1 in Laguna Beach through the San Joaquin Hills with several freeways in Irvine , ending at the SR 241 toll road in the latter city . The portion north of SR 73 in Laguna Beach is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , and it is built as an expressway from SR 73 to Laguna Canyon Road ( just south of I @-@ 405 in Irvine ) . SR 133 is a freeway ( the Laguna Freeway ) to I @-@ 5 , and a tollway ( part of the Eastern Toll Road ) to SR 241 near the Santa Ana Mountains . 
 SR 133 was constructed as a county road by the 1910s ; the portion from I @-@ 405 to I @-@ 5 was upgraded to a freeway four decades later . Plans to extend the freeway south were canceled by the state , and the southern part of the road remains an undivided highway . In 1998 , the majority of the Eastern Transportation Corridor opened , and the connector between I @-@ 5 and SR 241 was designated as a toll extension of SR 133 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 133 begins at the Pacific Coast Highway ( SR 1 ) as Broadway in Laguna Beach , a block from the Pacific Ocean . The name changes to Laguna Canyon Road as the highway leaves downtown Laguna Beach and enters Laguna Canyon , soon narrowing to one lane in each direction . After entering the canyon , which lies between Laguna Coast Wilderness Park ( west side of SR 133 ) and Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park ( east side of SR 133 ) , the first major intersection is with El Toro Road ( County Route <unk> ) . SR 133 widens to four lanes and becomes a highway after its interchange with the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road ( SR 73 ) . 
 As it continues through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park , SR 133 follows a four @-@ lane alignment on the west side of the canyon , moved from the old two @-@ lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006 . Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine . North of the park , the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at @-@ grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road , followed by an interchange at exit 8 , San Diego Freeway ( I @-@ 405 ) . SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway ( I @-@ 5 ) . After crossing I @-@ 5 , SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro , crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241 . 
 = = History = = 
 As part of its construction of concrete roads , started by a 1913 bond issue , Orange County paved the county road through Laguna Canyon , connecting State Highway Route 2 ( the forerunner of U.S. Hwy . 101 and I @-@ 5 ) at Irvine with Laguna Beach , by 1917 . The road was added to the state highway system in 1933 as Route 185 , an unsigned designation . The entire route was added to the new California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 ; the planned upgrade had already been named the Laguna Freeway by the California Highway Commission on November 26 , 1957 . The highway received a sign route number — State Route 133 — in the 1964 renumbering . 
 Opening of the first — and only — piece of the Laguna Freeway was celebrated in Laguna Beach on October 1 , 1952 , connecting the north end of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the Santa Ana Freeway at a trumpet interchange and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue . There were initially no other interchanges along the route . The state decided not to build the remainder of the freeway in late 1975 , and in 1996 the portion south of SR 73 was removed from the Freeway and Expressway System . Widening of the part north of SR 73 to a four @-@ lane expressway was completed in late 2006 , moving the road out of the canyon bottom and allowing better access to areas in Laguna Coast Wilderness Park . 
 A new State Route 231 was added to the state highway system in 1988 , connecting I @-@ 5 northwest of Irvine with SR 91 , and in 1991 the south end was shifted southeast to the north end of SR 133 , with the old route becoming SR 261 . To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I @-@ 5 , the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996 , with the remainder becoming an extended SR 241 . The Eastern Transportation Corridor , which includes SR 133 north of I @-@ 5 , was completed on October 15 , 1998 , opening a new shortcut from Orange County to the northeast . 
 = = Tolls = = 
 The toll portion of SR 133 employs a barrier toll system , where drivers are charged flat @-@ rate tolls based on what particular toll booths they pass through . Tolls are collected at selected on- and off @-@ ramps ; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza , which spans the on @-@ and off @-@ ramps to Northbound SR 241 ( traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133 / 241 interchange ) . 
 Since May 13 , 2014 , the road has been using an all @-@ electronic , open road tolling system ; cash is no longer being accepted . Drivers may pay using the <unk> electronic toll collection system , license plate tolling ( under Transportation Corridor Agencies 's brand name " <unk> " ) , or via a one time payment online . Those using <unk> are charged a lower toll than those using the other two methods . Drivers must pay within 5 days after their trip on the toll road or they will accessed a toll violation .

 = Subtropical ridge = 
 The subtropical ridge , also known as the subtropical high or horse latitudes , is a significant belt of atmospheric high pressure situated around the latitudes of 30 ° N in the Northern Hemisphere and 30 ° S in the Southern Hemisphere . It is characterized by mostly calm winds , which act to reduce air quality under its axis by causing fog overnight , and haze during daylight hours caused by the stable atmosphere found near its location . Air flows out from its center toward the upper and lower latitudes of each hemisphere , creating both the trade winds and the westerlies . The subtropical ridge moves poleward during the summer , reaching its most northern latitude in early fall , before moving equatorward during the cold season . The ENSO climate cycle can displace the northern hemisphere subtropical ridge , with La <unk> allowing for a more northerly axis for the ridge , while El Niños show flatter , more southerly ridges . The change of the ridge position during ENSO cycles changes tracks of tropical cyclones that form around their equatorward and western peripheries . As the subtropical ridge varies in position and strength , it can enhance or depress monsoon regimes around their low @-@ latitude periphery . The term " horse latitudes " refers to and is synonymous with the subtropical ridge or subtropical high . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or Intertropical convergence zone . These rising air currents diverge in the upper troposphere and move away from the equator at high altitude in both northerly and southerly directions . As it moves towards the mid @-@ latitudes on both sides of the equator , the air cools and sinks . The resulting air mass subsidence creates a subtropical ridge near the 30th parallel of latitude in both hemispheres where the formation of cloud is minimal except on the anticyclone ’ s western edge ( eastern coast of continents ) where warm and moist low @-@ level air is driven poleward and cooled to create thunderstorms – producing the humid subtropical climates of the American South , South China , southern <unk> central @-@ eastern South America , southern Queensland and KwaZulu Natal province in South Africa . At surface level , the sinking air diverges again with some moving back to the equator and completing the vertical cycle . This circulation on each side of the equator is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge . Many of the world 's deserts are caused by these climatological high @-@ pressure areas . 
 = = Migration = = 
 The subtropical ridge starts migrating poleward in late spring reaching its zenith in early autumn before retreating equatorward during the late fall , winter , and early spring . The equatorward migration of the subtropical ridge during the cold season is due to increasing north @-@ south temperature differences between the poles and tropics . The latitudinal movement of the subtropical ridge is strongly correlated with the progression of the monsoon trough or Intertropical Convergence Zone . 
 Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator , then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies . When the subtropical ridge shifts due to ENSO , so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks . Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September – November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years , while mainland China experiences much greater landfall frequency during La Niña years . During El Niño years , the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130 ° E , which would favor the Japanese archipelago , while in La Niña years the formation of tropical cyclones , along with the subtropical ridge position , shift west , which increases the threat to China . In the Atlantic basin , the subtropical ridge position tends to lie about 5 degrees farther south during El Niño years , which leads to a more southerly recurvature for tropical cyclones during those years . 
 When the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation 's mode is favorable to tropical cyclone development ( 1995 – present ) , it amplifies the subtropical ridge across the central and eastern Atlantic . 
 = = Importance to global monsoon regimes = = 
 When the subtropical ridge in the northwest Pacific is stronger than normal , it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia . The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States . The subtropical ridge across North America typically migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September . When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners , monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona . When suppressed to the south , the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest , causing a break in the monsoon regime . 
 = = Role in haze and fog formation = = 
 When surface winds become light , the subsidence produced directly under the subtropical ridge can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge , leading to widespread haze . If the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight , fog can form .

The platform and shelter also include a roadside beacon that is lit at night , graffiti @-@ resistant weather barriers , two <unk> ticket vending machines , two ORCA card readers , and a next bus arrival sign . Buses stop at all stations , are allowed a dwell time of 10 seconds , and use curb bumpers to guide them closer to the platform . 
 Transfers from Swift to other bus routes are possible at every station , served by shadow service running on the State Route 99 and Evergreen Way corridor between Swift stations and frequently @-@ spaced stops . Community Transit route 101 runs from Aurora Village Transit Center to the Everett city limits at Airport Road Station , and Everett Transit routes 7 and 8 run on the Swift corridor within Everett . There are several intersecting routes that connect Swift to Sound Transit Express service on Interstate 5 in Lynnwood : three routes on 200th Street near Crossroads and Heron stations travel east to Lynnwood Transit Center ; and two routes on 148th Street travel to Ash Way Park and Ride . Swift 's termini also connect to regional services that run south to Seattle : Everett Station has Sounder commuter rail and Sound Transit Express bus routes to Seattle , and Aurora Village Transit Center is the terminus for the RapidRide E Line , a bus rapid transit route on Aurora Avenue that runs through Shoreline to Downtown Seattle .

 Notes 
 = = Service = = 
 Swift runs at a headway of 12 minutes from 6 : 00 a.m. to 7 : 00 pm on weekdays , its highest level of service with five buses per hour per direction . Weekday service begins with a headway of 20 minutes from 5 : 00 a.m. to 6 : 00 am , and ends with the same frequency during the evening from 7 : 00 p.m. to 10 : 00 pm . During Saturdays , buses run every 20 minutes from 6 : 00 a.m. to 10 : 00 pm . Sunday service , which was suspended from 2010 until 2015 , runs from 7 : 00 a.m. to 8 : 20 pm every 20 minutes . Swift initially ran at a 10 @-@ minute headway , and had evening service end at midnight , until a major system @-@ wide service reduction in February 2012 reduced its weekday headway to the current 12 minutes . 
 Swift carried a total of 1 @,@ 621 @,@ 838 riders in 2015 , making it the most popular route operated by Community Transit , and accounting for 16 @.@ 2 % of the agency 's total ridership . 
 = = = Fares and enforcement = = = 
 Fares on Swift are equivalent to Community Transit 's local service fares , divided into three groups : adult at $ 2 @.@ 25 , youth at $ 1 @.@ 50 , and reduced at $ 1 @.@ 00 . Adult fare is charged for passengers between the ages of 19 and 64 , youth fare is charged for passengers between the ages of 6 and 18 , and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 , or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders . At the time of Swift 's launch in 2009 , adult fares were set at $ 1 @.@ 50 ; since then , fares have since increased to the present $ 2 @.@ 25 for adults effective July 1 , 2015 . 
 Swift uses off @-@ board payment at its stations , made possible by the placement of two ORCA card readers and two ticket vending machines at each shelter . The ticket vending machines only accept $ 1 bills ( without giving change ) and credit cards from Visa and MasterCard , printing out a paper ticket . The system uses proof @-@ of @-@ payment to verify fares , enforced by " Swift Ambassadors " , who conduct random checks and can issue a $ 124 citation to riders who fail to pay .

 Swift uses a fleet of 15 specially @-@ branded New Flyer <unk> articulated hybrid buses , measuring 62 feet ( 19 m ) long and carrying 43 seated passengers and up to 80 standing passengers . The buses , ordered in 2007 with the option of purchasing 34 additional coaches , have three doors ( of which two are plug doors ) that allow for all @-@ door boarding at all stations ; the front door has a wheelchair ramp , and is located closest to the two wheelchair bays secured by a passive restraint system , which doesn 't require assistance from the driver ; bicyclists are directed to the rear door of the coach , where three interior bike racks are located . The coaches deadhead to and from their overnight storage space at the Merrill Creek bus base in Everett , where a mock station used for driver training was unveiled in May 2009 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Former services = = = 
 Swift bus rapid transit service on the State Route 99 corridor was preceded by decades of transit services traveling through southwestern Snohomish County , which ranged from an interurban railway to local buses . The Seattle – Everett Interurban Railway ran interurban service from 1910 to 1939 along the Pacific Highway , later U.S. Route 99 and State Route 99 . During its heyday , the interurban ran at 30 @-@ minute headways throughout the day , and only made automatic stops at its terminals in Everett and Seattle . The railway was dismantled and later used as right of way for overhead power lines , until it was converted into a rail trail in the 1990s and 2000s , named the Interurban Trail . 
 Community Transit was founded in 1976 as the public transit agency for Snohomish County , and introduced local service from Everett to Aurora Village via State Route 99 on route 750 . Route 750 was later renumbered to route 610 , which was later upgraded to 15 @-@ minute headways in the 1990s , and itself split into two routes , 100 and 101 , in 2003 . Community Transit route 100 ran during peak hours along the full length of the corridor from Aurora Village to Everett , while route 101 only ran the southern portion of the route to South Everett , with all @-@ day service that required a transfer to Everett Transit to complete trips to downtown Everett . 
 = = = BAT lanes and BRT studies = = = 
 Planning for limited @-@ stop bus service , which later evolved into bus rapid transit , began in the 1990s , with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road ( near State Route 526 ) in Everett . Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority , and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system , but later replaced it , before service began , with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate , while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit . Sound Transit funded the construction of business access and transit lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002 , converting former parking lanes , and widening the highway in some areas , improving existing bus service , and laying the ground for a future bus rapid transit line . 
 Community Transit 's Strategic Planning Group published a recommendation in 2004 , calling for bus rapid transit service on the State Route 99 corridor between Everett Station and Aurora Village Transit Center , featuring off @-@ board fare collection , limited stops , and transit signal priority . The route alternatives proposed included express service from Aurora Village to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue North or Interstate 5 , as well as express service on Interstate 5 in Everett , if a partnership to share costs with Everett Transit for the Evergreen Way segment was not viable . In December 2005 , the CT Board of Directors approved an accelerated planning schedule for a bus rapid transit project , to cost an estimated $ 15 – 20 million , and to begin service as the first such system in the Puget Sound region in 2008 . 
 = = = Planning , design and construction = = = 
 Community Transit unveiled detailed plans for its bus rapid transit system , including the " Swift " name and logo , on July 26 , 2006 . The first line , located on State Route 99 between Everett and Aurora Village , would begin operating in 2008 , with 10 @-@ minute headways and limited stops . The agency envisioned real @-@ time arrival signs at stations , and transit signal priority , among other improvements over existing bus service . 
 The following year , CT purchased its fleet of 15 hybrid diesel @-@ electric buses from New Flyer , at a cost of $ 879 @,@ 028 per vehicle , to be paid for with state and federal subsidies . 
 Community Transit signed an agreement on December 5 , 2007 with Everett Transit , which allowed for Swift to operate within Everett city limits with sales tax revenue from Everett funding stations , and transit signal priority within Everett . In exchange , Everett Transit would be allowed to expand its services into neighboring unincorporated areas that do not have CT service . 
 A groundbreaking ceremony for the first Swift station , located at Airport Road in south Everett , was held on December 3 , 2008 , and was attended by Community Transit CEO Joyce Eleanor , U.S. Senator Patty Murray , and the mayors of Everett and Marysville . Stations were constructed in two phases : the first consisting of utility relocation and pouring of the concrete shelter pad ; the second being the installation of the shelters , beacons , and other amenities beginning in June 2009 . The first station to be completed , a training facility at the Merrill Creek bus base , was opened during a media event on May 5 , 2009 ; in September 2009 , the first station on the line was completed at 196th Street in Lynnwood . 
 The project cost a total of $ 29 million ( equivalent to $ 32 million in 2016 ) , of which $ 15 million was paid for by grants from the Federal Transit Administration , Washington State Department of Transportation , as well as the partnership with Everett Transit . The grants also paid for the majority of the cost to operate Swift for its first three years of service , estimated at $ 5 million annually , allowing it to maintain 10 @-@ minute headways , while the rest of Community Transit service was reduced in 2010 . 
 = = = Launch and additional stations = = = 
 Swift launched on November 29 , 2009 with a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony at Crossroads Station , and a day of free rides from 4 : 00 p.m. to midnight . The following day marked the beginning of regular service , with the first runs departing their termini at 5 : 00 am , and the new service attracted more than 1 @,@ 500 riders , with end @-@ to @-@ end trips taking 20 minutes less compared to local buses on the same corridor . Swift debuted as the first bus rapid transit line in the state of Washington , ahead of King County 's RapidRide , opening a year later in 2010 , and one of the longest lines in the country when it opened . 
 Existing local service on the State Route 99 was reduced on November 29 to accommodate the introduction of Swift . Community Transit eliminated route 100 , a peak only service on the corridor , and reduced weekday headways on route 101 from 15 minutes to 20 minutes . Everett Transit reduced weekday headways on route 9 , running from Airport Road Station to the Everett Community College , from 20 minutes to 30 minutes . 
 The successful launch of Swift , which saw ridership grow to 3 @,@ 000 daily boardings in its first five months of service , earned Community Transit a Vision 2040 Award from the Puget Sound Regional Council in May 2010 . The agency also received two bronze Summit Creative Awards for the launch of Swift , as well as instructional videos on riding Swift that were published on YouTube . 
 Four infill stations located in Everett were added to Swift in December 2010 and January 2011 : a split pair at Madison Street and Pecks Drive , filling a nearly 2 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) gap between Casino Road and 50th Street , and a pair at 112th Street . The stations were paid for by $ 1 @.@ 6 million in regional mobility grants from the Washington State Department of Transportation to Everett Transit , awarded in May 2009 . 
 The final Swift station , College Station at 204th Street SW in Lynnwood , was opened on February 3 , 2016 . The southbound @-@ only station is without a matching northbound one , serves the Edmonds Community College . It was originally proposed with the rest of the Lynnwood stations , but was delayed while waiting for the City of Lynnwood to extend 204th Street and build a traffic signal at its intersection with State Route 99 . 
 = = = Later developments = = = 
 Swift stations were given a number of small improvements after the line opened . Curb bumpers were installed in June 2010 to help guide buses closer to the raised platform , and reduce the gap at the door . In 2012 , a queue jump signal was installed northbound at the north end of the BAT lanes at 148th Street , allow Swift buses to merge into traffic . Real @-@ time arrival signs debuted at Swift stations in 2013 , featuring a countdown to the arrival of the next bus that is estimated using GPS units on coaches . In June 2015 , the Washington State Department of Transportation removed part of the refuge island at the intersection of State Route 99 and Airport Road to create a through lane exclusively for Swift buses . 
 Bus service on Aurora Avenue North , the continuation of State Route 99 in Shoreline and Seattle , was upgraded to bus rapid transit with the introduction of the RapidRide E Line in February 2014 . The line terminates at Aurora Village Transit Center , allowing for transfers to Swift .

 In its transit development plan published in 2016 , Community Transit proposed the restoration of 10 @-@ minute weekday frequencies on Swift by March 2018 . 
 Community Transit has also proposed extending the current line on State Route 99 through Shoreline to Link Light Rail at NE 185th Street Station when it opens as part of the Lynnwood Link Extension in 2023 .

 In 2005 , Community Transit approved a long range plan , which extended Swift into a full network , and which comprised the core of Community Transit service on " Transit Emphasis Corridors " . The corridors identified served the cities of Everett , Lynnwood , Edmonds , Mill Creek , Bothell , Marysville , and Arlington , using existing arterial streets that already have bus service . 
 Community Transit announced plans for a second Swift line in November 2013 . The 12 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) line , tentatively named " Swift II " , was created out of two Transit Emphasis Corridors , and would travel from the Boeing Everett Factory to Mill Creek via Airport Road and State Route 527 . A study , prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff , and partially funded by the state legislature in 2012 , estimated that the project would cost $ 42 – 48 million to construct , and attract 3 @,@ 300 riders when it opened . The Federal Transit Administration approved project development in December 2014 , a prerequisite to federal grants for capital construction and vehicle acquisition . During the 2015 session of the Washington State Legislature , Community Transit was granted the authority to increase sales taxes to fund operation of Swift II , pending voter approval via a ballot measure ; the Washington State Department of Transportation also gave $ 6 @.@ 8 million in funding to build the line 's northern terminus at Seaway Transit Center . The ballot measure was approved by voters in November 2015 , and CT expects the line to open as early as 2018 . 
 = Narcissus ( plant ) = 
 Narcissus / <unk> / is a genus of predominantly spring perennial plants in the Amaryllidaceae ( amaryllis ) family . Various common names including daffodil , <unk> , narcissus , and jonquil are used to describe all or some members of the genus . Narcissus has conspicuous flowers with six petal @-@ like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet @-@ shaped corona . The flowers are generally white or yellow ( orange or pink in garden varieties ) , with either uniform or contrasting coloured tepals and corona . 
 Narcissus were well known in ancient civilisation , both medicinally and botanically , but formally described by Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum ( 1753 ) . The genus is generally considered to have about ten sections with approximately 50 species . The number of species has varied , depending on how they are classified , due to similarity between species and hybridization . The genus arose some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene epochs , in the Iberian peninsula and adjacent areas of southwest Europe . The exact origin of the name Narcissus is unknown , but it is often linked to a Greek word for intoxicated ( narcotic ) and the myth of the youth of that name who fell in love with his own reflection . The English word ' daffodil ' appears to be derived from " asphodel " , with which it was commonly compared . 
 The species are native to meadows and woods in southern Europe and North Africa with a center of diversity in the Western Mediterranean , particularly the Iberian peninsula . Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely , and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century . Narcissi tend to be long @-@ lived bulbs , which propagate by division , but are also insect @-@ pollinated . Known pests , diseases and disorders include viruses , fungi , the larvae of flies , mites and nematodes . Some Narcissus species have become extinct , while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism . 
 Historical accounts suggest narcissi have been cultivated from the earliest times , but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands . Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens . The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars . For horticultural purposes , narcissi are classified into divisions , covering a wide range of shapes and colours . Like other members of their family , narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids , which provide some protection for the plant , but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested . This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer 's dementia . Long celebrated in art and literature , narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures , ranging from death to good fortune , and as symbols of spring . The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries . The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = General = = = 
 Narcissus is a genus of perennial herbaceous <unk> geophytes , dying back after flowering to an underground storage bulb . They regrow in the following year from brown @-@ skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks , and reach heights of 5 – 80 cm depending on the species . Dwarf species such as N. <unk> have a maximum height of 5 – 8 cm , while Narcissus tazetta may grow as tall as 80 cm . 
 The plants are <unk> , having a single central leafless hollow flower stem ( scape ) . Several green or blue @-@ green , narrow , strap @-@ shaped leaves arise from the bulb . The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower , but occasionally a cluster of flowers ( umbel ) . The flowers , which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow , sometimes both or rarely green , consist of a perianth of three parts . Closest to the stem ( proximal ) is a floral tube above the ovary , then an outer ring composed of six tepals ( undifferentiated sepals and petals ) , and a central disc to conical shaped corona . The flowers may hang down ( pendent ) , or be erect . There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style . The ovary is inferior ( below the floral parts ) consisting of three chambers ( trilocular ) . The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits ( dehisces ) releasing numerous black seeds . 
 The bulb lies dormant after the leaves and flower stem die back and has contractile roots that pull it down further into the soil . The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb , to emerge the following season . Most species are dormant from summer to late winter , flowering in the spring , though a few species are autumn flowering . 
 = = = Specific = = = 
 = = = = Vegetative = = = = 
 Bulbs 
 The pale brown @-@ skinned ovoid tunicate bulbs have a membranous tunic and a corky stem ( base or basal ) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs in a ring around the edge , which grow up to 40 mm in length . Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales , surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud . The scales are of two types , true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves . These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached . The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk ( <unk> ) . ( see Hanks Fig 1 @.@ 3 ) . The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units , each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases . Each bulb unit has a life of about four years . 
 Once the leaves die back in summer , the roots also wither . After some years , the roots shorten pulling the bulbs deeper into the ground ( contractile roots ) . The bulbs develop from the inside , pushing the older layers outwards which become brown and dry , forming an outer shell , the tunic or skin . Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species . While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start to grow in the following spring , develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths . The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf . 
 Stems 
 The single leafless stem or scape , appearing from early to late spring depending on the species , bears from 1 to 20 blooms . Stem shape depends on the species , some are highly compressed with a visible seam , while others are rounded . The stems are upright and located at the centre of the leaves . In a few species such as N. <unk> the stem is oblique ( asymmetrical ) . The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material . 
 Leaves 
 Narcissus plants have one to several basal leaves which are linear , <unk> or strap shaped ( long and narrow ) , sometimes channelled <unk> to <unk> , and may ( pedicellate ) or may not ( sessile ) have a petiole stalk . The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb . The emerging plant generally has two leaves , but the mature plant usually three , rarely four , and they are covered with a <unk> containing cuticle , giving them a waxy appearance . Leaf colour is light green to blue @-@ green . In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem , but in some species the leaves are low hanging . The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath . After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod ( fruit ) is ripe . 
 Jonquils usually have dark green , round , rush @-@ like leaves . 
 = = = = Reproductive = = = = 
 Inflorescence 
 The inflorescence is <unk> , the single stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel with up to 20 blooms . Species bearing a solitary flower include section Bulbocodium and most of section Pseudonarcissus . <unk> species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence ( unbranched , with short floral stalks ) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers , such as N. papyraceus ( see illustration , left ) and N. tazetta ( see Table I ) . The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with ( pedicellate ) or without ( sessile ) floral stalks . 
 Prior to opening , the flower buds are enveloped and protected in a thin dry papery or membranous ( scarious ) spathe . The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed , and which remains wrapped around the base of the open flower . As the bud grows , the spathe splits longitudinally . <unk> are small or absent . 
 Flowers 
 The flowers of Narcissus are hermaphroditic ( bisexual ) , have three parts ( tripartite ) , and are sometimes fragrant ( see Fragrances ) . The flower symmetry is actinomorphic ( radial ) to slightly zygomorphic ( bilateral ) due to declinate @-@ ascending stamens ( curving downwards , then bent up at the tip ) . Narcissus flowers are characterised by their , usually conspicuous , corona ( trumpet ) . 
 The three major floral parts ( in all species except N. cavanillesii in which the corona is virtually absent - Table I : Section Tapeinanthus ) are ; 
 ( i ) the proximal floral tube ( <unk> ) , 
 ( ii ) the surrounding free tepals , and 
 ( iii ) the more distal corona ( <unk> , paraperigonium ) . 
 All three parts may be considered to be components of the perianth ( <unk> , perigonium ) . The perianth arises above the apex of the inferior ovary , its base forming the <unk> floral tube . 
 The floral tube is formed by fusion of the basal segments of the tepals ( proximally <unk> ) . Its shape is from an inverted cone ( obconic ) to funnel @-@ shaped ( <unk> ) or cylindrical , and is surmounted by the more distal corona . Floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to rudimentary ( N. cavanillesii ) . 
 Surrounding the floral tube and corona and reflexed ( bent back ) from the rest of the perianth are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves , in two whorls which may be distally ascending , reflexed ( folded back ) , or lanceolate . Like many monocotyledons , the perianth is <unk> , that is undifferentiated into separate calyx ( sepals ) and corolla ( petals ) , but rather has six tepals . The three outer <unk> segments may be considered sepals , and the three inner segments petals . The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth . 
 The corona , or <unk> , is variously described as bell @-@ shaped ( <unk> , trumpet ) , bowl @-@ shaped ( <unk> , <unk> , cup shaped ) or disc @-@ shaped with margins that are often frilled , and is free from the stamens . Rarely the corona is a simple callose ( hardened , thickened ) ring . The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure , the anthers becoming reduced . At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed . All species produce nectar at the top of the ovary . Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus ( see Table I ) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus ( trumpet daffodils , Table I ) . 
 While the perianth may point forwards , in some species such as N. cyclamineus it is folded back ( reflexed , see illustration , left ) , while in some other species such as N. bulbocodium ( Table I ) , it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona . 
 The colour of the perianth is white , yellow or bicoloured , with the exception of the night flowering N. viridiflorus which is green . In addition the corona of N. poeticus has a red crenulate margin ( see Table I ) . Flower diameter varies from 12 mm ( N. bulbocodium ) to over 125 mm ( N. nobilis = N. pseudonarcissus <unk> nobilis ) . 
 Flower orientation varies from pendent or <unk> ( hanging down ) as in N. triandrus ( see illustration , left ) , through declinate @-@ ascendant as in N. alpestris = N. pseudonarcissus subsp. moschatus , horizontal ( patent , spreading ) such as N. <unk> or N. poeticus , erect as in N. cavanillesii , N. serotinus and N. rupicola ( Table I ) , or intermediate between these positions ( <unk> @-@ patent ) . 
 The flowers of Narcissus demonstrate exceptional floral diversity and sexual polymorphism , primarily by corona size and floral tube length , associated with pollinator groups ( see for instance Figs . 1 and 2 in Graham and Barrett ) . Barrett and Harder ( 2005 ) describe three separate floral patterns ; 
 <unk> ' form 
 <unk> ' form 
 <unk> ' form . 
 The predominant patterns are the ' daffodil ' and ' paperwhite ' forms , while the ' triandrus ' form is less common . Each corresponds to a different group of pollinators ( See Pollination ) . 
 The ' daffodil ' form , which includes sections Pseudonarcissus and Bulbocodium , has a relatively short , broad or highly funnelform tube ( funnel @-@ like ) , which grades into an elongated corona , which is large and funnelform , forming a broad , cylindrical or trumpet @-@ shaped perianth . Section Pseudonarcissus consists of relatively large flowers with a corolla length of around <unk> , generally solitary but rarely in inflorescences of 2 @-@ 4 flowers . They have wide greenish floral tubes with funnel shaped bright yellow <unk> . The six tepals sometimes differ in colour from the corona and may be cream coloured to pale yellow . 
 The ' paperwhite ' form , including sections Jonquilla , Apodanthi and Narcissus , has a relatively long , narrow tube and a short , shallow , flaring corona . The flower is horizontal and fragrant . 
 The ' triandrus ' form is seen in only two species , N. albimarginatus ( a Moroccan endemic ) and N. triandrus . It combines features of both the ' daffodil ' and ' paperwhite ' forms , with a well @-@ developed , long , narrow tube and an extended bell @-@ shaped corona of almost equal length . The flowers are pendent . 
 <unk> 
 There are six stamens in one to two rows ( whorls ) , with the filaments separate from the corona , attached at the throat or base of the tube ( <unk> ) , often of two separate lengths , straight or declinate @-@ ascending ( curving downwards , then upwards ) . The anthers are basifixed ( attached at their base ) . 
 <unk> 
 The ovary is inferior ( below the floral parts ) and trilocular ( three chambered ) and there is a pistil with a minutely three lobed stigma and filiform ( thread like ) style , which is often exserted ( extending beyond the tube ) . 
 Fruit 
 The fruit consists of dehiscent <unk> capsules ( splitting between the locules ) that are ellipsoid to subglobose ( almost spherical ) in shape and are papery to leathery in texture . 
 Seeds 
 The fruit contains numerous subglobose seeds which are round and swollen with a hard coat , sometimes with an attached elaiosome . The testa is black and the pericarp dry . 
 Most species have 12 ovules and 36 seeds , although some species such as N. bulbocodium have more , up to a maximum of 60 . Seeds take five to six weeks to mature . The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge @-@ shaped and matte black , while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black . A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds . 
 = = = Chromosomes = = = 
 Chromosome numbers : 2n = 14 , 22 , 26 , with numerous <unk> and polyploid derivatives . The basic chromosome number being 7 , with the exception of N. tazetta , N. elegans and N. <unk> in which it is 10 or 11 , chromosome number being the way that this subgenus ( Hermione ) was characterised . <unk> species include N. papyraceus ( 4x = 22 ) and N. dubius ( 6x = 50 ) . 
 = = = Phytochemistry = = = 
 = = = = Alkaloids = = = = 
 As with all <unk> genera , Narcissus contains unique <unk> alkaloids . The first alkaloid to be identified was lycorine , from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877 . These are considered a protective adaptation , and are utilised in the classification of species . Nearly 100 alkaloids have been identified in the genus , about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids , although not all species have been tested . Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family , Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the <unk> ( lycorine , <unk> , <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) groups . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> alkaloids are also represented . The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time , location , and developmental stage . Narcissus also contain <unk> and low molecular weight <unk> in the leaves and plant stems . 
 = = = = Fragrances = = = = 
 Fragrances are predominantly monoterpene isoprenoids , with a small amount of <unk> , although N. jonquilla has both equally represented . Another exception is N. <unk> which produces mainly fatty acid derivatives . The basic monoterpene precursor is <unk> pyrophosphate , and the commonest monoterpenes are limonene , <unk> , and trans @-@ β @-@ <unk> . Most <unk> are non @-@ <unk> , while a few species contain <unk> forms ( ethers ) , e.g. N. <unk> . Other ingredient include indole , <unk> and very small amounts of sesquiterpenes . Fragrance patterns can be correlated with pollinators , and fall into three main groups ( see Pollination ) .

 The genus Narcissus was well known to the ancients . In Greek literature Theophrastus and <unk> described νάρκισσος , probably referring to N. poeticus , although the exact species mentioned in classical literature cannot be accurately established . Pliny the Elder later introduced the Latin form narcissus . These early writers were as much interested in the plant 's possible medicinal properties as they were its botanical features and their accounts remained influential until at least the Renaissance ( see also Antiquity ) . Mediaeval and Renaissance writers include Albert Magnus and William Turner , but it remained to Linnaeus to formally describe and name Narcissus as a genus in his Species Plantarum ( 1753 ) at which time there were six known species . 
 = = = = Modern = = = = 
 De Jussieu ( 1789 ) grouped Narcissus into a ' family ' which he called Narcissi . This was renamed Amaryllideae by Jaume Saint @-@ Hilaire in 1805 , corresponding to the modern Amaryllidaceae . For a while Narcissus was considered part of Liliaceae ( as in the illustration seen here of Narcissus <unk> ) , but then the Amaryllidaceae were split off from it . 
 Various authors have adopted either narrow ( e.g. Haworth , Salisbury ) or wide ( <unk> , Spach ) interpretations of the genus . The narrow view treated many of the species as separate genera . Over time the wider view prevailed with a major monograph on the genus being published by Baker ( 1875 ) . One of the more controversial genera was Tapeinanthus , but today it is included in Narcissus . 
 The eventual position of Narcissus within the Amaryllidaceae family only became settled in this century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system . Within Amaryllidaceae the genus Narcissus belongs to the Narcisseae tribe , one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily . It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae , being distinguished from Sternbergia by the presence of a paraperigonium , and is monophyletic . 
 = = = Subdivision = = = 
 The infrageneric phylogeny of Narcissus still remains relatively unsettled , the taxonomy having proved complex and difficult to resolve , due to the diversity of the wild species , the ease with which natural hybridization occurs , and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation . Consequently , the number of accepted species has varied widely . 
 De Candolle , in the first systematic taxonomy of Narcissus , arranged the species into named groups , and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority . The situation was confused by the inclusion of many unknown or garden varieties , and it was not till the work of Baker that the wild species were all grouped as sections under one genus , Narcissus . 
 A common classification system has been that of Fernandes based on cytology , as modified by Blanchard ( 1990 ) and Mathew ( 2002 ) . Another is that of Meyer ( 1966 ) . Fernandes proposed two subgenera based on basal chromosome number , and then subdivided these into ten sections as did Blanchard . 
 Other authors ( e.g. Webb ) prioritised morphology over genetics , abandoning subgenera , although Blanchard 's system has been one of the most influential . While infrageneric groupings within Narcissus have been relatively constant , their status ( genera , subgenera , sections , subsections , series , species ) has not . The most cited system is that of the Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) which simply lists ten sections . Three of these are monotypic ( contain only one species ) , while two others contain only two species . Most species are placed in section Pseudonarcissus . Many of these subdivisions correspond roughly to the popular names for daffodil types , e.g. Trumpet Daffodils , <unk> , Pheasant 's Eyes , Hoop Petticoats , Jonquils . 
 The most hierarchical system is that of Mathew , illustrated here - 
 = = = = Phylogenetics = = = = 
 The phylogenetic analysis of Graham and Barrett ( 2004 ) supported the infrageneric division of Narcissus into two clades corresponding to Fernandes ' subgenera , but did not support monophyly of all sections . A later extended analysis by Rønsted et. al . ( 2008 ) with additional taxa confirmed this pattern . 
 A large molecular analysis by Zonneveld ( 2008 ) sought to reduce some of the paraphyly identified by Graham and Barrett . This led to a revision of the sectional structure . While Graham and Barrett ( 2004 ) had determined that subgenus Hermione was monophyletic , Santos @-@ Gally et. al . ( 2011 ) did not . If two species excluded in the former study are removed from the analysis , the studies are in agreement , the species in question instead forming a clade with subgenus Narcissus . Some so @-@ called <unk> have been proposed , to accommodate natural ( ' ancient ' ) hybrids ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = = Species = = = = 
 Estimates of the number of species in Narcissus have varied widely , from anywhere between 16 and almost 160 , even in the modern era . Linnaeus originally included six species in 1753 , by 1784 there were fourteen by 1819 sixteen , and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species . 
 Much of the variation lies in the definition of species . Thus , a very wide view of each species , such as Webb 's results in few species , while a very narrow view such as that of Fernandes results in a larger number . Another factor is the status of hybrids , with a distinction between ' ancient hybrids ' and ' recent hybrids ' . The term ' ancient hybrid ' refers to hybrids found growing over a large area , and therefore now considered as separate species , while ' recent hybrid ' refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents , with a more restricted range . 
 Fernandes ( 1951 ) originally accepted 22 species , Webb ( 1980 ) 27 . By 1968 , Fernandes had 63 species , Blanchard ( 1990 ) 65 species , and Erhardt ( 1993 ) 66 . In 2006 the Royal Horticultural Society 's ( RHS ) International Daffodil Register and Classified List listed 87 species , while Zonneveld 's genetic study ( 2008 ) resulted in only 36 . As of September 2014 , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families accepts 52 species , along with at least 60 hybrids , while the RHS has 81 accepted names in its October 2014 list . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Within the Narcisseae , Narcissus ( western Mediterranean ) diverged from Sternbergia ( Eurasia ) some time in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras , around 29 @.@ 3 – 18 @.@ 1 Ma . Later the genus divided into the two subgenera ( Hermione and Narcissus ) between 27 @.@ 4 – 16 @.@ 1 Ma . The divisions between the sections of Hermione then took place during the Miocene period 19 @.@ 9 – 7 @.@ 8 Ma . Narcissus appears to have arisen in the area of the Iberian peninsula , southern France and north @-@ western Italy . Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 = = = = Narcissus = = = = 
 The derivation of the Latin narcissus ( Greek : νάρκισσος ) is unknown , but may be connected with hell . It is frequently linked to the myth of Narcissus who became so obsessed with his own reflection in water that he drowned and the narcissus plant sprang from where he died . There is no evidence for the flower being named for the youth . Narcissus poeticus which grows in Greece , has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating . Pliny wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance ( <unk> <unk> , " I grow numb " ) not the youth . Furthermore , there were accounts of narcissi growing long before the story of Narcissus appeared ( see Greek culture ) . It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams represent the youth admiring his reflection . Linnaeus used the Latin name ' narcissus ' for the plant but was preceded by others such as Matthias de l 'Obel ( 1591 ) and Clusius ( 1576 ) . The name Narcissus was not uncommon for men in Roman times . 
 The plural form of the common name " narcissus " has caused some confusion . Dictionaries list " narcissi " , " <unk> " and " narcissus " However , texts on usage such as Garner and Fowler state that " narcissi " is the preferred form . The common name narcissus should not be capitalised . 
 = = = = Daffodil = = = = 
 The name " daffodil " is derived from " <unk> " , a variant of asphodel . The narcissus was frequently , referred to as the asphodel , ( see Antiquity ) . Asphodel in turn appears to come from the Greek " <unk> " ( Greek : <unk> ) . The reason for the introduction of the initial " d " is not known . From at least the 16th century , " <unk> Dilly " , " <unk> <unk> " , and " <unk> " have appeared as alternative names . 
 Other names include " Lent lily " . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Although the Amaryllidaceae family are predominantly tropical or subtropical as a whole , Narcissus occurs primarily in Mediterranean region , with a centre of diversity in the Iberian Peninsula ( Spain and Portugal ) . A few species extend the range into southern France , Italy , and the Balkans ( N. poeticus , N. serotinus , N. tazetta ) and the Eastern Mediterranean ( N. serotinus ) including Israel ( N. tazetta ) . The occurrence of N. tazetta in western and central Asia , China and Japan are considered introductions , albeit ancient ( see Eastern cultures ) . While the exact northern limit of the range is unknown , the occurrences of wild N. pseudonarcissus in Great Britain , middle and northern Europe are similarly considered ancient introductions . 
 While Amaryllidaceae is not native to North America , it grows well in USDA hardiness zones 3B through 10 , encompassing most of the country . 
 N. elegans occurs on the North West African Coast ( Morocco and Libya ) , as well as the coastline of Corsica , Sardinia and Italy , and N. bulbocodium between Tangier and Algiers and Tangier to Marrakech , but also on the Iberian Peninsula . N. serotinus is found along the entire Mediterranean coast . N. tazetta occurs as far east as Iran and Kashmir . Since this is one of the oldest species found in cultivation , it is likely to have been introduced into Kashmir . N. poeticus and N. pseudonarcissus have the largest distribution ranges . N. poeticus ranges from the Pyrenees along the Romanian Carpathians to the Black Sea and along the Dalmatian coast to Greece . N. pseudonarcissus ranges from the Iberian Peninsula , via the Vosges Mountains to northern France and Belgium , and the United Kingdom where there are still wild stocks in Southern Scotland . The only occurrence in Luxembourg is located near <unk> , in the municipality of <unk> . In Germany it is found mainly in the nature reserve at <unk> @-@ <unk> and the Eifel National Park , where in the spring at Monschau the meadows are teeming with yellow blooms . One of the most easterly occurrences can be found at <unk> near Nassau on the Lahn . 
 However unlike the above examples most species have very restricted endemic ranges which may overlap resulting in natural hybrids . For instance in the vicinity of the Portuguese city of Porto where both N. pseudonarcissus and N. triandrus occur there are found various intersections of the two species while in a small area along part of the Portuguese Montego river are found intersectional hybrids between N. <unk> and N. triandrus . 
 The biogeography demonstrates a phylogenetic association , for instance subgenus Hermione having a lowland distribution , but subgenus Narcissus section Apodanthi being montane and restricted to Morocco , Spain and Portugal . The remaining sections within subgenus Narcissus include both lowland and mountain habitats . Section Pseudonarcissus , although widely naturalised is endemic to the <unk> Ranges of the south eastern Iberian peninsula . 
 = = = Habitats = = = 
 Their native habitats are very varied , with different elevations , bioclimatic areas and substrates , being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures , and including grassland , scrub , woods , river banks and rocky crevices . Although requirements vary , overall there is a preference for acidic soils , although some species will grow on limestone . Narcissus <unk> will grow on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer , while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers . 
 The Pseudonarcissus group in their natural habitat prefer humid situations such as stream margins , springs , wet pastures , clearings of forests or shrublands with humid soils , and moist hillsides . These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains , producing discrete isolated populations . In Germany , which has relatively little limestone , Narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir , beech , oak , alder , ash and birch trees with well @-@ drained soil . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 Narcissus are long @-@ lived perennial geophytes with winter @-@ growing and summer @-@ dormant bulbs that are mainly <unk> ( leaves and flowers appearing at the same time ) . While most species flower in late winter to spring , five species are autumn flowering ( N. <unk> , N. cavanillesii , N. elegans , N. serotinus , N. viridiflorus ) . By contrast these species are hysteranthous ( leaves appear after flowering ) . 
 Flower longevity varies by species and conditions , ranging from 5 – 20 days . After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in , and the plant appears to be ' dormant ' till the next spring , conserving moisture . However the dormant period is also one of considerable activity within the bulb primordia . It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators ( see Pests and diseases below ) . Like many bulb plants from temperate regions , a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin . This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it . Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb . Early spring growth confers a number of advantages , including relative lack of competition for pollinators , and lack of deciduous shading . The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is N. tazetta . 
 Plants may spread clonally through the production of daughter bulbs and division producing clumps . Narcissus species hybridise readily , although the fertility of the offspring will depend on the parental relationship . 
 = = = Pollination = = = 
 The flowers are insect pollinated , the major pollinators being bees , butterflies , flies , and hawkmoths , while the highly scented night flowering N. viridiflorus is pollinated by crepuscular moths . Pollination mechanism fall into three groups corresponding to floral morphology ( see Description - Flowers ) . 
 <unk> ' form . Pollinated by bees seeking pollen from anthers within the corona . The broad perianth allows bees ( Bombus , <unk> , <unk> ) to completely enter the flower in their search for nectar and / or pollen . In this type the stigma lies in the mouth of the corona , extending beyond the six anthers , whose single whorl lies well within the corona . The bees come into contact with the stigma before their legs , thorax and abdomen contact the anthers , and this approach <unk> causes cross pollination . 
 <unk> ' form . These are adapted to long @-@ tongued Lepidoptera , particularly <unk> moths such as <unk> , Pieridae and Nymphalidae but also some long @-@ tongued bees , and flies , all of which are primarily seeking nectar . The narrow tube admits only the insect 's proboscis , while the short corona serves as a funnel guiding the tip of the proboscis into the mouth of the perianth tube . The stigma is placed either in the mouth of the tube , just above two whorls of three anthers , or hidden well below the anthers . The pollinators then carry pollen on their <unk> or faces . The long tongued bees cannot reach the nectar at the tube base and so collect just pollen . 
 <unk> ' form . Pollinated by long @-@ tongued solitary bees ( <unk> , Bombus ) which forage for both pollen and nectar . The large corona allows the bees to crawl into the perianth but then the narrow tube prevents further progres , causing them to probe deeply for nectar . The pendant flowers prevent pollination by lepidoptera . In N. albimarginatus there may be either a long stigma with short and mid length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers ( dimorphism ) . In N. triandrus there are three patterns of sexual organs ( <unk> ) but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position and the length of the lower anthers . 
 <unk> ( outcrossing ) on the whole is enforced through a late @-@ acting ( ovarian ) self @-@ incompatibility system , but some species such as N. dubius and N. <unk> are self @-@ compatible producing mixtures of <unk> and outcrossed seeds . 
 = = = Pests and diseases = = = 
 Diseases of Narcissus are of concern because of the economic consequences of losses in commercial cultivation . Pests include viruses , bacteria , and fungi as well as arthropods and gastropods . For control of pests , see Commercial uses . 
 Viruses 
 Aphids such as <unk> <unk> can transmit viral diseases which affect the colour and shape of the leaves , as can Nematodes . Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi . These include the Narcissus common latent virus ( <unk> , Narcissus mottling @-@ associated virus ) , Narcissus latent virus ( <unk> , Narcissus mild mottle virus ) which causes green mottling near leaf tips , Narcissus degeneration virus ( NDV ) , Narcissus late season yellows virus ( <unk> ) which occurs after flowering , streaking the leaves and stems , Narcissus mosaic virus , Narcissus yellow stripe virus ( NYSV , Narcissus yellow streak virus ) , Narcissus tip necrosis virus ( <unk> ) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus ( NWSV ) . 
 Less host specific viruses include Raspberry ringspot virus , Nerine latent virus ( <unk> ) = Narcissus <unk> virus , Arabis mosaic virus ( <unk> ) , Broad Bean Wilt Viruses ( <unk> ) Cucumber mosaic virus ( CMV ) , Tomato black ring virus ( <unk> ) , Tomato ringspot virus ( <unk> ) and Tobacco rattle virus ( TRV ) . 
 Of these viruses the most serious and prevalent are NDV , NYSV and NWSV . NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta . Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green , or yellow stripes or <unk> on the upper two @-@ thirds of the leaf , which may be roughened or twisted . The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched . NWSV produces greenish purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow , and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield . These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries . The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage . 
 Bacteria 
 Bacterial disease is uncommon in Narcissus but includes Pseudomonas ( bacterial streak ) and <unk> <unk> sp. <unk> ( bacterial soft rot ) . 
 Fungi 
 More problematic for non @-@ commercial plants is the fungus , Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi , which causes basal rot ( rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves ) . This is the most serious disease of Narcissus . Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately , and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years . Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible . Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus , N. tazetta and N. jonquilla . 
 Another fungus which attacks the bulbs , causing narcissus smoulder , is Botrytis narcissicola ( Sclerotinia narcissicola ) and other species of Botrytis , including Botrytis cinerea , particularly if improperly stored . Copper sulfate is used to combat the disease , and infected bulbs are burned . Blue mould rot of bulbs may be caused by infection with species of Penicillium , if they have become damaged either through mechanical injury or infestation by mites ( see below ) . Species of Rhizopus ( e.g. Rhizopus <unk> , Rhizopus nigricans ) cause bulb soft rot and Sclerotinia <unk> , black slime disease . A combination of both <unk> curtisii ( <unk> curtisii ) and Botrytis narcissicola causes neck rot in the bulbs . 
 Fungi affecting the roots include Nectria radicicola ( <unk> <unk> ) , a cause of root rot and <unk> <unk> causing white root rot , while others affect root and bulb , such as Aspergillus niger ( black mold ) , and species of Trichoderma , including T. viride and T. <unk> ( = T. narcissi ) responsible for green mold . 
 Other fungi affect the remainder of the plant . Another Botrytis fungus , Botrytis <unk> ( Sclerotinia <unk> ) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems ( narcissus fire ) , especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry . <unk> <unk> is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates , causing narcissus white mould disease . <unk> curtisii , the Narcissus leaf scorch , also affects the leaves as does its <unk> , <unk> narcissi ( leaf tip blight ) . <unk> narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems . 
 Animals 
 Arthropods that are Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants , narcissus bulb fly <unk> equestris , and two species of hoverflies , the lesser bulb flies Eumerus <unk> and Eumerus <unk> . The flies lay their eggs at the end of June in the ground around the narcissi , a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs . The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors . They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell , emerging in April to pupate in the soil , from which the adult fly emerges in May . The larvae of some moths such as <unk> <unk> ( the common swift moth ) attack Narcissus bulbs . 
 Other arthropods include Mites such as <unk> laticeps ( Bulb scale mite ) , <unk> and <unk> infest mainly stored bulbs and multiply particularly at high ambient temperature , but do not attack planted bulbs . 
 Planted bulbs are susceptible to nematodes , the most serious of which is <unk> <unk> ( Narcissus <unk> ) , the main cause of basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen . Infested bulbs have to be destroyed ; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years . Other nematodes include <unk> <unk> which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and <unk> <unk> ( lesion nematode ) the main cause of root rot in narcissi . Other nematodes such as the <unk> ( <unk> spp. or needle nematodes and <unk> spp. or dagger nematodes ) and the stubby @-@ root nematodes or <unk> ( <unk> spp. and <unk> spp . ) can also act as vectors of virus diseases , such as <unk> and <unk> , in addition to causing stunting of the roots . 
 <unk> such as snails and slugs also cause damage to growth . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Many of the smallest species have become extinct , requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species . Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over @-@ collection and threats to their natural habitats by urban development and tourism . N. cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered , and is protected . The IUCN Red List describes five species as ' Endangered ' ( Narcissus <unk> , Narcissus <unk> , Narcissus <unk> , Narcissus nevadensis , Narcissus <unk> ) . In 1999 three species were considered endangered , five as vulnerable and six as rare . 
 In response a number of species have been granted protected species status and protected areas ( meadows ) have been established such as the <unk> Daffodil Meadow in Romania , or Kempley Daffodil Meadow in the UK . These areas often host daffodil festivals in the spring .

 Magna <unk> non indigent Narcissi 
 Most easy of cultivation is the Narcissus 
 Of all the flowering plants , the bulbous have been the most popular for cultivation . Of these , narcissi are one of the most important spring flowering bulb plants in the world . Indigenous in Europe , the wild populations of the parent species had been known since antiquity . Narcissi have been cultivated from at least as early as the sixteenth century in the Netherlands , when large numbers of bulbs where imported from the field , particularly Narcissus <unk> which soon became nearly extinct in its native habitat of France and Spain , though still found in the southern part of that country . The only large scale production at that time related to the double narcissus ' Van Sion ' and cultivars of N. tazetta imported in 1557 . 
 Cultivation is also documented in Britain at this time , although contemporary accounts show it was well known as a favourite garden and wild flower long before that and was used in making garlands . This was a period when the development of exotic formal gardens and parks was becoming popular , particularly in what is known as the ' Oriental Period ' ( 1560 – 1620 ) . In his Hortus <unk> ( 1588 ) , the first catalogue of a German garden 's plants , Joachim Camerarius the Younger states that nine different types of daffodils were represented in his garden in Nuremberg . After his death in 1598 , his plants were moved by Basilius Besler to the gardens they had designed at <unk> , the bishop 's palace at Eichstätt , Upper Bavaria . That garden is described in Besler 's Hortus <unk> ( 1613 ) by which time there were 43 different types present . Another German source at this time was Peter <unk> who gives an account of the species known to him and their cultivation in his Apparatus <unk> : de plantis <unk> et de plantis <unk> ( 1632 ) . 
 While Shakespeare 's daffodil is the wild or true English daffodil ( N. pseudonarcissus ) , many other species were introduced , some of which escaped and naturalised , particularly N. <unk> ( a hybrid ) in Devon and the west of England . Gerard , in his extensive discussion of daffodils , both wild and cultivated ( " bastard daffodils " ) described twenty four species in London gardens ( 1597 ) , ( " we have them all and every one of them in our London gardens , in great abundance " , p . 114 ) . 
 In the early seventeenth century , Parkinson helped to ensure the popularity of the daffodil as a cultivated plant by describing a hundred different varieties in his Paradisus Terrestris ( 1629 ) , and introducing the great double yellow Spanish daffodil ( Pseudonarcissus aureus <unk> flore <unk> or Parkinson 's Daffodil , see illustration ) to England . 
 I thinke none ever had this kind before myselfe nor did I myself ever see it before the year 1618 for it is of mine own raising and flowering first in my own garden 
 Although not achieving the sensationalism of tulips , daffodils and narcissi have been much celebrated in art and literature ( see The Arts ) . The largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils , N. poeticus and N. bulbocodium , and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe . By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were an important component of the spring garden . By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties . A catalog of a Dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties . In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale , writing " The garden does not afford , in its Kind , a prettier plant than this ; nor do we know one that has been so early , or so honorably mention 'd by all Kinds of Writers " ( see illustration ) . Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available , primarily the bunch flowered ( multiple flower heads ) N. tazetta ( <unk> Narcissus ) . However interest varied by country . Maddock ( 1792 ) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England , whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen ( 1760 ) stated that N. tazetta ( Narcisse à bouquet ) is the fifth most important – " Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur , <unk> les <unk> , les <unk> les <unk> , et les <unk> , ( dont nous avons <unk> <unk> , ) qui <unk> <unk> attention " . Similarly Philip Miller , in his Gardeners Dictionary ( 1731 – 1768 ) refers to cultivation in Holland , Flanders and France , but not England , because it was too difficult , a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time . However , for most species of Narcissus <unk> 's dictum Magna <unk> non indigent Narcissi was much cited . 
 Narcissi became an important horticultural crop in Western Europe in the latter part of the nineteenth century , beginning in England between 1835 and 1855 and the end of the century in the Netherlands . By the beginning of the twentieth century 50 million bulbs of N. Tazetta ' <unk> ' were being exported annually from the Netherlands to the United States . With the production of <unk> such as ' Golden Spur ' , in the late nineteenth century , and in the beginning of the twentieth century , <unk> like ' King Alfred ' ( 1899 ) , the industry was well established , with trumpet daffodils dominating the market . The Royal Horticultural Society has been an important factor in promoting narcissi , holding the first Daffodil Conference in 1884 , while the Daffodil Society , the first organisation dedicated to the cultivation of narcissi was founded in Birmingham in 1898 . Other countries followed and the American Daffodil Society which was founded in 1954 publishes The Daffodil Journal quarterly , a leading trade publication . 
 Narcissi are now popular as ornamental plants for gardens , parks and as cut flowers , providing colour from the end of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions . They are one of the most popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops , being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers , though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production . Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers . They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn . They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants . Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double , triple , or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments . Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona ( trumpet or cup ) , in terms of its length , shape , and colour , and the surrounding perianth or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form . 
 = = = Narcissi as garden plants = = = 
 While some wild narcissi are specific in terms of their ecological requirements , most garden varieties are relatively tolerant of soil conditions , however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage . The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 0 . 
 Bulbs offered for sale are referred to as either ' round ' or ' double nose ' . Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem , while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems , but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual . Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales , leading to the dying off of the exterior scales . To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs , they can be dug up every 5 – 7 years , and the daughters separated and replanted separately , provided that a piece of the basal plate , where the rootlets are formed , is preserved . For daffodils to flower at the end of the winter or early spring , bulbs are planted in autumn ( September – November ) . This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil . Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure . 
 Narcissi are well suited for planting under small thickets of trees , where they can be grouped as 6 – 12 bulbs . They also grow well in perennial borders , especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading . A number of wild species and hybrids such as ' Dutch Master ' , ' Golden Harvest ' , ' Carlton ' , ' Kings Court ' and ' Yellow Sun ' naturalise well in lawns , but it is important not to mow the lawn till the leaves start to fade , since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season . Blue Scilla and <unk> which also naturalise well in lawns and flower at the same time as narcissus , make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter . Unlike Tulips , narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them . 
 When flower heads have died , removing ( deadheading ) them will allow more energy to build up the bulbs and strengthen the following years ' display . 
 = = = Propagation = = = 
 The commonest form of commercial propagation is by twin @-@ scaling , in which the bulbs are cut into many small pieces but with two scales still connected by a small fragment of the basal plate . The fragments are disinfected and placed on nutrient media . Some 25 – 35 new plants can be produced from a single bulb after four years . <unk> methods are not used for commercial production but is used for establishing commercial stock . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 For commercial use , varieties with a minimum stem length of 30 cm are sought , making them ideal for cut flowers . Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail outlet . For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms , and there is a particular demand for miniature varieties . The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types . The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium , N. cyclamineus , N. jonquilla , N. poeticus , N. pseudonarcissus , N. serotinus and N. tazetta . 
 N. pseudonarcissus gave rise to trumpet cultivars with coloured tepals and corona , while its subspecies N. pseudonarcissus subsp. bicolor was used for white <unk> varieties . To produce large cupped varieties , N. pseudonarcissus was crossed with N. poeticus , and to produce small cupped varieties back crossed with N. poeticus . <unk> varieties , often called ' <unk> ' are mainly hybrids of N. poeticus and N. tazetta . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 For horticultural purposes , all Narcissus cultivars are split into 13 divisions as first described by Kington ( 1998 ) , for the Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) , based partly upon flower form ( shape and length of corona ) , number of flowers per stem , flowering period and partly upon genetic background . The classification is a useful tool for planning planting . Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 ( Trumpet ) , 2 ( Large cupped ) and 8 ( Tazetta ) . Division 13 which includes the wild daffodil is the exception to this scheme . 
 Growers register new daffodil cultivars by name and color with the Royal Horticultural Society , which is the international registration authority for the genus . Their International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable . The most recent supplement ( 2014 ) is the sixth ( the fifth was published in 2012 ) . More than 27 @,@ 000 names were registered as of 2008 , and the number has continued to grow . Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 W @-@ W ( ' Thalia ' ) . In horticultural usage it is common to also find an unofficial Division 14 : Miniatures , which although drawn from the other 13 divisions , have their miniature size in common . Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit ( See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus ) . 
 = = = = Colour code = = = = 
 Daffodil breeding has introduced a wide range of colours , in both the outer perianth <unk> segment and the inner corona . In the registry , daffodils are coded by the colours of each of these two parts . Thus ' Geranium ' , Tazetta ( Division 8 ) as illustrated here with a white outer perianth and orange corona is classified as 8 W @-@ O. 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 = = = Pharmacology = = = 
 All Narcissus species contain the alkaloid poison lycorine , mostly in the bulb but also in the leaves . Members of the monocot subfamily Amaryllidoideae present a unique type of alkaloids , the <unk> alkaloids , which are 4 @-@ <unk> derivatives combined with tyrosine . They are responsible for the poisonous properties of a number of the species . Over 200 different chemical structures of these compounds are known , of which 79 or more are known from Narcissus alone . 
 The toxic effects of ingesting Narcissus products for both man and animals ( such as cattle , goats , pigs and cats ) have long been recognised and they have been used in suicide attempts . Ingestion of N. pseudonarcissus or N. jonquilla is followed by salivation , acute abdominal pains , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , then neurological and cardiac events , including trembling , convulsions , and paralysis . Death may result if large quantities are consumed . 
 The toxicity of Narcissus varies with species , N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus , for instance . The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies , for instance there is a five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of N. papyraceus than in the bulb , making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb , and is part of the plant 's defence mechanisms . The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites . The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants , including roses , rice , and cabbages , inhibiting growth . For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter . 
 = = = Poisoning = = = 
 Many cases of poisoning or death have occurred when narcissi bulbs have been mistaken for leeks or onions and cooked and eaten . Recovery is usually complete in a few hours without any specific intervention . In more severe cases involving ingestion of large quantities of bulbs activated charcoal , salts , and laxatives may be required , and for severe symptoms intravenous atropine and <unk> or stomach pumping may be indicated . However , ingestion of large quantities accidentally is unusual because of a strong unpleasant taste . When narcissi were compared with a number of other plants not normally consumed by animals , narcissi were the most repellant , specifically N. pseudonarcissus Consequently , narcissus alkaloids have been used as repellents and may also discourage fungi , molds , and bacteria . 
 On 1 May 2009 a number of schoolchildren fell ill at <unk> Primary School in Martlesham Heath , Suffolk , England , after a daffodil bulb was added to soup during a cookery class . 
 = = = Topical effects = = = 
 One of the most common dermatitis problems for flower pickers , packers , florists and gardeners , " daffodil itch " , involves dryness , fissures , scaling , and erythema in the hands , often accompanied by <unk> hyperkeratosis ( thickening of the skin beneath the nails ) . It is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate , <unk> acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in the sap , either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction . It has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others . N. pseudonarcissus and the cultivars ' <unk> ' , ' <unk> ' , ' Gloriosa ' , ' Grande Monarque ' , ' <unk> ' , ' Princeps ' and ' Scilly White ' are known to do so . 
 If bulb extracts come into contact with wounds , both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result . The scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from N. bulbocodium . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Traditional medicine = = = 
 Despite the lethal potential of Narcissus alkaloids , they have been used for centuries as traditional medicines for a variety of complaints , including cancer . Plants thought to be N. poeticus and N. tazetta are described in the Bible in the treatment for what is thought to be cancer . In the Classical Greek world Hippocrates ( ca . B.C. 460 – 370 ) recommended a <unk> prepared from narcissus oil for uterine tumors , a practice continued by Pedanius Dioscorides ( ca . A.D. 40 – 90 ) and Soranus of Ephesus ( A.D. 98 – 138 ) in the first and second centuries A.D. , while the Roman Pliny the Elder ( A.D. 23 – 79 ) , advocated topical use . The bulbs of N. poeticus contain the antineoplastic agent narciclasine . This usage is also found in later Arabian , North African , Central American and Chinese medicine during the Middle Ages . In China N. tazetta var. chinensis was grown as an ornamental plant but the bulbs were applied topically to tumors in traditional folk medicine . These bulbs contain <unk> , an active antitumor compound . 
 Narcissus products have received a variety of other uses . The Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus listed narcissus root in De Medicina among medical herbs , described as emollient , <unk> , and " powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of the body " . N. tazetta bulbs were used in Turkey as a remedy for abscesses in the belief they were <unk> and analgesic . Other uses include the application to wounds , strains , painful joints and various local ailments as an ointment called ‘ <unk> ’ . Powdered flowers have also been used medically , as an emetic , a decongestant and for the relief of dysentery , in the form of a syrup or infusion . The French used the flowers as an antispasmodic , the Arabs the oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac . In the eighteenth century the Irish herbal of John K ’ <unk> recommended pounding the roots in honey for use on burns , bruises , dislocations and freckles , and for drawing out thorns and splinters . N. tazetta bulbs have also been used for contraception , while the flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy . A homeopathic medicine made from bulbs was prescribed for bronchitis and whooping cough . In the traditional Japanese medicine of <unk> , wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste ; the plant , however , does not appear in the modern <unk> herb list . 
 There is also a long history of the use of Narcissus as a stimulant and to induce trance like states and hallucinations . Sophocles referred to the narcissus as the ‘ Chaplet of the infernal Gods ’ , a statement frequently wrongly attributed to Socrates ( see Antiquity ) . 
 = = = Biological properties = = = 
 Extracts of Narcissus have demonstrated a number of potentially useful biological properties including antiviral , prophage induction , antibacterial , antifungal , antimalarial , insecticidal , cytotoxic , antitumor , <unk> , antiplatelet , <unk> , emetic , acetylcholine esterase inhibitory , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , pheromone , plant growth inhibitor , and allelopathic . An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of <unk> , para @-@ benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction , but not in another , the hot plate test . Most of these properties are due to alkaloids , but some are also due to <unk> @-@ binding lectins . The most @-@ studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine ( <unk> ) , lycorine , narciclasine , and <unk> . 
 It is likely that the traditional use of narcissi for the treatment of cancer was due to the presence of <unk> constituents such as narciclasine , <unk> and their congeners . N. poeticus contains about <unk> of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs . 
 <unk> esterase inhibition has attracted the most interest as a possible therapeutic intervention , with activity varying by a thousandfold between species , and the greatest activity seen in those that contain galantamine or <unk> . 
 The rodent repellant properties of Narcissus alkaloids have been utilised in horticulture to protect more vulnerable bulbs . 
 = = = Therapeutics = = = 
 Of all the alkaloids , only galantamine has made it to therapeutic use in man , as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer 's disease . <unk> is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within the central nervous system . Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys , Wales , to produce galantamine , a drug used to combat Alzheimer 's disease .

 Throughout history the scent of narcissi has been an important ingredient of perfumes , a quality that comes from essential oils rather than alkaloids . Narcissi are also an important horticultural crop , and source of cut flowers ( floriculture ) . 
 The Netherlands , which is the most important source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production . Of 16 @,@ 700 hectares ( ha ) under cultivation for flower bulbs , narcissi account for about 1 @,@ 800 hectares . In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million , sixth in size after tulips , gladioli , irises , crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third . About two thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties . In the 2009 / 2010 season 470 cultivars were produced on 1578 ha . By far the largest area cultivated is for the miniature ' Tête @-@ à @-@ Tête ' , followed at some distance by ' Carlton ' . The largest production cultivars are shown in Table II ; 
 <unk> ' and ' Ice Follies ' ( Division 2 : Large cup ) have a long history of cultivation , together with ' Dutch Master ' and ' Golden Harvest ' ( 1 : yellow ) . ' Carlton ' and ' Golden Harvest ' were introduced in 1927 , and ' Ice Follies ' in 1953 . ' Carlton ' , with over 9000 million bulbs ( 350 000 tons ) , is one of the larger individual plants produced in the world . The other major areas of production are the United States , Israel which exported 25 million N. tazetta cultivar bulbs in 2003 , and the United Kingdom . 
 In the United Kingdom a total of 4100 ha were planted with bulbs , of which 3800 ha were Narcissi , the UK 's most important bulb crop , much of which is for export , making this the largest global production centre , about half of the total production area . While some of the production is for forcing , most is for dry bulb production . Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East , while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production . The farm gate value was estimated at £ 10m in 2007 . 
 Production of both bulbs and cut flowers takes place in open fields in beds or ridges , often in the same field , allowing adaptation to changing market conditions . Narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates . Compared to the United Kingdom , the harsher winters in the Netherlands require covering the fields with straw for protection . Areas with higher rainfall and temperatures are more susceptible to diseases that attack the <unk> production is based on a 1 ( UK ) or 2 ( Netherlands ) year cycle . Optimal soil pH is 6 @.@ 0 – 7 @.@ 5 . Prior to planting disinfection by hot water takes place , such as immersion at 44 @.@ 4 ° C for three hours . 
 Bulbs are harvested for market in the summer , sorted , stored for 2 – 3 weeks , and then further disinfected by a hot ( 43 @.@ 5 ° C ) bath . This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes . The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature , and then stored at 15 @.@ 5 ° C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted , and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage . The optimal temperature for initiation is 20 ° C followed by cooling to 13 ° C. 
 Traditionally , sales took place in the daffodil fields prior to harvesting the bulbs , but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting . In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs , some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display . While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail , which are only available at wholesale , usually at a minimum of several hundredweight . The most famous display is at <unk> , although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there . 
 = = = = Forcing = = = = 
 There is also a market for forced blooms , both as cut flowers and potted flowers through the winter from Christmas to Easter , the long season requiring special preparation by growers . 
 Cut flowers 
 For cut flowers , bulbs larger than 12 cm in size are preferred . To bloom in December , bulbs are harvested in June to July , dried , stored for four days at 34 ° C , two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17 – 20 ° C and then placed in cold storage for <unk> at 9 degrees for about 15 – 16 weeks . The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13 ° C – 15 ° C and the blooms appear in 19 – 30 days . 
 <unk> flowers 
 For potted flowers a lower temperature is used for <unk> ( 5 ° C for 15 weeks ) , followed by 16 ° C – 18 ° C in a greenhouse . For later blooming ( mid- and late @-@ forcing ) , bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted , being stored a 17 – 20 ° C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9 ° C in September for 17 – 18 ( cut flowers ) or 14 – 16 ( potted flowers ) weeks . The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames , and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements . 
 Narcissus tazetta 
 N. tazetta and its cultivars are an exception to this rule , requiring no cold period . Often harvested in October , bulbs are lifted in May and dried and heated to 30 ° C for three weeks , then stored at 25 ° C for 12 weeks and planted . Flowering can be delayed by storing at 5 ° C – 10 ° C.

 The daffodil is the national flower of Wales , associated with Saint David 's Day ( March 1 ) . The narcissus is also a national flower symbolising the new year or <unk> in the Iranian culture . 
 In the West the narcissus is perceived as a symbol of vanity , in the East as a symbol of wealth and good fortune ( see Eastern cultures ) , while in Persian literature , the narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes . 
 In western countries the daffodil is also associated with spring festivals such as Lent and its successor Easter . In Germany the wild narcissus , N. pseudonarcissus , is known as the <unk> or " Easter bell . " In the United Kingdom the daffodil is sometimes referred to as the Lenten lily . 
 Although prized as an ornamental flower , some people consider narcissi unlucky , because they hang their heads implying misfortune . White narcissi are especially associated with death , such as N triandrus ' Thalia ' , and have been called grave flowers . In Ancient Greece narcissi were planted near tombs and Robert Herrick , describes them as portents of death , an association which also appears in the myth of Persephone and the underworld ( see The Arts , below ) . 
 = = = The Arts = = =

 The decorative use of narcissi dates as far back as ancient Egyptian tombs , and frescoes at Pompeii . They are mentioned in the King James Version of the Bible as the Rose of Sharon and make frequent appearances in classical literature . 
 = = = = = Greek culture = = = = = 
 The narcissus appears in two Graeco @-@ Roman myths , that of the youth Narcissus who was turned into the flower of that name , and of the Goddess Persephone snatched into the Underworld by the god Hades while picking the flowers . The narcissus is considered sacred to both Hades and Persephone , and to grow along the banks of the river Styx in the underworld . 
 The Greek poet <unk> mentioned them in the Cypria amongst the flowers of Cyprus . The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly in the seventh century BC Homeric Hymn To Demeter , where the author describes the narcissus , and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone . The flower , she recounts to her mother was the last flower she reached for before being seized . 
 Other Greek authors making reference to the narcissus include Sophocles and Plutarch . Sophocles , in Oedipus at Colonus utilises narcissus in a symbolic manner , implying fertility , allying it with the cults of Demeter and her daughter Kore ( Persephone ) , and by extension , a symbol of death . Jebb comments that it is the flower of imminent death with its fragrance being narcotic , emphasised by its pale white colour . Just as Persephone reaching for the flower heralded her doom , the youth Narcissus gazing at his own reflection portended his own death . Plutarch refers to this in his <unk> as numbing the nerves causing a heaviness in the limbs . He refers to Sophocles ' " crown of the great Goddesses " , which is the source of the English phrase " Chaplet of the infernal Gods " incorrectly attributed to Socrates . 
 A passage by Moschus , describes fragrant narcissi . Homer in his Odyssey described the underworld as having Elysian meadows carpeted with flowers , thought to be narcissus , as described by Theophrastus . A similar account is provided by Lucian describing the flowers in the underworld . The myth of the youth Narcissus is also taken up by Pausanias . He believed that the myth of Persephone long antedated that of Narcissus , and hence discounts the idea the flower was named after the youth . 
 = = = = = Roman culture = = = = = 
 Virgil , the first known Roman writer to refer to the narcissus , does so in several places , for instance twice in the Georgics . Virgil refers to the cup shaped corona of the narcissus flower , allegedly containing the tears of the self @-@ loving youth Narcissus . Milton makes a similar analogy " And <unk> fill their Cups with Tears " . Virgil also mentions narcissi three times in the Eclogues . 
 The poet Ovid also dealt with the mythology of the narcissus . In his Metamorphoses , he recounts the story of the youth Narcissus who , after his death , is turned into the flower , and it is also mentioned in Book 5 of his poem Fasti . This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just Narcissus ; for instance see crocus , laurel and hyacinth . 
 = = = = Western culture = = = = 
 Although there is no clear evidence that the flower 's name derives directly from the Greek myth , this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture . The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants , and appears frequently in English literature . Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus ) . No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily , with poems by authors from John Gower , Shakespeare , Milton ( see Roman culture , above ) , Wordsworth , Shelley and Keats . Frequently the poems deal with self @-@ love derived from Ovid 's account . Gower 's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus , though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth 's death , there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated , some preferring Crocus . Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in <unk> of his Shepheardes <unk> ( 1579 ) . 
 Shakespeare , who frequently uses flower imagery , refers to daffodils twice in The Winter 's Tale and also The Two Noble Kinsmen . Robert Herrick alludes to their association with death in a number of poems . Amongst the English romantic movement writers none is better known than William Wordsworth 's short 1804 poem I <unk> Lonely as a Cloud which has become linked in the popular mind with the daffodils that form its main image . Wordsworth also included the daffodil in other poems . Yet the description given of daffodils by his sister , Dorothy is just as poetic , if not more so , just that her poetry was prose and appears almost an unconscious imitation of the first section of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter ( see Greek culture , above ) . Amongst their contemporaries , Keats refers to daffodils amongst those things capable of bringing ' joy for ever ' . 
 More recently A. E. Housman , using one of the daffodil 's more symbolic names ( see Symbols ) , wrote The Lent Lily in A Shropshire Lad , describing the traditional Easter death of the daffodil . 
 In Black Narcissus , Rumer Godden describes the disorientation of English nuns in the Indian Himalayas , and gives the plant name an unexpected twist , alluding both to narcissism and the effect of the perfume Narcisse Noir ( Caron ) on others . The novel was later adapted into the 1947 British film of the same name . The narcissus also appears in German literature such as that of Paul Gerhardt . 
 In the visual arts , narcissi are depicted in three different contexts , mythological ( Narcissus , Persephone ) , floral art , or landscapes . The Narcissus story has been popular with painters and the youth is frequently depicted with flowers to indicate this association . The Persephone theme is also typified by Waterhouse in his Narcissus , the floral motif by van <unk> and the landscape by Van Gogh 's Undergrowth . 
 Narcissi first started to appear in western art in the late middle ages , in panel paintings , particularly those depicting crucifixion . For instance that of the <unk> Meister in Köln in the Wallraf @-@ Richartz @-@ Museum , Cologne , where daffodils symbolise not only death but also hope in the resurrection , because they are perennial and bloom at Easter .

In contrast to the West , narcissi have not played a significant part in Chinese Garden art , however , Zhao <unk> in the Southern Song Dynasty was noted for his portrayal of narcissi .

 = Operation Crimp = 
 Operation Crimp ( 8 – 14 January 1966 ) , also known as the Battle of the Ho Bo Woods , was a joint US @-@ Australian military operation during the Vietnam War , which took place 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) north of Cu Chi in Binh Duong Province , South Vietnam . The operation targeted a key Viet Cong headquarters that was believed to be concealed underground , and involved two brigades under the command of the US 1st Infantry Division , including the 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 1 RAR ) which was attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade . Heavy fighting resulted in significant casualties on both sides , but the combined American and Australian force was able to uncover an extensive tunnel network covering more than 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) . 
 The operation was the largest allied military action mounted during the war in South Vietnam to that point , and the first fought at division level . Despite some success , the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and it remained a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war . The tunnels were later used as a staging area for the attack on Saigon during the 1968 Tet offensive before they were largely destroyed by heavy bombing from American B @-@ 52 bombers in 1970 , ending their utility . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Military situation = = = 
 Although the initial American commitment to the war in Vietnam had been limited to advice and materiel support , by 1964 there were 21 @,@ 000 US advisors in South Vietnam . However , with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) weakened by successive defeats at the hands of the communists , the South Vietnamese government faltering , and Saigon threatened with a major offensive , the worsening situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965 , with a large @-@ scale commitment of US ground troops under the command of General William Westmoreland . At first the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy , applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by US Marine units . This was abandoned in April 1965 , and replaced by a new " enclave strategy " of defending key coastal population centres and installations . This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US battalions , or 14 @,@ 000 troops , to bring the total in Vietnam to 13 . Allied nations of the Free World Military Forces were expected to contribute another four battalions . 
 Westmoreland planned to develop a series of defensive positions around Saigon before expanding operations to pacify the South Vietnamese country @-@ side and as a result a number of sites close to Viet Cong dominated areas were subsequently chosen to be developed into semi @-@ permanent divisional @-@ level bases . Such areas included Di An which was intended to become the headquarters of the US 1st Infantry Division , while the US 25th Infantry Division would be based in the vicinity of Cu Chi . However , large @-@ scale military operations to clear the intended base areas had to wait until the dry season . Yet the allied enclave strategy proved only transitory and further setbacks led to additional troop increases to halt the losing trend . With the situation reaching crisis point during the Viet Cong wet season offensive in June 1965 , Westmoreland requested further reinforcement and US and allied forces increased to 44 battalions which would be used to directly bolster the ARVN . 
 Australia 's growing involvement in Vietnam reflected the American build up . In 1963 , the Australian government had committed a small advisory team , known as the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam ( AATTV ) , to help train the South Vietnamese forces . However , in June 1965 the decision to commit ground troops was made , and the 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment — originally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan ' Lou ' Brumfield — was dispatched . Supporting 1 RAR was 1 Troop , A Squadron , 4th / 19th Prince of Wales 's Light Horse equipped with M @-@ 113 Armoured Personnel Carriers , artillery from 105th Field Battery , Royal Australian Artillery and 161st Field Battery , Royal New Zealand Artillery , and 161st Reconnaissance Flight operating Cessna 180s and Bell H @-@ 13 Sioux light observation helicopters ; in total 1 @,@ 400 personnel . The Australian and New Zealand units were attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade under the command of Brigadier General Ellis W. Williamson in Bien Hoa and operated throughout the III Corps Tactical Zone to help establish the Bien Hoa @-@ Vung Tau enclave . Although logistics and resupply were primarily provided by the Americans , a small logistic unit — 1st Australian Logistics Company — was situated at Bien Hoa airbase . Unlike later Australian units that served in Vietnam , which included conscripts , 1 RAR was manned by regular personnel only . 
 Attached to US forces , 1 RAR would primarily be employed in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations , utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery into an area of operations , and to support them with aerial mobility , fire support , casualty evacuation , and resupply . The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong 's wet season offensive . During this time US 173rd Brigade , including 1 RAR , conducted a number of operations into War Zone D — a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long , Long Khanh , Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces — as well as in the Iron Triangle , formed by the confluence of the Saigon and Thi Tinh rivers and Route 7 , where they fought a number of significant actions including the Battle of Gang Toi on 8 November . Meanwhile , Brumfield was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece , after an old football injury forced his evacuation to Australia in mid @-@ November . During the period 21 November to 16 December 1 RAR was involved in Operation New Life in the La Nga Valley , 75 kilometres ( 47 mi ) north @-@ east of Bien Hoa in an attempt to deny the Viet Cong access to the rice harvest . On 24 November D Company , 1 RAR carried out a deliberate attack on the fortified village of Duc Hanh which had been occupied by the Viet Cong , killing 10 and wounding four without loss . Operation Marauder on the Plain of Reeds in the Mekong Delta was subsequently launched on New Years Day 1966 .

 Located 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) west of the Iron Triangle , the Ho Bo Woods were believed to contain the political @-@ military headquarters of the communist 4th Military Region , which controlled all Viet Cong activity around the South Vietnamese capital , Saigon . Although its precise position was unknown , it was believed to be concealed in an extensive underground bunker system . Agents ' reports , the interrogation of prisoners , and aerial surveillance all pointed to the presence of this vital communist facility . The headquarters itself was believed to be located in a 31 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 12 sq mi ) area of jungle and marshland , and to have four entrances guarded by a Viet Cong Regional Force company , while two Main Force battalions were also thought to be in the vicinity to afford additional security . Communist units detected in the Ho Bo Woods by allied intelligence included the <unk> Local Force Company , 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion and 7th Cu Chi Battalion . The commander of the Cu Chi Battalion was later identified after the war as Captain Nguyen Thanh Linh . In total , local communist defensive strength was believed to include 1 @,@ 000 men . 
 In response , a large American ' search @-@ and @-@ destroy ' operation was launched in January 1966 , involving more the 8 @,@ 000 troops commanded by the US 1st Infantry Division under Major General Jonathan O. Seaman , including the US 3rd Infantry Brigade , 1st Infantry Division and the US 173rd Airborne Brigade , which was attached to the division for the operation ; in total six battalions plus supporting arms . Still attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade was the Australian battalion , 1 RAR — now commanded by Preece — with 105 Field Battery in direct support , as well as engineers from 3rd Field Troop , Royal Australian Engineers and the M113s from the Prince of Wales Light Horse . At the time it was the largest military operation mounted in South Vietnam , being the first divisional offensive to date . Preceded by a heavy aerial bombardment , the scheme of manoeuvre envisioned an airmobile assault by the US 173rd Brigade in the north and west , while the US 3rd Infantry Brigade would seal off the area to the south , in preparation for a sweep designed to push trapped communist forces eastwards against the Saigon River . 1 RAR 's role was to establish a blocking position in a village beside the river on the northern flank of the brigade 's area of operations . 
 In order to achieve tactical surprise , the operation was launched immediately following Operation Marauder , with the Australians and Americans redeployed by air . Prior to the assault , the 1 RAR Operations Officer , Major John Essex @-@ Clarke , conducted an aerial reconnaissance of the proposed Landing Zone — known as LZ June — on 7 January . Observing a lack of ground foliage , he was concerned about the possibility of extensive Viet Cong defensive works close to the LZ , and with the support of Williamson the landing zone was subsequently switched to a less @-@ exposed location . The original plan would have seen 1 RAR inserted directly on top of a heavily defended bunker system , and would have likely resulted in heavy casualties . Captain Sandy MacGregor , the commander of the 3rd Field Troop , was of the opinion that the " decision almost certainly saved hundreds of Australian lives . "

 = = = Insertion , 8 January 1966 = = = 
 The battle began at 09 : 30 on 8 January with heavy American preparatory fire from artillery , as well as napalm and airstrikes from B @-@ 52 bombers which resulted in significant defoliation . Soon after the airmobile operation commenced with the first American units being inserted by helicopter to the north , west and south . The US 3rd Infantry Brigade — under the command of Colonel William <unk> — was subsequently inserted by helicopter and by road . The brigade headquarters and command element departed Di An in convoy and reached Trung Lap on the western boundary of the brigade 's area of operations by midday . Concurrently , two battalions were inserted by helicopter to the south @-@ west , one blocking the south side of the Ho Bo Woods while the other conducted a sweep . The Americans were in contact almost immediately , although the engagements were generally small scale , or involving snipers . Meanwhile , the brigade 's third battalion moved by road to Trung Lap and then moved on foot to its assigned search area . 
 In the north , 1 RAR was inserted into its new landing zone — LZ March — 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the south @-@ west . With B Company securing the site , the battalion moved on foot to the line of departure but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire . However , after the Australians established communications , the shelling was halted and they began their advance . No sooner had the lead elements — D Company under the command of Major Ian Fisher — emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion 's LZ , when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree @-@ line on the north @-@ east corner . In the action which followed , six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded , including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke , who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood . Meanwhile , two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed . 
 Preece moved to push his other companies around each flank of D Company , and towards the battalion 's original blocking position . Soon they were also in contact with small groups of Viet Cong from positions behind trees and in bunkers , while others popped up from spider holes and tunnel entrances ; it became apparent to the Australians that they had stumbled across a significant Viet Cong force in extensive fortifications , sufficient to hold a battalion . B Company , under the command of Major Ian McFarlane , also uncovered a small dug @-@ in hospital with simple transfusion equipment , documents and bandages . Meanwhile , the remaining battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade had also been inserted . The 1st Battalion , US 503rd Infantry Regiment flew into LZ April at 12 : 00 , while US 2 / 503rd Battalion arrived at LZ May at 14 : 30 . With the insertion going largely according to plan , the brigades began their advance eastwards . Converging on the suspected location of the communist headquarters , a thorough search of the area yielded little , and it was believed that the Viet Cong had withdrawn earlier in response to the initial Australian advance . 
 Amid strong resistance , the Australians were made to fight their way through the maze of bunkers , <unk> stakes and booby traps but they were eventually able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance . The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches , one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet . The defenders subsequently withdrew , with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east . Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap — as one of the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during Operation Hump — the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter before dark and waited for the communists to counter @-@ attack . As night fell , movement was detected along a trench on the C Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position . Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol that had just departed on a clearing patrol , the machine @-@ gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment , killing one of the infiltrators at point @-@ blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew . 
 Minor actions continued into the night , with small groups of Viet Cong able to pop up undetected and then disappear at will from within the Australian defensive position . The searching units were unable to locate Viet Cong in large numbers but experienced a significant number of sudden engagements and ambushes throughout the day , and it became clear that the communists were using tunnels for movement and concealment . Preece suspected that the area was honeycombed with tunnels and that the communist headquarters that he had been tasked to destroy was in fact located beneath the feet of the battalion . The Australians were the only battalion in the US 173rd Brigade to strike significant resistance , and by the end of the first day 1 RAR had suffered a total of three killed and 15 wounded , while the artillery Forward Observer from 105 Field Battery had also been killed . The battalion spent a sleepless night and in the early hours of the morning there were a number of short exchanges of fire as small groups of Viet Cong returned to the area . Not wanting to fire the machine @-@ guns for fear of giving their positions away or hitting friendly troops , the Australians resorted to using grenades forward of the perimeter . Meanwhile , in the US 3rd Infantry Brigade area of operations contact had been light , with only six Viet Cong killed . 
 = = = Tunnels of Cu Chi , 9 January 1966 = = = 
 The process of breaking into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January , with the objective now switching to the location , clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes . Whereas standard US Army practice was to seal , blow up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable with smoke , tear gas and explosives before quickly moving on , the Australians spent the next few days laboriously searching and mapping the complexes they found using military engineers . Led by MacGregor , the Australian sappers from 3 Field Troop systematically tackled the tunnels , using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages . Small @-@ scale contacts between the communists and the Australians continued and MacGregor was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership . 
 Originally constructed in 1945 by the Viet Minh during the fighting with the French in the First Indochina War , the tunnels at Cu Chi had taken decades to build but later had lain dormant after the war until 1960 , when they were reactivated . Since then they had endured constant bombing , all the while being expanded . By 1965 they formed an underground maze of passages , fighting tunnels , meeting rooms and food caches , stretching from Saigon to the Cambodian border . Given their headquarters function , the tunnels were equipped with an array of communications and medical facilities and were defended by interlocking arcs of fire and connecting fire tunnels . Dug into hard clay which had largely protected them from American bombing , some trenches were reported as being more 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) deep , and some tunnels as long as 460 metres ( 500 yd ) , while numerous side tunnels led from the main tunnels . In places the system was between one , two and even three levels deep . The network was so extensive that they were rumoured to be able to hold 5 @,@ 000 men , many of whom lived underground for up to six months at a time . On seeing the tunnels one American soldier described them at the time as " the New York subway " . 
 In the southern area of operations , the US 3rd Infantry Brigade was making slow progress , with the Viet Cong using hit @-@ and @-@ run and ambush tactics to inflict casualties on the Americans , before withdrawing into the sanctuary of their underground tunnels . On 9 January , the Americans located and destroyed a cache of medical supplies , as well as a large amount of rice and a small hospital , as well as capturing 30 Viet Cong during a series of skirmishes . To the north , while 1 RAR searched the tunnel complex the American battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade continued to sweep their area of operations , with a number of friendly fire incidents complicating their task . Both the US 1 / 503rd and <unk> 2 / 503rd Battalions searched eastward toward the Saigon River and , although they continued to find supply caches and abandoned positions , they were involved in only minor skirmishes with the Viet Cong . Concealed in well @-@ camouflaged ambush positions however , the communists inflicted a number of casualties on the Americans . Only one Viet Cong was killed during the fighting , bringing the total for the operation to just 22 . Despite the large number of US troops involved they had experienced only limited contact to that point , and criticism of the operation consequently began to mount in the American media . 
 = = = Fighting intensifies , 10 – 11 January 1966 = = = 
 The Australians continued to explore the tunnels , finding a large quantity of documents and equipment , and by 10 January they had recovered 59 weapons , 20 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition , 100 fragmentation grenades , one 57 mm recoilless rifle , explosives , clothing and medical supplies . At least 11 Viet Cong had also been killed in the fighting . Contact also continued , and overnight the Australians killed another five Viet Cong outside their perimeter , while numerous actions occurred during the day as the US 173rd Brigade maintained its sweep . On 10 January at 09 : 00 the American cavalry from Troop E , US 17th Cavalry Regiment and the Australians from the Prince of Wales Light Horse commenced a combined search operation and fought communist snipers and small groups throughout most of the day . At 14 : 00 a number of Viet Cong dug @-@ in in trenches were encountered , and following a series of air @-@ strikes and artillery barrages , the cavalry and the Australian M113s swept the area during which several Australians were slightly injured by a misdirected US Navy air @-@ strike . Sixteen Viet Cong bodies were subsequently recovered , and another 60 were believed to have been killed but had been removed from the battlefield . 
 Williamson subsequently ordered the US 1 / 503rd Battalion — under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Tyler — to change the direction of its advance . During the morning the battalion had conducted platoon @-@ sized patrols south , south @-@ west and west , locating a well @-@ constructed defensive position , including bunkers and trenches connected by tunnels . With no contact as yet made with the Viet Cong , the battalion prepared to move to a new AO in the north by 13 : 30 . During this move the battalion , and armour from Troop D , US 16th Cavalry Regiment , engaged a dug @-@ in Viet Cong Main Force company less than 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 2 @,@ 200 yd ) west of the Australians . Following air @-@ strikes and heavy artillery bombardment the communists withdrew , leaving 29 dead during a sharp engagement . The US 2 / 503rd Battalion had also sent out a number of squad @-@ sized patrols during the day , but no recent signs of Viet Cong activity were found , and only minor sniper fire encountered . However , like the Australians , the American paratroopers also uncovered a large number of tunnels and other fortifications . 
 Meanwhile , the US 3rd Brigade continued to make slow progress and , despite reaching the banks of the Saigon River by 10 January , only a few brief glimpses of the Viet Cong had been made . A small base camp was discovered and destroyed however , while another battalion captured more than 10 tons of rice and 15 bales of cotton . The following day the Americans found and destroyed more bunkers and a number of houses and sampans , as well as quantities of supplies and food . They also uncovered a tunnel complex and a quantity of maps , charts and documents , although still little resistance was met . During these actions the Americans lost more men to booby traps than enemy fire . Advancing on a 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) front , troops from the 1st Battalion , US 28th Infantry Regiment — commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Haldane — took a number of casualties from snipers , although the source of the fire was not immediately obvious . The Viet Cong attempted to avoid a set piece battle , opting instead to disperse into small groups to fight from their spider @-@ holes and tunnels and only choosing to engage the Americans at close range with small arms , which included old Russian K @-@ 44 rifles . Despite suffering a number of casualties the Americans continued to advance , calling in artillery fire . Such tactics proved largely ineffectively though and the Commanding Officer of US 2 / 28th Battalion , Lieutenant Colonel George <unk> , was himself shot and killed by a sniper during the fighting . Regardless , after receiving word of the discovery of the tunnels by US 173rd Airborne Brigade to their north , the brigade began another sweep . 
 The US 3rd Brigade subsequently also uncovered a significant tunnel complex , after Sergeant Stewart Green from US 1 / 28th Battalion accidentally sat down on a nail and uncovered a trap door on 11 January . Volunteering to enter the tunnel , Green then located an underground dispensary occupied by more than 30 Viet Cong who subsequently escaped . Later a smoke machine was used to pump smoke into the tunnel system , and this was successful in locating numerous tunnel entrances and bunkers as the smoke rose above the jungle canopy . They were the first American troops to enter the tunnels , and they proceeded to attack them with CS gas , and later explosives . However , such tactics met with limited success with the tear gas flushing out large numbers of women and children , but few Viet Cong . Led by Green , a squad of Americans equipped with flashlights , pistols and a field telephone penetrated over 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) of the tunnel system before becoming involved in a fire @-@ fight with the Viet Cong . Wearing gas @-@ masks the Americans threw gas grenades and fought their way back to the tunnel entrance , but one soldier became lost in the darkness and Green re @-@ entered the tunnel to find him . The Viet Cong subsequently withdrew . 
 Yet even as the Americans were attempting to clear the tunnels , heavy hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed only with a pistol , in order to give first aid to a number of wounded soldiers . His courage inspired his men to complete the assault , and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective . That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation , and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation . The brigade 's involvement in Crimp had been limited , losing six killed and 45 wounded , while 22 Viet Cong had been killed . It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin . 
 = = = Crimp continues , 12 – 13 January 1966 = = = 
 As they had done previously , the communists continued to attempt to infiltrate the 1 RAR perimeter during the night , and a minor clash with an Australian standing patrol occurred at dawn . Over the next two days , operations to exploit the tunnels continued , with the US 173rd Brigade and the Australians involved in a number of contacts , as well as suffering from sporadic sniper and mortar fire . Significant quantities of documents , equipment and rice were captured however , and large numbers of civilians detained for questioning . On 12 January , 1 RAR continued its patrolling program and one patrol subsequently located 15 tons of rice and destroyed it after killing six Viet Cong during a 20 @-@ minute battle . The task was complicated by the presence of a large number of civilians however , and many were found hiding in shelters and tunnels and they had to be coaxed out of hiding by the Australians and transported to a refugee camp which had been established nearby . Another patrol from 11 Platoon later uncovered a tunnel system just 50 metres ( 55 yd ) from their position , and found it to be occupied by a large Viet Cong force after a dog and its handler were sent into the tunnel to investigate . Eight Viet Cong were subsequently killed after the tunnel was destroyed by Australian engineers . 
 The same day , however , the Australian efforts to clear the tunnels had suffered a setback after an engineer became stuck in a trap door between one underground gallery and another , more than 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) below the surface . Despite the efforts of his comrades , he could not be recovered and died from asphyxiation after being overcome by a combination of tear gas , carbon monoxide , and lack of oxygen when he dislodged his respirator during the struggle to free himself . After days of living in close proximity to the enemy , the constant strain of sniper fire and the pressure of searching the tunnels was also beginning to take its toll , and a number of Australians were killed and wounded in otherwise avoidable friendly fire incidents on the evenings of 10 and 12 January . During the early afternoon of 12 January the Australians encountered a large group of armed Viet Cong during a tunnel clearance and called on them to surrender . However they failed to emerge and the tunnel was subsequently demolished , probably killing eight Viet Cong who were believed to have been entombed as it collapsed . 
 Meanwhile , the same day Haldane ordered US 1 / 28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations , uncovering a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps . A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American was killed by a Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large anthill . Later , as the 1 / 503rd continued to search its area with platoon @-@ size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January , a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact . An air @-@ strike was successfully called in by the Americans however , and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong , while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed . 
 = = = Action concludes , 14 January 1966 = = = 
 Ultimately , more than 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) of tunnels had been uncovered and searched by the Australians . A large quantity of documents had been recovered , including more than 100 @,@ 000 pages detailing operational structure as well as the names of agents operating in Saigon . Ninety weapons were also captured , as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition and enough equipment , food and other supplies to fill eight 2 ½ <unk> trucks . Although the US battalions had played a large part in the operation and had also uncovered numerous tunnel systems and been involved in heavy contact , by the fortunes of war 1 RAR had been allocated the area of operations that was ultimately found to contain the Viet Cong headquarters . The Australians had even partially searched the tunnel leading to the headquarters that was their objective , but did not learn how close they had come to succeeding until decades after the war had ended . During the course of these activities the searchers had suffered a number of additional fatalities from Viet Cong snipers . 
 Fully exploring and destroying the tunnels was well beyond the allied resources available , and the decision was eventually made to call a halt to operations . Six days after it began , Operation Crimp ended , with 1 RAR returning to Bien Hoa on 14 January . By the time the operation was concluded only a fraction of the known tunnel network had been destroyed and it was not until after the war that it was learnt that the system at Cu Chi actually included more than 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) of tunnels . Although further American ground operations as well a number of heavy B52 bombing raids resulted in further damage to the tunnel complexes , the Ho Bo Woods were never occupied on a permanent basis and the Viet Cong were successful in restoring their transit and supply functions . As such , despite significant disruption , the military and political apparatus in Cu Chi remained largely intact , allowing the communists freedom of action for later operations against Saigon . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 During the fighting the Australians had faced stiff resistance and had suffered eight killed and 29 wounded , while claiming 27 Viet Cong killed and a further 30 probably killed . The Americans had also been involved in heavy fighting and their casualties included 14 killed and 76 wounded . Total communist casualties included 128 confirmed killed , and another 190 probably killed , as well as 92 captured and another 509 suspects detained . In addition many more Viet Cong were thought likely to have perished in the tunnels as they were collapsed by charges laid by the Australian engineers . The Americans later claimed that the headquarters of the communist 4th Military Region had also been destroyed . Due to the quantity of information recovered from the thousands of captured documents alone , the battle was later described as the first allied strategic intelligence victory of the war . So significant was the find that both Westmoreland and General Joseph <unk> , the head of Intelligence at MACV , visited 1 RAR during Operation Crimp . Allied operations against the communist tunnels had been largely ad hoc , and the Australians began to develop the earliest techniques for exploring and destroying them . Later , at least partially as a result of the success of the Australians in clearing some of the shorter tunnels , American units adopted similar tactics and created a number of tunnel @-@ clearance teams , known popularly as Tunnel Rats . 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 Despite the losses suffered by the communists , the combined American and Australian force had only succeeded in partially clearing the area and the tunnel network it concealed , and consequently the Ho Bo Woods would remain a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war . Indeed , the bulk of the communist force had successfully withdrawn intact , leaving only rear guard elements in defence , prompting the communists to also declare the operation a victory , claiming almost 2 @,@ 000 American troops killed or wounded , 100 vehicles destroyed , and 50 aircraft shot down . Yet , such claims were based on estimates of casualties caused by command @-@ detonated mines , <unk> sticks and other booby traps , and proved to be wildly inaccurate . In fact Operation Crimp had rattled the communists , and they subsequently ordered their units in the south to prevent the Americans from concentrating their forces in the future . Regardless , it also highlighted the inherent weakness of the search @-@ and @-@ clear operations that would later become standard operating procedure for the US Army in Vietnam . The Ho Bo Woods were again targeted by the Americans in January 1967 , during a much larger operation known as Operation Cedar Falls . However , despite heavy casualties again being inflicted on the Viet Cong , the tunnels continued to remain a problem for the Americans and they were later used as a communist staging area for the attack on Saigon during the 1968 Tet offensive . Finally in 1970 , American B @-@ 52 bombers carried out a number of heavy air @-@ strikes on the area , dropping thousands of delayed @-@ fuse bombs that buried deep into the ground before exploding , ending the tunnels ' utility . Operation Crimp was 1 RAR 's third and last foray into the communist heartland and following the fighting they had more than two weeks rest in Bien Hoa — their longest break from operations during the battalion 's tour . Further operations followed in the months afterwards , including the Battle of Suoi Bong Trang on the night of 23 – 24 February 1966 . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 At the strategic level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after appearing on the verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided , yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy , with US troop levels planned to rise from 210 @,@ 000 in January 1966 to 327 @,@ 000 by December 1966 . The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966 , announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade — the 1st Australian Task Force — with armour , aviation , engineer and artillery support ; in total 4 @,@ 500 men . Additional Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6 @,@ 300 personnel . 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province , thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter @-@ insurgency tactics and techniques . The task force arrived between April and June 1966 , constructing a base at Nui Dat , while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group which was subsequently established at the port of Vung Tau . 
 = William J. Fields = 
 William Jason Fields ( December 29 , 1874 – October 21 , 1954 ) was a politician from the U.S. state of Kentucky . Known as " Honest Bill from Olive Hill " , he represented Kentucky 's Ninth District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1923 , resigning to become the state 's 41st governor . 
 Discouraged by an early defeat for a seat in the state legislature , Fields took a job at a grocery store in Ashland , Kentucky that allowed him to travel the state and meet many people in his congressional district . In 1911 , he became the first Democrat elected to Congress from the Ninth District in two decades . Elected to seven consecutive terms , he rose to become the ranking member of the House Committee on Military Affairs during World War I. When Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died unexpectedly two months before the general election , the Democratic Central Committee chose Fields to replace Cantrill as the nominee . In a campaign that featured more name @-@ calling than substantial debate , Fields secured the backing of the powerful Jockey Club political alliance and won a landslide victory over Republican Attorney General Charles I. Dawson . 
 The first legislative session of Fields ' term was marked by infighting within his own party . His agenda was opposed by a Democratic faction led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham , Louisville Courier @-@ Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham , and political boss Percy Haly . Fields ' signature issue , a $ 75 million bond issue to construct a state highway system , passed the legislature in 1924 , but the electorate refused to approve it in November of that year . Among Fields ' accomplishments as governor were an increase in the gasoline tax to help fund his highway program , a reorganization of the state 's government bureaucracy , and the preservation of Cumberland Falls from industrial development . He never united the factions of his party , however . His political enemies charged him with nepotism and abusing his pardon power , and the Democrats lost the governorship in 1927 to Republican Flem D. Sampson . Following his service as governor , Fields failed in an attempt to return to his former congressional seat . He was appointed to the State Workman 's Compensation Board by Governor A. B. " Happy " Chandler , and after his retirement from public service , he practiced law and worked as a real estate agent until his death on October 21 , 1954 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William J. Fields was born December 29 , 1874 in Willard , Carter County , Kentucky . He was the fourth of twelve children born to Christopher C. and Alice ( Rucker ) Fields . He was educated in the local public schools , then matriculated to the University of Kentucky . After graduation , he started a real estate business in Olive Hill , Kentucky and engaged in farming . He also studied law on his own . 
 On October 10 , 1893 , Fields married Dora McDavid ; the couple had six children . At age 21 , he was elected constable of Carter County , but three years later , he fell short in his bid to capture a seat in state legislature . Following the loss , he took a job at a grocery store in Ashland , Kentucky that would allow him to travel the state more freely , make acquaintances , and better position himself for a run for higher office . 
 = = House of Representatives = = 
 Campaigning under the moniker " Honest Bill from Olive Hill " , Fields won a narrow victory as a Democrat to represent Kentucky 's Ninth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1910 . The first Democrat to hold the seat in twenty years , he was re @-@ elected for another six consecutive terms . A member of the Committee on Military Affairs , he eventually became the ranking Democrat on the committee and the ranking member of the subcommittee that controlled appropriations for U.S. operations during World War I. 
 In September 1923 , Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died , leaving the party without a candidate . Alben Barkley , who Cantrill had defeated for the nomination , refused to be the Democratic candidate , perhaps because he had already decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 1926 . The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill . 
 = = Governor of Kentucky = = 
 The general election campaign generated little interest and quickly degenerated into name calling . Fields ' opponent , Republican Attorney General Charles I. Dawson , mocked Fields ' traditional election slogan , calling him " Dodging Bill from Olive Hill , who answers no questions and never will " . Fields countered by referring to Dawson as " Changing Charlie " , a reference to Dawson 's one @-@ time affiliation with the Democratic Party prior to becoming a Republican . Fields secured the backing of a group of powerful political bosses , including Louisville banker James B. Brown , U.S. Senator Augustus Owsley Stanley , and Lexington power broker Billy <unk> . These three were the leaders of the Jockey Club , a group dedicated to the preservation of parimutuel betting in the state , especially at racetracks . Discontent with incumbent Republican Governor Edwin P. Morrow further aided Fields ' campaign , and he defeated Dawson by a vote of 356 @,@ 035 to 306 @,@ 277 . It was one of the largest Democratic gubernatorial landslides in state history . He resigned from the House to accept the governorship . 
 Already lightly regarded because he was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary , Fields further weakened his position due to some of his personal preferences . A devout Methodist and prohibitionist , Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion . He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda , where dancing would be allowed , but he and his wife did not attend . Fields ' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion 's lawn , drawing derision from urban citizens . 
 Fields ' 1924 address to the General Assembly included several ambitious proposals , including the founding of a trade school for blacks at Paducah , planning and developing normal schools at Murray and Morehead , raising the gasoline tax to three cents per gallon , and the issuance of $ 75 million in state bonds to finance a state highway system . A dissenting faction of the Democratic party , led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham , political boss Percy Haly , and Louisville Courier @-@ Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham , voiced strong opposition to Fields ' proposals , especially the bond issue . They charged that Fields had the support of a dangerous " bipartisan combine " , with the Republican element of the combine led by Maurice Galvin . 
 Tensions between the factions were inflamed almost as soon as the 1924 legislature convened . A bill to outlaw parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives , but failed in the Senate . The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board 's makeup ; this attempt also narrowly failed . When Senator Stanley , an opponent of prohibition , sought re @-@ election to the Senate in 1924 , Fields and his allies did not support him , leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett and giving the Republicans both of the state 's senate seats for the first time in history . 
 The signature issue of the session , however , was Fields ' request for the bond issue . He engaged in a debate with opponents of the issue that was published in Bingham 's Courier @-@ Journal as well as the Louisville Herald and Louisville Post , two papers owned by James B. Brown . Ultimately , the issue was approved by the General Assembly , which was considered a major victory for Fields . Still , the bond issue had to be approved by the state 's electorate . The Courier @-@ Journal continued the fight against the issue , while Desha Breckinridge 's Lexington Herald came out in favor of it . Fields spent ten weeks criss @-@ crossing the state speaking in favor of the bond issue , but on election day , it was rejected by a margin of 90 @,@ 000 votes . 
 Undaunted by the failure of the bond issue , Fields returned to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals , including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system . The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature , including the increased gas tax and several bills to reorganize state government . The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in the reorganization . Under Fields , the state implemented the first phase of desegregation busing . 
 Fields opposed a plan to develop hydroelectric power generation capabilities on the Cumberland Falls . In order to prevent development , he accepted an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the property around the falls and donate it to the state . He also suggested the creation of Carter Caves State Resort Park in his home county . 
 Fields ' political enemies charged him with corruption and chastised him for issuing too many pardons . He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner , political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner , and other relatives and political supporters to low @-@ ranking positions in the state government . Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley 's senatorial bid in 1926 , Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham , and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Following his service as governor , Fields returned to Olive Hill and was admitted to the bar in 1927 . Sensing an opportunity for a political comeback in 1930 , Fields launched a bid to regain his former seat in the U.S. House , which was now occupied by Republican Elva R. Kendall . Kendall had beaten Fields 's successor , Fred M. Vinson in the 1928 Hoover landslide , which saw nine out of eleven ( all but the two ancestrally Democratic western Kentucky ) U.S. House seats go to the Republicans . 
 Vinson instead chose not to stand aside for his former ally and decisively beat Fields in the August Democratic primary by a margin of 63 % to 21 % ( with a third candidate , W.C. Hamilton taking the remaining 16 % ) . Vinson successfully reclaimed his seat in the general election from Kendall .

 = Washington State Route 17 = 
 State Route 17 ( SR 17 ) is a 136 @.@ 67 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 219 @.@ 95 km ) state highway serving the Columbia Plateau in the central region of the U.S. state of Washington . The highway travels through mostly rural areas of Franklin . Adams , Grant , Douglas , and Okanogan counties and is designated as part of the National Highway System between Mesa and Moses Lake and as the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway between Othello and Coulee City for passing through the Grand Coulee . SR 17 begins in Mesa at an interchange with U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) and travels north and intersects SR 26 near Othello before entering Moses Lake , where the highway intersects Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) and travels as a partial expressway . SR 17 continues north , intersecting SR 28 in Soap Lake , through the Grand Coulee to a short concurrency with US 2 west of Coulee City . The highway turns northwest and crosses the Columbia River on the Columbia River Bridge at Bridgeport before ending at US 97 in Brewster at the southwestern edge of the Colville Indian Reservation . 
 SR 17 was established during the merger of three highways during the 1964 highway renumbering : Secondary State Highway 11G ( SSH 11G ) between Eltopia and Soap Lake , a branch of Primary State Highway 7 ( PSH 7 ) between Soap Lake and Coulee City , and a branch of PSH 10 between Coulee City and Brewster . The PSH 10 branch was codified in 1931 as a branch of State Road 10 and was followed by the PSH 7 branch during the creation of the primary state highway system in 1937 . The Columbia River Bridge at Bridgeport was completed in 1950 and the PSH 10 branch was re @-@ aligned onto the north side of the Columbia River the following year . SSH 11G was created in 1951 and was moved to a wider , straighter route between Moses Lake and Soap Lake in the 1960s . The highway was replaced by a limited @-@ access highway north of Moses Lake in 2007 . SR 17 between Eltopia and Mesa was replaced by US 395 in 1979 as part of a larger series of projects in the area to improve the highway in Franklin County .

 SR 17 begins at a diamond interchange with US 395 southeast of Mesa in Franklin County . The highway travels northwest through Mesa , where it crosses over a BNSF rail line and runs through <unk> Coulee before intersecting the terminus of SR 260 west of Connell in the Paradise Flats . SR 17 travels east of <unk> Reservoir and northwest into Adams County before <unk> SR 26 in a diamond interchange east of Othello . The highway continues north into Grant County as the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway and travels over the Columbia Basin Railroad into rural Adams County . The roadway serves as the western terminus of SR 170 and the eastern terminus of SR 262 west of Warden before continuing northwest towards Moses Lake . 
 SR 17 travels into the city of Moses Lake and intersects I @-@ 90 in a partial cloverleaf interchange , serving as the eastern terminus of I @-@ 90 Business and its concurrency with SR 17 . The roadway expands to four lanes and turns north at Pioneer Way , where I @-@ 90 Business leaves the concurrency and travels into Downtown Moses Lake . SR 17 heads around Moses Lake and turn northwest onto a limited @-@ access highway after an intersection with Broadway Avenue , signed as the northern terminus of SR 171 . The limited @-@ access highway intersects Stratford Road in a diamond interchange north of the city and heads northwest along Moses Lake through Moses Lake North , passing south of Grant County International Airport . SR 17 crosses Rocky Ford Creek and intersects SR 282 east of Ephrata in rural Grant County . The highway continues north and passes Ephrata Municipal Airport before it intersects SR 28 in Soap Lake . 
 SR 17 and the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway continue northwest through the Grand Coulee and passing several lakes , including Soap Lake , Lake Lenore and Alkali Lake . The highway turns northeast onto the west shores of Blue Lake and Park Lake , and passes the Blue Lake rest area . The roadway enters Sun Lakes State Park and passes Dry Falls at the north end of the Grand Coulee . SR 17 intersects US 2 , the continuation of the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway , west of Coulee City at the southern end of Banks Lake and begins a concurrency into Douglas County . SR 17 briefly travels west with US 2 and turns north to intersect the eastern terminus of SR 172 at Sims Corner . From Sims Corner , the roadway follows East Foster Creek northward to the western terminus of SR 174 and its spur route in Leahy . 
 The highway continues northwest to Bridgeport at the southern terminus of SR 173 and crossing the Columbia River on the 1 @,@ 108 @.@ 80 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 337 @.@ 96 m ) Columbia River Bridge ( also named the Bridgeport Bridge ) downstream from the Chief Joseph Dam . The steel continuous riveted deck truss bridge , listed on the National Register of Historic Places , carries SR 17 into Okanogan County and the Colville Indian Reservation , west of Bridgeport State Park . The highway continues north along the east bank of the Columbia River before passing through Fort Okanogan and ending at an intersection with US 97 east of Brewster near the confluence of the Columbia and Okanogan rivers . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was the expressway between SR 171 and Stratford Road in Moses Lake , serving an average of 19 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busiest section of the highway was between SR 172 in Sims Corner and SR 174 in Leahy , serving an average of 570 vehicles . SR 17 between Mesa and the Moses Lake area is designated as part of the National Highway System , which includes roadways important to the national economy , defense , and mobility ; and as part of WSDOT 's Highways of Statewide Significance , which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 17 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to three highways that were designated under the primary and secondary state highway system : SSH 11G from US 395 and PSH 11 in Eltopia to PSH 7 in Soap Lake , a branch of PSH 7 from Soap Lake to US 2 and PSH 2 west of Coulee City , and a branch of PSH 10 from Coulee City to US 97 and PSH 10 east of Brewster . The Coulee City – Brewster branch of PSH 10 was codified in 1931 as a branch of State Road 10 and re @-@ codified in 1937 , during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways ; however , the highway was not built between Sims Corner and Bridgeport until the 1950s . The Soap Lake – Coulee City branch of PSH 7 was established in 1937 to serve as an alternate route to SSH 2F , avoiding the Grand Coulee Dam . In 1951 , the PSH 10 branch between Bridgeport and Brewster was moved north of the Columbia River via the newly built Columbia River Bridge on the present route of SR 17 , as the old route through Bridgeport and over the Brewster Bridge became a new branch that was later signed in 1964 as SR 173 . SSH 11G was also created in 1951 , traveling north from US 395 in Eltopia through Mesa and Moses Lake to Soap Lake along existing gravel roads from the late 1930s , later straightened and widened in the 1970s . 
 SR 17 was originally a 144 @.@ 27 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 232 @.@ 18 km ) highway , extending south from Mesa to Eltopia when it was created in 1964 and codified in 1970 , but was shortened by 7 @.@ 60 miles ( 12 @.@ 23 km ) to its current route after US 395 was re @-@ aligned between Eltopia and Connell . The new alignment , part of improvements to SR 17 in the Mesa area in the late 1960s , was approved in 1968 and opened in late 1979 . No major revisions to the route of SR 17 have occurred since 1979 , as WSDOT has improved the sections of the highway through widening and barriers . Within Moses Lake , the two @-@ lane highway was designated to be widened to a four @-@ lane limited @-@ access highway between Pioneer Way and Stratford Road in 1997 and completed a decade later on October 8 , 2007 . The highway between SR 26 in Othello to US 2 west of Coulee City was designated as the Coulee Corridor Scenic Byway under the Washington State Scenic and Recreational Highways program in 1967 and under the National Scenic Byway program on September 22 , 2005 .
