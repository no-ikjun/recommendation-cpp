" after becoming frustrated by a last @-@ minute alteration to the show 's teleprompter text . The band members watched the video clip of this incident repeatedly and decided that it was emblematic of how they wanted to record a live show – without overdubbing in post @-@ production . Personnel in the group for the live show included Wednesday 13 on vocals and guitar , Jason Trioxin on guitar , Nate Manor on bass , and Jonny Chops on drums . 
 Fuck It , We 'll Do It Live received a generally positive reception from music critics . Metal Storm reviewed the release and described the album as an ideal introduction to Wednesday 13 , comparing the style of music to glam punk . Metal Ireland recommended the music for its simple , B @-@ movie quality . Global Domination wrote that the album broke the trend of inadvisable purchases of live performances . The release received favorable reviews from <unk> and <unk> ; the latter compared the album 's style to that of Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson .

 Wednesday 13 explained the album 's inspiration in an interview : " Wednesday 13 ( the band ) has a live DVD that I put out and we couldn 't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking , we are going to have to come up with a name for it . The live titles , you have to put something like that . So , we were watching Bill O 'Reilly and we kept listening to him say , ' Fuck it , we 'll do it live . ' That 's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together . We didn 't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like , ' fuck it , we 'll do it live . ' We didn 't do any overdubs on it , everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it . "

 Wednesday 13 explained that he had been in a motor vehicle accident in September 2007 and had fractured his clavicle , and had subsequently decided to expand the band from four to five members . By the time of the live recording , he had healed sufficiently to both perform as frontman and play guitar , and the band was reduced back to its normal size of four members . This was Wednesday 13 's first live album . In an interview with SF Weekly , Wednesday 13 spoke about his touring band . " This is like my favorite lineup that I 've ever had , and I 've definitely had members come and go for many different reasons over the years . " 
 The video of the performance was recorded using six cameras . At brief times during the performance , the video recorded a moment of white on camera or a dark screen , both of which were related to the use of strobe lights . An individual dressed in costume as Friday the 13th character Jason Voorhees made an appearance on @-@ stage at one point during the performance .

 No post @-@ production overdubbing was done in the studio . Occasional wrong notes can be heard in the final product of the recording . Wednesday 13 admitted , " First off , let me say this is a live recording . This is not a live recording where we went back into the studio and overdubbed guitar parts or vocals . This is us ... LIVE ! If we make a mistake , you will hear it . If my voice cracks , you hear it . This is as close to a live experience as we could give . "

 = Olivia ( Olivia album ) = 
 Olivia is the debut album by American R & B singer Olivia . It was released on May 15 , 2001 , by J Records . Olivia was known as " the First Lady of J " as she was the first artist signed to the label . Promotional efforts for the album associated Olivia with a provocative image . The record is a primarily hip hop and R & B record , with lyrical themes that revolve largely around sexuality and romance . It features guest vocals from American rapper Petey Pablo and American R & B singer Jimmy Cozier . Olivia received comparisons to music by rapper Lil ' Kim and R & B singers Aaliyah and Mýa . Olivia later expressed disappointment with her lack of control over the recording and promotion of the album and felt she was limited to a " bad girl " image by label executives . After promoting the album , Olivia left the label and was invited to join G @-@ Unit Records by its founder 50 Cent . 
 The album received mixed reviews from critics , who praised Olivia 's attitude while rapping and singing , though some criticized the record 's inconsistency , and Olivia 's lack of connection to the material . The album was moderately successful in the United States , peaking at number 55 on the Billboard 200 and number 22 on the Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums charts . 
 " Bizounce " was released as the lead single from Olivia on March 20 , 2001 , and peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The second single " Are U Capable " was released on July 3 , 2001 ; " You Got the Damn Thing ( I Like ) Remix " , a remix of the album track " You Got the Damn Thing " , was serviced as the third and final single from the record later that same year . Olivia further promoted the album through several performances on television and live shows and a promotional tour prior to its release . 
 = = Background = = 
 After initially attempting to rap under the name " O @-@ Lovely " , Olivia chose to attend Hofstra University and Five Towns College to further her career in music . Olivia said people would frequently compare her voice to R & B singer Brandy . During her audition for American record producer Clive Davis , she sang the gospel hymn " His Eye Is on the Sparrow " . Musician Joshua Thompson produced Olivia 's demo , and arranged her audition for Arista Records executives and Davis . In an interview with Billboard , Olivia said she was signed to the label immediately after the meeting . J Records senior vice president Ron <unk> described Olivia as " the real deal " , emphasizing her roles as " a songwriter , a singer , and a rapper " . At age 17 , Olivia was the first artist signed to J Records by American record producer Clive Davis . Executives from the record company referred to her as " the First Lady of J " . Olivia described herself as " the one chosen to flagship the label " since her single and album were one of the first projects released by the company . She defined her music as " R & B with a strong hip hop flava " . The Morning Call 's Righi reported the popularity of Olivia , along with R & B singer Aaliyah , reflecting that " the right attitude , hip @-@ hop production and clothing — not to mention a body to die for " was considered more important in contemporary R & B than : " the plaintive human voice in the throes of transcendent ecstasy or bottomless hurt " . 
 Olivia later viewed the recording of the album as a learning experience for her future music ventures ; she said her time at the record label " was cut short by the politics of the industry and me not actually taking my career into my own hands " . She said record executives took away her control over the creation of the album given her youth and inexperience . In her 2014 autobiography Release Me : My Life , My Words , Olivia wrote that she did not consider building a cohesive set of songs during the recording process and identified the album as lacking a clear direction . During promotion for the record , Olivia described having a good working relationship with Davis , but she called him " extremely controlling " after leaving the label . Olivia claimed that she was forced to be the bad girl while label mate Alicia Keys was promoted as the good girl . In an official statement , J Records ' representatives pointed to Olivia 's credits as a co @-@ writer for a majority of the album as proof of her involvement with the project and maintained : " Clive doesn 't categorize artists as good or bad girls " . After her release from J Records , American rapper 50 Cent and Interscope Geffen A & M Records chairman Jimmy Iovine signed Olivia to G @-@ Unit Records . 50 Cent said he enjoyed Olivia 's previous work and blamed J Records for sabotaging her career . 
 = = Composition and promotion = = 
 The final cut of Olivia comprises twelve tracks on the standard edition . The album consists primarily of R & B songs , with hip @-@ hop and jazz influences . The Morning Call 's Righi characterized the album 's first ten tracks as " dreary complaints [ with ] a mercenary attitude " while the final three were : " girlish and even gooey " . " Bizounce " was released as Olivia 's lead single on March 20 , 2001 . Director Marcus Raboy shot the accompanying music video . The song reached number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the Billboard Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart . It was Olivia 's highest @-@ charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 until her 2005 collaboration with 50 Cent on " Candy Shop " , which peaked at number one on the chart . In Canada , the single peaked at number sixteen on the Canadian Singles Chart . A reviewer in Billboard praised Olivia 's vocals , saying she " has the mouth of a bad girl and the voice of an angel " , and described the single as making her : " a bona fide R & B singer " . 
 The second single was originally intended to be " You Got the Damn Thing " before being changed to " Are U Capable " , which was released on vinyl , on July 3 , 2001 , and promoted with a music video . Rashaun Hall from Billboard gave the single a positive review , saying that it : " may be the song that sets her career ablaze " . " You Got the Damn Thing ( I Like ) Remix " , a remix of the album track " You Got the Damn Thing " , was later released separately and was treated as the third and final single from the album . 
 Olivia made appearances on television and on live shows to promote her debut album . Before the album 's release , she performed " Bizounce " on Soul Train , BET , MTV 's hip @-@ hop video block Sucker Free ( known at the time as <unk> ) , and The Source Sound Lab . On February 11 , 2001 , she embarked on a promotional tour leading up to the album 's release on May 15 , 2001 .

 Olivia received mixed reviews from music critics . A reviewer in Honey praised the album , saying : " Hip Hop Soul has a real voice with Olivia " . A reviewer in The Source noted that " Olivia is most memorable when she 's in woman @-@ scorned mode " , calling her " a <unk> @-@ out Aaliyah and pissed @-@ off Mýa " . A reviewer in CMJ called the album : " unique and ground @-@ breaking " . A reviewer in Q magazine described Olivia as " well @-@ versed in the not always noble art of the R & B ballad " and the songs as : " a list of saucy demands that would make Lil ' Kim blush " . Jon <unk> of AllMusic praised the album , saying " her softer tracks show some versatility " , and deemed Olivia 's best works as coming from : " when she is venting her spleen rather than revealing her soul " . Negative criticism focused on the inconsistency of the album 's sound and Olivia 's lack of connection to the material . Entertainment Weekly 's Mark Bautz commended the album 's impeccable production , but felt that it : " lacks the overall energy and excitement of its best songs " . Len Righi of The Morning Call praised Olivia 's persona as " the vulgar <unk> " , but was critical of the album 's content , saying " without being able to see the hand gesturing that is an integral part of modern R & B , Olivia 's music loses a lot " .

 SMS Thetis was the fourth member of the ten @-@ ship Gazelle class , built by the Imperial German Navy . She was built by the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig , laid down in 1899 , launched in July 1900 , and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in September 1901 . Armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , Thetis was capable of a top speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . 
 Thetis served in the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet during her peacetime career . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was deployed as a coastal defense ship in the Baltic , where she saw heavy service against the Russians . She supported the German drive on Libau in April – May 1915 , and was damaged by mines during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga . She was repeatedly attacked by Allied submarines , though she was never hit . In 1917 , Thetis was withdrawn from front @-@ line service for use as a gunnery training ship . She survived the war and continued on in service with the Reichsmarine through the 1920s . She was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1929 and broken up for scrap the following year .

 Thetis was ordered under the contract name " C " and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig in 1899 and launched on 3 July 1900 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 September 1901 . The ship was 105 @.@ 1 meters ( 345 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 2 m ( 40 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 92 m ( 16 @.@ 1 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 017 t ( 2 @,@ 969 long tons ; 3 @,@ 326 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple @-@ expansion engines manufactured by AG @-@ Germania . They were designed to give 8 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 6 @,@ 000 kW ) , for a top speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . The engines were powered by ten coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers . Thetis carried 560 tonnes ( 550 long tons ) of coal , which gave her a range of 3 @,@ 560 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 590 km ; 4 @,@ 100 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side by side aft . The guns could engage targets out to 12 @,@ 200 m ( 40 @,@ 000 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition , for 100 shells per gun . She was also equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes . They were submerged in the hull on the broadside . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 20 to 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick . The conning tower had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick sides , and the guns were protected by 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick shields . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After her commissioning , Thetis was assigned to the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet , a role she served in until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 . She was thereafter reduced to a coastal defense ship . As the Central Powers prepared to launch the Gorlice – Tarnów Offensive in early May 1915 , the extreme left flank of the German Army was ordered to launch a diversionary attack on 27 April . Thetis was assigned to the naval support for the attack ; on the first day of the attack , she and the cruiser Lübeck shelled the port of Libau . Ten days later , the Army was poised to seize Libau , and so requested naval support for the attack . Thetis and several other cruisers and torpedo boats covered the assault on the city and patrolled to ensure no Russian naval forces attempted to intervene . 
 On 14 May 1915 , Thetis had taken the U @-@ boat U @-@ 4 under tow off Bogskär island in the Gulf of Finland . The Russian submarine Drakon attacked the two German vessels , launching three torpedoes at Thetis and a fourth at U @-@ 4 , all of which missed . From the recently captured naval base at Libau , the Germans began to make offensive operations further into the Baltic . On 3 June , Thetis , four torpedo boats , and a seaplane tender attempted to force the Irben Strait into the Gulf of Riga , where they intended to lay a minefield . Russian and British submarines intercepted the flotilla in the Strait , however . The Russian submarine Okun attempted to move into position to attack Thetis , but one of the torpedo boats spotted her periscope and forced it off . On 5 June , the British submarine HMS E9 arrived on the scene , while Thetis was resupplying from a collier . E9 launched a spread of torpedoes at the two ships ; the one fired at Thetis missed , but the collier was hit , as was the torpedo boat <unk> . The collier sank , but the torpedo boat survived and made it back to port . 
 In August , Thetis was assigned to the fleet that was to break into the Gulf of Riga to support the German Army 's attempt to capture the city . On 8 August , the Germans made their first attempt to force the Irben Strait , during which Thetis and the torpedo boat SMS <unk> were damaged by mines . Thetis had to be towed back to Windau . The attack failed due to heavy Russian resistance , and the operation had to be postponed . 
 In 1917 , Thetis was rearmed with nine newer 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in U @-@ boat mountings ; in this configuration , Thetis was used as a gunnery training ship . She was one of six light cruisers Germany was permitted to retain by the Treaty of Versailles . She served in the newly reorganized Reichsmarine through the 1920s . In 1922 , the ship was assigned to the Reserve Squadron on the Baltic Station , along with the battleships Hessen and Schleswig @-@ Holstein and the cruiser Berlin . Thetis was stricken from the naval register on 27 March 1929 and sold to Blohm & Voss , along with the torpedo boats V1 and V6 for a total of 351 @,@ 000 Reichsmarks . She was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg . 
 = Commander ( song ) = 
 " Commander " is a song performed by American recording artist Kelly Rowland from her third studio album , Here I Am ( 2011 ) . It serves as the project 's international lead single and her debut release with Universal Motown . It was co @-@ written by American songwriter Rico Love , who described the song as a " fun and aggressive club record " with themes of female empowerment and lyrics with deliberate grammatical errors . French disc jockeys and producers David Guetta and Sandy Vee produced " Commander " with synthesized dance beats that blend R & B with electronica and house music . Rowland and Guetta had previously topped charts around the world with a similar dance production , " When Love Takes Over " , in 2009 . The song was premiered at the 2010 Winter Music Conference and subsequently garnered acclaim from contemporary critics for Rowland 's vocal performance as well as Guetta 's musical production . 
 Just over a month after release , it topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Chart and later peaked top ten in the UK and top twenty in Ireland and New Zealand . Entertainment Weekly named " Commander " the number @-@ one summer jam of 2010 and named by Fitness Magazine as one of The Top 100 Workout Songs of 2010 . The song was nominated at the International Dance Music Awards for Best R & B / Urban Dance Track . An accompanying music video was directed by Masashi Muto , and portrays Rowland facing herself in various dance @-@ off scenes . Promotion for the release included performing the song live on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge and The Graham Norton Show . The Extended Dance Mix , also produced by Guetta , was released alongside the main single worldwide , whereas the urban remix with American rapper Nelly was released in the United Kingdom and United States . 
 = = Background and context = = 
 In 2009 , before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for " When Love Takes Over " , the media reported that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement . However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly , Rowland stated the decision to leave was not hers : the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well . After the release of " When Love Takes Over " she would go on to fire Matthew Knowles . It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny 's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles . The media reported that Knowles ' decision to release one more video ( " Why Don 't You Love Me " ) from her album I Am ... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released " Commander " was unfair on Rowland . These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for " Why Don 't You Love Me " airing several days before " Commander " , the media was " making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn 't exist . " She also said , " we all came out at the same time and it really doesn 't matter ... I think there 's room for everybody ... There 's Bey [ oncé ] , there 's Ciara putting something out and [ Lady ] GaGa putting something out , but , because we started out together , people are going to say things like that . But I really don 't care , I love her ' til our dying days and that 's all that counts . "

 " Commander " is an electro @-@ house @-@ R & B song , set in a common time signature of 125 beats per minute . It was written by Kelly Rowland , Rico Love , David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as " there 's no other who do it like I do it " and " you won 't find no lady who does it like I does it " . The lyrics have themes around hair , fashion and competing with other women . Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats , which is similar to his other production , " Sexy Bitch " . The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip @-@ hop producer Timbaland . Rowland explained that the hook of the song , " Commander " , should be associated with dance instead of the military . " When I command you to dance ... I want you moving , you know ? It felt good to have a song that I could express that in . " 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 The Daily Star quoted Rowland on the theme of the song . She said " I hope to see women singing the song like they 're in charge . It 's important to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny . " Love explained to Rap @-@ Up magazine his view of the song , " It 's just such an aggressive record , it 's a club record , it 's a worldwide international record . She 's stretching her legs out and she 's showing her true vocal ability , she 's like the queen of the night on this record . " Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said " I feel like I 've finally come into my own , " a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound . " With the sound of dance music getting embraced more , I 'm very excited , seeing how fans have been responding to the music . Dance music is more of a European thing , but I 've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans ( in different parts of the country ) talking about playing ' Commander ' . " She said working with Guetta was " amazing " because it is " effortless " and she feels a great sense of " chemistry " when working with him . Rowland felt she was trying something different : " In this generation and this day and time , no one is putting soul in dance music ... no pop artist . I thought maybe that was something I could try . And then it works . " In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was " darker " than her previous material but still fun . " I just thought it 'd be so much fun to be a commander of course . It 's just a statement for me definitely , coming out on my own , filling my space . I 'm happy being a commander " . 
 = = Release = = 
 " Commander " was selected as the album 's first single . Rowland said there were initially two songs in the running for the lead single , but " without a doubt we had to go with [ ' Commander ' ] , I just fell in love with it ... It 's definitely a club banger . You know the first time I heard it , I went bananas . " At Pat Field 's Disco Party in New York , she told Universal Music Group executives " I know in my gut that it felt good . Nobody could take my thoughts away from that . I doesn 't need anyone else to tell me it 's good " . The song was released on May 17 and May 18 , to the iTunes Store , in France and the U.S. respectively . The official Extended Dance Remix was released alongside the main single on May 18 , 2010 . In the UK , " Commander " was planned for a June 28 , 2010 release . Love and Rowland would later unveil plans for an urban mix of the song with a slower , smoother sound . American rapper Nelly heard the new version in its early stages and asked if he could be featured on the remix . It was released as part of the UK Remixes <unk> as well as the second U.S. remixes EP . The official press from Universal Motown Records on May 19 , 2010 confirmed that " Commander " would serve only as the " international lead single " , leading to speculation another song would be released domestically . This speculation was confirmed when the Ne @-@ Yo @-@ penned , " Shake Them Haters Off " was set to impact on radio stations in the United States . However those plans were changed and on June 29 , 2010 two singles were serviced to impact in the United States . " Grown Woman " was sent to urban / rhythmic radio and " Rose Colored Glasses " for pop radio .

 The song was well received by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta . Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said " It looks as though they 're going to be ruling the airwaves all over again ... After she lulls us into a false sense of security ( " I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe ? / With the treble and the bass ? " ) , the track plunges into a pounding electro @-@ house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor ... The result isn 't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta 's recent output – Kelis ' ' Acapella ' , for example – but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer 's magic . " The site 's other reviewer , Nick Levine , agreed saying that the song " thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967 . " Robert Daw of Idolator said " if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go @-@ go boots off anytime soon , then you 'd best go lean against the wall , flower . Rowland 's Guetta @-@ produced new single ' Commander ' is pure strobe @-@ light adrenaline rush ...

With Alex <unk> of Paper saying " she belts out soaring vocals , is further proof that she 's no longer the cute teenage girl sharing a chorus . " 
 Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian said that before Guetta 's collaborations with Kelis ( " Acapella " ) and Rowland , she felt " [ David Guetta ] was ruining R & B by turning all of my favorite ladies into Euro <unk> " . However " Acapella " changed Nicholson 's mind and she said , " ' Commander ' is further evidence of this " . Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars , his review was neither positive nor negative . He said " Singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing ( and bossy ) they are . Even if the words have a double meaning , which hints that they are merely mouthing the self @-@ regard of a rampant egomaniac , who is laughing and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing , they don 't mind . Why would they ? The song mentions hair , and being better than the other ladies . That 's what singers live for . [ I awarded it ] one extra star for the <unk> grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus , which rules . " Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song , instead saying it will put her " firmly in control of the dance floor " . Entertainment Weekly named it " the number one summer jam of the year " whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24 , 2010 . A reviewer from the network said , " Commander is another smash [ where ] ... Kelly 's taking command ! With glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power ' Commander ' is proof that Kelly means business ! " In Fitness magazine 's 100 best workout songs , " Commander " was named one of the ten best dance workout songs for its bouncy 125 beats per minute composition .

 " Commander " made its U.S. chart debut on May 18 , 2010 ( the day of release ) at No. 36 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart ; it climbed the chart in subsequent weeks and peaked at the top position for one week in July . It also reached the top ten on the U.S. Hot Dance / Electronic Digital Songs chart , in the issue dated June 26 , 2010 . Jeremy Helligar of ' True / Slant ' offered an explanation of why the commercial prospects for " Commander " were limited in the United States , writing , " the dance music Rowland favors is a bit edgier than the danceable pop that Lady Gaga consistently takes to the top of the charts " . 
 In the United Kingdom , single and dance mixes were released as standalone downloads on May 17 , 2010 , whilst the song was added to urban music radio and UK 's biggest mainstream station , BBC Radio 1 's C @-@ playlist , that same week . Consequently " Commander " debuted on the UK Dance Singles chart at No. 34 . The following week the song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at No. 167 supported by the song 's ascension to the B @-@ playlists on the UK 's urban music radio station BBC 1Xtra as well as on mainstream radio . Then a week ahead of the remixes EP , " Commander " reached its peak at No. 2 on the UK Dance Chart and No. 9 on the Official Singles Chart as well as reaching the A @-@ playlist on urban radio . It peaked at No. 9 on the UK Download Chart and No. 19 on the ' UK Subscription Plays ' chart , the single was one of Rowland 's longest runs on the UK Top 40 with 16 weeks . The single became Rowland 's third best selling solo single in the UK with 285 @,@ 000 copies being sold as of November 2011 . 
 It made its Irish debut at No. 24 before peaking at No. 13 . It debuted in Australia on the Singles Chart at No. 64 and has since peaked at No. 61 . It fared better on the Australia Dance Chart , where it peaked at No. 11 . In New Zealand , the song debuted at No. 39 before falling out of the top forty the following week , only to return and peak at No. 16 . In Europe the song reached No. 2 on both the Belgium Wallonia and Flanders Ultratip Charts as well as on the Slovakian Airplay Charts . It reached the top twenty in Norway in addition to the top thirty in Denmark and Sweden .

 The video was filmed on May 5 , 2010 with Japanese music producer and promo director , Masashi Muto . Muto 's previous work includes " I Will Be Here " for Dutch disc jockey Tiësto , as well as promo clips for Pepsi and Honda . His work is known for its scale , impact and colorful imagery . Love and Guetta make cameos in the video while Fatima Robinson handled the video 's choreography . The Los Angeles Times was one of several media outlets present during the video shoot and were able to release exclusive " behind the scenes " footage on May 10 , 2010 . On June 1 , 2010 an unfinished version of the video was leaked online ; this was addressed on Rowland 's official Twitter account , where she made clear that leaked video was the wrong edit . UK music channels MTV and MTV Base began to play the early version of the video on June 8 , 2010 though , it was not until June 21 , 2010 when the official final version premiered on Rowland 's website .

 Rowland stated to Rap Up TV that " the concept of the video is very futuristic and great . The red line in the story is that I am above all the lead but in the club atmosphere with cool people . I fight against myself with my haircut , makeup , and dance moves . " According to Love , in the clip Rowland is transformed into a fashionista , " Kelly 's look in this video is just utterly sexy . It 's like a jungle feel . I feel like we 're in Avatar somewhere , running through the woods , minus the blue paint . " Later one of her outfits was described as an " Avatar @-@ esque bodysuit " . Rowland said " I had to pull out my dancing shoes for this video ! " The video features " Kelly Rowland facing off against herself . The two Kellys start what appears to be a voguing competition on the dancefloor , then are flanked by respective dance teams . " Guetta makes an appearance at the end of the clip he " undergoes a ' Transformers ' -like metamorphosis , turning into a mixer . " Paper magazine described Rowland 's look in the video as " superhero @-@ esque " . Joanna Goh from MSN China said that in the clip " [ Rowland ] sports a new femme fatale image a la the bodysuits and masculine imaging " .

 As of July 6 , 2010 and according to a press release from Universal Motown , the video has received critical acclaim with over two million Vevo views . When Robbie Daw of ' Idolator ' saw the unfinished version of the video compared it to the earlier works of Janet Jackson saying it had " old @-@ school Janet vibe " . Later after seeing the fully finished version he said it was " a colorful , militant dance @-@ off " . The theme , wardrobe , and choreography also drew comparisons to Janet Jackson 's " Feedback " video , with HitFix commenting " Rowland even has Janet 's singular and straight pony tail . " E ! Online 's Natalie Finn also had praise for the video . She said it " takes the themes of the song : taking charge , owning the floor and staying sexy and feminine throughout ... " and " dresses ' em in tight little outfits and turns ' em loose to break hearts and dominate the opposite sex at will . " " The music video is great and it might be a must @-@ spin " according to Martin from Above & Beyond magazine , who praised Rowland 's beauty by saying , " I didn 't know Kelly was that well @-@ equipped from the back but I always found Kelly more attractive than Beyoncé ... I 'm just saying " . 
 The video was criticized for the absence of story line by critics such as Laura Brooks of ' <unk> ' , who described the video as " [ an opportunity ] to show off her lovely hair and her thighs " that " also features David Guetta who appears to have remembered at several points throughout the video that he 's left his iron on dashes off to remedy the situation . " Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic agreed , calling the clip " dopey ... with guys who forgot to wash the home dye out of their hair " ( sic ) and the dancing was on @-@ par with sci @-@ fi film Matrix Reloaded . However she did say that " It 's a high @-@ concept understanding of the dance floor , even if it 's not my preferred interpretation of that space . If love and shaking it are war , Kelly seems like she 'd be a pretty decent person to have boss you around in both . " Meanwhile Sound Savvy said " There 's some nice moves and Kelly sports some sexy looks for the clip . ' Commander ' has received <unk> airplay and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this track . I kinda dig the video , but I would 've liked more choreography . "

 Rowland debuted " Commander " live at Cathy Guetta 's Fuck Me I 'm Famous party in Miami , as part of Winter Music Conference on March 27 , 2010 . Immediately after the performance she said , " I was nervous and anxious , but when I hit the stage I felt the inner ' Commander ' come to life ! " Then on May 4 , whilst playing a DJ set at a club in Frankfurt ( Germany ) , Guetta premiered his extended remix . Rowland performed " Commander " at KIIS FM 's Wango Tango 2010 Staples Centre ( Los Angeles ) on May 15 , 2010 . International promotion for the song began a week later with live UK debut of " Commander " at BBC Radio 1 's Big Weekend . This was followed up on June 15 with a live performance and interview on The Graham Norton Show and a medley performance on June 25 in Singapore . Rowland has subsequently appeared three more times in the UK on GMTV , an acoustic performance on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge ; as well as The 5 O 'Clock Show . " Commander " was performed in acoustic for a second time on Radio 2 's Saturday Sessions with Dermot O 'Leary . In August 2010 the Canadian dance show , So You Think You Can Dance Canada used the song for their season three promotion TV clips . The music was also used in the presentation of delegates and opening number of the live telecast of Miss Universe 2010 in Mandalay Bay , Las Vegas .

 = Jupiter = 
 Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System . It is a giant planet with a mass one @-@ thousandth that of the Sun , but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined . Jupiter is a gas giant , along with Saturn , with the other two giant planets , Uranus and Neptune , being ice giants . Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times . The Romans named it after their god Jupiter . When viewed from Earth , Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of − 2 @.@ 94 , bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows , and making it on average the third @-@ brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus . 
 Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium , though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules . It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements , but like the other giant planets , Jupiter lacks a well @-@ defined solid surface . Because of its rapid rotation , the planet 's shape is that of an oblate spheroid ( it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator ) . The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes , resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries . A prominent result is the Great Red Spot , a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope . Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere . Jupiter has at least 67 moons , including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 . Ganymede , the largest of these , has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury . 
 Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft , most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the Galileo orbiter . In late February 2007 , Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe , which used Jupiter 's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto . The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno , which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4 , 2016 . Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice @-@ covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa . 
 = = Formation and migration = = 
 Earth and its neighbor planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super @-@ Earths near the Sun . As Jupiter came toward the inner Solar System , in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis , gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing a series of collisions between the super @-@ Earths as their orbits began to overlap . 
 Astronomers have discovered nearly 500 planetary systems with multiple planets . Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several times greater than Earth 's ( super @-@ Earths ) , orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun , and sometimes also Jupiter @-@ mass gas giants close to their star . 
 Jupiter moving out of the inner Solar System would have allowed the formation of inner planets , including Earth . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter . It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System and hence its largest planet . It has a diameter of 142 @,@ 984 km ( 88 @,@ 846 mi ) at its equator . The average density of Jupiter , 1 @.@ 326 g / cm3 , is the second highest of the giant planets , but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Jupiter 's upper atmosphere is composed of about 88 – 92 % hydrogen and 8 – 12 % helium by percent volume of gas molecules . A helium atom has about four times as much mass as a hydrogen atom , so the composition changes when described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms . Thus , Jupiter 's atmosphere is approximately 75 % hydrogen and 24 % helium by mass , with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements . The interior contains denser materials , such that the distribution is roughly 71 % hydrogen , 24 % helium , and 5 % other elements by mass . The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane , water vapor , ammonia , and silicon @-@ based compounds . There are also traces of carbon , ethane , hydrogen sulfide , neon , oxygen , phosphine , and sulfur . The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia . Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements , trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found . 
 The atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the primordial solar nebula . Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass , which is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun . Helium is also depleted to about 80 % of the Sun 's helium composition . This depletion is a result of precipitation of these elements into the interior of the planet . 
 Based on spectroscopy , Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter , but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium . 
 = = = Mass and size = = = 
 Jupiter 's mass is 2 @.@ 5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined — this is so massive that its barycenter with the Sun lies above the Sun 's surface at 1 @.@ 068 solar radii from the Sun 's center . Jupiter is much larger than Earth and considerably less dense : its volume is that of about 1 @,@ 321 Earths , but it is only 318 times as massive . Jupiter 's radius is about 1 / 10 the radius of the Sun , and its mass is 0 @.@ 001 times the mass of the Sun , so the densities of the two bodies are similar . A " Jupiter mass " ( MJ or MJup ) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects , particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs . So , for example , the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0 @.@ 69 MJ , while Kappa Andromedae b has a mass of 12 @.@ 8 MJ . 
 Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had much more mass than it does at present , it would shrink . For small changes in mass , the radius would not change appreciably , and above about 500 M ⊕ ( 1 @.@ 6 Jupiter masses ) the interior would become so much more compressed under the increased pressure that its volume would decrease despite the increasing amount of matter . As a result , Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve . The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition is achieved as in high @-@ mass brown dwarfs having around 50 Jupiter masses . 
 Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times as massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star , the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter . Despite this , Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun ; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives . This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin – Helmholtz mechanism through contraction . This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2 cm each year . When it was first formed , Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter . 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 Jupiter is thought to consist of a dense core with a mixture of elements , a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen with some helium , and an outer layer predominantly of molecular hydrogen . Beyond this basic outline , there is still considerable uncertainty . The core is often described as rocky , but its detailed composition is unknown , as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths ( see below ) . In 1997 , the existence of the core was suggested by gravitational measurements , indicating a mass of from 12 to 45 times that of Earth , or roughly 4 % – 14 % of the total mass of Jupiter . The presence of a core during at least part of Jupiter 's history is suggested by models of planetary formation that require the formation of a rocky or icy core massive enough to collect its bulk of hydrogen and helium from the protosolar nebula . Assuming it did exist , it may have shrunk as convection currents of hot liquid metallic hydrogen mixed with the molten core and carried its contents to higher levels in the planetary interior . A core may now be entirely absent , as gravitational measurements are not yet precise enough to rule that possibility out entirely . 
 The uncertainty of the models is tied to the error margin in hitherto measured parameters : one of the rotational coefficients ( <unk> ) used to describe the planet 's gravitational moment , Jupiter 's equatorial radius , and its temperature at 1 bar pressure . The Juno mission , which arrived in July 2016 , is expected to further constrain the values of these parameters for better models of the core . 
 The core region is surrounded by dense metallic hydrogen , which extends outward to about 78 % of the radius of the planet . Rain @-@ like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer , depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere . 
 Above the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen . At this depth , the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen 's critical pressure of 1 @.@ <unk> MPa and critical temperature of only 32 @.@ 938 K. In this state , there are no distinct liquid and gas phases — hydrogen is said to be in a supercritical fluid state . It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1 @,@ 000 km , and as liquid in deeper layers . Physically , there is no clear boundary — the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends . 
 The temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily toward the core , due to the Kelvin – Helmholtz mechanism . At the " surface " pressure level of 10 bars , the temperature is around 340 K ( 67 ° C ; 152 ° F ) . At the phase transition region where hydrogen — heated beyond its critical point — becomes metallic , it is calculated the temperature is 10 @,@ 000 K ( 9 @,@ 700 ° C ; 17 @,@ 500 ° F ) and the pressure is 200 GPa . The temperature at the core boundary is estimated to be 36 @,@ 000 K ( 35 @,@ 700 ° C ; 64 @,@ 300 ° F ) and the interior pressure is roughly 3 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 500 GPa . 
 = = = Atmosphere = = = 
 Jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System , spanning over 5 @,@ 000 km ( 3 @,@ 000 mi ) in altitude . Because Jupiter has no surface , the base of its atmosphere is usually considered to be the point at which atmospheric pressure is equal to 100 kPa ( 1 @.@ 0 bar ) . 
 = = = = Cloud layers = = = = 
 Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide . The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes , known as tropical regions . These are sub @-@ divided into lighter @-@ hued zones and darker belts . The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence . Wind speeds of 100 m / s ( 360 km / h ) are common in zonal jets . The zones have been observed to vary in width , color and intensity from year to year , but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations . 
 The cloud layer is only about 50 km ( 31 mi ) deep , and consists of at least two decks of clouds : a thick lower deck and a thin clearer region . There may also be a thin layer of water clouds underlying the ammonia layer , as evidenced by flashes of lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter . This is caused by water 's polarity , which makes it capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning . These electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on Earth . The water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior . 
 The orange and brown coloration in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun . The exact makeup remains uncertain , but the substances are thought to be phosphorus , sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons . These colorful compounds , known as <unk> , mix with the warmer , lower deck of clouds . The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view . 
 Jupiter 's low axial tilt means that the poles constantly receive less solar radiation than at the planet 's equatorial region . Convection within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles , balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer . 
 = = = = Great Red Spot and other vortices = = = = 
 The best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot , a persistent anticyclonic storm that is larger than Earth , located 22 ° south of the equator . It is known to have been in existence since at least 1831 , and possibly since 1665 . Images by the Hubble Space Telescope have shown as many as two " red spots " adjacent to the Great Red Spot . The storm is large enough to be visible through Earth @-@ based telescopes with an aperture of 12 cm or larger . Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and may be a permanent feature of the planet . 
 The oval object rotates counterclockwise , with a period of about six days . The Great Red Spot 's dimensions are 24 – 40 @,@ 000 km × 12 – 14 @,@ 000 km . It is large enough to contain two or three planets of Earth 's diameter . The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8 km ( 5 mi ) above the surrounding cloudtops . 
 Storms such as this are common within the turbulent atmospheres of giant planets . Jupiter also has white ovals and brown ovals , which are lesser unnamed storms . White ovals tend to consist of relatively cool clouds within the upper atmosphere . Brown ovals are warmer and located within the " normal cloud layer " . Such storms can last as little as a few hours or stretch on for centuries . 
 Even before Voyager proved that the feature was a storm , there was strong evidence that the spot could not be associated with any deeper feature on the planet 's surface , as the Spot rotates differentially with respect to the rest of the atmosphere , sometimes faster and sometimes more slowly . 
 In 2000 , an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot , but smaller . This was created when several smaller , white oval @-@ shaped storms merged to form a single feature — these three smaller white ovals were first observed in 1938 . The merged feature was named Oval BA , and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior . It has since increased in intensity and changed color from white to red . 
 = = = Magnetosphere = = = 
 Jupiter 's magnetic field is fourteen times as strong as that of Earth , ranging from 4 @.@ 2 gauss ( 0 @.@ 42 mT ) at the equator to 10 – 14 gauss ( 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 4 mT ) at the poles , making it the strongest in the Solar System ( except for sunspots ) . This field is thought to be generated by eddy currents — swirling movements of conducting materials — within the liquid metallic hydrogen core . The volcanoes on the moon Io emit large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moon 's orbit . The gas is ionized in the magnetosphere producing sulfur and oxygen ions . They , together with hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter , form a plasma sheet in Jupiter 's equatorial plane . The plasma in the sheet co @-@ rotates with the planet causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of magnetodisk . Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature that produces bursts in the range of 0 @.@ 6 – 30 MHz . 
 At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet , the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock . Surrounding Jupiter 's magnetosphere is a magnetopause , located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath — a region between it and the bow shock . The solar wind interacts with these regions , elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter 's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn . The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere , which protects them from the solar wind . 
 The magnetosphere of Jupiter is responsible for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet 's polar regions . Volcanic activity on Jupiter 's moon Io ( see below ) injects gas into Jupiter 's magnetosphere , producing a torus of particles about the planet . As Io moves through this torus , the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter . As a result , radio waves are generated through a cyclotron maser mechanism , and the energy is transmitted out along a cone @-@ shaped surface . When Earth intersects this cone , the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 Jupiter is the only planet whose barycenter with the Sun lies outside the volume of the Sun , though by only 7 % of the Sun 's radius . The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million km ( about 5 @.@ 2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun , or 5 @.@ 2 AU ) and it completes an orbit every 11 @.@ 86 years . This is two @-@ fifths the orbital period of Saturn , forming a 5 : 2 orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System . The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1 @.@ 31 ° compared to Earth . Because of an eccentricity its orbit of 0 @.@ 048 , Jupiter 's distance from the Sun varies by 75 million km between its nearest approach ( perihelion ) and furthest distance ( aphelion ) . 
 The axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small : only 3 @.@ 13 ° . As a result , it does not experience significant seasonal changes , in contrast to , for example , Earth and Mars . 
 Jupiter 's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System 's planets , completing a rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours ; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through an Earth @-@ based amateur telescope . The planet is shaped as an oblate spheroid , meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles . On Jupiter , the equatorial diameter is 9 @,@ 275 km ( 5 @,@ 763 mi ) longer than the diameter measured through the poles . 
 Because Jupiter is not a solid body , its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation . The rotation of Jupiter 's polar atmosphere is about 5 minutes longer than that of the equatorial atmosphere ; three systems are used as frames of reference , particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features . System I applies from the latitudes 10 ° N to 10 ° S ; its period is the planet 's shortest , at 9h 50m <unk> System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these ; its period is 9h 55m <unk> System III was first defined by radio astronomers , and corresponds to the rotation of the planet 's magnetosphere ; its period is Jupiter 's official rotation . 
 = = Observation = = 
 Jupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in the sky ( after the Sun , the Moon and Venus ) ; at times Mars appears brighter than Jupiter . Depending on Jupiter 's position with respect to the Earth , it can vary in visual magnitude from as bright as − 2 @.@ 9 at opposition down to − 1 @.@ 6 during conjunction with the Sun . The angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies from 50 @.@ 1 to 29 @.@ 8 arc seconds . Favorable oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through perihelion , an event that occurs once per orbit . 
 Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398 @.@ 9 days as it orbits the Sun , a duration called the synodic period . As it does so , Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion with respect to the background stars . That is , for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky , performing a looping motion . 
 Because the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth , the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11 @.@ 5 ° . That is , the planet always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth @-@ based telescopes . It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained . A small telescope will usually show Jupiter 's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter 's atmosphere . A large telescope will show Jupiter 's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth .

 The observation of Jupiter dates back to the Babylonian astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC . The ancient Chinese referred to Jupiter as " the Year Star " ( Sui @-@ xing <unk> ) , and by the 4th century BC had divided the sky into twelve zodiacal regions , with Jupiter passing through one each year . The Chinese historian Xi <unk> has claimed that Gan De , an ancient Chinese astronomer , discovered one of Jupiter 's moons in 362 BC with the unaided eye . If accurate , this would predate Galileo 's discovery by nearly two millennia . In his 2nd century work the Almagest , the Hellenistic astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus constructed a geocentric planetary model based on deferents and epicycles to explain Jupiter 's motion relative to Earth , giving its orbital period around Earth as 4332 @.@ 38 days , or 11 @.@ 86 years . In 499 , Aryabhata , a mathematician – astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and astronomy , also used a geocentric model to estimate Jupiter 's period as 4332 @.@ <unk> days , or 11 @.@ 86 years .

 In 1610 , Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter ( now known as the Galilean moons ) using a telescope ; thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth 's . One day after Galileo , Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter , though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614 . It was Marius 's names for the four major moons , however , that stuck — Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto . These findings were also the first discovery of celestial motion not apparently centered on Earth . The discovery was a major point in favor of Copernicus ' heliocentric theory of the motions of the planets ; Galileo 's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the Inquisition . 
 During the 1660s , Giovanni Cassini used a new telescope to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and observed that the planet appeared oblate ; that is , flattened at the poles . He was also able to estimate the rotation period of the planet . In 1690 Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation . 
 The Great Red Spot , a prominent oval @-@ shaped feature in the southern hemisphere of Jupiter , may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini , although this is disputed . The pharmacist Heinrich Schwabe produced the earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831 . 
 The Red Spot was reportedly lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878 . It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century . 
 Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of Jupiter 's moons , allowing predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet . By the 1670s , it was observed that when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth , these events would occur about 17 minutes later than expected . Ole Rømer deduced that sight is not instantaneous ( a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected ) , and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light . 
 In 1892 , E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36 @-@ inch ( 910 mm ) refractor at Lick Observatory in California . The discovery of this relatively small object , a testament to his keen eyesight , quickly made him famous . This moon was later named Amalthea . It was the last planetary moon to be discovered directly by visual observation . 
 In 1932 , Rupert Wildt identified absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of Jupiter . 
 Three long @-@ lived anticyclonic features termed white ovals were observed in 1938 . For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere , sometimes approaching each other but never merging . Finally , two of the ovals merged in 1998 , then absorbed the third in 2000 , becoming Oval BA . 
 = = = <unk> research = = = 
 In 1955 , Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin detected bursts of radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22 @.@ 2 MHz . The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet , and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate . Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms : long bursts ( or L @-@ bursts ) lasting up to several seconds , and short bursts ( or S @-@ bursts ) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second . 
 Scientists discovered that there were three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter . 
 <unk> radio bursts ( with a wavelength of tens of meters ) vary with the rotation of Jupiter , and are influenced by interaction of Io with Jupiter 's magnetic field . 
 <unk> radio emission ( with wavelengths measured in centimeters ) was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein <unk> in 1959 . The origin of this signal was from a torus @-@ shaped belt around Jupiter 's equator . This signal is caused by cyclotron radiation from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter 's magnetic field . 
 Thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere of Jupiter . 
 = = = Exploration = = = 
 Since 1973 a number of automated spacecraft have visited Jupiter , most notably the Pioneer 10 space probe , the first spacecraft to get close enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the Solar System 's largest planet . Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy , which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft , or delta @-@ v. Entering a Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter from low Earth orbit requires a delta @-@ v of 6 @.@ 3 km / s which is comparable to the 9 @.@ 7 km / s delta @-@ v needed to reach low Earth orbit . Fortunately , gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter , albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration . 
 = = = = Flyby missions = = = = 
 Beginning in 1973 , several spacecraft have performed planetary flyby maneuvers that brought them within observation range of Jupiter . The Pioneer missions obtained the first close @-@ up images of Jupiter 's atmosphere and several of its moons . They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected , but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment . The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system . Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter 's diameter and the amount of polar flattening . 
 Six years later , the Voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter 's rings . They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic . Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions , turning from orange to dark brown . A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io 's orbital path , and volcanoes were found on the moon 's surface , some in the process of erupting . As the spacecraft passed behind the planet , it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere . 
 The next mission to encounter Jupiter was the Ulysses solar probe . It performed a flyby maneuver to attain a polar orbit around the Sun . During this pass , the spacecraft conducted studies on Jupiter 's magnetosphere . Ulysses has no cameras so no images were taken . A second flyby six years later was at a much greater distance . 
 In 2000 , the Cassini probe flew by Jupiter en route to Saturn , and provided some of the highest @-@ resolution images ever made of the planet . 
 The New Horizons probe flew by Jupiter for gravity assist en route to Pluto . Its closest approach was on February 28 , 2007 . The probe 's cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail , as well as making long @-@ distance observations of the outer moons Himalia and Elara . Imaging of the Jovian system began September 4 , 2006 . 
 = = = = Galileo mission = = = = 
 The first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo probe , which entered orbit on December 7 , 1995 . It orbited the planet for over seven years , conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and Amalthea . The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 , giving a unique vantage point for the event . Its originally designed capacity was limited by the failed deployment of its high @-@ gain radio antenna , although extensive information was still gained about the Jovian system from Galileo . 
 A 340 @-@ kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995 , entering Jupiter 's atmosphere on December 7 . It parachuted through 150 km ( 93 mi ) of the atmosphere at a speed of about 2 @,@ 575 km / h ( 1600 mph ) and collected data for 57 @.@ 6 minutes before it was crushed by the pressure of about 23 atmospheres at a temperature of 153 ° C. It melted thereafter , and possibly vaporized . The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21 , 2003 at a speed of over 50 km / s to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating Europa , a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of harboring life . 
 Data from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90 % of Jupiter 's atmosphere . The recorded temperature was more than 300 ° C ( > 570 ° F ) and the windspeed measured more than 644 km / h ( > 400 mph ) before the probes vapourised .

 = = = = Canceled missions = = = = 
 There has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail because of the possibility of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter 's moons Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto . Funding difficulties have delayed progress . NASA 's JIMO ( Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter ) was cancelled in 2005 . A subsequent proposal was developed for a joint NASA / ESA mission called EJSM / Laplace , with a provisional launch date around 2020 . EJSM / Laplace would have consisted of the NASA @-@ led Jupiter Europa Orbiter and the ESA @-@ led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter . However , ESA had formally ended the partnership by April 2011 , citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the mission timetable . Instead , ESA planned to go ahead with a European @-@ only mission to compete in its L1 Cosmic Vision selection . 
 = = Moons = = 
 Jupiter has 67 natural satellites . Of these , 51 are less than 10 kilometres in diameter and have only been discovered since 1975 . The four largest moons , visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night , known as the " Galilean moons " , are Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto . 
 = = = Galilean moons = = = 
 The moons discovered by Galileo — Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto — are among the largest satellites in the Solar System . The orbits of three of them ( Io , Europa , and Ganymede ) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance ; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter , Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one . This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes , because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the same point in every orbit it makes . The tidal force from Jupiter , on the other hand , works to circularize their orbits . 
 The eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons ' shapes , with Jupiter 's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away . This tidal flexing heats the moons ' interiors by friction . This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io ( which is subject to the strongest tidal forces ) , and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa 's surface ( indicating recent resurfacing of the moon 's exterior ) . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Before the discoveries of the Voyager missions , Jupiter 's moons were arranged neatly into four groups of four , based on commonality of their orbital elements . Since then , the large number of new small outer moons has complicated this picture . There are now thought to be six main groups , although some are more distinct than others . 
 A basic sub @-@ division is a grouping of the eight inner regular moons , which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter 's equator and are thought to have formed with Jupiter . The remainder of the moons consist of an unknown number of small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits , which are thought to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids . Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin , perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up . 
 = = = Planetary rings = = = 
 Jupiter has a faint planetary ring system composed of three main segments : an inner torus of particles known as the halo , a relatively bright main ring , and an outer gossamer ring . These rings appear to be made of dust , rather than ice as with Saturn 's rings . The main ring is probably made of material ejected from the satellites Adrastea and Metis . Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence . The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts . In a similar way , the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring . There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea 's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon . 
 = = Interaction with the Solar System = = 
 Along with the Sun , the gravitational influence of Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System . The orbits of most of the system 's planets lie closer to Jupiter 's orbital plane than the Sun 's equatorial plane ( Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun 's equator in orbital tilt ) , the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter , and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System 's history . 
 Along with its moons , Jupiter 's gravitational field controls numerous asteroids that have settled into the regions of the Lagrangian points preceding and following Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun . These are known as the Trojan asteroids , and are divided into Greek and Trojan " camps " to commemorate the Iliad . The first of these , 588 Achilles , was discovered by Max Wolf in 1906 ; since then more than two thousand have been discovered . The largest is 624 Hektor . 
 Most short @-@ period comets belong to the Jupiter family — defined as comets with semi @-@ major axes smaller than Jupiter 's . Jupiter family comets are thought to form in the Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune . During close encounters with Jupiter their orbits are perturbed into a smaller period and then circularized by regular gravitational interaction with the Sun and Jupiter . 
 = = = Impacts = = = 
 Jupiter has been called the Solar System 's vacuum cleaner , because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner Solar System . It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System 's planets . It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment . However , recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass through the inner Solar System , as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them . This topic remains controversial among scientists , as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud . Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth . 
 A 1997 survey of historical astronomical drawings suggested that Cassini may have recorded an impact scar in 1690 . The survey produced eight other candidate observations between 1664 and 1839 , but they had low or no possibility of being the result of an impact . 
 More recent discoveries include the following : 
 A fireball was photographed by Voyager 1 during its Jupiter encounter in March 1979 . 
 During the period July 16 , 1994 , to July 22 , 1994 , over 20 fragments from the comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 ( SL9 , formally designated D / 1993 F2 ) collided with Jupiter 's southern hemisphere , providing the first direct observation of a collision between two Solar System objects . This impact provided useful data on the composition of Jupiter 's atmosphere . 
 On July 19 , 2009 , an impact site was discovered at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2 . This impact left behind a black spot in Jupiter 's atmosphere , similar in size to Oval BA . Infrared observation showed a bright spot where the impact took place , meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter 's south pole . 
 A fireball , smaller than the previous observed impacts , was detected on June 3 , 2010 , by Anthony Wesley , an amateur astronomer in Australia , and was later discovered to have been captured on video by another amateur astronomer in the Philippines . 
 Yet another fireball was seen on August 20 , 2010 . 
 On September 10 , 2012 , another fireball was detected . 
 March 17 , 2016 an asteroid or comet struck and was filmed on video . 
 = = Possibility of life = = 
 In 1953 , the Miller – Urey experiment demonstrated that a combination of lightning and the chemical compounds that existed in the atmosphere of a primordial Earth could form organic compounds ( including amino acids ) that could serve as the building blocks of life . The simulated atmosphere included water , methane , ammonia , and molecular hydrogen , all molecules still found in Jupiter 's atmosphere . Jupiter 's atmosphere has a strong vertical air circulation , which would carry these compounds down into the lower regions . The higher temperatures within the interior of the atmosphere would break down these chemicals , hindering the formation of Earth @-@ like life . 
 It is considered highly unlikely that there is any Earth @-@ like life on Jupiter , because there is only a small amount of water in Jupiter 's atmosphere and any possible solid surface deep within Jupiter would be under extreme pressures . Still , it has been hypothesized that <unk> or water @-@ based life could evolve in Jupiter 's upper atmosphere . The possible presence of underground oceans on some of Jupiter 's moons has led to speculation that the presence of life is more likely there . 
 = = Mythology = = 
 The planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times . It is visible to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low . To the Babylonians , this object represented their god Marduk . They used Jupiter 's roughly 12 @-@ year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac . 
 The Romans named it after Jupiter ( Latin : <unk> , <unk> ) ( also called Jove ) , the principal god of Roman mythology , whose name comes from the Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European vocative compound * <unk> @-@ <unk> ( nominative : * <unk> @-@ <unk> , meaning " Father Sky @-@ God " , or " Father Day @-@ God " ) . In turn , Jupiter was the counterpart to the mythical Greek Zeus ( <unk> ) , also referred to as Dias ( <unk> ) , the planetary name of which is retained in modern Greek . 
 The astronomical symbol for the planet , , is a stylized representation of the god 's lightning bolt . The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root <unk> , used to form some Jupiter @-@ related words , such as <unk> . 
 Jovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter . The older adjectival form jovial , employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages , has come to mean " happy " or " merry " , moods ascribed to Jupiter 's astrological influence . 
 The Chinese , Koreans and Japanese called it the " wood star " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , based on the Chinese Five Elements . Chinese Taoism personified it as the Fu star . The Greeks called it <unk> , Phaethon , " blazing " . In Vedic astrology , Hindu astrologers named the planet after Brihaspati , the religious teacher of the gods , and often called it " Guru " , which literally means the " Heavy One " . 
 In Germanic mythology , Jupiter is equated to Thor , whence the English name Thursday for the Roman dies Jovis . 
 In the Central Asian @-@ Turkic myths , Jupiter is called <unk> or <unk> , from <unk> ( of uncertain meaning ) and <unk> ( " star " ) . There are many theories about the meaning of <unk> . These peoples calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days . They believed that some social and natural events connected to <unk> 's movements on the sky . 
 = Breton horse = 
 The Breton is a breed of draft horse . It was developed in Brittany , a province in northwest France , from native ancestral stock dating back thousands of years . The Breton was created through the crossbreeding of many different European and Oriental breeds . In 1909 , a stud book was created , and in 1951 it was officially closed . The breed is often chestnut in color , and is strong and muscular . There are three distinct subtypes of the Breton , each coming from a different area of Brittany . The Corlay Breton is the smallest type , and is generally used for light draft and under saddle work . The Postier Breton is used for harness and light farm work . The Heavy Draft Breton is the largest subtype , and is generally used for the hardest draft work . This horse breed has been used in military , draft and agricultural capacities . It also has been used to improve and create many other draft breeds , and to produce mules . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Breton horses are usually about 1 @.@ 58 metres ( 15 @.@ 2 hands ) tall , but may range from 1 @.@ 55 to 1 @.@ 63 m ( 15 @.@ 1 to 16 @.@ 0 hands ) , depending on type . They usually have a chestnut coat , often with a flaxen mane and tail , but can also be bay , grey , or red or blue roan . Bretons have a well @-@ proportioned head of medium volume with a straight profile and a strong , short neck well @-@ set into muscular withers . The shoulder is long and sloping , the chest broad and muscular , the back short and wide , and the croup sloping . The legs are well @-@ feathered , short but powerful , with broad joints and well @-@ formed hooves . 
 = = = Subcategories = = = 
 There are several subtypes of the Breton breed . Two , the Trait Breton and the Postier Breton , are officially recognised , while others such as the <unk> or Cheval de Corlay and the Centre @-@ montagne or Central Mountain Breton are not . Older types that have disappeared include the Grand Breton and the Bidet Breton or Bidet d <unk> . 
 The Corlay Breton is derived from crossbreeding native stock with the Arabian and Thoroughbred , and is considered the real descendant of the original Breton . It has the same general features as the draft type but is smaller with a more dished face . It was used mainly for light draft work that required speed and under saddle , and its numbers have been decreasing in recent years . The type is also known as the Cheval de Corlay , and is now extremely rare . It was also used in local races because of its speed , which it inherited from its Arabian and Thoroughbred ancestors . 
 Postier Bretons were developed as a result of crossbreeding with the Norfolk Trotter and the Hackney during the 19th century . This type is bred mainly in central Brittany , has a very attractive gait , is a good coach horse , and capable of light farming work . Its name originates from its use in pulling mail coaches . The Postier was used extensively by the French Horse Artillery , and it has been described as a lighter version of the Suffolk Punch draft breed from Great Britain . 
 The Heavy Draft Breton is derived from an infusion of Ardennes and Percheron blood . It is very strong relative to its size and has short but muscular legs . It is bred in the northern coastal area of Brittany , in <unk> . This type has absorbed another , older type , called the Grand Breton , a heavier horse that was used to improve many other draft breeds . The Centre @-@ montagne or Central Mountain Breton is a smaller draft type . 
 = = Breed history = = 
 Bretons were originally bred for great strength and durability . Horses have been present in the Breton mountains for thousands of years , but nobody knows how they first arrived . One theory is that they were brought to Europe during the Aryan migration from Asia over 4 @,@ 000 years ago , while another school of thought has them descending from horses bred by Celtic warriors before their conquest of Great Britain . 
 The original ancestors of the Breton were a population of horses that that lived in the Breton mountains , possibly descended from steppe horses ridden by Celts . During the Crusades , these mountain horses were crossed with oriental horses to create a type known as the Bidet Breton . In the Middle Ages , the ancestral Breton horse was sought by military leaders , partly because of its comfortable gait , which was said to be partway between a brisk trot and an amble . Due to its gaits and the fact that it only stood about 1 @.@ 40 m ( 13 @.@ 3 hands ) high , it was nicknamed the Bidet d <unk> or Bidet Breton . Horses of other bloodlines brought back to Europe during the Crusades had a strong influence on the Breton , and two types subsequently developed . The <unk> was the common , heavier type , used mainly as a pack horse and for farm and draft work . From the <unk> , the Roussin was developed , was used mainly in wars and on long journeys . The Roussin 's natural ambling gait made it popular as a lighter riding horse . 
 The breed retained its mountain roots with its main stud , the National Provincial Stud , being located in the mountain country of <unk> . It was at this time that Arabian and Thoroughbred blood was added to the breed , creating the Corlay subtype . From the Middle Ages until the early 1900s , the Breton was crossed with various horses , both native and foreign , including the Boulonnais , Percheron and Ardennes breeds . In the 19th century it was crossbred with the Norfolk Trotter , which resulted in a lighter weight type of Breton , the Postier subtype . Today , the Breton breed is controlled by the Syndicat des Éleveurs de Cheval Breton , an organization dating its studbook to 1909 when it was created , with separate books for the Heavy Draft and Postier types . In 1912 , the books were combined but separate sections were used for each type , and in 1926 the sections were combined so that all types of Bretons are now registered together . Postier Bretons must be of documented <unk> bloodstock and pass in @-@ harness performance tests . In 1920 , the decision was made to permit no new outside blood into the studbook , and in 1951 the studbook was officially closed to outside horses . Breton horses are only eligible to be registered if they were foaled in the present @-@ day region of Brittany or in the Loire @-@ Atlantique department , formerly part of Brittany . Registered foals are branded with a " cross surmounting a splayed , upturned V " on the left side of the neck . Despite the registration restrictions , breeding of the Breton horse has spread across France , and around the world . Today in France , the Breton is bred mainly at studs in <unk> , <unk> , and parts of La Roche @-@ sur @-@ Yon . 
 = = = Crossbreeding = = = 
 For a time , there was a trend to increase the size of draft horse breeds to gain more power and bulk through crossbreeding . However , due to its endurance and gaits , the Breton was an exception . Crossbreeding was shown to reduce the breed 's unique qualities , and so in the 1930s , infusions of other blood were abandoned , and this decision led to the preservation of the breed 's purity . 
 Therefore , rather than being subject to crossbreeding itself , the Breton has instead been used to improve many other breeds . Buyers come to France from all over the world to buy Bretons for use in improving their native draft horses . The Breton had a significant influence on the Canadian Horse , after members of the breed were sent to New France ( Canada ) during the 17th century . They have also been used to create the Swiss Freiberger , as well as other heavy draft breeds . Bretons were used in India to produce mules , and at the Saharanpur breeding farm were crossed with the Anglo @-@ Arabian stallion Mystère to produce carriage horses . In the 19th and early 20th centuries , Italian farmers attempted to use the Brabant to improve local stock , but the offspring proved to be too heavy and slow for the lighter , more general draft work required . In the 1930s , the Hispano @-@ <unk> breed was developed in Spain by crossing imported Breton stallions with local mares . Today , the breed population is small , but has been noted by researchers for its rich genetic diversity . After World War II , a Breton stallion was used to improve the Schleswig breed of Germany . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Breton is used in many capacities , due to the various sub @-@ types of the breed . Smaller types can be used under saddle and for fast , light draft work , while larger types are ideal for heavy draft and agricultural work . They are also commonly used to improve other breeds through crossbreeding . Today , the breed is used as a draft horse on small farms , and is also used to gather seaweed . It is also bred for meat production ; horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries , including France , Belgium , Germany and Switzerland .

 On 6 December 2006 , Ao was arrested for allegedly taking bribes and having engaged in irregular financial activities . The Macau Commission Against Corruption ( CAC ) alleged that between 2002 and 2006 Ao received MOP 187 million in bribes from three real estate and construction companies , two from Macau and one from the mainland , in return for which Ao had allegedly offered preference in 20 government works projects . Ao allegedly had assets not commensurate with his earnings : Ao and his wife earned 14 million patacas from their official posts between 2000 and 2006 , yet had accumulated assets totalling 804 million patacas ( US $ 100m ) , equivalent to 57 times their earnings . Ao was charged with 76 counts , including corruption , bribe @-@ taking , money laundering and abuse of power . 
 According to Article 50 of the Basic Law of Macau , the removal of ministers would require Central Government approval . Citing " irrefutable evidence " of improper behaviour , Chief Executive Edmund Ho asked Beijing to remove Ao from office . 
 = = First trial = = 
 Ao Man @-@ long stood trial in Macau on 5 November 2007 , facing 30 years in prison . Given Ao 's status of Government Secretary ( equivalent to Minister ) , he was tried directly in the Court of Final Appeal of the Macau SAR . Over one hundred witnesses were called to testify . 
 Although it was an open trial , the 500 @-@ page indictment was not made public . Media representatives petitioned for its release , but it was denied by judge <unk> Manuel Pinheiro de Lima , who said it would affect witnesses ' thoughts and testimony . The prosecution charged Ao with having received millions of dollars in kickbacks for contracts , including those for the dome constructed for the 2005 East Asian Games , the Venetian and the Galaxy <unk> Hotel , from Ho Meng @-@ fai , Chairman of San Meng Fai Engineering and Construction Company . 
 Anti @-@ corruption officers were aided unwittingly by Ao , who kept details of every illegal transaction and the kickbacks he received in a notebook . Ho Meng @-@ fai – who had jumped bail – confessed in statements given to the CAC and the procurator 's office that Ao offered to recommend his company to foreign investors in exchange for 2 to 3 percent of the winning tenders . Ho said between 2004 and 2006 , he paid Ao about HK $ 140 million in kickbacks , for private projects only . During the trial , 7 witnesses , including Ho , went missing . 
 Ao allegedly set up shell companies a network of secret bank accounts in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands with the help of friends and family members to launder bribe money . Ao 's father Ao Veng @-@ <unk> , brother Ao Man @-@ fu , and sister @-@ in @-@ law Ao Chan Va @-@ <unk> were charged with setting up overseas bank accounts and shell companies for Ao Man @-@ long to handle kickbacks . The total deposits in more than a dozen Hong Kong bank accounts under his father 's name exceeded HK $ 157 million as of December 2006 .

 On 30 January 2008 , Ao was found guilty on 40 counts of bribe @-@ taking , 13 counts of money laundering , two counts of abuse of power , one count of incorrect declaration of assets and one count of holding assets from unknown sources ; Ao was sentenced to 27 years in prison . About MOP 252 million of his assets in Macau were seized . Ao decided not to appeal . There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall @-@ guy , as most <unk> were sceptical that corruption on such a scale could take place without anyone else knowing or being involved . During his trial , Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million <unk> required the approval of his superior in government , Edmond Ho . 
 In a separate trial , his wife was sentenced in absentia to 23 years in jail for her role in laundering money . Ao 's four family members , each accused of six to 14 counts of money laundering activities , were also jailed for between 10 and 18 years . Ao 's wife is believed to have absconded to the United Kingdom . Macau authorities were co @-@ operating with the <unk> in Hong Kong to retrieve an estimated HK $ 637 million ( US $ 81 @.@ 7 million ) , which was reportedly deposited in 39 Hong Kong bank accounts in Ao 's name and 92 overseas bank accounts opened in the name of his relative @-@ accomplices .

 Independiente is the first album Arjona released as an independent artist , and through his own record label , Metamorfosis , a company he created to refocus his career . Presided by Arjona and some friends , Metamorfosis is based in Miami and Mexico City , and also includes the photographer and director Ricardo Calderón , Universal Music México 's executive Humberto Calderon and BMG 's Miriam Sommerz . Although the album is marketed with the new label , distribution was handled by Warner Music . Arjona commented many times , that he considered the way he decided to go independent raised more compromise than freedom , saying that " Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administrate , in the best way possible , such independence . " 
 Independiente was composed and written within one year , and marks the fourth time Arjona had collaborated with Tommy Torres , who had helped writing , composing , producing and providing backing vocals . The other three albums in which the two artists had worked together are Quién Dijo Ayer , in which Torres helped producing the singles " Quién " and " Quiero " , and offering additional work on the new versions of Arjona 's hits ; 5to Piso , and Adentro , respectively . Also , in the album , Arjona returned to his classic and trademark sound , which Torres has helped crafting it since six years now , after the drastic change he made in Poquita Ropa . On that album , the artist made use of the fewest instruments possible , simplifying his sound , and introducing what he called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " of his music . 
 Weeks before the release of Independiente , Arjona issued a letter in which he talked about his past relations with recording companies . In the letter , he revealed that he entered in his first record label as an exchange , commenting that " a producer , friend of mine , told them [ the record label ] that if they don 't sign me they won 't sign two artists he had [ at that time ] " , and that he received the " minimum royalty percentage " out from his most successful albums . Billboard notes that although other groups have decided to launch independently their works after having a contract with major record labels , Arjona is by far the most important artist in the Latin pop to follow this trend .

 Ricardo Arjona released on 9 February 2012 the music video for " Fuiste Tú " . Filmed in December 2011 , the clip was directed by Joaquín Cambré , was shot in Guatemala , and features several tropical locations from the country , including Antigua Guatemala , Río Dulce , the Atitlán lake , <unk> <unk> and the Tikal ruins . Some of those locations belong to the Sololá , and the singer revealed that he chose to film the video there because he wanted to " show the real situation of that department " , which is one of the poorest in the country , although being visited yearly by thousands of tourists . About the concept of the video , Arjona commented that " it recreates the battle on a couple when someone starts to say ' is the beginning of the end ' . When there is something you don 't like from your beloved one , there 's two options : The first , hold on to the relationship . The second , go away . Sadly , there 's a third one that is created by those who are unsure and that is when , on the <unk> moments , they use a recurrent phrase : It was you . " 
 The clip starts showing Gaby Moreno playing a melody in a guitar while staying close to a window , watching the people walk on the street below . Meanwhile , scenes of all the places featured on the video are interpolated . Just as the song begins , Arjona is shown leaving the Tikal ruins on an orange Jeep , as well as images of Moreno singing in front of a piano . Then , as Arjona abandons the Jeep and goes as a passenger on another vehicle , Moreno is shown singing inside a house , close to another Jeep similar to that of Arjona 's . Finally , Arjona reaches the town on which Moreno has been waiting for him , just to find that she is gone to where he has been before , on the Tikal ruins . As of February 2016 , the video has received over 290 million views on YouTube .

 = Mohini = 
 Mohini ( <unk> : <unk> , <unk> ) is the only female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu . She is portrayed as a femme fatale , an enchantress , who maddens lovers , sometimes leading them to their doom . Mohini is introduced into the Hindu mythology in the narrative epic of the Mahabharata . Here , she appears as a form of Vishnu , acquires the pot of Amrita ( an elixir of immortality ) from thieving asuras ( demons ) , and gives it back to the devas ( gods ) , helping them retain their immortality . 
 Many different legends tell of her various exploits and marriages , including union with Shiva . These tales relate , among other things , the birth of the god Shasta and the destruction of Bhasmasura , the ash @-@ demon . Mohini 's main modus operandi is to trick or <unk> those she encounters . She is worshipped throughout Indian culture , but mainly in Western India , where temples are devoted to her depicted as Mahalasa , the consort of Khandoba , a regional avatar of Shiva . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Mohini comes from the verb root <unk> , meaning " to enchant , perplex , or disillusion , " and literally means " delusion personified . " In the <unk> culture of Central India , the word <unk> means " erotic magic or spell . " The name also has an implied connotation of " the essence of female beauty and <unk> . " 
 = = Legends and history = = 
 = = = The Amrita = = = 
 The earliest reference to a Mohini @-@ type goddess appears in the Samudra manthan episode of the 5th century BCE Hindu epic Mahabharata . The Amrita , or nectar of immortality , is produced by the churning of the Ocean of Milk . The Deva and the Asura fight over its possession . The Asuras contrive to keep the Amrita for themselves , angering the Devas . Vishnu , wise to their plan , assumes the form of an " enchanting damsel " . She uses her allure to trick the Asuras into giving her the Amrita , and then distributes it amongst the Devas . Rahu , an Asura , disguises himself as a god and tries to drink some Amrita himself . Surya ( the sun @-@ god ) and Chandra ( the moon @-@ god ) quickly inform Vishnu , and he uses the Sudarshana Chakra ( the divine discus ) to decapitate Rahu , leaving the head immortal . The decapitated body becomes Ketu . Rahu and Ketu are both regarded as celestial bodies that assume one 's destiny . The other major Hindu epic , Ramayana ( 4th century BCE ) , narrates the Mohini story briefly in the Bala Kanda chapter . This same tale is also recounted in the Vishnu Purana four centuries later . 
 In the original text , Mohini is referred to as simply an enchanting , female form of Vishnu . In later versions , Mohini is described as the maya ( illusion ) of Vishnu . Later still , the name of the avatar becomes Mohini from the original phrase describing his deliberate false appearance ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . Once the Mohini legend became popular , it was retold , revised , and expanded in several texts . The tales of Mohini @-@ Vishnu also increased among devotional circles in various regions . The same expanded Mahabharata version of the story is also recounted in the Bhagavata Purana in the 10th century CE . Here , Mohini becomes a formal avatar of Vishnu . 
 This legend is also retold in the Padma Purana and Brahmanda Purana . In the Brahmanda Purana , however , Vishnu @-@ Mohini simply , after meditation upon the Great Goddess Maheshvari , acquires her form to trick the thieving asuras . 
 = = = Slayer of demons = = = 
 Mohini also has an active history in the destruction of demons throughout Hindu texts . In the Vishnu Purana , Mohini defeats Bhasmasura , the " ash @-@ demon " . Bhasmasura invokes the god Shiva by performing severe penances . Shiva , pleased with Bhasmasura , grants him the power to turn anyone into ashes by touching their head . The demon decides to try the power on Shiva himself . Shiva runs terrified . Vishnu , witnessing the unfortunate turn of events , transforms into Mohini and charms Bhasmasura . Bhasmasura is so taken by Mohini that he asks her to marry him . Mohini agrees , but only on the condition that Bhasmasura follows her move for move in a dance . In the course of the dance , she places her hand on her head . Bhasmasura mimics the action , and in turn , reduces himself to ashes . The legend of Bhasmasura is retold in the Buddhist text Satara <unk> Devi <unk> , with a slight variation . In this tale , Vishnu assumes his female form ( the name " Mohini " is not used ) and charms Bhasmasura . The female Vishnu asks Bhasmasura to promise never to leave her by placing his hand on his head as per the usual practice to swear on one 's head . On doing so , Bhasmasura is reduced to ashes . 
 In a similar legend related to the birth of Ayyappa , the demon <unk> earns the power to turn anyone into ashes by his austerities . The tale mirrors all other aspects of the Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale , where he is forced by Mohini to severe fidelity by keeping his hand on his head and is burnt . 
 The prelude of the Ramakien , the Thai version of the Ramayana , the demon Nontok is charmed and killed by Mohini @-@ Vishnu . Nontok misuses a divine weapon given to him by Shiva . The four @-@ armed Mohini @-@ Vishnu enchants Nontok and then attacks him . In his last moments , the demon accuses Vishnu of foul play saying that Vishnu first seduced him and then attacked him . Vishnu decrees that in his next birth , Nontok will be born as the ten @-@ armed demon Ravana and Vishnu will be a mortal man called Rama . He will then fight him and defeat him . 
 In a lesser @-@ known tale in the Ganesha Purana ( 900 — <unk> ) the wise asura king <unk> is rewarded a magical crown by the sun @-@ god Surya . The crown shields him against all harm . Vishnu as Mohini then enchants <unk> and steals his crown . The demon , thus unprotected , is killed by Vishnu . 
 Another legend about the demon Araka associates Mohini with Krishna rather than the god himself . The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman ( extreme chastity ) . Krishna takes the form of the beautiful Mohini and marries him . After three days of marriage , Araka 's bonds of chastity are broken , and Krishna kills him in battle . Transgender <unk> consider Krishna @-@ Mohini to be a transsexual deity . 
 = = = Relationship with Shiva = = = 
 In the Bhagavata Purana , after Vishnu deceives the demons by his maya female form , Shiva wishes to see the bewildering Mohini again . When Vishnu agrees and reveals his Mohini form , Shiva runs crazily behind Mohini , " bereft of shame and robbed by her of good sense , " while the abandoned wife Parvati ( Uma ) looks on . Shiva is overcome by <unk> ( love and desire or Kamadeva , the god of love and desire ) . His " unfailing " seed escapes and falls on ground creating ores of silver and gold . Afterwards , Vishnu comes to his true form and reveals that his maya ( illusory power ) cannot be surpassed even by Shiva . Shiva then extols Vishnu 's power . 
 The <unk> , a south Indian Shakta text , retells the story , giving more importance to the Goddess . When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu 's Mohini form again , Vishnu fears that he may be burned to ashes like Kamadeva by the ascetic Shiva . So , Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura , who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu , <unk> the Mohini @-@ form . As Shiva touches Mohini , his seed spills , indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities . 
 In the Brahmanda Purana when the wandering sage Narada tells Shiva about Vishnu 's Mohini form that deluded the demons , Shiva dismisses him . Shiva and his wife Parvati go to Vishnu 's home . Shiva asks him to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself . Vishnu smiles , again meditates on the Goddess , and in place of Vishnu stands the gorgeous Mohini . Overcome by lust , Shiva chases Mohini as Parvati hangs her head in shame and envy . Shiva grabs Mohini 's hand and embraces her , but Mohini frees herself and runs further . Finally , Shiva grabs her and their " violent coupling " leads to discharge of Shiva 's seed which falls " short of its goal , " suggesting the act was not consummated . The seed falls on the ground and the god Maha @-@ Shasta ( " The Great <unk> " ) is born . Mohini disappears , while Shiva returns home with Parvati . 
 Shasta is identified primarily with two regional deities : Ayyappa from Kerala and the Tamil Aiyanar . He is also identified with the classical Hindu gods Skanda and Hanuman . In the later story of the origin of Ayyappa , Shiva impregnates Mohini , who gives birth to Ayyappa . They abandon Ayyappa in shame . The legend highlights Vishnu 's protests to be Mohini again and also notes that Ayyappa is born of Vishnu 's thigh as Mohini does not have a real womb . Another variant says that instead of a biological origin , Ayyappa sprang from Shiva 's semen , which he ejaculated upon embracing Mohini . Ayyappa is referred to as Hariharaputra , " the son of Vishnu ( Hari ) and Shiva ( Hara ) " , and grows up to be a great hero . Another tale says after <unk> 's destruction , Shiva wishes to see Mohini and mesmerized by her looks , has union with her resulting in the birth of <unk> . 
 Kanda Puranam narrates about the birth of Shasta identified with Aiyanar . The text tells just before the tale that Vishnu is Shiva 's Shakti ( wife and power ) Parvati in a male form . The legend begins with Shiva 's request and Vishnu 's agreement to show his illusionary Mohini form , that he assumed for the distribution of amrita . Shiva falls in love with Mohini and proposes a union with her . Mohini @-@ Vishnu declines saying that union of two same sex women was unfruitful . Shiva informs Mohini @-@ Vishnu that he was just one of forms of his Shakti . Thereafter , their union resulted in the birth of a dark boy with red locks , who was named Hariharaputra . Further , he was also known as Shasta and <unk> . 
 In the Agni Purana , as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini , drops of his semen falls on the ground and become lingas , Shiva 's symbols . His semen also generates the monkey @-@ god Hanuman , who helps Vishnu 's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana . Shiva Purana says that by the mere glimpse of Mohini , Shiva spurts out his seed . The seed was collected and poured into the ear of Anjani , who gave birth to Hanuman , the incarnation of Shiva . The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana . Though Hanuman strings from Shiva 's seed , he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva . 
 The Buddhist version of the Bhasmasura tale continues with Shiva ( Ishvara ) asking the female @-@ Vishnu , who is seated on a swing , to marry him . She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home . Shiva returns with Umayangana 's consent to find the female @-@ Vishnu pregnant , who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home . When he returns , a child is born and female @-@ Vishnu is pregnant again . She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home . This happens six more times . Finally , Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman . Vishnu then returns to his male form . Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six @-@ headed Skanda , while the eldest , named <unk> ( " eldest brother " ) remains intact . <unk> is identified with Aiyanar . 
 Mohini plays a lesser role in a Shaiva legend in the Skanda Purana . Here , Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages . A group of sages are performing rituals in a forest , and start to consider themselves as gods . To humble them , Shiva takes the form of an attractive young beggar ( Bhikshatana ) and Vishnu becomes Mohini , his wife . While the sages fall for Mohini , their women wildly chase Shiva . When they regain their senses , they perform a black magic sacrifice , which produces a serpent , a lion , an elephant ( or tiger ) and a dwarf , all of which are overpowered by Shiva . Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja , the cosmic dancer . The legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some variation . This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva @-@ Nataraja . 
 Another legend from the Linga Purana says that the embracing of love @-@ struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body . At this moment , Mohini became Vishnu again , resulting the composite deity Harihara , whose right side of the body is Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form . In the temple in <unk> near <unk> is one of the rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara ( Sankara @-@ Narayana ) . The deity is depicted similar to the <unk> , the composite form of Shiva @-@ Parvati , where right side of the body is the male Shiva and left side is female . This image 's female side represents Mohini and it , as a whole , symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini . The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have led to the development of composite images like Harihara , where Vishnu is identified with Shiva 's consort , or Mohini . Like the Kanda Puranam narrative , the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati ( Uma ) , the female counterpart of Shiva . 
 = = = Other legends = = = 
 A folktale tells of the Mahabharata hero Aravan ( who becomes the Tamil god <unk> ) , who was married to Mohini , before his self @-@ sacrifice . Aravan agrees to become the sacrificial victim for the <unk> ( " sacrifice to the battlefield " ) to ensure the victory of the Pandavas , his father , and his uncles . Before being sacrificed to goddess Kali , Aravan asks three boons from Krishna , the guide of the Pandavas . The third boon was that Aravan should be married before the sacrifice so that he could get the right of cremation and funerary offerings ( bachelors were buried ) . This third boon , however , is found only in the folk cults . To fulfill this wish in the Kuttantavar cult myth , Krishna turns into Mohini , marries Aravan , and spends the night with him . Then after the sacrifice , Mohini laments Aravan 's death , breaking her bangles , beating her breasts , and discarding her bridal finery . She then returns to the original form of Krishna . The legend of the marriage of Aravan and Krishna in his female form as Mohini , and Mohini @-@ Krishna 's widowhood after Aravan 's sacrifice , forms the central theme of an eighteen @-@ day annual festival in the Tamil month of <unk> ( April – May ) at Koovagam . The marriage ceremony is re @-@ enacted by transgender <unk> , who play the role of Mohini @-@ Krishna . 
 = = Cultural interpretations = = 
 According to mythologist Pattanaik , Mohini is just a disguise to delude the demon Bhasmasura , rather than a sexual transformation in this legend . Mohini is a disillusion , Vishnu 's maya . 
 Stories in which Shiva knows of Mohini 's true nature have been interpreted to " suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction " . Pattanaik writes while Westerners may interpret the Shiva @-@ Mohini union as homosexual , traditional Hindus do not agree to this interpretation . He also writes that those focusing only on homoeroticism miss the narrative 's deeper metaphysical significance : Mohini 's femininity represents the material aspect of reality , and Mohini 's seduction is another attempt to induce the ascetic Shiva into taking an interest in worldly matters . Only Vishnu has the power to " enchant " Shiva ; a demon who tried to enchant and hurt Shiva in form of a woman was killed in the attempt . 
 Another interpretation posits that the Mohini tale suggests that Vishnu 's maya blinds even supernatural beings . Mohini is " the impersonation of the magically delusive nature of existence which fetters all beings to the rounds of births and deaths and vicissitudes of life . " Mohini also does not have an independent existence ; she exists only as a temporary delusion , and is absorbed back into Vishnu after serving her purpose . 
 The legend of the union of Mohini @-@ Vishnu and Shiva may also be written as part of the desire to have a common child of the two cosmic patriarchs of Hinduism . 
 = = Worship = = 
 On the fifth day of <unk> , Venkateshwara is dressed as Mohini and paraded in a grand procession . 
 In Goa , Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani . She is the Kuladevi ( family goddess ) of many Hindus from western and southern India , including Goud Saraswat Brahmins , <unk> Brahmins , <unk> and Bhandaris . The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol , Goa , though her temples also exist in the states of Karnataka , Kerala , Maharashtra , and Gujarat . Mahalasa has four hands , carrying a Trishula , a sword , a severed head , and a drinking bowl . She stands on a prostate man or demon , as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head . Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu @-@ <unk> , the slayer of Rahu , as told in the Bhavishya Purana . 
 Mahalasa is also called Mhalsa , the consort of Khandoba , a local incarnation of Shiva . As the consort of Khandoba , her chief temple - the <unk> temple - is located at <unk> , where she is worshiped as a four @-@ armed goddess and identified with Mohini . Mhalsa is often depicted with two arms and accompanying Khandoba on his horse or standing besides him . 
 The central icon of the Jaganmohini @-@ Kesava <unk> temple at <unk> , discovered buried underground by the king in the 11th century , represents the male Vishnu in the front , while the back of the icon is the female Jagan @-@ Mohini ( " one who deludes the world " ) or Mohini , with a female hairdo and figure . A Sthala Purana tells that the flower in Mohini 's hair fell at <unk> ( " fall " in Telugu ) when Mohini was being chased by Shiva . 
 = = Customs and ceremonies = = 
 Mohini has an important , dramatic role in several mythical works of South Indian drama like Yakshagana and Kathakali . In Kerala , however , where Mohini 's son Ayyappa is popular , the <unk> ( " the dance of Mohini " ) is honored as an independent dance form . Named after the goddess , it is a dance meant exclusively for women and " an ideal example of the erotic form . " The origins of <unk> form are unknown , though it was popularized in the 1850s , but later banned as it was used by " loose women " to attract customers . The ban was lifted in 1950 , after which it has seen a renewal . 
 The legends of Mohini are also being depicted in other dances , including the modern Kathak . The Sonal <unk> , performed in the Saho area of Chamba district , Himachal Pradesh , retells the Mohini @-@ Bhasmasura tale , and hence is known as the Mohini @-@ Bhasmasura dance . It is performed on festive occasions , especially in the Saho fair held in <unk> in the precincts of the <unk> temple . 
 = Yagan = 
 Yagan ( / <unk> / ; c . 1795 – 11 July 1833 ) was an Indigenous Australian warrior from the Noongar people . He played a key part in early resistance to British settlement and rule in the area surrounding what is now Perth , Western Australia . Yagan was pursued by the local authorities after he killed a servant of Archibald Butler in an act of retaliation after Smedley , another servant of Butler , shot at a group of Noongar people taking potatoes and fowls , killing one of them . The government offered a bounty for Yagan 's capture , dead or alive , and a young settler , William Keats , subsequently shot and killed him . Yagan 's execution figures in Aboriginal folklore as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of Australia by colonial settlers . He is considered a hero by the Noongar . 
 After his shooting , settlers removed Yagan 's head to claim the bounty . Later , an official sent it to London , where it was exhibited as an " anthropological curiosity " and eventually given to a museum in Liverpool . It held the head in storage for more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in Liverpool in 1964 . Over the years , the Noongar asked for repatriation of the head , both for religious reasons and because of Yagan 's traditional stature . The burial site was identified in 1993 ; officials exhumed the head four years later and repatriated it to Australia . After years of debate within the Noongar community on the appropriate final resting place , Yagan 's head was buried in a traditional ceremony in the Swan Valley in July 2010 , 177 years after his death . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 A member of the <unk> Noongar people , Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name , according to Robert Lyon , was Beeliar . Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people may have been a family subgroup of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called <unk> . According to Lyon , the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers , as far south as Mangles Bay . The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this , extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River . The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours ' land , possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups . 
 Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795 . His father was Midgegooroo , an elder of the Beeliar people ; his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo 's two wives . Yagan was probably a <unk> in the Noongar classification . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 According to the historian Neville Green , Yagan had a wife and two children . A report in the Perth Gazette in 1833 gives the names of his children as " <unk> " , age 9 , and " <unk> " , age 11 ; however , most other sources state that the warrior was unmarried and childless . Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique , Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder , which identified him as " a man of high degree in tribal law . " He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe . 
 = = = Relations with settlers = = = 
 Yagan would have been about 35 years old in 1829 when British settlers landed in the area and established the Swan River Colony . For the first two years of the colony , relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable , as there was little competition for resources . The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as <unk> , the returned spirits of their dead . Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish . As time passed , conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent . The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed . Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use . 
 As the colonists fenced off more land , the Noongar were increasingly denied access to their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites . In search of food , the Noongar raided the settlers ' crops and killed their cattle . They also developed a taste for the settlers ' supplies , and began to take flour and other food , which became a serious problem for the colony . In addition , the Noongar practice of <unk> farming : firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability , threatened the settlers ' crops and houses . 
 In December 1831 Yagan and his father led the first significant Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia . Thomas Smedley , a servant of farmer Archibald Butler , ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch , and killed one of Yagan 's family group . A few days later , Yagan , Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and , finding the door locked , began to break through the mud @-@ brick walls . Inside were Butler 's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons <unk> and Ralph . After hiding his sons under the bed , Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo . Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer 's tribal group , not necessarily the murderer . The Noongar considered servants and employees to be part of the settlers ' groups . Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law . Not understanding tribal law ( and unlikely to agree with its concepts ) , the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan 's group , without success . 
 In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat alongside the Canning River near Kelmscott . One of the men , John Thomas , escaped , but the other , William Gaze , was wounded and later died as a result . The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £ 20 for his capture . He avoided capture until early October 1832 . A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat , then pushed off into deep water . The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse , from which they were transferred to the Round House at Fremantle . Yagan was sentenced to death , but he was saved by the intercession of settler Robert Lyon . Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion , Lyon said Yagan should not be considered a criminal but a prisoner of war and suggested he should be treated as such . At the recommendation of John Septimus Roe , the Surveyor @-@ General of Western Australia , Yagan and his men were exiled on Carnac Island under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers . 
 Lyon thought he could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity . He hoped to gain his cooperation and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority . Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs . After a month , Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland . The Government did not pursue them ; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished . 
 In January 1833 two Noongar , Gyallipert and <unk> , visited Perth from King George Sound , where relations between settlers and natives were amicable . Two settlers , Richard [ Robert ? ] Dale and George Smythe , arranged for the men to meet a party of local Noongar to encourage friendly relations in the Swan River Colony . On 26 January Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars in greeting the two men near Lake Monger . The men exchanged weapons and held a corroboree , though the groups did not appear to share a language . Yagan and Gyallipert competed at spear throwing . As an example of his prowess , Yagan struck a walking stick from a distance of 25 metres . 
 Gyallipert and <unk> remained in Perth for some time . On 3 March , Yagan obtained permission to hold another corroboree , this time in the Post Office garden in Perth . The Perth and King George Sound men met at dusk , chalked their bodies , and performed a number of dances including a kangaroo hunt dance . The Perth Gazette wrote that Yagan " was master of ceremonies and acquitted himself with infinite grace and dignity . " 
 During February and March , Yagan was involved in a series of minor conflicts with settlers . In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door , demanded a gun , and taken handkerchiefs . Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread . The following month , Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott ; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply , Yagan threatened him with his spear . Later that month , Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson 's house while he was away . The group left after Watson 's wife called on neighbours for help . The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour . The frequent incidents prompted The Perth Gazette to remark on " the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin 's fee ... For the most trivial offence ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him . He is at the head and front of any mischief . " 
 = = = Wanted dead or alive = = = 
 On the night of 29 April , a party of Noongar broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour and were shot at by the caretaker Peter Chidlow . <unk> , a brother of Yagan , was badly injured and died in jail a few days later . The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to Preston Point , where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death . Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at Bull Creek , where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions . Later that day , the group ambushed the lead cart , killing two settlers , Tom and John <unk> . Tribal law required only a single death for vengeance . Some historians have speculated that the <unk> were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen . Alexandra Hasluck has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack , but this has been refuted elsewhere . 
 For the killing of the <unk> , the Lieutenant @-@ Governor Frederick Irwin declared Yagan , Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws , offering rewards of £ 20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday , and a reward of £ 30 for Yagan 's capture , dead or alive . Munday successfully appealed against his proscription . Midgegooroo , Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley . On 17 May , Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River . After a brief , informal trial , he was executed by firing squad . Yagan remained at large for over two months . 
 Late in May , George Fletcher Moore reported seeing Yagan on his property and talking with him in pidgin English . Moore wrote in the Perth Gazette : 
 Yagan stepped forward and leaning with his left hand on my shoulder while he <unk> with the right , delivered a sort of recitation , looking earnestly in my face . I regret I could not understand it , I thought from the tone and manner that the purport was this : 
 " You came to our country — you have driven us from our haunts , and disturbed us in our occupations . As we walk in our own country we are fired upon by the white men ; why should the white men treat us so ? " 
 Since Moore had little knowledge of Yagan 's native language , the historian Hasluck suggests that this account is probably more indicative of " a feeling of conscience on the part of the white men " than an accurate rendering of Yagan 's state of mind . 
 Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo was dead or alive . Moore gave no reply , but a servant answered that Midgegooroo was a prisoner on Carnac Island . Yagan warned , " White man shoot Midgegooroo , Yagan kill three . " Moore reported the encounter but made no attempt to restrain Yagan . He later wrote , " The truth is , every one wishes him taken , but no one likes to be the captor ... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire . "

 On 11 July 1833 , two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of Guildford when a group of Noongar approached while en route to collect flour rations from Henry Bull 's house . The Keates brothers suggested Yagan remain with them to avoid arrest . While he was staying with them during the morning , the brothers decided to kill the warrior and claim the reward . When the natives were ready to depart , the Keates took their last opportunity . William Keates shot Yagan , and James shot Heegan , another native , in the act of throwing his spear . The brothers ran away , but other Noongar overtook William and speared him to death . James escaped by swimming the river . Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull 's estate . 
 When the party of settlers arrived , they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying . Heegan " was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came , and whether humanity or brutality , a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces . " The settlers cut Yagan 's head from his body , and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy . They buried the bodies a short distance away . 
 James Keates claimed the reward , but his conduct was widely criticised . The Perth Gazette referred to Yagan 's killing as " a wild and treacherous act ... it is revolting to hear this lauded as a meritorious deed . " However , Daisy Bates understood that " he was killed in self @-@ defence by the young lad . " Keates left the colony the following month ; it is possible that he left from fear of being murdered in tribal retaliation .

 = = = Exhibition and burial = = = 
 Yagan 's head was initially taken to Henry Bull 's house . Moore saw it there and sketched the head a number of times in his unpublished , handwritten diary , commenting that " possibly it may yet figure in some museum at home . " The head was preserved by smoking . 
 In September 1833 , Governor Irwin sailed for London , partly to give his own account of the events leading up to the killing . This was an unusual measure , especially given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India . The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin 's administration of the colony . 
 Travelling with Irwin was Ensign Robert Dale , who had somehow acquired Yagan 's head . According to the historian Paul Turnbull , Dale appears to have persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an " anthropological curiosity " . After arriving in London , Dale tried to sell the head to scientists , approaching a number of anatomists and <unk> . His price of ₤ 20 failed to find a buyer , so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months . Pettigrew , a surgeon and antiquarian , was well known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied Egyptian mummies . He displayed the head on a table in front of a panoramic view of King George Sound reproduced from Dale 's sketches . For effect , the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red @-@ tailed black cockatoo . 
 Pettigrew had the head examined by a <unk> . Examination was considered difficult because of the large fracture across the back of the head caused by the gunshot . His conclusions were consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians . Dale published these in a pamphlet entitled Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View & c. of King George 's Sound and the Adjacent Country , which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a souvenir of their evening . The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand @-@ coloured aquatint print of Yagan 's head by the artist George Cruikshank . 
 Early in October 1835 , Yagan 's head and the panoramic view were returned to Dale , then living in Liverpool . On 12 October he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution , where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy . In 1894 the Institution 's collections were dispersed , and Yagan 's head was lent to the Liverpool Museum ; it is thought not to have been put on display there . By the 1960s Yagan 's head was badly deteriorated . In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it . It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964 , together with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head . They were buried in Everton Cemetery 's General Section 16 , grave number 296 . In later years a number of burials were made around the grave . For example , in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box , 20 stillborn babies and two infants who died soon after birth . 
 = = = Lobbying for repatriation = = = 
 For many years beginning in the early 1980s , a number of Noongar groups sought the return of Yagan 's head to Australia . 
 It is Aboriginal belief that because Yagan 's skeletal remains are incomplete , his spirit is earthbound . The uniting of his head and torso will immediately set his spirit free to continue its eternal journey . 
 At the time , there was no historical trail for the head after Pettigrew passed it on . Tribal elders entrusted the Aboriginal leader Ken Colbung with the search . In the early 1990s , Colbung enlisted the aid of University of London archaeologist Peter Ucko . One of Ucko 's researchers , Cressida Fforde , conducted a literature search for information on the head . Fforde successfully traced the head in December 1993 . The following April , Colbung applied to exhume the remains under Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857 . Home Office regulations required next of kin consent before disturbing the remains of the 22 infants . Colbung 's solicitors requested waiver of this condition on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan 's living relatives , and great national importance to Australia . 
 Meanwhile , divisions in the Noongar community in Perth began to develop . Some elders questioned Colbung 's role and one Noongar registered a complaint with the Liverpool City Council over his involvement . Media reports indicated acrimonious debate within the Noongar community about who had the best cultural qualifications to take possession of the head . The academic Hannah <unk> claims that these divisions were largely manufactured by the media , particularly The West Australian , which " aimed to and successfully represented the <unk> community in terms of disharmony and dissent " . She alleges that one West reporter contacted Noongar who were known to be in disagreement , and quoted one to the other , so as to elicit provocative responses . The disputes were " trumpeted " by The West , allowing it to " preach " against the infighting . 
 On 25 July a public meeting was held in Perth . All parties agreed to put aside their differences and co @-@ operate to ensure that the repatriation was a " national success " . A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co @-@ ordinate the repatriation , and Colbung 's application was allowed to proceed . In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the requirement to obtain next of kin consent for the exhumation . It contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known , and received unconditional consent from only one . Accordingly , on 30 June 1995 , Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected . 
 Meeting on 21 September , the Yagan Steering Committee decided to lobby Australian and British politicians for support . In 1997 Colbung was invited to visit the United Kingdom at the British government 's expense and he arrived on 20 May . His visit attracted substantial media coverage , and increased the political pressure on the British Government . He secured the support of the Prime Minister of Australia , John Howard , after gate crashing the Prime Minister 's June visit to the United Kingdom . 
 = = = Exhumation = = = 
 While Colbung was in the United Kingdom , Martin and Richard Bates were engaged to undertake a geophysical survey of the grave site . Using electromagnetic and ground penetrating radar techniques , they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot . A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office , prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments . 
 Of concern to the Home Office were an undisclosed number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung 's involvement in the repatriation process ; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant . In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission ( ATSIC ) to tell the British Home Office that he was the correct applicant . ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung 's application could proceed . 
 Colbung continued to press for the exhumation , asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan 's death on 11 July , so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration . His request was not met , and on the anniversary of Yagan 's death , Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton . He returned to Australia empty @-@ handed on 15 July . 
 The exhumation of Yagan 's head eventually proceeded , without Colbung 's knowledge , by excavating six feet down the side of the grave , then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box . Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains . The following day , a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan 's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew 's report . The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August , when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council . 
 = = = Repatriation = = = 
 On 27 August 1997 , a delegation of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung , Robert <unk> , Richard Wilkes and <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> arrived in the UK to collect Yagan 's head . The delegation was to have been larger , but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute . The handover of Yagan 's skull was further delayed , however , when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover . Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan 's remains , Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head 's exhumation and removal to Australia . On 29 August , Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application , on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements , and on the evidence of another Noongar elder ( Albert Corunna , who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan ) and anthropologist Pat Baines , both of whom refuted Bodney 's claim to sole responsibility . 
 Yagan 's skull was handed over to the Noongar delegation at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997 . In accepting the skull , Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan 's death with the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , earlier that day : 
 That is how nature goes ... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things . And because the Poms did the wrong thing , they now have to suffer . 
 Colbung 's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia , with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments . Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted . 
 Throughout the repatriation process , many sections of the international media treated the story as a joke . For example , the US News & World Report ran a story under the headline Raiders of the Lost <unk> , in which Yagan 's head was referred to as a " pickled curio " , and Colbung 's actions were treated as a publicity stunt . 
 = = = Preparations for reburial = = = 
 On its return to Perth , Yagan 's head continued to be a source of controversy and conflict . Responsibility for reburial of the head was given to a " Committee for the Reburial of Yagan 's <unk> " , headed by Richard Wilkes . However , the reburial was delayed by disputes between elders over the burial location , mainly due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body , and disagreement about the importance of burying the head with the body . 
 A number of attempts were made to locate the remains of Yagan 's body , which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus . A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998 , but no remains were found . An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later , but this also was unsuccessful . Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body . Wilkes has claimed that it can , so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed , so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains . 
 In 1998 the Western Australian Planning Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs jointly published a document entitled Yagan 's <unk> Master Plan , which discussed " matters of ownership , management , development and future use " of the property on which Yagan 's remains are believed to be buried . Under consideration was the possibility of turning the site into an Indigenous burial site , to be managed by the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board . 
 Yagan 's head spent some time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to forensics experts who reconstructed a model from it . After that it was held in storage at Western Australia 's state mortuary . Plans to re @-@ bury the head were repeatedly deferred , causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups . In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan 's head would be reburied in November , and a Yagan Memorial Park created as a projected cost of A $ 996 @,@ 000 ; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems . In March 2009 , it was announced that the Department of Indigenous Affairs had given the City of Swan more than A $ 500 @,@ 000 to develop the park . 
 = = = Reburial = = = 
 The head was finally buried in a private ceremony attended only by invited Noongar elders , on 10 July 2010 , the anniversary of the last full day he lived and one day before the end of <unk> Week 2010 . The site in Belhus was chosen as it is believed to be near to where the rest of Yagan 's body was buried . The burial coincided with a ceremony to mark the opening of the Yagan Memorial Park which was attended by around 300 people , including Noongar elders and State government representatives . State Premier Colin Barnett described the occasion as " a wonderful day for all West Australians . " 
 The art works for the Yagan Memorial Park were designed by Peter Farmer , Sandra Hill , Jenny Dawson and Kylie Ricks . Dawson and Hill created an entry wall of Yagan 's story ; Farmer designed the park entry statements and Ricks the female <unk> . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The repatriation of Yagan 's head increased the Aboriginal leader 's notability . He is considered a famous historical figure throughout Australia , with material about him appearing in such publications as the Australian Dictionary of Biography , and Western Australia 's school curriculum . He is of greatest significance , however , to the Noongar people , for whom he is " a revered , cherished and heroic individual ... patriot and visionary hero of WA 's South @-@ West " . The return of his head was likened by some Indigenous Australians to the November 1993 ceremonial repatriation from Gallipoli of Australia 's unknown soldier . 
 The former Upper Swan Bridge , which carries the Great Northern Highway over the Swan River at Belhus , was renamed the Yagan Bridge in 2010 . Also , an open plaza in the Perth central business district , constructed as part of the Perth City Link , an ongoing urban renewal project , will be named Yagan Square , having previously been referred to simply as " City Square " . The plaza , located adjacent to the Horseshoe Bridge , is expected to open in late 2016 .

 = = = Alas Poor Yagan = = = 
 On 6 September 1997 The West Australian published a Dean Alston cartoon entitled Alas Poor Yagan , which was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan 's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity . The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture , and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage . The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians , and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission . The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 because it was " an artistic work " that was published " reasonably and in good faith " , and was therefore exempt . This ruling was upheld on appeal by the Federal Court of Australia , Some academic commentators have since expressed concern that the protections offered under the act have been undermined by the ruling 's broad interpretation of the exemptions . 
 = = = Statue = = = 
 From the mid @-@ 1970s , members of the Noongar community lobbied for the erection of a statue of Yagan as part of the WAY 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations . Their requests were refused , however , after then Premier of Western Australia Sir Charles Court was advised by one prominent historian that Yagan was not important enough to warrant a statue . Colbung claims " Court was more interested in spending tax payers ' money on refurbishing the badly neglected burial place of Captain James Stirling , WA 's first governor . " Despite this setback , the Noongar community persisted , establishing a Yagan Committee and running a number of fund @-@ raising drives . Eventually , sufficient funds were collected to allow the commissioning of Australian sculptor Robert Hitchcock to create a statue . The result was a life @-@ size statue in bronze , depicting Yagan standing naked with a spear held across his shoulders . Hitchcock 's statue of Yagan was officially opened by Yagan Committee chairperson Elizabeth Hanson on 11 September 1984 . It stands on Heirisson Island in the Swan River near Perth . 
 In 1997 , within a week of the return of Yagan 's head to Perth , vandals beheaded the statue using an angle grinder . Soon after a replacement head was installed and it too was detached and stolen . Credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a " British loyalist " as an act of retaliation for Colbung 's comments about Diana , Princess of Wales . The Western Australia Police did not succeed in identifying the vandals , nor in recovering the heads , and deemed it infeasible to have the statue fenced off or placed under guard . 
 Commentary on the beheadings varied widely . One column in The West Australia found humour in them , referring to the head as a " bonce " and a " noggin " , and finished with a pun on " skullduggery " . Stephen <unk> calls this the " satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns " ; and Adam Shoemaker writes " This is the stuff of light humour and comic relief . There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism , even less that it could have been motivated by malevolence ... [ T ] he piece has a definite authorising function " . On the other hand , academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity . In 2007 , for example , David Martin described the decapitation as " an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism , but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own . " 
 In 2002 , Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet <unk> called for the statue 's genitalia to be covered up , but nothing was done . In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again called for the statue 's groin to be covered , on the grounds that such a depiction would be more historically accurate , as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year . Also under consideration is the creation of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan 's head .

 Mary Durack published a fictionalised account of Yagan 's life in her 1964 children 's novel The <unk> Savage : Yagan of the Swan River , which was renamed Yagan of the <unk> on reissue in 1976 . 
 The repeated beheading of Yagan 's statue in 1997 prompted Aboriginal writer Archie Weller to write a short story entitled Confessions of a <unk> . Weller later worked with film director Sally Riley to adapt the story into a script , and in 2000 a 35 @-@ minute movie , also named Confessions of a <unk> , was released . Directed by Sally Riley , the movie won Best Short Fiction Film at the 2000 AFI Awards . The following year the script won the Script Award in the 2001 Western Australian Premier 's Book Awards . 
 In 2002 , the South African @-@ born Australian poet John <unk> published his fourth collection of poems , entitled Loanwords . The collection is divided into four sections , of which the third , In the Presence of a Severed Head , has Yagan as its subject .

 A section of <unk> , a play by Jack Davis , explores the deteriorating relationship between Yagan and a settler couple . 
 In September 1989 an early maturing cultivar of barley , bred by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture for performance on sandy soils , was released under the name " Hordeum vulgare ( Barley ) <unk> Yagan " .

 = 1889 – 90 Sheffield United F.C. season = 
 The 1889 – 90 season was the first in existence for Sheffield United . Having not been elected to any organised league at that point they predominantly played friendly fixtures but did enter the FA Cup for the first time as well as locally arranged cup competitions The Sheffield Challenge Cup and the Wharncliffe Charity Cup . The club did not employ a manager in this period ; tactics and team selection were decided by The Football Committee and the players were coached by a trainer . J.B. Wostinholm held the position of club secretary , dealing with player transfers and contracts , arranging matches and dealing with the FA . The first season was deemed a reasonable success with steady attendances to home games and progress in the FA Cup although the fluctuating nature of the team meant that consistency was never really achieved . 
 As the season progressed it became obvious that a better standard of player would be required to succeed in League Football and the club began to recruit new players in the spring , notably signing Rab Howell , Mick Whitham and Arthur Watson from nearby Rotherham Swifts who were in financial difficulties . United eventually reached the second round proper of the FA Cup where they were comprehensively beaten by the more experienced Bolton Wanderers and finished the season having been accepted to play in the newly formed Midland Counties League the following term . 
 = = Background = = 
 Sheffield United had been formed earlier in 1889 by the organising committee of the Sheffield United Cricket Club in response to the growing popularity of the game . They viewed a football team as a means of generating extra revenue and a greater utilisation of the club facilities , particularly in the winter months . The initial plan was to sign a core squad of players and augment them with the best amateur players from the region as guests . The club had duly advertised for players in the local press and in Glasgow as it was considered that Scotland was an untapped pool of talent . Respondents were invited for trials and a basic squad were offered contracts . 
 = = Kit = = 
 For their first season the team wore a plain white ' jersey ' and blue ' knickers ' and socks . The club would not adopt its now traditional red and white stripes until the following season . 
 = = Season overview = = 
 With a team assembled over the summer months , United played their first ever fixture against Notts Rangers on 7 September 1889 , a game which they lost 4 – 1 . As they were not part of any organised league the club arranged a series of friendly and exhibition games to fill the schedule of their fledgling club . Their opponents were drawn both from the local area ( Sheffield having a number of established teams at this time ) and from further afield , particularly the North @-@ West and West Midlands . 
 The establishment of a new , well @-@ financed , football team in the city had caused some consternation amongst the local FA and United undertook a low @-@ key start , not playing their first game at Bramall Lane until the end of September , against Birmingham St. George 's . The team continued to play regularly and attendances at Bramall Lane steadily increased as interest in the new side grew . The team performed well against local sides but the fluctuating nature of the squad during this period meant there was little consistency in results . By December however , it had become clear that better quality of players would be required if the club was to develop and take on the more established sides playing in the Football League . The initial plan of maintaining a core of players that would be boosted from the ranks of the local amateur game had not borne fruit as the players who appeared were often ageing and past their best . Similarly the players recruited from Scotland had largely failed to impress and so the football committee looked to bring in fresh players to strengthen the team . 
 Ironically , their first two new signings were a Scot , William Calder , and another local amateur , <unk> Clarke , who both arrived in December 1889 but the team was beginning to take on a more professional image . The team continued their campaign of friendly fixtures into 1890 , with varying degrees of success , whilst competing in the FA Cup for the first time . With the club hoping to be accepted into the newly formed Midland Counties League for the following season the committee made a number of additions to the squad in March , signing Billy Bairstow from local side Sheffield Club but more significantly signing a trio of players from nearby Rotherham Swifts . Rab Howell , Arthur Watson and Michael Whitham would all become stalwarts of the team in the coming seasons , with both Howell and Whitham subsequently going on to represent England . They represented United 's first reported entry into the transfer market , arriving for a combined fee of £ 200 , and signalled a new era of full professionalism for the club . 
 = = = FA Cup = = = 
 United made their debut in the FA Cup in an away fixture against Scarborough on 7 October 1889 , a game which they comprehensively won 6 – 1 . Required to play a number of qualifying games they went on to play various local sides before reaching the First round proper when they took on Burnley in January 1990 . Having dispatched the Clarets , United were drawn against another Lancashire side in the next round – Bolton Wanderers . Giving up home advantage in return for a payment of £ 40 ( a practice that was actually against the rules of the competition ) they travelled across the Pennines only to be trounced 13 – 0 , a result that remains United 's worst ever cup defeat . 
 = = = Local cup competitions = = = 
 United entered both the Sheffield Challenge Cup and the Wharncliffe Charity Cup during the course of the season . Both competitions were ratified by the Sheffield FA and as such were viewed as fully competitive fixtures within the local area . United progressed through three early rounds of the Challenge Cup , beating Sheffield Exchange , Heeley and Attercliffe before facing Staveley at Bramall Lane in the semi @-@ final . A 2 – 0 victory was enough to see them progress to the team 's first ever ' cup final ' where they took on an experienced Rotherham Town side over two legs . United were held to a 0 – 0 draw in the first fixture at Bramall Lane but succumbed to a single goal in the return leg which was played at the ground of Rotherham Swifts . 
 The Wharncliffe Cup was a smaller affair and The Blades needed only to beat Doncaster Rovers in a home game to progress to the semi @-@ final . They travelled to Staveley but were beaten 2 – 1 by their hosts .

 " Eggtown " is the fourth episode of the fourth season and 76th episode overall of the ABC 's serial drama television series Lost . It was aired on February 21 , 2008 , on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada . It was written by supervising producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and script coordinator Greggory Nations and directed by co @-@ executive producer Stephen Williams . This is the first episode written by Nations . 
 The episode 's island plot takes place in late December 2004 , 90 @-@ plus days after the crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 . Flashforwards show Kate Austen ( played by Evangeline Lilly ) on trial for her numerous pre @-@ island crimes , after her escape from the island . " Eggtown " was watched by 15 million Americans and received mixed reviews from critics . The cliffhanger was generally praised , but the slow pace was criticized . 
 = = Plot = = 
 John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) is keeping Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) prisoner in the basement of the house that he has claimed in the Barracks . He prepares breakfast for him , including the two remaining eggs which he fries along with some fresh melon , but Ben taunts him and Locke becomes frustrated . Kate cuts a deal with Locke 's prisoner Miles Straume ( Ken Leung ) : he will tell her what he knows about her if he can speak to Ben for a minute . Miles wants to extort $ 3 @.@ 2 million from Ben and in return , Miles promises to lie to his employer claiming Ben is dead . Miles gives Ben a week to produce the cash . Before Locke finds them , Miles reveals that he knows all about Kate 's past . Locke banishes Kate from the Barracks and goes to a lake house where Miles is being held captive . Locke puts a grenade in Miles 's mouth so that if he ceases to bite , he will die . Kate sleeps with James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) but does not have sex with him . Before Kate leaves for the camp at the beach , she slaps Sawyer across the face after he suggests that she is just pretending to be mad as an excuse to go back to Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) and continue their love triangle . 
 Meanwhile , Jack returns to the survivors ' beach camp with Juliet Burke ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) and newcomers Daniel Faraday ( Jeremy Davies ) and Charlotte Lewis ( Rebecca Mader ) . Jack and Juliet grow increasingly uneasy over a series of unsuccessful attempts to contact the freighter by satellite phone and verify that Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) and Frank Lapidus ( Jeff Fahey ) , who departed for the freighter by helicopter the previous evening , have arrived safely . That evening , as Charlotte tests Daniel 's memory using playing cards ( Daniel successfully remembers two out of three cards , and Charlotte remarks that this is " progress " ) , Jack and Juliet ask if there is another phone number they could try . Charlotte dials an emergency number and speaks to Regina ( Zoë Bell ) , who reports that the helicopter never arrived . 
 After leaving the island , Kate is famous as one of the Oceanic Six . She is tried for her numerous crimes committed before the crash and pleads not guilty . Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial , Jack is called in as a character witness . He lies in his testimony , saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water , eight survived the crash , but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six 's survival . Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen ( Beth Broderick ) for the first time in four years . Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed when she thought that Kate had died in the plane crash . When Diane , the prosecution 's star witness , no longer wants to testify against her daughter , the District Attorney makes a plea deal : Kate gets ten years probation , but must stay in the state of California . Jack meets Kate in the parking garage . He admits that he still loves her ( in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf ) and asks to go out for coffee with her . Kate responds that they cannot go out until he is willing to visit her baby . It is then revealed that Kate is raising Claire Littleton 's ( Emilie de Ravin ) son Aaron ( William Blanchette ) as her own . 
 = = Production = = 
 Greggory " Gregg " Nations worked as the script coordinator for the late 1990s CBS television series Nash Bridges . Lost 's show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse — the former was a writer and the latter was the show runner for Nash Bridges — hired Nations to serve as Lost 's script coordinator in the 2005 alongside pre @-@ production of the second season . Nations rewatched every episode and created a series " Bible " and timeline . Nations made his direct Lost writing debut with " Eggtown " . Nations would be promoted to a coproducer for the show 's fifth season . 
 Lindelof and Cuse hyped in September 2007 that " Eggtown " would conclude Kate 's potential pregnancy . After having sex a few times in the third season , Kate and Sawyer begin to wonder if Kate is pregnant . In " Eggtown " , Kate exclaims to Sawyer that she is not pregnant and Sawyer rejoices , causing Kate to become angry with him and suddenly leave the Barracks . Evangeline Lilly was excited by Kate 's new connection to Aaron . Lilly has said that if she could choose to play another Lost character , it would be Claire because of Aaron . Now she gets to have Aaron while portraying Kate . She also enjoyed Kate having more responsibility because it puts her in a different situation from previous seasons . 
 The word " Eggtown " is not directly referenced in the episode , resulting in online speculation and confusion . According to Lindelof and Cuse , it has been " the most questioned title of the show " . Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the title was a reference to the ancient cosmic egg concept or the chicken or the egg causality dilemma , while John Kubicek of BuddyTV guessed that it was a shout @-@ out to the children 's book and film called The Easter Egg Adventure , which depicts roosters attempting to steal Easter eggs from the animals of a place called Egg Town or that it was an allusion to the Great Depression slang term , which was used in the 1930s when describing a bad deal . Lindelof and Cuse confirmed that the episode was primarily named as such because Locke fries eggs for Ben 's breakfast and secondarily because the story deals with Kate 's possible pregnancy . 
 " Eggtown " continues Lost 's pattern of featuring numerous literary references , which may allude to a favourite book of the writers or a story similar to that of a character . Locke gives Ben Philip K. Dick 's <unk> , a 1981 science fiction novel about a gnostic vision of one aspect of God . Sawyer reads The Invention of Morel , a 1940 science fiction novel by Argentine writer Adolfo <unk> Casares about a fugitive who hides on a deserted Pacific island where the people are only images and do not exist . 
 Hurley also asks James if he would like to watch Xanadu or a fictional film called Satan 's Doom but James replies saying that he is reading a book . Hurley then plays Xanadu and we hear the film 's title song . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Eggtown " was watched by 13 @.@ 647 million American viewers , ranking Lost seventh of the week in Nielsen ratings . The episode was watched by a total of 15 @.@ 438 million viewers , including those who watched within seven days of broadcast , making it the most recorded show of the week ; this number went toward the year @-@ end season average . It received at least 5 @.@ 7 / 13 in the key adults 18 – 49 demographic . The Canadian broadcast was seen by 1 @.@ 615 million people , making it the ninth most watched show of the week . In the United Kingdom , Lost brought in 1 @.@ 1 million viewers . Amidst speculation that Lost would be pulled from the schedule , 780 @,@ 000 Australians tuned in to " Eggtown " and made it the nineteenth most watched show of the night . Nevertheless , it was in the top ten programs of the night in each of the key adults 25 – 54 , 18 – 49 and 16 – 39 demographics . 
 Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Lilly 's performance , saying that it was almost worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination . TV Guide 's Michael Ausiello dubbed " Eggtown " the best episode of the first four episodes of the fourth season . Nikki Stafford of Wizard described it as a " great episode " and observed that it features " the first conversation between Jin and Sun [ of the ] season . Interesting that last season so many fans were up in arms for the [ early third season ] because we didn 't get to see enough of the other characters , and this season we 're seeing even less of the others , yet no one is complaining . Looks like the writers finally found the right balance . " Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen thought that the episode " was all about moving all the simmering subplots forward so the next episodes can drive them home " . Kristin Dos Santos of E ! called the episode 's final plot twist " fantastic " and " unexpected " . Digital Spy 's Ben Rawson @-@ Jones called it the best of the first four episodes of the season with four out of five stars , saying that " the courtroom scenes were very well executed , with a marked difference in the characterisation of Jack [ who ] has become known as the trustworthy , honest type since Oceanic Flight 815 crashed , so his blatant lies about the island under oath were definitely dramatic . " Erin Martell of AOL 's TV Squad reviewed " Eggtown " positively , writing that it " not many shows could mix topics like blackmail , grenades , and motherhood into one episode , but Lost pulled it off . " Jon Lachonis of UGO claimed that Lost " again blew everybody 's minds " with " Eggtown " . BuddyTV 's Oscar Dahl commented that " those last few [ flash ] forward scenes were genius . The writers really out @-@ did themselves . " Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post thought that " Eggtown " " effectively kept up the frantic pace that this season has set , answering some really good questions while effectively bringing up new ones . " 
 Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times found " Eggtown " to be set at a slower pace than other episodes of the season and said that " the witness stand as forum for revelation … holds no appeal for me . " Newsday 's Diane Werts had mixed feelings about " Eggtown " . She criticized the lack of plot twists , stating that " that last @-@ second ' reveal ' of [ Kate raising Aaron ] turned out to be a bit of a dud " . Werts also critiqued the execution and acting , calling the trial " blandly delivered " and Lilly and Fox " expressionless " . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger dubbed " Eggtown " " the weakest episode of the season " , partially because he also was unimpressed with the lack of plot twists and does not find Kate to be a compelling character . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune 's Karla Peterson gave a mixed review , writing that " last night 's Lost was not amazing , until it slammed us upside the head with a plot curveball that left us unable to remember whatever doubts we may have had , say , one minute before . " Daniel of TMZ gave the episode a " D " , partially because the twist ending had been spoiled for him . IGN 's Chris Carabott rated it the worst of the first four by scoring it as a 7 @.@ 6 / 10 . He wrote that the flashforward was " out of place " and that the " final revelation was shocking … but Lost can 't survive on shock value alone . " Daniel MacEachern of Television Without Pity gave the episode a " B " , the lowest grade for a fourth season episode from the website . 
 = 1980 Eureka earthquake = 
 The 1980 Eureka earthquake ( also known as the Gorda Basin earthquake ) occurred on November 8 at 02 : 27 : 34 local time along the northern coastal area of California in the United States . With a moment magnitude of 7 @.@ 3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII ( Very strong ) , this strike @-@ slip earthquake was the largest to occur in California in 28 years . Although damage was considered light , several loss estimates equaled or exceeded $ 2 million , and six injuries resulted when two vehicles came down with the partial collapse of a highway overpass on US 101 in Fields Landing . The north coast of California experiences frequent plate boundary earthquakes near the Mendocino Triple Junction and intraplate events also occur within the Gorda Plate . 
 Due to the regional seismic risk , the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s . No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil @-@ fuel units that were still operational at the facility . Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically @-@ active area , but the majority of records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance . Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made . 
 = = Tectonic setting = = 
 Near Cape Mendocino , the Mendocino Triple Junction is an area of active seismicity where three tectonic plates come together . The Mendocino Fracture Zone ( also known as the Mendocino Fault east of the Gorda Ridge ) is a transform fault that separates the Pacific and Gorda Plates . To the south , the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate is accommodated by the San Andreas Fault , and to the north , the Gorda Plate is converging with the North American Plate at the Cascadia Subduction Zone . Earthquakes within the Gorda Plate are the result of north @-@ south compression at the Mendocino Fault . 
 = = Earthquake = = 
 The left @-@ lateral strike @-@ slip earthquake was the largest to occur in California since the 1952 Kern County earthquake . The mainshock ( which was described as a multiple @-@ rupture , with four subevents in the initial 80 seconds ) and its aftershocks occurred on a northeast @-@ trending fault that extended from near the Mendocino Fault to a point northwest of Eureka . Movement along the fault is due to a north @-@ south compressional regime and the resulting intraplate deformation of the Gorda Plate . Previous events in this area were the January 1922 7 @.@ 3 Ms and the January 1923 7 @.@ 2 Ms shocks . 
 The earthquake occurred offshore ( to the northwest of Eureka , about 37 mi ( 60 km ) west of Patrick 's Point ) and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII ( Very strong ) . Some people reported intense shaking that lasted for 15 to 30 seconds ; tremors were felt as far south as the San Francisco Bay Area and as far north as Salem , Oregon . In the epicentral area , items were knocked off shelves and furniture was displaced , but damage was considered light ( the smaller 5 @.@ 2 ML event that occurred in June 1975 caused more damage ) . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 While most of the damage from the Gorda Basin earthquake was considered light , there were some exceptions . Mercalli intensities in the immediate area were judged to be in the range of V ( Moderate ) to VII . In Eureka , intensity VI ( Strong ) effects included broken windows and dishes , fallen chimneys , and merchandise that fell from store shelves . Intensity VII effects affected the Fields Landing , King Salmon , Loleta , and Big Lagoon areas , and included surface cracks on the ground , soil liquefaction , small landslides and rockfalls , and numerous slumps along the Eel River . Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone , where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas . Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing . Seismic wave amplification , poor design , or inadequate construction style may have contributed to losses there . 
 = = = = Tompkins Hill Road overpass = = = = 
 The Tompkins Hill Road overpass is situated just south of Fields Landing and was built in the late 1960s . It suffered slight damage during the 1975 earthquake and was due for a retrofit in 1981 . The overpass was constructed with cement abutments on earthen ramps on either end and a series of concrete support columns in the middle . Eight 60 ft ( 20 m ) reinforced concrete spans accommodated northbound and southbound lanes of traffic , with no anchors connecting the spans with each other or to the abutments . At the time of the shock , two of the southbound spans came off their support ( a 6 in ( 15 cm ) ledge ) and six people were injured when a Volkswagen Beetle and a small pickup truck plummeted off the bridge . 
 = = = = Humboldt Bay Power Plant = = = = 
 The Humboldt Bay Power Plant is located about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of the collapsed highway overpass and operated fossil @-@ fuel and nuclear units in the 1960s and 1970s . The nuclear unit was cancelled in 1976 because of seismic safety concerns , but the two fossil @-@ fuel units remained in operation . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed a post @-@ event survey of the facility 's systems in late 1980 , but inspectors found only minor effects to the plant 's structure , piping , tanks , and other mechanical equipment . It was found that the two units were automatically shut down at the time of the shock for various protective concerns and that there were minor cracks in masonry and concrete , sheared bolts , pipe leaks , and slight movement of water tanks . The deformation of a reinforced masonry wall that resulted in a variable @-@ width gap was the only structural issue . 
 = = = Strong motion = = = 
 Pacific Gas and Electric initially reported that peak ground accelerations in the range of <unk> – .4g were recorded on the floor of the refueling building on the plant 's strong motion instruments ( accelerometers ) . Low voltage from a faulty power supply left the instruments in a condition that was functional , but the records were not considered reliable . Three <unk> Technology film recorders were also in use as a backup system , but these instruments also did not produce any usable records , because lack of maintenance had allowed dirt and grit to get inside . Only records from one instrument ( an <unk> peak shock recorder ) was believed to be operating correctly and , with a close examination of the energy dispersed at various frequencies , an estimate of .15 – .25g was given for the event at that location .

 Pokémon Apokélypse is a 2010 fan @-@ made short film directed by Kial Natale and produced by Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub . Based on the Pokémon franchise , the storyline takes place several years after the events of the original anime series . Intended as a fan @-@ response to " the common trend of ' dark and gritty ' reboots of popular franchises " , the film was meant to give a mature spin on Pokémon and be in the same vein as work seen on parody website CollegeHumor . The creators initially intended to reveal the film at the Vancouver Anime Evolution convention , it was not shown due to technical difficulties . Instead on September 14 , 2010 , it revealed online via a teaser segment distributed through emails sent to various media outlets , which presented itself as a recording of a " secret movie trailer screening " for a film in development . The full film followed shortly thereafter , posted online on September 20 . 
 The result of almost two years of work , the film follows Ash Ketchum and his friends years after the events of the original anime series , and their struggle against criminal organization Rocket Industries . Deciding on using the subject of Pokémon after considering several possibilities such as Grand Theft Auto and Dragon Ball Z , the producers were surprised by fan reaction to the material . Despite praises for the content , they have stated they have no intention to produce a full @-@ fledged film . 
 The initial " leaked " preview was met with skepticism and criticism , with Crave Online in particular recalling the trend of past video game @-@ inspired films being of poor quality . Kotaku and Topless Robot in particular noting that the preview did it a disservice by hiding the charm of the completed project , which by comparison was met with very positive reception . GamesRadar called it " amazing " , and stated that the content was " good enough for grown ups " ; in a further discussion , they added they were impressed by the quality of the work , and how it addressed the similarity between the games and dog fighting . Other sources such as The Escapist and Game Informer also heavily praised the production , with the former lamenting that such a concept would never officially appear from Nintendo . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Structured as a trailer for a non @-@ existent film , Pokémon Apokélypse is set in the fictional <unk> City , and takes place several years after the events of the original anime series . The plot focuses on Ash Ketchum ( Lee Majdoub ) , a Pokémon Trainer who commands creatures called Pokémon to battle other Trainers ' Pokémon to advance within a league setting . Formerly a global sport , it was long since outlawed due to outcries of animal abuse , and instead continued in underground arenas , where the fighting became much more brutal . Despite warnings by his friend Brock ( Kial Natale ) , Ash takes part in the battles with his Pokémon , Pikachu . When approached by Giovanni ( David Quast ) , the head of Rocket Industries , with a bribe to throw his next fight , Ash turns the offer down . In response , Giovanni threatens Ash 's former mentor Professor Oak ( Richard Toews ) and girlfriend , Misty ( Rebecca Strom ) . Deciding to keep them safe , Ash accepts the bribe , and Pikachu is nearly killed in the match . 
 Quickly regretting his actions , Ash revisits Giovanni and returns the bribe money , declaring himself out of the league . Enraged , Giovanni declares Ash and his friends dead , and sends his minions Jessie , James ( Julia Lawton and <unk> Patrick Paon ) and Meowth to carry out the retribution . As a result , Oak is killed , Pikachu and Misty are assaulted , and Brock is tortured . With the help of Pikachu , Brock and Misty , Ash goes after Giovanni and aims to take down Rocket Industries , declaring he will not stop until he has " caught them all " .

 = = Development and production = = 
 Produced as a side project by Kial Natale , Dylan Innes and Lee Majdoub , the concept originated in December 2008 from the desire to produce a live @-@ action version of a series , with Natale wishing to focus on Grand Theft Auto , and Majdoub suggesting a film based upon Dragon Ball Z. After another member of the group suggested Pokémon as a possibility , they focused on that concept instead . Kial quickly wrote a script for the short film , while Majdoub and executive film producer Innes contributed additional material to flesh it out . Originally intended to be a film in the vein of CollegeHumor 's parody productions , more scenes were added and visual effects improved due to Kial 's love for the series and his desire for the film to be " more and more " . Planning of the film took four months , while filming and production took a year and a half . Varying crew sizes were used for the four different filming periods with the majority of filming occurring within one weekend . Majdoub noted he was surprised at the number of people that came forth for auditions that were not actors , but fans of the series . 
 The film 's tone was inspired by a discussion with editor Nicholas Porteous about a review of Ang Lee 's film Hulk , in which a producer theorized that the film was seen as a commercial failure " because it wasn ’ t dark and gritty , like Batman Begins " . Natale found the idea that Begins succeeded solely due to its tone insulting to its director Christopher Nolan , and joked with Majdoub on the popularity of ' dark ' series reboots , pondering what series would be good for a live @-@ action adaptation . Settling on Pokémon due to its undertones of animal rights abuse , Majdoub wanted to approach the film from a completely mature standpoint . Displeased with the current trend of video game to film adaptations , they wished to " see how far we could take it without being absolutely ridiculous " . A variety of locations were worked in to give the completed project a proper trailer feel . The title Pokémon Apokélypse was chosen as nod to Apocalypse Now , due to the similarity of the shooting ratios , with only ten percent of the footage actually used . Though several scenes were shot to add more content to the film , others using dialogue and one @-@ liners from the anime series were purposefully shot in longer scenes then cropped down , in order to ensure the lines did not feel forced and to give a sense that " here is a world beyond what is shown in the trailer " . 
 Though originally intended to be shown at the Anime Evolution convention in Vancouver , Canada , the crew ran into technical difficulties . At a friend 's suggestion , the film was instead revealed through viral emails on September 14 , 2010 , with the sender named " Professor Oak " attaching a small thirty @-@ second part of the film and presenting it as a small part recorded from a " secret movie trailer screening " . Satisfied that the teaser had sparked interest , the full film was released on September 20 . Natale stated that he was impressed by the people that had scrutinized the preview to determine whether or not it was genuine . When asked if they had any plans to produce a full movie , Majdoub stated that he would like to consider the prospects if they could receive assistance with the CGI aspects of the film , however any further production would be up to Natale . Natale in turn added that while he was grateful for the positive reviews , he had no intention to do further films based on the Pokémon franchise .

 Reaction to the film 's preview segment was mixed . Kotaku heavily praised the effects , undertone and music , stating that the staff loved it , though lamented that an official film of this kind would join a long line of " ill @-@ advised live @-@ action adaptations " . Game Informer called it " absurd " , stating that while it was a possible proof of concept film it was more likely completely fake , and adding " It looks goofy as hell , and <unk> are sure to get a couple chuckles out of it if nothing else . " ComicsAlliance called it " somewhere in the middle " of presenting a better take on the franchise and a reminder that " some intellectual properties got things right ( or inherently wrong ) the first time " , though called the effect " surprisingly competent " and it both generally fun and funny . Crave Online heavily criticized the film , calling the story formulaic and the production values " threadbare " , and further adding that they dreaded the idea of it inspiring an actual live @-@ action film on the series in light of Capcom 's Street Fighter : The Legend of Chun @-@ Li . 
 = = = Post @-@ release = = = 
 In contrast , the full film has been well received by the media . GamesRadar praised the idea of the film , stating that if produced it would be " the best movie since Piranha 3D " and calling it " good enough for grown @-@ ups " . In a further discussion via their Pokémon Monday cast , the three editors involved praised the film as " very well done " . While one editor stated disdain for the appearance of the various Pokémon in the film , they agreed that in any live @-@ action adaptation the creatures would " always look weird " , and that for a film with a lack of budget they were done very well . They also praised the attention of detail , and praised David Quast 's portrayal of Giovanni , as well as the presentation of recurring anime villains Jessie , James and Meowth . Editor Carolyn Gudmundson added that she was uncomfortable with the grittiness of the production , though praised it for presenting out the inherent problem of the concept behind the games and its similarity to dog fighting . 
 The Escapist shared similar sentiments , calling the film " amazing " and stating their desire to see the mock @-@ trailer expanded into a full film despite it being contrary to Nintendo 's vision of the series ; " Why can 't anything this cool ever come through official channels ? " Joystiq commented that it was " long , long overdue " and called the completed results delightful , questioning why such a project had not been properly attempted years prior . Kotaku added that while the " leaked " segment hid the flaws in the film 's effects , it hurt the film by hiding the " hammy charm " of the completed project . Though Game Informer criticized the original segment , they heavily praised the full film , describing it as " what the franchise could look like if Peter Jackson , Martin Scorsese , and Jerry Bruckheimer all teamed up " . Topless Robot stated that while the original preview had nearly sabotaged the final production 's appeal , they called it " awesome " and described it as taking " Pokémon battles to its inevitable , cock @-@ fighting end " . Cinemablend stated that while the content was out of place with Nintendo 's presentation of the series , they found the finished product still " pretty cool " , further praising the effects and the approach taken towards the material . 
 = Ohio State Route 369 = 
 State Route 369 ( SR 369 ) is a short , two @-@ lane north – south state highway in the western portion of the U.S. state of Ohio . The southern terminus of SR 369 is at an interchange with SR 4 approximately two and a half miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of <unk> . Its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) nearly one and a half miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) east of <unk> . SR 369 was created in the mid @-@ 1930s . In addition to serving as a connector between SR 4 and US 40 southwest of Springfield , it provides access to a county park named in honor of George Rogers Clark . 
 = = Route description = = 
 All of SR 369 is situated within Bethel Township in the southwestern quadrant of Clark County . The route starts at an interchange with SR 4 approximately two and a half miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of <unk> . SR 369 serves as a continuation of Lower Valley Pike , which enters the interchange from the North of SR 4 , the west side of SR 369 abuts a residential subdivision , while the east side of the route straddles the western portion of the county – maintained George Rogers Clark Park . As the highway proceeds north of the park boundary , both sides of the highway are lined with houses , leading up to the point where it comes to an end at US 40 nearly one and a half miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) east of <unk> . Continuing to the north of the U.S. route following the terminus of SR 369 is Tecumseh Road . 
 SR 369 is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) . As a part of its duties in maintaining this highway , ODOT tracks the volume of traffic using it by a metric called the average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This measurement determines the amount of traffic utilizing a particular stretch of the roadway on a typical day of the year . A 2008 AADT report shows that the busiest stretch of SR 369 is the portion in the vicinity of the SR 4 interchange , at the Lower Valley Pike transition , where typically 2 @,@ 900 passenger vehicles and 220 commercial vehicles use the highway on a daily basis . The AADT along the portion of SR 369 between SR 4 and US 40 was determined to be 1 @,@ 580 passenger vehicles and 120 commercial vehicles . SR 369 is not included within the National Highway System . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 369 was first designated in 1934 . Originally , the route was a spur route off of US 40 that served George Rogers Clark Park . In 1959 , with the relocation of SR 4 onto a new freeway alignment along the north side of the Mad River through this vicinity , the southern terminus of SR 369 was reconfigured such that the highway met the new freeway at an interchange at the south end of the park .

 Tropical Storm Chris caused minor flooding in the Greater Antilles and the Eastern United States in August 1988 . The seventh tropical cyclone and third named storm of the annual hurricane season , Chris developed from a tropical wave while roughly midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on August 21 . Forming as a tropical depression , it remained weak for several days , crossing the Lesser Antilles , Hispaniola , and The Bahamas during this time . While offshore the coast of Florida on August 28 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chris . Thereafter , the system tracked rapidly north @-@ northwestward and came ashore near Savannah , Georgia later that day . Once inland , Chris quickly weakened , and by early on the following day , it weakened to a tropical depression over South Carolina . Six hours later , Chris was absorbed by a cold front while over North Carolina , though the remnants of the system tracked across the Eastern United States and Atlantic Canada before dissipating on August 30 . 
 In the Leeward Islands and U.S. Virgin Islands , Chris produced only light rainfall , that caused no damage or fatalities . Heavy rainfall occurred in Puerto Rico , which damaged 100 homes and caused three fatalities . Large amounts of precipitation also fell in Hispaniola , though no damage was reported . In the United States , much of the damage occurred due to tornadoes , especially in The Carolinas . A tornado in South Carolina destroyed at least 15 mobile homes , caused one fatality , and resulted in a brief shutdown of U.S. Route 301 . Flooding was minimal , as rainfall totals amounted to 5 inches ( 130 mm ) or less , though standing water was reported on Interstate 26 . Another destructive tornado occurred in Virginia . Two additional deaths were reported in New York , two from drowning and one from a tree falling onto a car . Although winds were light , at least 118 @,@ 000 people from South Carolina to Maine were left without electricity . The dissipating storm produced light winds and precipitation in Nova Scotia . Overall , Tropical Storm Chris was attributed to four fatalities and $ 2 @.@ 25 million ( 1988 USD ) in losses .

 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 15 . Six days later , the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven while centered halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa . The depression tracked west @-@ northwestward around the periphery of a subtropical surface high pressure ridge . After strengthening minimally , the depression struck Guadeloupe late on August 23 and entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter . Although satellite intensity estimates indicated tropical storm status , 13 reconnaissance flights conducted by the National Hurricane Center between August 23 and August 27 indicated winds were less than 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . By August 25 , the depression made landfall near Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic . Despite the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola , the depression did not weakened and re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic from the northern coast of Haiti early on August 26 . The depression curved northwestward and did not strengthen . On August 27 , the depression made another landfall near Andros Town on Andros , Bahamas . Later that day , the depression passed less than 25 miles ( 40 km ) east of West Palm Beach , Florida . Thereafter , the depression curved north @-@ northwestward and remained offshore of Florida . 
 At 0600 UTC on August 28 , a ship located about 93 miles ( 150 km ) from the center of the depression reported tropical storm force winds . As a result , the depression was finally upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris . Tracking rapidly north @-@ northeastward , Chris attained its peak intensity about six hours later , with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 006 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The storm made its final landfall near Savannah , Georgia with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) at 1500 UTC on August 28 . After moving inland , Chris quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical depression near Columbia , South Carolina on August 29 . Shortly thereafter , Chris merged with a cold front over North Carolina . The remnants of Chris tracked east @-@ northeastward across the Eastern United States . Eventually , the remnants briefly re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic from New England , then moved across Nova Scotia before dissipating near Cape Breton on August 30 .

 In preparation of the tropical depression , officials in Puerto Rico closed public schools and sent federal workers home early . At 1000 UTC on August 28 , a tropical storm watch was issued for Edisto Beach , South Carolina , to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . Two hours later , areas from Savannah , Georgia , to Cape Hatteras North Carolina , were placed under a tropical storm warning . They were later discontinued at an unknown time . Residents of Charleston , South Carolina , complained of little warning in advance of the storm . However , as Chris moved ashore only nine hours after becoming a tropical storm , there was minimal time for preparations .

 = Don 't Look Now = 
 Don 't Look Now is a 1973 independent British @-@ Italian film directed by Nicolas Roeg . It is a thriller adapted from the short story by Daphne du Maurier . Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland star as a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter , after the husband accepts a commission to restore a church . They encounter two sisters , one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger . The husband at first dismisses their claims , but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself . 
 While Don 't Look Now observes many conventions of the thriller genre , its primary focus is on the psychology of grief , and the effect the death of a child can have on a relationship . Its emotionally convincing depiction of grief is often singled out as a trait not usually present in films featuring supernatural plot elements . 
 As well as the unusual handling of its subject matter , Don 't Look Now is renowned for its innovative editing style , and its use of recurring motifs and themes . The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition , but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer 's perception of what is really happening . It also adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery , often presaging events with familiar objects , patterns and colours using associative editing techniques . 
 Originally causing controversy on its initial release due to an explicit and — for the time — very graphic sex scene between Christie and Sutherland , its reputation has grown considerably in the years since , and it is now acknowledged as a modern classic and an influential work in horror and British film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Some time after the drowning of their young daughter , Christine ( Sharon Williams ) , in a tragic accident at their English country home , John Baxter ( Donald Sutherland ) and his grief @-@ stricken wife , Laura ( Julie Christie ) , take a trip to Venice after John accepts a commission from a bishop ( Massimo <unk> ) to restore an ancient church . Laura encounters two elderly sisters , Heather ( Hilary Mason ) and Wendy ( <unk> Matania ) , at a restaurant where she and John are dining ; Heather claims to be psychic and — despite being blind — informs Laura she is able to " see " the Baxters ' deceased daughter . Shaken , Laura returns to her table , where she faints . 
 Laura is taken to the hospital , where she later tells John what Heather told her . John is sceptical but pleasantly surprised by the positive change in Laura 's demeanour . Later in the evening after returning from the hospital , John and Laura engage in passionate sexual intercourse . Afterwards , they go out to dinner where they get lost and briefly become separated . John catches a glimpse of what appears to be a small child ( Adelina <unk> ) wearing a red coat similar to the one Christine was wearing when she died . 
 The next day , Laura meets with Heather and Wendy , who hold a séance to try to contact Christine . When she returns to the hotel Laura informs John that Christine has said he is in danger and must leave Venice . John loses his temper with Laura , but that night they receive a telephone call informing them that their son ( Nicholas Salter ) has been injured in an accident at his boarding school . Laura departs for England , while John stays on to complete the restoration . Under the assumption that Laura is in England , John is shocked when later that day he spots her on a <unk> that is part of a funeral cortege , accompanied by the two sisters . Concerned about his wife 's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice , he reports Laura 's disappearance to the police . The inspector ( Renato Scarpa ) investigating the killings is suspicious of John and has him followed . 
 After conducting a futile search for Laura and the sisters — in which he again sees the childlike figure in the red coat — John contacts his son 's school to enquire about his condition , only to discover Laura is already there . After speaking to her to confirm she really is in England , a bewildered John returns to the police station to inform the police he has found his wife . In the meantime the police have brought Heather in for questioning , so an apologetic John offers to escort her back to the hotel . 
 Shortly after returning , Heather slips into a trance so John makes his excuses and quickly leaves . Upon coming out of it she beseeches her sister to go after John , sensing that something terrible is about to happen , but Wendy is unable to catch up with him . Meanwhile , John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it . He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches it , believing it to be a child . Instead , it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf , and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat . As the life drains from him , John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral .

 Don 't Look Now ostensibly is an occult thriller , but the genre conventions of the Gothic ghost story primarily serve to explore the minds of a grief @-@ stricken couple . The film 's director , Nicolas Roeg , was intrigued by the idea of making " grief into the sole thrust of the film " , noting that " Grief can separate people ... Even the closest , healthiest relationship can come undone through grief . " The presence of Christine , the Baxters ' deceased daughter , weighs heavily on the mood of the film , as she and the nature of her death are constantly recalled through the film 's imagery : there are regular flashbacks to Christine playing in her red coat as well as the sightings of the mysterious childlike figure also wearing a red coat which bears a likeness to her ; the constant association of water with death is maintained via a serial @-@ killer sub @-@ plot , which sees victims periodically dragged from the canals ; there is also a poignant moment when John fishes a child 's doll out of a canal just as he did with his daughter 's body at the beginning of the film . 
 The associative use of recurring motifs combined with unorthodox editing techniques foreshadows key events in the film . In Daphne du Maurier 's novella it is Laura that wears a red coat , but in the film the colour is used to establish an association between Christine and the elusive figure that John keeps catching glimpses of . Du Maurier 's story actually opens in Venice following Christine 's death from meningitis , but the decision was taken to change the cause of death to drowning and to include a prologue to exploit the water motif . The threat of death from falling is also ever present throughout the film : besides Christine falling into the lake , Laura is taken to hospital after her fall in the restaurant , their son Johnny is injured in a fall at boarding school , the bishop overseeing the church restoration informs John that his father was killed in a fall , and John himself is nearly killed in a fall during the renovations . Glass is frequently used as an omen that something bad is about to occur : just before Christine drowns , John knocks a glass of water over , and Johnny breaks a pane of glass ; as Laura faints in the restaurant she knocks glassware off the table , and when John almost falls to his death in the church , a plank of wood shatters a pane of glass ; finally , shortly before confronting the mysterious red clad figure , John asks the sisters for a glass of water , a piece of symbolism that prefigured Christine 's death . 
 The plot of the film is preoccupied with misinterpretation and mistaken identity : when John sees Laura on the barge with the sisters , he fails to realise it is a premonition and believes Laura is in Venice with them . John himself is mistaken for a Peeping Tom when he follows Laura to the séance , and ultimately he mistakes the mysterious red @-@ coated figure for a child . The concept of Doppelgänger and duplicates feature prominently in the film : reproductions are a constantly recurring motif ranging from reflections in the water , to photographs , to police sketches and the photographic slides of the church John is restoring . Laura comments in a letter to their son that she can 't tell the difference between the restored church windows and the " real thing " , and later in the film John attempts to make a seamless match between recently manufactured tiles and the old ones in repairing an ancient mosaic . Roeg describes the basic premise of the story as principally being that in life " nothing is what it seems " , and even decided to have Donald Sutherland 's character utter the line — a scene which required fifteen takes . 
 Communication is a theme that runs through much of Nicolas Roeg 's work , and figures heavily in Don 't Look Now . This is best exemplified by the blind psychic woman , Heather , who communicates with the dead , but it is presented in other ways : the language barriers are purposefully enhanced by the decision to not include subtitles translating the Italian dialogue into English , so the viewer experiences the same confusion as John . Women are presented as better at communicating than men : besides the clairvoyant being female , it is Laura who stays in regular contact with their son , Johnny ; when the Baxters receive a phone call informing them of Johnny 's accident at the boarding school , the headmaster 's <unk> in explaining the situation causes his wife to intercept and explain instead . 
 Much has been made of the fragmented editing of Don 't Look Now , and Nicolas Roeg 's work in general . Time is presented as ' fluid ' , where the past , present and future can all exist in the same timeframe . John 's premonitions merge with the present , such as at the start of the film where the mysterious red @-@ coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides , and when he ' sees ' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present , but in fact it is a vision of the future . The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene , in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner . After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments , the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback , which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes . At a narrative level the plot of Don 't Look Now can be regarded as a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy : it is John 's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death . According to the editor of the film , Graeme Clifford , Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his " exercise in film grammar " . 
 = = = Inspirations = = = 
 Don 't Look Now is particularly indebted to Alfred Hitchcock , exhibiting several characteristics of the director 's work . The aural match cut following Christine 's death from Laura 's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps , when a woman 's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train . When John reports Laura 's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes a suspect in the murder case they are investigating — an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait . The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène , by manifesting its protagonist 's psychology in plot developments : in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy , and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice ; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings , and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her — both physical realisations of what is going on in his head . 
 Nicolas Roeg had employed the fractured editing style of Don 't Look Now on his previous films , Performance and Walkabout , but it was originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia . Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia , which incidentally also starred Julie Christie , and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg . Roeg 's use of colour — especially red — can be traced back to earlier work : both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red , similar in nature to the scene during Christine 's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it — along with the whole screen — turn completely red . The mysterious red @-@ coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer , The Masque of the Red Death , which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character . The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red @-@ coated figure possibly draw on Proust : in Remembrance of Things Past , while in Venice , the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love . 
 Besides Proust , other possible literary influences include Borges and Nietzsche ; Pauline Kael in her review comments that " Roeg comes closer to getting Borges on the screen than those who have tried it directly " , while Mark Sanderson in his BFI Modern Classics essay on the film , finds parallels with Nietzsche 's Beyond Good and Evil . 
 = = Production = = 
 Don 't Look Now was produced by Peter Katz through London based Casey Productions and Rome based Eldorado Films . The script based on the short story by Daphne du Maurier was offered to Nicolas Roeg by scriptwriter Allan Scott , who had co @-@ written the screenplay with Chris Bryant , while Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland were cast in the principal roles . Filming began in England in December 1972 , breaking off for Christmas , and resuming in January 1973 for seven more weeks in Italy . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Don 't Look Now was to be Nicolas Roeg 's third directorial feature following Performance and Walkabout . Although real @-@ life couple Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner were suggested for the parts of Laura and John Baxter , Roeg was eager to cast Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland from the very start . Initially engaged by other projects both actors unexpectedly became available . Christie liked the script and was keen to work with Roeg who had served as cinematographer on Fahrenheit 451 , Far from the Madding Crowd and Petulia in which she had starred . Sutherland also wanted to make the film but had some reservations about the depiction of clairvoyance in the script . He felt it was handled too negatively and believed that Don 't Look Now should be a more " educative film " , and that the " characters should in some way benefit from ESP and not be destroyed by it " . Roeg was resistant to any changes and issued Sutherland with an ultimatum . 
 Roeg wanted Julie Christie to attend a séance prior to filming . Leslie Flint , a direct voice medium based in Notting Hill , invited them to attend a session which he was holding for some American <unk> , who were coming over to observe him . Roeg and Christie went along and sat in a circle in the pitch dark and joined hands . Flint instructed his guests to " <unk> " their legs , which Roeg subsequently incorporated into the film . 
 Adelina <unk> was cast as the fleeting red @-@ coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome . Standing at only 4 ' 2 " tall , she had a career as a singer . Renato Scarpa was cast as Inspector Longhi , despite not being able to speak English and so he had no idea what he was saying in the film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The drowning scene and house exteriors were filmed in Hertfordshire at the home of actor David Tree , who also plays the headmaster at the son 's boarding school . Shooting the sequence was particularly problematic : Sharon Williams , who played Christine , became hysterical when submersed in the pond , despite the rehearsals at the swimming pool going well . A farmer on the neighbouring land volunteered his daughter who was an accomplished swimmer , but who refused to be submersed when it came to filming . In the end , the scene was filmed in a water tank using three girls . Nicolas Roeg and editor Graeme Clifford showed the opening sequence to some friends before filming resumed on the Venice segment , and Clifford recalls it making a considerable impression . 
 The Venice locations included the Hotel Gabrielli <unk> — the lobby and exteriors standing in for the film 's fictional Europa Hotel , although the Baxters ' suite was located at the Bauer Grunwald ( which better accommodated the cameras ) — and the San Nicolò dei <unk> ( the Church of St. Nicholas " of the beggars " ) , located on the outskirts of Venice . Finding an appropriate church proved difficult : after visiting most of the churches in Venice , the Italian location manager suggested constructing one in a warehouse . The discovery of San Nicolò was particularly fortuitous since it was currently being renovated and the scaffolding was already in place , the circumstances lending themselves well to the plot of the film . Roeg decided not to use traditional tourist locations to purposefully avoid a " travel documentary " look . Venice turned out to be a difficult place to film in , mainly due to the tides which caused problems with the continuity and transporting equipment . 
 Filming the scene in which John almost falls to his death while restoring the mosaic in San Nicolò church was also beset by problems , and resulted in Donald Sutherland 's life being put in danger . The scene entailed some of the scaffolding collapsing leaving John dangling by a rope , but the stuntman refused to perform the stunt because the insurance was not in order . Sutherland ended up doing it instead , and was attached to a <unk> wire as a precaution in case he should fall . Some time after the film had come out , renowned stunt co @-@ ordinator Vic Armstrong commented to Sutherland that the wire was not designed for that purpose , and the twirling around caused by holding on to the rope would have damaged the wire to the extent it would have snapped if Sutherland had let go . 
 While many of the changes were down to the logistics of filming in Venice , some were for creative reasons , the most prominent being the inclusion of the famous love scene . The scene was in fact an unscripted last minute improvisation by Roeg , who felt that without it there would be too many scenes of the couple arguing . The scene set in the church where Laura lights a candle for Christine was mostly improvised too . Originally intended to show the gulf between John 's and Laura 's mental states — John 's denial and Laura 's inability to let go — the script included two pages of dialogue to illustrate John 's unease at Laura 's marked display of grief . After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment , Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church , to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being " silly " , and the church was " beautiful " . Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life in terms of what the characters would actually say to each other , and that the scripted version was " overwritten " , so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real @-@ life exchange instead . 
 The funeral scene at the end of the film was also played differently from what was originally intended . Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face , but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene . Christie was initially sceptical , but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife . 
 = = = Scoring = = = 
 The score was composed by Pino Donaggio , a native Venetian who was a popular singer at the time ( he had a hit with " lo Che Non Vivo " which was covered by Dusty Springfield in 1966 as " You Don 't Have to Say You Love Me " ) ; prior to Don 't Look Now , Donaggio had never scored a film . Ugo Mariotti , a producer on the film , spotted Donaggio on a Vaporetto on the Grand Canal in Venice , and believing it to be a " sign " contacted him to see if he would be interested in working on the film . Donaggio was reluctant at first because he did not understand why they would be interested in someone who had no experience of scoring films . 
 Donaggio had no interest in making soundtracks for films at the time , but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film . Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London @-@ based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films . The film 's financiers were pleased with Donaggio 's work and overruled the producers . As well as composing the score , Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself . The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio , despite the fact that he was not very accomplished at playing the piano . The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film , and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano . Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano , the pieces had an unsure style to them , perfect for the effect they were trying to capture . 
 The only disagreement over the musical direction of the film was for the score accompanying the love scene . Donaggio composed a grand orchestral piece , but Roeg thought the effect was overkill , and wanted it toned down . In the end the scene just used a combination of the piano , the flute , an acoustic guitar and an acoustic bass guitar . The piano was played by Donaggio again , who also played the flute ; in contrast to his skill as a pianist , Donaggio was a renowned flautist , famous for it at the conservatory . Donaggio conceded that the more low @-@ key theme worked better in the sequence and ditched the high strings orchestral piece , reworking it for the funeral scene at the end of the film .
