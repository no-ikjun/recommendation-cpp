 An 1895 newspaper description of the furnishings of the mansion relates there are several hunting trophies displayed in the entrance hall . The antler from an elk 's skeleton , which had been found buried in the family 's Fermoy estate , was mounted in the hall and the width between the tips was reported as more than 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) . The dimensions for the long gallery are given as 125 feet ( 38 m ) long with a ceiling height of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) and 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide . Decorated in a deep maroon , steel engravings , drawings and old prints adorn the walls . It was furnished with antiques and an organ was the centrepiece . Some of the first floor rooms accessed from the gallery were a Ballroom and a Drawing Room . Three arches separated these two rooms and the side arches were fitted with mirrors . Silk damask in a light blue shade was the Ball Room wall covering while satin of a light green colour was used in the Drawing Room . Among the paintings displayed in the Dining Room were family portraits by Henry Raeburn and a painting by John Hoppner was in the Library .

 The gardens and policies were added to the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland in 2011 because it is an " all @-@ round , outstanding designed landscape " . Designated as " outstanding " within six of the seven categories ( work of art , historical , horticultural , architectural , scenic and archaeological ) , it is listed as of high importance in the assessment for the nature conservancy listing . 
 To the northwest of the mansion is a 15 metres ( 49 ft ) square walled garden . Enclosed inside the 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high perimeter walls are greenhouses and outside are several lean @-@ to stores , potting sheds and a single storey cottage for the gardener . Category C listed on 15 February 1982 , these structures were also designed by Smith in the 19th @-@ century . 
 Several other structures within the policies are listed . These include the Category B listed Gothic style mausoleum constructed in 1865 at a cost of £ 2 @,@ 500 , equivalent to around £ 266 @,@ 000 as at 2012 . Built in the shape of a cross , it has a round stained glass window in the front gable and features many gargoyles and other stone decorations . Bodies are interred in the burial ground outside but commemorative stones made of Carrara marble are inside the mausoleum . The corbels on the internal oak roof are embellished with angel figurines . 
 Among other Category B listed structures are the stables and coach house situated to the south of the mansion . This group of buildings are given as constructed c . 1840 by Historic Scotland but Miller attributes them as being from the time of the previous mansion . The brick built Dovecot , from the early 19th @-@ century and the Eastside and North Lodge houses from c . 1865 are also Category B listed . 
 In 1906 some excavation work was undertaken by Scottish archaeologist J. Graham Callander on a circular tumulus that is within the estate , just over half a mile to the south of the mansion . The mound , in a wooded area known as <unk> Wood , is 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) in height and c . 64 feet ( 20 m ) wide . Various relicts and urns were discovered including three drinking @-@ cup type urns , some of the " highest quality " .

 = Donald William Kerst = 
 Donald William Kerst ( November 1 , 1911 – August 19 , 1993 ) was an American physicist who worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts ( accelerator physics ) and plasma physics . He is most notable for his development of the betatron , a novel type of particle accelerator used to accelerate electrons . 
 A graduate of the University of Wisconsin , Kerst developed the first betatron at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign , where it became operational on July 15 , 1940 . During World War II , Kerst took a leave of absence in 1940 and 1941 to work on it with the engineering staff at General Electric , and he designed a portable betatron for inspecting dud bombs . In 1943 he joined the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory , where he was responsible for designing and building the Water Boiler , a nuclear reactor intended to serve as a laboratory instrument . 
 From 1953 to 1957 Kerst was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association , where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts , most notably the <unk> accelerator . He was then employed at General Atomics 's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory from 1957 to 1962 , where he worked on the problem of plasma physics . With <unk> Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields . Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs , and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Donald William Kerst was born in Galena , Illinois November 1 , 1911 , the son of Herman Samuel Kerst and Lillian E <unk> . He entered the University of Wisconsin , where he earned a Bachelor of Arts ( BA ) degree in 1934 , and then his Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD ) in 1937 , writing his thesis on " The Development of Electrostatic Generators in Air Pressure and Applications to Excitation Functions of Nuclear Reactions " . This involved building and testing a 2 @.@ 3 MeV generator for experiments with the scattering of protons . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 After graduation , Kerst worked at General Electric Company for a year , working on the development of x @-@ ray tubes and machines . He found this frustrating , as x @-@ ray research required high energies that could not be produced at the time . In 1938 he accepted an offer of an <unk> at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign , where the head of the physics department , F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator . The result of these efforts was the betatron . When it became operational on July 15 , 1940 , Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction , reaching energies of 2 @.@ 3 MeV . 
 It took longer to name the device . Colleagues suggested names such as the German " <unk> " . In December 1941 Kerst decided on " betatron " , using the Greek letter " beta " , which was the symbol for electrons , and " tron " meaning " instrument for " . He went on to build more <unk> of increasing energy , a 20 MeV machine in 1941 , an 80 MeV in 1948 , and a 340 MeV machine , which was completed in 1950 . 
 The betatron would influence all subsequent accelerators . Its success was due to a thorough understanding of the physics involved , and painstaking design of the magnets , vacuum pumps and power supply . In 1941 , he teamed up with Robert Serber to provide the first theoretical analysis of the oscillations that occur in a betatron . The original 1940 machine was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1960 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 During World War II , Kerst took a leave of absence from the University of Illinois to work on the development of the betatron with the engineering staff at General Electric in 1940 and 1941 . They designed 20 MeV and 100 MeV versions of the betatron , and he supervised the construction of the former , which he brought back to the University of Illinois with him . He also designed a portable 4 MeV betatron for inspecting dud bombs . 
 Kerst 's engineering and physics background placed him near the top of the list of scientists that Robert Oppenheimer recruited for the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory , which was set up to design the atomic bomb . In August 1943 , Kerst was placed in charge of the Laboratory 's P @-@ 7 Group , which was responsible for designing and building the Water Boiler , a nuclear reactor intended to serve as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials . Primarily drawn from Purdue University , his group included Charles P. Baker , Gerhart Friedlander , Lindsay Helmholtz , Marshall Holloway , and Raemer Schreiber . Robert F. Christy provided help with the theoretical calculations . 
 Kerst designed an aqueous homogeneous reactor in which enriched uranium in the form of soluble uranium sulfate , was dissolved in water , and surrounded by a beryllium oxide neutron reflector . It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel , and required most of the world 's meager supply at the time . A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944 , and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May . By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals . 
 The Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to concentrate on creating an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon . Studying implosion on a large scale , or even a full scale , required special diagnostic methods . As early as November 1943 , Kerst suggested using a betatron employing 20 MeV gamma rays instead of x @-@ rays to study implosion . In the August 1944 reorganization , he became joint head , with Seth Neddermeyer , of the G @-@ 5 Group , part of Robert Bacher 's G ( Gadget ) Division specifically charged with betatron testing . Oppenheimer had the 20 MeV betatron at the University of Illinois shipped to Los Alamos , where it arrived in December . On January 15 , 1945 , the G @-@ 5 Group took their first betatron pictures of an implosion . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Kerst returned to the University of Illinois after the war . From 1953 to 1957 he was technical director of the Midwestern Universities Research Association , where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts , most notably the <unk> accelerator . He developed the spiral @-@ sector focusing principle , which lies at the heart of many spiral ridge cyclotrons that are now in operation around the world . His team devised and analysed beam stacking , a process of radio frequency acceleration in fixed field machines that led to the development of the colliding beam accelerators . 
 From 1957 to 1962 Kerst was employed at the General Atomics division of General Dynamics 's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science in La Jolla , California , where he worked on plasma physics , which it was hoped was the doorway to the control of thermonuclear energy . With <unk> Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields . The two completed this work at the University of Wisconsin , where Kerst was a professor from 1962 until his retirement in 1980 . Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs , and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit . From 1972 to 1973 he was also chairman of the Plasma Physics Division of the American Physical Society . 
 Kerst was married to Dorothy Birkett Kerst . They had two children , a daughter , Marilyn , and a son , Stephen . After he retired , Kerst and Dorothy moved to Fort Myers , Florida . He died on August 19 , 1993 at the University Hospital and Clinics in Madison , Wisconsin , from a brain tumor . He was survived by his wife and children . His papers are in the University of Illinois Archives .

 = Naborr = 
 Naborr ( April 3 , 1950 – November 9 , 1977 ) , originally named Nabor , was a gray Arabian stallion foaled in Russia at the Tersk Stud . He was sired by Negatiw , a Russian @-@ bred stallion with Crabbet ancestry , out of the Polish @-@ bred mare Lagodna . After establishing himself on the race track and show ring in the former USSR , Naborr was exported to Poland , where he lived for seven years , and from there was purchased for import to the United States by a wealthy Arabian horse breeder from Arizona , Anne McCormick . Upon her death , Naborr was sold in 1969 to Tom Chauncey and Wayne Newton for $ 150 @,@ 000 , which was at the time the highest price ever paid for an Arabian horse at auction . He went on to become a leading sire of champion Arabian horses in the United States and Canada . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 Naborr was foaled at Russia 's Tersk Stud on April 13 , 1950 , and was originally named Nabor . He was sired by the Russian @-@ born stallion Negatiw ( sometimes spelled <unk> ) and out of the mare Lagodna . He was a homozygous gray , and was recorded by the Russian Arabian Stud Book as standing 150 centimetres ( 14 @.@ 3 hands ; 59 in ) . As a two @-@ year @-@ old , Nabor raced at <unk> and won two times out of eight starts . His highest recorded speeds were 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) in 1 : 54 , 1 @,@ 600 metres ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) in 1 : 55 , and 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) in 2 : 10 . His accomplishments at the track qualified him to become a breeding stallion at Tersk . At age four , he was awarded a " certificate of the first class " , equivalent to a Reserve Champion , at the All @-@ Union Agricultural Fair in Moscow in a competition open to all breeds of horses . His sire Negatiw was the champion . Nabor sired nine foals in Russia , but only one , a colt , was registered . 
 In 1955 , Nabor was sold to Poland . The Polish were rebuilding their Arabian breeding program following World War II , and wanted a stallion that would restore the Ibrahim sire line to their national studs . Ibrahim was a desert @-@ bred stallion brought to Poland in 1907 by Count Joseph Potocki . The horse was killed in 1917 during the Bolshevik Revolution , and by the end of World War II , the sire line had been lost to Poland . It was preserved via Ibrahim 's son Skowronek , who had been exported to England in 1912 , and Skowronek was the great @-@ grandsire of Nabor . In Poland , Nabor was first put to stud at the <unk> State Stud , then in 1957 moved to the Michalow State Stud . While in Poland , he was noted for his docile temperament , intelligence , soundness , and <unk> @-@ style Arabian beauty : " dry , fine head with expressive eye , swan neck and milk @-@ white hair unusual for his age ... he resembled the Arabian horses painted by Juliusz Kossak , the best painter of oriental horses . " In 1962 , the Poles were also able to import his sire Negatiw . 
 Nabor stayed at Michalow until January 1963 , when he was purchased and imported to America by the heiress Anne " Fifi " McCormick . Upon arrival in America , Nabor 's registered name became Naborr . Naborr came to America via ship , along with 15 other Polish @-@ bred Arabians , including Bask . The voyage lasted 44 days and was rough because the ship encountered a storm at sea . They also ran low on hay . 13 @-@ year @-@ old Naborr came through the trip fairly well but lost 50 pounds . One other horse , a mare , aborted her foal and died , and most of the other horses lost a great deal more weight than did Naborr . McCormick only stood Naborr to her own mares and those of a few select friends , and as a result , under McCormick 's ownership , he only sired about 10 foals per year , a total of 82 foals . Because Naborr 's stud book was closed to outside mares , breeders seeking his bloodlines returned to Poland and purchased several of his offspring bred there , including the mare * <unk> and stallions * Gwalior , * <unk> , and * Aramus . A total of 27 of Naborr 's offspring were imported from Poland to the United States . 
 When McCormick died at age 90 , in 1969 , the terms of her will called for her Arabians to be sold at public auction . In October , 1969 Tom Chauncey , a television station owner , rancher and horse breeder in the Phoenix area , agreed to team up with Wayne Newton and purchased Naborr at the McCormick estate auction . Chauncey paid $ 150 @,@ 000 , which at the time was the highest price ever paid for an Arabian horse at auction in America , and brought in Newton as a partner on the horse a month later . Chauncey had previously bred Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses , but already owned a few Arabians that he kept on his ranch . He initially stabled Naborr at Newton 's more suitable barn , but built his own facility near Scottsdale , Arizona , and bought out Newton 's share in 1971 . In the same period , Newton formed a partnership with other Arabian breeders to purchase * Aramus , who was a son of Naborr . When Aramus was named National Champion Stallion in 1970 , Naborr 's stud fee was advertised at $ 10 @,@ 000 . That same year , Naborr was brought to the U.S. Arabian National Championship show and honored before the spectators there as one of 10 " Living Legends " . In 1975 he was the fourth @-@ leading sire of champions in the United States . Under Chauncey 's ownership , he sired another 260 foals . 
 His high purchase price and coverage in mainstream national news outlets was credited as the beginning of a " bubble " of high auction prices paid for Arabian horses . Naborr had the distinction of being the first Russian @-@ bred Arabian to have offspring registered in the United States . Due to his importation from Poland , he could be registered , as the Russian Arabian Stud Book was not approved by the World Arabian Horse Association until 1978 . Naborr died on November 9 , 1977 ; he was 27 years old . In his final year of life , he sired 36 foals , the last of which was born on October 1 , 1978 . 
 = = Offspring and legacy = = 
 Combining his imported offspring and American @-@ born foals , Naborr sired 365 horses registered in the United States . By the end of 1967 , 61 of his offspring had won 693 show championships among them . The number of wins later doubled . In 1981 , Naborr was tied for third as the leading sire of U.S. and Canadian National Champions . By 1999 , statistics showed that 1130 championships had been won by 121 of his offspring . Of these horses , 46 of them earned Top Ten or higher honors at the U.S. and Canadian National Arabian Championships . 
 Naborr 's winning offspring included his son <unk> , who was a Canadian National Champion Stallion in halter and western pleasure , and reserve U.S. National Champion stallion as well as Senior European Male Champion at the Salon du Cheval in France in 1979 . Other sons and daughters had championship careers as well . The Naborr son * Aramus , foaled in Poland and imported to the United States , became a U.S. and Canadian National Champion Stallion in both halter and performance , showing in formal driving and as a park horse . Naborr 's son Gai @-@ Adventure was U.S. National Champion stallion in 1974 . His daughter , * <unk> , was a U.S. and Canadian National Champion Mare . Other national champion offspring in performance disciplines included Riffle , a park and formal driving horse , and Ibn Naborr , Canadian National Champion Stock Horse . 
 = = Pedigree = = 
 Through his sire Negatiw , Naborr was a grandson of the Skowronek son Naseem , who had been sold to Russia in 1936 by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud for a price estimated at ₤ 50 @,@ 000 . His dam Lagodna was foaled in Poland and the Russians captured her and a number of other Arabians during World War II and brought her to Tersk . Also amongst the captured horses were Naborr 's ancestors <unk> , Gazella II , and <unk> Bey . Via his sire line to <unk> , as well as through Lagodna 's sire <unk> , and the mare <unk> , Naborr carries three crosses to the stallion Ibrahim . 
 = Ruthenium = 
 Ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44 . It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table . Like the other metals of the platinum group , ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals . The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland , the Russian Empire ( one of Russia 's Latin names is Ruthenia ) . Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores ; the annual production is about 20 tonnes . Most ruthenium produced is used in wear @-@ resistant electrical contacts and thick @-@ film resistors . A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 A polyvalent hard white metal , ruthenium is a member of the platinum group and is in group 8 of the periodic table : 
 Whereas all other group 8 elements have 2 electrons in the outermost shell , in ruthenium , the outermost shell has only one electron ( the final electron is in a lower shell ) . This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals , niobium ( 41 ) , rhodium ( 45 ) , and palladium ( 46 ) . 
 Ruthenium has four crystal modifications and does not tarnish unless subject to high temperatures . Ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis to give <unk> ( RuO2 − 
 4 ) , is not attacked by acids ( even aqua regia ) but is attacked by halogens at high temperatures . Indeed , ruthenium is most readily attacked by oxidizing agents . Small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of platinum and palladium . The corrosion resistance of titanium is increased markedly by the addition of a small amount of ruthenium . The metal can be plated by electroplating and by thermal decomposition . A ruthenium @-@ molybdenum alloy is known to be superconductive at temperatures below 10 @.@ 6 K. Ruthenium is the last of the 4d transition metals that can assume the group oxidation state + 8 , and even then is less stable there than the heavier congener osmium : this is the first group from the left of the table where the second and third @-@ row transition metals display notable differences in chemical behavior . Like iron but unlike osmium , ruthenium can form aqueous cations in its lower oxidation states of + 2 and + 3 . 
 Ruthenium is the first in a downward trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum , because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding . ( Technetium , the previous element , has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half @-@ filled [ Kr ] <unk> configuration , though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a [ Kr ] <unk> configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series . ) Unlike the lighter congener iron , ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature , as iron also is above its Curie point . 
 The reduction potentials in acidic aqueous solution for some common ruthenium ions are shown below : 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Naturally occurring ruthenium is composed of seven stable isotopes . Additionally , 34 radioactive isotopes have been discovered . Of these radioisotopes , the most stable are <unk> with a half @-@ life of 373 @.@ 59 days , 103Ru with a half @-@ life of 39 @.@ 26 days and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 9 days . 
 Fifteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 89 @.@ 93 u ( <unk> ) to 114 @.@ 928 u ( <unk> ) . Most of these have half @-@ lives that are less than five minutes except <unk> ( half @-@ life : 1 @.@ 643 hours ) and <unk> ( half @-@ life : 4 @.@ 44 hours ) . 
 The primary decay mode before the most abundant isotope , <unk> , is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission . The primary decay product before <unk> is technetium and the primary decay product after is rhodium . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 As the 74th most abundant element in Earth 's crust , ruthenium is relatively rare , found in about 100 parts per trillion . This element is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America . Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury , Ontario , Canada , and in <unk> deposits in South Africa . The native form of ruthenium is a very rare mineral ( Ir replaces part of Ru in its structure ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Mining = = = 
 Roughly 12 tonnes of ruthenium are mined each year with world reserves estimated as 5 @,@ 000 tonnes . The composition of the mined platinum group metal ( PGM ) mixtures varies widely , depending on the geochemical formation . For example , the PGMs mined in South Africa contain on average 11 % ruthenium while the PGMs mined in the former USSR contain only 2 % ( 1992 ) . Ruthenium , osmium , and iridium are considered the minor platinum group metals . 
 Ruthenium , like the other platinum group metals , is obtained commercially as a by @-@ product from nickel , and copper , and platinum metals ore processing . During electrorefining of copper and nickel , noble metals such as silver , gold , and the platinum group metals precipitate as anode mud , the feedstock for the extraction . The metals are converted to ionized solutes by any of several methods , depending on the composition of the feedstock . One representative method is fusion with sodium peroxide followed by dissolution in aqua regia , and solution in a mixture of chlorine with hydrochloric acid . Osmium , ruthenium , rhodium , and iridium are insoluble in aqua regia and readily precipitate , leaving the other metals in solution . Rhodium is separated from the residue by treatment with molten sodium <unk> . The insoluble residue , containing Ru , Os , and Ir is treated with sodium oxide , in which Ir is insoluble , producing dissolved Ru and Os salts . After oxidation to the volatile oxides , <unk> 
 4 is separated from OsO 
 4 by precipitation of ( NH4 ) <unk> with ammonium chloride or by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile osmium tetroxide . Hydrogen is used to reduce ammonium ruthenium chloride yielding a powder . The first method to precipitate the ruthenium with ammonium chloride is similar to the procedure that Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston used . 
 Several methods are suitable for industrial scale production . In either case , the product is reduced using hydrogen , yielding the metal as a powder or sponge metal that can be treated with powder metallurgy techniques or argon @-@ arc welding . 
 = = = From used nuclear fuels = = = 
 Fission products of uranium @-@ 235 contain significant amounts of ruthenium and the lighter platinum group metals , and spent nuclear fuel is a potential source of ruthenium . The extraction and refinement is expensive and the radioactive isotopes of ruthenium require the spent fuel to be stored for multiple half @-@ lives of those isotopes . Those factors have so far discouraged large @-@ scale extraction , and none has been started . 
 = = Chemical compounds = = 
 The oxidation states of ruthenium range from 0 to + 8 , and − 2 . The properties of ruthenium and osmium compounds are often similar . The + 2 , + 3 , and + 4 states are the most common . The most prevalent precursor is ruthenium trichloride , a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically . 
 = = = Oxides and chalcogenides = = = 
 Ruthenium can be oxidized to ruthenium ( IV ) oxide ( RuO2 , oxidation state + 4 ) which can in turn be oxidized by sodium <unk> to the volatile yellow tetrahedral ruthenium tetroxide , RuO4 , an aggressive , strong oxidizing agent with structure and properties analogous to osmium tetroxide . Like osmium tetroxide , ruthenium tetroxide is a potent fixative and stain for electron microscopy of organic materials , and is mostly used to reveal the structure of polymer samples . <unk> ruthenate ( <unk> , + 6 ) , and potassium perruthenate ( <unk> , + 7 ) are also known . Unlike osmium tetroxide , ruthenium tetroxide is less stable and is strong enough as an oxidising agent to oxidise dilute hydrochloric acid and organic solvents like ethanol at room temperature , and is easily reduced to ruthenate ( RuO2 − 
 4 ) in aqueous alkaline solutions ; it decomposes to form the dioxide above 100 ° C. Unlike iron but like osmium , ruthenium does not form oxides in its lower + 2 and + 3 oxidation states . Ruthenium forms <unk> only when reacted directly with the chalcogens , which are diamagnetic semiconductors crystallizing in the pyrite structure and thus must contain ruthenium ( II ) . 
 Like iron , ruthenium does not readily form <unk> , and prefers to achieve high coordination numbers with hydroxide ions instead . Ruthenium tetroxide is reduced by cold dilute potassium hydroxide to form black potassium perruthenate , <unk> , with ruthenium in the + 7 oxidation state . Potassium perruthenate can also be produced by oxidising potassium ruthenate , <unk> , with chlorine gas . The perruthenate ion is unstable and is reduced by water to form the orange ruthenate . Potassium ruthenate may be synthesized by reacting ruthenium metal with potassium hydroxide and potassium nitrate . 
 Some mixed oxides are also known , such as <unk> , <unk> , Na

 The highest known ruthenium halide is the hexafluoride , a dark brown solid that melts at 54 ° C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact with water and easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides , releasing fluorine gas . Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed , melting at 86 @.@ 5 ° C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine . Among the binary compounds of ruthenium , these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides . 
 Ruthenium trichloride is a well @-@ known compound , existing in a black α @-@ form and a dark brown β @-@ form : the <unk> is red . Of the known trihalides , trifluoride is dark brown and decomposes above 650 ° C , tetrabromide is dark @-@ brown and decomposes above 400 ° C , and triiodide is black . Of the dihalides , difluoride is not known , dichloride is brown , dibromide is black , and diiodide is blue . The only known <unk> is the pale green ruthenium ( VI ) oxyfluoride , <unk> . 
 = = = Coordination and organometallic complexes = = = 
 Ruthenium forms a variety of coordination complexes . Examples are the many <unk> derivatives [ Ru ( NH3 ) 5L ] n + that often exist for both Ru ( II ) and Ru ( III ) . Derivatives of bipyridine and <unk> are numerous , best known being the luminescent tris ( bipyridine ) ruthenium ( II ) chloride . 
 Ruthenium forms a wide range compounds with carbon @-@ ruthenium bonds . Grubbs ' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis . <unk> is analogous to ferrocene structurally , but exhibits distinctive redox properties . The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts in the absence of CO pressure to the dark red solid <unk> dodecacarbonyl . Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including <unk> ( CO ) ( PPh3 ) 3 and Ru ( CO ) 2 ( PPh3 ) 3 ( Roper 's complex ) . Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris ( triphenylphosphine ) ruthenium dichloride ( <unk> ( PPh3 ) 3 ) , which converts to the hydride complex <unk> ( triphenylphosphine ) ruthenium ( II ) ( <unk> ( PPh3 ) 3 ) .

That natural platinum contained palladium , rhodium , osmium and iridium was discovered in the first decade of the 19th century . Platinum in alluvial sands of Russian rivers gave access to raw material for use in plates and medals and for the minting of ruble coins , starting in 1828 . Residues from platinum production for coinage were available in the Russian Empire , and therefore most of the research on them was done in Eastern Europe . 
 It is possible that the Polish chemist Jędrzej Śniadecki isolated element 44 ( which he called " <unk> " after the asteroid Vesta discovered shortly before ) from South American platinum ores in 1807 . He published an announcement of his discovery in 1808 . His work was never confirmed , however , and he later withdrew his claim of discovery . 
 Jöns Berzelius and Gottfried Osann nearly discovered ruthenium in 1827 . They examined residues that were left after dissolving crude platinum from the Ural Mountains in aqua regia . Berzelius did not find any unusual metals , but Osann thought he found three new metals , which he called <unk> , ruthenium , and <unk> . This discrepancy led to a long @-@ standing controversy between Berzelius and Osann about the composition of the residues . As Osann was not able to repeat his isolation of ruthenium , he eventually relinquished his claims . The name " ruthenium " was chosen by Osann because the analysed samples stemmed from the Ural Mountains in Russia . The name itself derives from Ruthenia , the Latin word for Rus ' , a historical area that included present @-@ day western Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , and parts of Slovakia and Poland . 
 In 1844 , Karl Ernst Claus , a Russian scientist of Baltic German descent , showed that the compounds prepared by Gottfried Osann contained small amounts of ruthenium , which Claus had discovered the same year . Claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of rouble production while he was working in Kazan University , Kazan , the same way its heavier congener osmium had been discovered four decades earlier . Claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6 grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia . Choosing the name for the new element , Claus stated : " I named the new body , in honour of my Motherland , ruthenium . I had every right to call it by this name because Mr. Osann relinquished his ruthenium and the word does not yet exist in chemistry . " 
 = = Applications = = 
 Because it hardens platinum and palladium alloys , ruthenium is used in electrical contacts , where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired durability . With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium , electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium . The plate is applied to the base by electroplating or sputtering . 
 Ruthenium dioxide with lead and bismuth <unk> are used in thick @-@ film chip resistors . These two electronic applications account for 50 % of the ruthenium consumption . 
 Ruthenium is seldom alloyed with metals outside the platinum group , where small quantities improve some properties . The added corrosion resistance in titanium alloys led to the development of a special alloy with 0 @.@ 1 % ruthenium . Ruthenium is also used in some advanced high @-@ temperature single @-@ crystal superalloys , with applications that include the turbines in jet engines . Several nickel based superalloy compositions are described , such as EPM @-@ 102 ( with 3 % Ru ) , TMS @-@ 162 ( with 6 % Ru ) , TMS @-@ 138 , and TMS @-@ 174 , the latter two containing 6 % rhenium . Fountain pen nibs are frequently tipped with ruthenium alloy . From 1944 onward , the famous Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with the " RU " nib , a 14K gold nib tipped with 96 @.@ 2 % ruthenium and 3 @.@ 8 % iridium . 
 Ruthenium is a component of mixed @-@ metal oxide ( MMO ) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures , and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water . The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen , finding use in <unk> sensors for oxygen . Ruthenium red , [ ( NH3 ) <unk> @-@ O @-@ Ru ( NH3 ) 4 @-@ O @-@ Ru ( NH3 ) 5 ] 6 + , is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy . The beta @-@ decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors , mainly malignant <unk> of the <unk> . Ruthenium @-@ centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties . Compared with platinum complexes , those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors . NAMI @-@ A and <unk> are two drugs undergoing clinical evaluation for treatment of metastatic tumors and colon cancers . 
 Ruthenium tetroxide exposes latent fingerprints by reacting on contact with fatty oils or fats with sebaceous contaminants and producing brown / black ruthenium dioxide pigment .

 Ruthenium is a versatile catalyst . With an aqueous suspension of CdS particles loaded with ruthenium dioxide , the energy of visible light can split Hydrogen sulfide . This process may be one day be used to remove H2S in oil refineries and other industrial processing facilities . Organometallic ruthenium carbene and <unk> complexes have been found to be highly efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis , a process with important applications in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry . Ruthenium @-@ promoted cobalt catalysts are used in Fischer @-@ Tropsch synthesis .

 Christopher L. " Chris " Howard ( born May 5 , 1975 ) is a retired professional American football running back who played in the National Football League ( NFL ) for the Jacksonville Jaguars . Howard had been drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft . His professional football career was haunted by fumble troubles , which caused the Broncos to release him before he played a regular season game for them . Howard began to have fumble problems again when the Jaguars acquired and promoted him to a role as a regular player . 
 He had previously played for the Michigan Wolverines football team where in the 1997 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season , his final year at Michigan , they won a National Championship . Howard led the National Champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team in rushing and was a Hula Bowl MVP in 1998 .

 In four years at Michigan from 1994 to 1997 , he totaled 1876 yards rushing on 418 carries and added 429 yards receiving on 60 receptions . He totaled nine 100 @-@ yard rushing efforts for Michigan including four during the 1997 championship season . In college , his biggest rushing effort was 127 yards against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in 1996 . However , he once rushed for 109 yards and 4 touchdowns against the UCLA Bruins . In addition , Howard also posted the fourth longest rush in school history , an 86 @-@ yard rush . 
 In 1996 , he had five 100 @-@ yard games despite only playing in ten games as a junior . He totaled 725 yards rushing and ten touchdowns in the ten games . However , he was second on the team in rushing to sophomore Clarence Williams who tallied 837 yards in 12 games . 
 In the 1997 championship season , he was the rushing leader for a fundamentally sound undefeated 12 – 0 Michigan team that did not have a 1000 @-@ yard rusher or 500 @-@ yard receiver . The team emphasized defense behind 1997 Heisman Trophy winning defensive back Charles Woodson . Howard totaled 938 yards rushing on 199 carries and 276 yards receiving on 37 receptions . He was second on the team in scoring to placekicker Kraig Baker with 7 rushing touchdowns and 1 receiving touchdown . He was complemented in the backfield by freshman Anthony Thomas who added 549 yards and 5 rushing touchdowns . 
 One of the key games in Michigan 's 1997 National Championship season was the game against the unbeaten Penn State Nittany Lions , then ranked Number 2 in the nation . Howard rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown in the win over the Nittany Lions , prompting Coach Lloyd Carr to comment : " I think that Chris Howard is a very underrated back . He proved that today . " Michigan controlled the game and led 34 – 0 after 3 quarters behind Howard ’ s best collegiate performance in terms of yards from scrimmage with 120 yards rushing and 41 yards receiving . 
 The 1997 season concluded with a 21 – 16 win over Washington State in the January 1 , 1998 Rose Bowl . Howard led all rushers in the game with 70 yards rushing on 19 carries . 
 He was also the North MVP for the 1998 edition of the Hula Bowl , an invitational college football all @-@ star game . He rushed for 116 yards on 14 carries and was involved in the culminating score in the North ’ s second half comeback . He handed off to Joe Jurevicius on a reverse play which ended with Jurevicius passing to Brian Griese for a five @-@ yard touchdown pass . The North would lose , however , when the missed extra point left the door open for a game winning field goal .

 Howard was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round of the 1998 NFL Draft , but he had a difficult pre @-@ season with the Broncos in 1998 , fumbling five times in two games . The Broncos released him from their practice squad in September 1998 , and he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars . At the time , Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said : " Chris Howard is a young man and he certainly still is developmental . A couple weeks into our system and I think he 'll be a guy who can be counted on . But I 'm not going to say we 're done with our evaluations just yet . " Coughlin said of Howard 's fumbles with Denver : " It was carelessness . Basically , we 'll start from scratch with him fundamentally here . " Howard had professional totals of 123 yards rushing on 41 carries and 37 yards receiving on five receptions . In 2000 , his final year , he fumbled twice on only 21 carries in the first two games .

 = Rage Against the Machine = 
 Rage Against the Machine ( also known as RATM or just Rage ) is an American rap metal band from Los Angeles , California . Formed in 1991 , the group consists of rapper and vocalist Zack de la Rocha , bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford , guitarist Tom Morello , and drummer Brad Wilk . They draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation , as well as hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa , Public Enemy , the Beastie Boys , and Dutch crossover band Urban Dance Squad . Rage Against the Machine is well known for the members ' leftist and revolutionary political views , which are expressed in many of the band 's songs . As of 2010 , they had sold over 16 million records worldwide . 
 In 1992 , the band released its self @-@ titled debut album , which became a commercial and critical success , leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . The band did not release a follow @-@ up record until 1996 , with Evil Empire . The band 's third album , The Battle of Los Angeles , followed in 1999 , and in 2003 , the album was ranked number 426 on the same list . During their initial nine @-@ year run , they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history , according to music journalist Colin Devenish . They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock . The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the second half of the 1990s . 
 In 2000 , the band released the cover album , Renegades . The same year , growing tensions over the direction of the band prompted de la Rocha to quit , leading to the band 's breakup . De la Rocha started a low @-@ key solo career , while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell , then @-@ former frontman of Soundgarden ; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007 . The same year , Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007 . Up until 2011 , the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world . As of 2012 , the group has no plans to perform or release new music . In 2016 Morello , Commerford and Wilk formed a new band , Prophets of Rage , with Chuck D and B @-@ Real .

 In 1991 , following the break @-@ up of guitarist Tom Morello 's former band Lock Up , former Lock Up drummer Jon Knox encouraged Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello as he was looking to start a new group . Tom soon contacted Brad Wilk , who had unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up . This line @-@ up went on to form Rage Against the Machine . The newly christened Rage Against the Machine named themselves after a song de la Rocha had written for his former popular underground hardcore punk band , Inside Out ( also to be the title of the unrecorded Inside Out full @-@ length album ) . Kent <unk> , with whom Inside Out were associated , had coined the phrase " rage against the machine " in a 1989 article in his zine No Answers . 
 Shortly after forming , they gave their first public performance on October 23 , 1991 at The Quad of California State University , Northridge . The blueprint for the group 's major @-@ label debut album , demo tape Rage Against the Machine , was laid on a twelve @-@ song self @-@ released cassette , the cover image of which was the stock market with a triple match taped to the inlay card . Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album — two were eventually included as B @-@ sides , while three others never saw an official release . Several record labels expressed interest , and the band eventually signed with Epic Records . Morello said , " Epic agreed to everything we asked — and they 've followed through .... We never saw a [ n ] [ ideological ] conflict as long as we maintained creative control . "

 The band 's debut album , Rage Against the Machine , reached triple platinum status , driven by heavy radio play of the song " Killing in the Name " , a heavy , driving track featuring only eight lines of lyrics . The " Fuck You " version , which contains 17 iterations of the word fuck , was once accidentally played on the BBC Radio 1 Top 40 singles show on February 21 , 1993 . The album 's cover featured Malcolm Browne 's Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning photograph of Thich Quang Duc , a Vietnamese Buddhist monk , burning himself to death in Saigon in 1963 in protest of the murder of Buddhists by the US @-@ backed Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem 's regime . The album was produced by Garth Richardson . To promote the album , the band went on tour , playing at Lollapalooza 1993 and as support for Suicidal Tendencies in Europe . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone Magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . 
 After their debut album , the band appeared on the soundtrack for the film Higher Learning with the song " Year of tha Boomerang . " An early version of " Tire Me " also appeared during the movie . Subsequently , they re @-@ recorded the song " Darkness " from their original demo for the soundtrack of The Crow , while " No Shelter " appeared on the Godzilla soundtrack . 
 Despite rumors of a breakup for several years , Rage Against the Machine 's second album , Evil Empire , entered Billboard 's Top 200 chart at number one in 1996 , and subsequently rose to triple platinum status . The song " Bulls on Parade " was performed on Saturday Night Live in April 1996 . Their planned two @-@ song performance was cut to one song when the band attempted to hang inverted US flags from their amplifiers ( " a sign of distress or great danger " ) , a protest against having Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes as guest host on the program that night . 
 In 1997 , the band opened for U2 on their PopMart Tour , for which all of Rage 's profits went to support social <unk> including <unk> , Women Alive and the Zapatista Front for National Liberation . Rage subsequently began an abortive headlining US tour with special guests Wu @-@ Tang Clan . Police in several jurisdictions unsuccessfully attempted to have the concerts cancelled , citing amongst other reasons , the bands ' " violent and anti @-@ law enforcement philosophies . " Wu @-@ Tang Clan were eventually removed from the line @-@ up and replaced with The Roots . On the Japan leg of their tour promoting Evil Empire , a compilation album composed of the band 's B @-@ side recordings titled Live & Rare was released by Sony Records . A live video , also titled Rage Against the Machine , was released later the same year . 
 In 1999 Rage Against the Machine played at the infamous Woodstock ' 99 concert . The following release , The Battle of Los Angeles also debuted at number one in 1999 , selling 450 @,@ 000 copies in the first week and then going double @-@ platinum . That same year the song " Wake Up " was featured on the soundtrack of the film The Matrix . The track " Calm Like a Bomb " was later featured in the film 's sequel , 2003 's The Matrix Reloaded . In 2000 , the band planned to support the Beastie Boys on the " Rhyme and Reason " tour ; however , the tour was cancelled when Beastie Boys drummer Mike D suffered a serious injury . In 2003 , The Battle of Los Angeles was ranked number 426 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time .

 On January 26 , 2000 , an altercation during filming of the video for " Sleep Now in the Fire " , directed by Michael Moore , caused the doors of the New York Stock Exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange . The video shoot had attracted several hundred people , according to a representative for the city ’ s Deputy Commissioner for Public Information . New York City 's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street . Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street , nor did he have a loud @-@ noise permit or the proper parking permits . " Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction , " No matter what happens , don 't stop playing , " Tom Morello recalls . When the band left the steps , NYPD apprehended Moore and led him away . Moore yelled to the band , " Take the New York Stock Exchange ! " In an interview with the Socialist Worker , Morello said he and scores of others ran into the Stock Exchange . " About two hundred of us got through the first set of doors , but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange 's titanium riot doors came crashing down . " " For a few minutes , Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism , " Moore said . " An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer . " 
 On September 7 , 2000 , the band attended the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards , and performed " Testify . " However , after the Best Rock Video award was given to Limp Bizkit . Commerford climbed onto the scaffolding of the set . Commerford and his bodyguard were sentenced to a night in jail and de la Rocha reportedly left the awards after the stunt . Morello recalled that Commerford related his plan to the rest of the band before the show , and that both de la Rocha and Morello advised him against it immediately after Bizkit was presented the award . 
 On October 18 , 2000 , de la Rocha released a statement announcing his departure from the band . He said , " I feel that it is now necessary to leave Rage because our decision @-@ making process has completely failed . It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band , and from my perspective , has undermined our artistic and political ideal . " " There was so much squabbling over everything , " explained Morello , " and I mean everything . We would even have fist fights over whether our T @-@ shirts should be mauve or camouflaged ! It was ridiculous . We were patently political , internally combustible . It was ugly for a long time . " 
 The band 's next album , Renegades , was a collection of covers of artists as diverse as Devo , EPMD , Minor Threat , Cypress Hill , The MC5 , Afrika Bambaataa , The Rolling Stones , Eric B. & Rakim , Bruce Springsteen , The Stooges , and Bob Dylan . It achieved platinum status a month later . The following year saw the release of another live video , The Battle of Mexico City , while 2003 brought the live album Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium , an edited recording of the band 's final concerts on September 12 and 13 , 2000 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles . It was accompanied by an expanded DVD release of the last show , which included a previously unreleased video for " <unk> " . 
 In the wake of 9 / 11 , the controversial 2001 Clear Channel memorandum contained a long list of what the memo termed " lyrically questionable " songs for the radio , uniquely listing all of Rage Against the Machine 's songs . 
 After the group 's breakup , Morello , Wilk , and Commerford decided to stay together and find a new vocalist . " There was talk for a while of us becoming Ozzy Osbourne 's backing band , and even Macy Gray 's , " said Morello . " We informed them that losing our singer was actually a blessing in disguise , and that we had bigger ambitions than being somebody 's hired musicians . " They eventually teamed up with then @-@ former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell to form Audioslave . The first Audioslave single , " Cochise " , was released in early November 2002 , and a self @-@ titled debut album followed to mainly positive reviews . Compared to Rage Against the Machine , most of Audioslave 's music was apolitical , although some songs touched on political issues . Their second album Out of Exile debuted at the number one position on the Billboard charts in 2005 . Audioslave released its third album Revelations on September 5 , 2006 , but an accompanying tour never occurred as Cornell and Morello were working on solo albums . After months of inactivity and rumors of a breakup , Audioslave disbanded on February 15 , 2007 after Cornell announced he was leaving the band . 
 Morello began his own solo career in 2003 , playing political acoustic folk music at open @-@ mic nights and various clubs under the alias The Nightwatchman , which he formed as an outlet for his political views while playing apolitical music with Audioslave . He first participated in Billy Bragg 's Tell Us the Truth tour with no plans to record , but later recorded a song for Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9 / 11 , " No One Left " . In February 2007 , he announced a solo album , entitled One Man Revolution , which was released in April 2007 . Morello followed up his first studio album with " The Fabled City " which was released on September 30 , 2008 . During the latter of his career as The Nightwatchman , Morello joined up with Boots Riley and formed the rap rock group Street Sweeper Social Club , which released its debut self @-@ titled album in June 2009 . 
 Meanwhile , de la Rocha had been working on a solo album collaboration with DJ Shadow , Company Flow , Roni Size and The Roots ' Questlove , but dropped the project in favor of working with Nine Inch Nails ' Trent Reznor . Recording was completed but the album has never been released . A collaboration between de la Rocha and DJ Shadow , the song " March of Death " was released for free over the World Wide Web in 2003 in protest against the imminent invasion of Iraq , and the 2004 soundtrack Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9 / 11 included one of the collaborations with Reznor , " We Want It All " . In late 2005 , de la Rocha was seen singing and playing the <unk> <unk> with Son <unk> band Son de Madera on multiple occasions . Rage Against the Machine was ranked 33rd on VH1 's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list in 2005 . 
 Members of the band had been offered large sums of money to reunite for concerts and tours , and had turned the offers down . Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members subsequently circulated , but Commerford said that he and de la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together , while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone , and had met up at a September 15 , 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm .

 Rumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival were circulating in mid @-@ January 2007 , and were confirmed on January 22 . The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007 . The reunion was described by Morello as primarily being a vehicle to voice the band 's opposition to the " right @-@ wing purgatory " the United States has " slid into " under the George W. Bush administration since RATM 's dissolution . Though the performance was initially thought to be a one @-@ off , this turned out not to be the case . 
 On April 14 , 2007 , Morello and de la Rocha reunited onstage early to perform a brief acoustic set at a Coalition of Immokalee Workers rally in downtown Chicago . Morello described the event as " very exciting for everybody in the room , myself included . " This was followed by the scheduled Coachella performance on Sunday , April 29 where the band staged a much anticipated performance in front of an <unk> backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival . 
 Rage Against the Machine continued to tour in the United States , New Zealand , Australia , and Japan , and also played a series of shows in Europe in Summer 2008 including Rock am Ring and Rock im Park , Pinkpop Festival , T in the Park in Scotland , the <unk> Festival in Sweden , the Reading and Leeds Festivals in England and the Oxegen Festival in Ireland . The band also performed on August 2 , 2008 , in Chicago as one of the headliners ( Radiohead , Kanye West and Nine Inch Nails being the other three ) for the 2008 Lollapalooza Music Festival . When asked in May 2007 if the band were planning on writing a new album , Morello replied : 
 There are no plans to do that ... That 's a whole other ball of wax right there . Writing and recording albums is a whole different thing than getting back on the bike ( laughs ) , you know , and playing these songs . But I think that the one thing about the Rage catalog is that to me none of it feels dated . You know , it doesn 't feel at all like a nostalgia show . It feels like these are songs that were born and bred to be played now . 
 Morello declined to comment about the possibility of a new album when interviewed by MTV News in April 2008 . In July 2008 , it was revealed that de la Rocha had begun a new project called One Day as a Lion with drummer Jon Theodore formerly of The Mars Volta , with an eponymous EP released on July 22 , 2008 . 
 In August 2008 , de la Rocha revealed his take on the possibility of new material : 
 We ’ re going to keep playing shows – we have a couple of big ones happening in front of both conventions . As far as us recording music in the future , I don ’ t know where we all fit with that . We ’ ve all embraced each other ’ s projects and support them , and that ’ s great . 
 In August 2008 , Rage headlined the free Tent State Music Festival to End the War in Denver during the Democratic National Convention . The band was supported by Flobots , State Radio , Jello Biafra , and Wayne Kramer . Following the concert , the band , following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans Against the War , led the 8 @,@ 000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a 6 @-@ mile march to Invesco Field , host of the DNC . After a 4 @-@ hour stand @-@ off with police , Obama 's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and hear their demands . 
 In September 2008 , Rage performed at the Target Center in Minneapolis during the Republican National Convention . The previous day , they attempted to play a surprise set at a free anti @-@ RNC concert at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul , but were prevented from doing so by the police . Instead , de la Rocha and Morello rapped and sang through a megaphone . Later that evening , Morello and Boots Reilly joined up with Billy Bragg and Jim Walsh for a three @-@ hour jam session at <unk> Parkway theater in south Minneapolis . 
 In December 2008 , Tom Morello revealed that Rage Against the Machine shows in 2009 were a possibility , although plans for the band to record a new studio album were very unlikely . When asked by Billboard.com whether they planned to head to the studio in 2009 , Morello stated that : " we 've had a wonderful year and a half of playing shows , and I don 't see any reason to not play more shows . The thing is there 's only so many hours in the musical day , and mine are very occupied right now . " 
 Morello elaborated that The Nightwatchman is now " my principal musical focus , as I see it , for the remainder of my life . From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses , it was apparent to me that this music was as important to me as any music I 've ever been involved in . It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist . " He repeated this point in an interview with the Los Angeles Times . 
 However , After the " Rage Factor " celebratory show in Finsbury Park on June 6 , 2010 , after the campaign to get Killing in the Name to Christmas Number 1 , Zack de la Rocha stated that it was a " genuine possibility " . Stating that they may use the momentum from the campaign to get back into the studio and write a follow @-@ up record to 2000s Renegades after 10 years . When talking to NME , Zack de la Rocha said : " I think it 's a genuine possibility , We have to get our heads around what we ’ re going to do towards the end of the year and finish up on some other projects and we ’ ll take it from there .

 In December 2009 , a campaign was launched on Facebook by Jon <unk> and his wife Tracy , in order to stop , most notably , The X Factor hits from becoming almost automatic Christmas number ones on the UK Singles Chart . It generated nationwide publicity and took the track " Killing in the Name " to the coveted Christmas number one slot in the UK Singles Chart , which had been dominated for four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the popular TV show The X Factor . Before the chart was announced on December 20 , 2009 , the Facebook group membership stood at over 950 @,@ 000 , and was acknowledged ( and supported ) by Tom Morello , Dave Grohl , Paul McCartney , Muse , Fightstar , NME , John Lydon , Bill Bailey , Lenny Henry , BBC Radio 1 , Hadouken ! , The Prodigy , Stereophonics , BBC Radio 5 Live , and even the 2004 X Factor winner Steve <unk> , amongst numerous others . On the morning of December 17 , Rage Against the Machine played a slightly censored version of " Killing in the Name " live on Radio 5 Live , but four repeats of ' Fuck you I won 't do what you tell me ' were aired before the song was pulled . During the interview before the song they reiterated their support for the campaign and their intentions to support charity with the proceeds . The campaign was ultimately successful , and " Killing in the Name " became the number @-@ one single in the UK for Christmas 2009 . A similar campaign was run on Facebook in Ireland the same year but Killing in the Name placed 2nd that Christmas to X Factors 2010 single . Rage 's Zack de la Rocha spoke to BBC1 upon hearing the news , stating that : 
 The band also set a new record , achieving the biggest download sales total in a first week ever in the UK charts. de la Rocha also promised the band would perform a free concert in the UK sometime in 2010 to celebrate the achievement . True to their word , the band announced that they would be performing a free concert at Finsbury Park , London on June 6 , 2010 . The concert , dubbed " The Rage Factor " , gave away all the tickets by free photo registration to prevent touting over the weekend of the February 13 – 14 , followed by an online lottery on February 17 . This proved to be overwhelmingly popular , with many users facing connection issues . The tickets were all allocated by 13 : 30 that same day . After allowing ticket holders to vote for who they wanted to be the support acts for " The Rage Factor " , it was announced that Gogol Bordello , Gallows and Roots Manuva would support Rage Against the Machine at this concert . 
 In addition to the free gig at Finsbury Park , the band headlined European festivals in June 2010 including the Download Festival at Donington Park , England , Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in Germany and Rock in Rio Madrid in Spain . They also performed in Ireland on June 8 and The Netherlands on June 9 . Zack de la Rocha had stated that it was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album , the first time since 2000 's Renegades <unk> confirmed this , stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band did write new material , but they had no motivation to release them until now . De la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the Download Festival 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material . In addition , the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23 , 2010 for their first US show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years . The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the <unk> immigration law . On the night of the show , a spokesperson announced to the crowd that ticket sales — all of which are non @-@ profit to the bands — had raised $ 300 @,@ 000 . The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October , performing at venues such as the <unk> Festival in Brazil , the <unk> Festival in Chile , and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina . It was the first time the band played on those countries . 
 During an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010 , Rage frontman Zack de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works , with a possibility of a 2011 release . De la Rocha is reported as saying , “ We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago . This is different and we project a lot : we are working on a new album due out next year , perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere . " However , in early May 2011 , guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album , but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work . " The band is not writing songs , the band is not in the studio , " Morello told The Pulse of Radio . " We get along famously and we all , you know , intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future , but beyond sort of working out a concert this year , there 's nothing else on the schedule ( for 2011 ) . " The band created its own festival , the L.A. Rising . As Morello stated , the only Rage appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio , Immortal Technique , Lauryn Hill , Rise Against and Muse . As of mid @-@ 2012 , there are no plans for any more shows . During an interview on July 30 , 2011 , Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello 's comments , stating that new material was being written , and specific plans for the next two years were in place . 
 In an October 2012 interview with TMZ , bassist Tim Commerford was asked if Rage Against the Machine was working on a new album . He simply responded , " maybe " . Asked by TMZ again in November 2012 whether a new album was being worked on , Commerford replied " definitely maybe ... anything 's possible . " Later that month , however , Morello denied that they were working on new material , and stated that Rage Against the Machine has " no plans beyond " the reissue of their self @-@ titled debut album . Morello said he would be open to recording new Rage Against the Machine material , but added that it is " not on the table right now . " 
 The band announced on October 9 via their Facebook page that they would be releasing a special 20th anniversary box set to commemorate the group 's debut album . The full box set contains never @-@ before @-@ released concert material , including the band 's 2010 Finsbury Park show and footage from early in their career , as well as a digitally @-@ remastered version of the album , b @-@ sides and the original demo tape ( on disc for the first time ) . The band released 3 @-@ disc and single @-@ disc versions . The collection was released on November 27 . 
 On April 30 , 2014 , drummer Brad Wilk stated that Rage Against the Machine 's 2011 performance at L.A. Rising may have been their final show . In February 2015 , Tim Commerford <unk> that uncertainty was typical of the band 's functioning , speculating : " It could be tomorrow ; it could be 10 years from now " . 
 On October 16 , 2015 , the 2010 gig in Finsbury Park was officially released as a DVD and Blu @-@ ray called Live at Finsbury Park . 
 = = = 2016 – present : Prophets of Rage = = = 
 In May 2016 , the band launched a mysterious countdown website , <unk> , with a clock counting down to June 1 . Accompanying the clock was an image of a broken slash through a circle with silhouettes of five people all extending their arms and clenched fists with the hashtag " # <unk> " underneath the timer . This led to speculation of the return of the band later in the year . However , a source close to Rage Against the Machine told Rolling Stone that the Prophets of Rage website had nothing do with the announcement of a " Rage @-@ specific reunion " , but added that " some of the members " of the band have been working on a project that will include live shows . 
 Finally , it was confirmed that Prophets of Rage is a new supergroup formed by Morello , Wilk and Commerford , plus Chuck D of Public Enemy and B @-@ Real of Cypress Hill . The band will be on tour and play some songs of the three bands in which the members of this group participated before . 
 Despite Morello , Wilk and Commerford 's involvement in Prophets of Rage , Commerford confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up , explaining , " We just do things our own way . Throughout our career , we never did what anyone wanted us to do . We never made the records people wanted us to make . We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by . And here we are , 25 years later , still a band . Clearly that means something . And if we did ever play or make new music or anything , it would be a very big deal . And there 's a lot of bands that I ’ ve seen come along during that 25 @-@ year period that did everything the record companies and the powers @-@ that @-@ be wanted them to do , and they sold millions of records . But where are they now ? They 're gone . " Morello added , " Right now ... the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage . Where Rage Against the Machine lives , is this summer in these songs that we are playing . And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha , the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against The Machine , who is working on his own music , which I 'm sure will be fantastic — he 's a great artist in his own right . But where you 're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage . " 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Rage Against the Machine has been noted for its " fiercely polemical music , which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America , cultural imperialism , and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of punk rock , hip @-@ hop , and thrash . " Zack de la Rocha 's lyrics and choruses are defined by a heavy use of sloganeering and repetition on songs like Bulls on Parade , Guerrilla Radio , Testify , and Down Rodeo . Guitarist Tom Morello , on the other hand , was considered the guitar player but also the DJ in Rage . 
 The band is associated with the 1990s alternative movement . They are also considered rap metal , rap rock and funk metal . 
 = = Political views and activism = = 
 The members of Rage Against the Machine are well known for their leftist and revolutionary political views , and almost all of the band 's songs focus on these views . Key to the band 's identity , Rage Against the Machine has voiced viewpoints highly critical of the domestic and foreign policies of current and previous US governments . Throughout its existence , RATM and its individual members participated in political protests and other activism to advocate these beliefs . The band sees its music as a vehicle for social activism ; De la Rocha explained that " I 'm interested in spreading those ideas through art , because music has the power to cross borders , to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue . " Morello said of wage slavery in America : 
 America touts itself as the land of the free , but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace . Once you exercise this freedom you 've lost all control over what you do , what is produced , and how it is produced . And in the end , the product doesn 't belong to you . The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you don 't care about making a living . Which leads to the second freedom : the freedom to starve . 
 Some critics have accused the group of hypocrisy for voicing commitment to leftist causes while being millionaires signed to Epic Records , a subsidiary of media conglomerate Sony Records . Infectious Grooves released a song called " Do What I Tell Ya ! " which mocks lyrics from " Killing in the Name " , accusing the band of being hypocrites . In response to such critiques , Morello offered the rebuttal :

 = French destroyer Mogador = 
 Mogador was the lead ship of the French Navy 's Mogador class of destroyers ( French : contre @-@ torpilleur ) . Named for the Moroccan town , she was built before the outbreak of World War II . The ship was heavily damaged during the British attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir on 3 July 1940 , but was later repaired and sailed to Toulon . She was scuttled in Toulon Harbor when the Germans tried to seize her , along with the rest of the fleet , on 27 November 1942 . 
 She was the last contre @-@ torpilleur built by the French Navy , a not entirely successful attempt to build a ship capable of out @-@ fighting every other ship below her tonnage . " In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of destroyer ; the contre @-@ torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities . " 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Mogador had an overall length of 137 @.@ 5 meters ( 451 ft 1 in ) , a beam of 12 @.@ 57 meters ( 41 ft 3 in ) , and a maximum draft of 4 @.@ 74 meters ( 15 ft 7 in ) . She displaced 2 @,@ 997 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 950 long tons ) at standard load and 4 @,@ 018 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 955 long tons ) at deep load . The Rateau @-@ Bretagne geared steam turbines were designed to produce 92 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 68 @,@ 604 kW ) , which would propel the ship at 39 knots ( 72 km / h ; 45 mph ) . However , during sea trials in March 1938 , Mogador 's turbines provided 118 @,@ 320 shp ( 88 @,@ 230 kW ) and she reached 43 @.@ 45 knots ( 80 @.@ 47 km / h ; 50 @.@ 00 mph ) for a single hour . The ship carried 360 metric tons ( 354 long tons ) of fuel oil at normal load and an additional 350 metric tons ( 340 long tons ) at deep load . 
 Mogador carried eight Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1929 in four twin turrets , two each superimposed , fore and aft . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Mle 1933 guns in a single mount positioned on the rear deck house forward of the rear turrets . She also mounted four 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) Mle 1929 heavy machine guns in two twin mounts located between the forward superstructure and the forward guns . Mogador carried 10 above @-@ water 550 @-@ millimeter ( 22 in ) torpedo tubes : a pair of triple mounts between the funnels and a pair of double mounts aft of the rear funnel . A pair of depth charge chutes were built into Mogador 's stern ; these housed a total of 16 Guirard depth charges . Mine rails were fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 40 mines . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Mogador , with her sister Volta , comprised the 6th Large Destroyer Division ( 6e Division de contre @-@ torpilleurs ) and was assigned to the Force de Raid based at Brest when the war began . This group 's purpose was to hunt German blockade runners and raiders and to escort convoys that might be in danger from the same . From 21 – 30 October 1939 the Force de Raid escorted the KJ.4 convoy to protect it against the German cruiser Deutschland which had sortied into the North Atlantic before the war began . A sortie by the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst into the North Atlantic on 21 November prompted the Force de Raid to sail from Brest to rendezvous with the British battlecruiser HMS Hood and patrol the area south of Iceland , but the German ships were able to return safely under the cover of heavy weather without being engaged . 
 Mogador was refitted at Lorient between January and March 1940 and a number of minor changes were made . The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during her sea trials a year prior were finally implemented , the canvas cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door , new radios were installed , and shields were fitted to the anti @-@ aircraft machine guns and the searchlights . A SS @-@ 6 sonar was fitted in June 1940 , but proved to be ineffectual . 
 Mogador was present during the British attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir on 3 July 1940 , but she was severely damaged by a hit from an armour @-@ piercing 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) shell in the rear hull that detonated her ready depth charges although it failed to detonate itself . The explosion destroyed her upper rear hull , but , miraculously , the rear magazines failed to explode . One propeller shaft was undamaged and the other shaft and the two propellers were intact , albeit damaged . She was towed to Oran for repairs . She was dry docked on 17 July , the remains of her No. 4 turret were removed and the after bulkheads repaired and reinforced to make her seaworthy . She sailed for Toulon on 1 December where she was docked pending reconstruction . 
 The French Navy decided to reinforce her anti @-@ aircraft armament in light of its wartime experience . Her no . 3 gun turret was to be moved to the No. 4 position , its magazine converted for extra fuel storage , and a new twin 37 mm Mle 1933 mount would replace it on top of the rear deck house . Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted on each side of the rear deckhouse and a fourth mount was to replace the 13 @.@ 2 Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge . One 13 @.@ 2 mm Browning machine gun was to planned to be mounted on each side of the forward twin 37 mm guns . This plan was later amended to add a degaussing cable , replacement of the SS @-@ 6 sonar by a French copy of the British ASDIC and six of the new <unk> de 25 mm contre @-@ <unk> Modèle 1940 anti @-@ aircraft guns , plus two more 13 @.@ 2 mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house . 
 The rebuilding was slowed by material shortages and she wasn 't taken into hand by the shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la <unk> at La Seyne @-@ sur @-@ Mer until late February 1942 . In October it was estimated that she wouldn 't be completed until Jul 1943 . She was scuttled in La Seyne @-@ sur @-@ Mer on 27 November 1942 to prevent her capture by the Germans . She was refloated by the Italians on 5 April 1943 , but not repaired . Mogador was sunk by Allied bombers in late 1944 , but was raised in 1949 and scrapped . 
 = 1901 Louisiana hurricane = 
 The 1901 Louisiana hurricane was the first hurricane to make landfall in Louisiana in the month of August or earlier since 1888 . The fourth tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season , this storm developed southwest of the Azores on August 2 . Moving southwestward and later westward , the depression remained weak for several days , until strengthening into a tropical storm while approaching the Bahamas early on August 9 . It then crossed through the islands and intensified only slightly . Late on August 10 , the storm made landfall near Deerfield Beach , Florida . After reaching the Gulf of Mexico the next day , continuous intensifying occurred and by August 12 , the storm reached hurricane status . Peaking with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) , it struck Louisiana late on August 14 and then Mississippi less than 24 hours later . The system weakened to a tropical storm early on August 16 and became extratropical several hours later . 
 Along portions of the east coast of Florida , " considerable damage " was reported due to strong winds . In Alabama , trees were uprooted , houses were de @-@ roofed , and chimneys collapsed in Mobile . Some areas of the city were also inundated with up to 18 inches ( 460 mm ) of water due to storm tide . Several yachts , schooners , and ships were wrecked or sunk , resulting in at least $ 70 @,@ 000 ( 1901 USD ) in damage . However , due to warnings by the Weather Bureau , the Mobile Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded . All towns along the coast of Mississippi " suffered seriously " . In Louisiana , severe damage was reported at some towns due to strong winds and high tides . The community of Port Eads reported that only the lighthouse was not destroyed , while other sources state that an office building also remained standing . In New Orleans , overflowing levees inundated numerous streets . Outside the city , crops suffered severely , particularly rice . Overall , the storm caused 10 – 15 deaths and $ 1 million in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical depression developed about 615 miles ( 990 km ) southwest of Flores Island , Azores at 0000 UTC on August 2 . The depression moved southwestward and remained weak for several days . On August 5 , it re @-@ curved west @-@ southwestward and then westward while passing north of the Lesser Antilles . The next day , the system curved west @-@ northwestward and briefly to the west on August 8 . Finally , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on August 9 , while located about 50 miles ( 80 km ) northeast of Cat Island , Bahamas . Around that time , the Weather Bureau first observed a " feeble disturbance in the subtropical north of Cuba . " Between August 9 and August 10 , the storm strengthened slightly further and moved through the Bahamas , passing over Cat Island and the Berry Islands . Around 2200 UTC on August 10 , the system made landfall near Deerfield Beach , Florida with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . 
 Early on August 11 , the storm weakened slightly while crossing Florida . It then decelerated and reached the eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later . Thereafter , the system began to re @-@ strengthen and became a Category 1 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200 UTC on August 12 . Early the next day , the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . It weakened slightly early on August 14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana . At 2100 UTC , the storm made landfall near Buras with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Curving northeastward , the hurricane re @-@ emerged into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 15 . However , around 1700 UTC , it made another landfall near Ocean Springs , Mississippi at the same intensity . Early on August 16 , the system weakened to a tropical storm . It then weakened much quicker and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Mississippi at 0000 UTC on August 17 . The remnant extratropical cyclone persisted until late the next day , at which time it dissipated over Indiana .

 As the storm approached the east coast of Florida on August 10 , a warning was sent to all Weather Bureau stations in Florida , as well as Savannah , Georgia , and Charleston , South Carolina , regarding a " disturbance of moderate intensity " , which posed a threat to small crafts in Florida and the western Bahamas . The next day , as the storm was moving across Florida , another message sent to Weather Bureau stations from New Orleans to Charleston warned of the potential for severe squalls along the west coast of Florida . While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States on August 13 , storm warnings were ordered for Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana , as well as for the west coast of Florida . At the National Weather Service office in New Orleans , hurricane warnings were ordered in Louisiana from mouth of the Mississippi River westward on August 15 and expanded to eastern Texas later that day . In New Orleans , 500 men , who were city authorities or levee board members , worked to strengthen the levees along canals in the city . Throughout much of the Gulf Coast of the United States , vessels and ships were warned to take precautions and remain in port . 
 In Florida , " considerable damage " due to strong winds was reported along portions of the east coast . Wind gusts reached 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) in Pensacola . Offshore , the Portuguese bark <unk> , with a cargo of timber worth $ 5 @,@ 000 , was badly damaged . Strong winds up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) were observed in the Mobile area of Alabama , uprooting trees , unroofing houses , and toppling chimneys . Tides inundated the cotton exchange with up to 18 inches ( 460 mm ) of water , while the Western Union , post office , and electrical house for railroads were also flooded . The pleasure yacht Ariel , which was bound for the Fish River , was smashed into pieces at a wharf along the eastern end of Mobile Bay . Between 12 and 15 schooners from the F. F. Saunders company fishing fleet were badly damaged ; four of which sank , resulting in $ 70 @,@ 000 in damage . However , due to warnings by the Weather Bureau , the Chamber of Commerce estimated that several millions of dollars in damage was evaded . All towns along the coast of Mississippi " suffered seriously " . 
 High winds and rough seas were observed in Louisiana . In Port Eads , five @-@ minute sustained winds reached 56 mph ( 90 km / h ) , before the anemometer blew away . At the same location , a 24 @-@ hour rainfall record was set for the month of August , with 7 @.@ 64 inches ( 194 mm ) of precipitation observed . According to a contemporaneous report , the weather instrument shelter was swept away due to storm tides and the flag staff was broken . While the office building did weather the storm intact , documents in it were soaked . However , a report written in 2010 states that in Port Eads only the lighthouse remained standing in the aftermath of the devastation . Fifteen fatalities were reported after a house was swept away by storm tides . The 2010 report , however , states that a total of ten deaths were caused by the storm over its entire existence . In Pilottown , the large " lookout " tower was toppled and destroyed . The outhouse that <unk> used and slept in was blown over and then rapidly filled with water , due to tides rising to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in only 10 minutes . Additionally , property of the Weather Bureau was also damaged . 
 Buras reported 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) of water in town . River stages along the Mississippi River at New Orleans rose to a level of 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) during the storm , producing much flooding . The Carondelet Canal also overflowed , inundating streets in the neighborhood of <unk> with 1 to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) of water . Levee breaks around New Orleans flooded the city . Additionally , strong winds littered the streets with tree branches . The worst hit areas of New Orleans were the neighborhoods of Bucktown , <unk> , West End , all of which are located on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain . In the New Orleans suburb of Shell Beach , severe crop damage was reported , particularly to rice . While sailing the Mississippi River just outside New Orleans , Dr. J. N. Thomas reported that a schooner and a small boat were wrecked , resulting in 60 deaths . However , this was not confirmed . Overall , damage in Louisiana reached $ 1 million , which excluded losses to crops . 
 = Jet stream = 
 Jet streams are fast flowing , narrow , meandering air currents found in the upper atmosphere or in troposphere of some planets , including Earth . The main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause . The major jet streams on Earth are westerly winds ( flowing west to east ) . Their paths typically have a meandering shape . Jet streams may start , stop , split into two or more parts , combine into one stream , or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet . The strongest jet streams are the polar jets , at 9 – 12 km ( 30 @,@ 000 – 39 @,@ 000 ft ) above sea level , and the higher altitude and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at 10 – 16 km ( 33 @,@ 000 – 52 @,@ 000 ft ) . The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have a polar jet and a subtropical jet . The northern hemisphere polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America , Europe , and Asia and their intervening oceans , while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica all year round . 
 Jet streams are the product of two factors : the atmospheric heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar , Ferrel , and Hadley circulation cells , and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses . The Coriolis force is caused by the planet 's rotation on its axis . On other planets , internal heat drives their jet streams . The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells ; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells . 
 Other jet streams also exist . During the Northern Hemisphere summer , easterly jets can form in tropical regions , typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes . Low @-@ level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central United States . 
 Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting . The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel , as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against . Clear @-@ air turbulence , a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety , is often found in a jet stream 's vicinity , but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 After the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano , weather watchers tracked and mapped the effects on the sky over several years . They labelled the phenomenon the " equatorial smoke stream " . In the 1920s , a Japanese meteorologist , <unk> <unk> , detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji . He tracked pilot balloons , also known as <unk> ( balloons used to determine upper level winds ) , as they rose into the atmosphere . <unk> 's work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because it was published in Esperanto . American pilot Wiley Post , the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933 , is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams . Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above 6 @,@ 200 metres ( 20 @,@ 300 ft ) . In the year before his death , Post made several attempts at a high @-@ altitude transcontinental flight , and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed . German meteorologist Heinrich <unk> is credited with coining a special term , <unk> ( literally " jet current " ) , for the phenomenon in 1939 . ( Modern German usage is " <unk> " . ) Many sources credit real understanding of the nature of jet streams to regular and repeated flight @-@ path <unk> during World War II . Flyers consistently noticed westerly tailwinds in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) in flights , for example , from the US to the UK . Similarly in 1944 a team of American meteorologists in Guam , including Reid Bryson , had enough observations to forecast very high west winds that would slow bombers going to Japan . 
 = = Description = = 
 Polar jet streams are typically located near the 250 hPa ( about 1 / 4 atmosphere ) pressure level , or 7 to 12 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 to 7 @.@ 5 mi ) above sea level , while the weaker subtropical jet streams are much higher , between 10 and 16 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 and 9 @.@ 9 mi ) . Jet streams wander laterally dramatically , and have large changes in their altitude . The jet streams form near breaks in the tropopause , at the transitions between the Polar , Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells , and whose circulation , with the Coriolis force acting on those masses , drives the jet streams . The Polar jets , at lower altitude , and often intruding into mid @-@ latitudes , strongly affects weather and aviation . The polar jet stream is most commonly found between latitudes 30 ° and 60 ° ( closer to 60 ° ) , while the subtropical jet streams are located close to latitude 30 ° . The northern Polar jet stream is said to " follow the sun " as it slowly migrates northward as the hemisphere warms , and southward again as the hemisphere cools . 
 The width of a jet stream is typically a few hundred kilometres or miles and its vertical thickness often less than five kilometres ( 3 mi ) . 
 Jet streams are typically continuous over long distances , but discontinuities are common . The path of the jet typically has a meandering shape , and these meanders themselves propagate eastward , at lower speeds than that of the actual wind within the flow . Each large meander , or wave , within the jet stream is known as a Rossby wave ( planetary wave ) . Rossby waves are caused by changes in the Coriolis effect with latitude . Shortwave troughs , are smaller scale waves superimposed on the Rossby waves , with a scale of 1 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 620 – 2 @,@ 490 mi ) long , that move along through the flow pattern around large scale , or longwave , " ridges " and " troughs " within Rossby waves . Jet streams can split into two when it encounters an upper @-@ level low , that diverts a portion of the jet stream under its base , while the remainder of the jet moves by to its north . 
 The wind speeds are greatest where temperature differences ( gradient ) between air masses are greatest , and often exceed 92 km / h ( 50 kn ; 57 mph ) , to over 398 km / h ( 215 kn ; 247 mph ) have been measured . 
 The jet stream moves from West to East bringing changes of weather . Meteorologists now understand that the path of jet streams steers cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere , and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting . For example , in 2007 and 2012 , Britain experienced severe flooding as a result of the polar jet staying south for the summer . 
 The polar and subtropical jets merge at some locations and times , while at other times they are well separated . 
 = = Cause = = 
 In general , winds are strongest immediately under the tropopause ( except locally , during tornadoes , tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations ) . If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet , the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference ( which ultimately causes wind ) is highest within the transition zone . The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area , but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses . 
 All these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation . The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force , or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel . Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction : upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight , and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force . The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic . Beyond the tropics , the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction , and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force . Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic . Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance , one can derive the thermal wind relation : the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient . If two air masses , one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South , are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed , the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass . The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward @-@ moving mass to deviate to the East , while equatorward @-@ moving mass will deviate toward the west . The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction . As a result , winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude . Therefore , the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the Equator is warmer than the North and South poles . 
 = = = Polar jet = = = 
 The thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets , rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere . One factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub @-@ tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front . This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude . At high altitudes , lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole . This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered ' quasi @-@ geostrophic ' . The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes , as the acceleration / deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low / high pressure respectively , which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region . 
 = = = Subtropical jet = = = 
 A second factor which contributes to a concentrated jet , that is more applicable to the subtropical jet , which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude . Tropical air rises to the tropopause , and moves poleward before sinking ; this is the Hadley cell circulation . As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum , since friction with the ground is significant . Air masses that begin moving northward are deflected to eastward by the Coriolis force ( true for either hemisphere ) , which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds ( note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere ) . 
 = = = Other planets = = = 
 Jupiter 's atmosphere has multiple jet streams , caused by the convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure ; on Jupiter , these convection cells are driven by internal heating . The factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology . In models , as one increases the planetary radius , holding all other parameters fixed , the number of jet streams decreases . 
 = = Some effects = = 
 = = = Hurricane protection = = = 
 The subtropical jet stream rounding the base of the mid @-@ oceanic upper trough is thought to be one of the reasons most of the Hawaiian Islands have been resistant to the long list of Hawaii hurricanes that have approached . For example , when Hurricane Flossie approached and dissipated just before reaching landfall , NOAA cited vertical wind shear as evidenced in the photo . 
 = = Uses = = 
 On Earth , the northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting , as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere , while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America . The term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies the northern polar jet stream . 
 = = = Aviation = = = 
 The location of the jet stream is extremely important for aviation . Commercial use of the jet stream began on 18 November 1952 , when Pan Am flew from Tokyo to Honolulu at an altitude of 7 @,@ 600 metres ( 24 @,@ 900 ft ) . It cut the trip time by over one @-@ third , from 18 to 11 @.@ 5 hours . Not only does it cut time off the flight , it also nets fuel savings for the airline industry . Within North America , the time needed to fly east across the continent can be decreased by about 30 minutes if an airplane can fly with the jet stream , or increased by more than that amount if it must fly west against it . 
 Associated with jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear @-@ air turbulence ( CAT ) , caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams . The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet , next to and just under the axis of the jet . Clear @-@ air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents , such as the death of one passenger on United Airlines Flight 826 ( 1997 ) . 
 = = = Future power generation = = = 
 Scientists are investigating ways to harness the wind energy within the jet stream . According to one estimate , of the potential wind energy in the jet stream , only 1 percent would be needed to meet the world 's current energy needs . The required technology would reportedly take 10 – 20 years to develop . There are two major scientific articles about jet stream power . Archer & Caldeira claim that the jet streams can generate the total power of 1700 TW , and that the climatic impact will be negligible . Miller , Gans , & Kleidon claim that the jet streams can generate the total power of only 7 @.@ 5 TW , and that the climatic impact will be catastrophic . 
 = = = <unk> aerial attack = = = 
 Near the end of World War II the Japanese fire balloon was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States . They were relatively ineffective as weapons , but they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II , causing six deaths and a small amount of damage . 
 = = Changes due to climate cycles = = 
 = = = Effects of ENSO = = = 
 El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) influences the average location of upper @-@ level jet streams , and leads to cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America , as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins . Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe . Changes in ENSO also change the location of the jet stream over South America , which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent . 
 = = = = El Niño = = = = 
 During El Niño events , increased precipitation is expected in California due to a more southerly , zonal , storm track . During the Niño portion of ENSO , increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal , and more southerly , polar jet stream . Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range , and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states . The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter , while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season . The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific , which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal , and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific . In the Southern Hemisphere , the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward , or north , of its normal position , which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent . 
 = = = = La Niña = = = = 
 Across North America during La Niña , increased precipitation is diverted into the Pacific Northwest due to a more northerly storm track and jet stream . The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions ( in the form of increased snowfall ) to the Midwestern states , as well as hot and dry summers . Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes . Across the North Atlantic , the jet stream is stronger than normal , which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe . 
 = = = Dust Bowl = = = 
 Evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States . Normally , the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains . During the Dust Bowl , the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal . This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall , causing extraordinary drought conditions . 
 = = Longer @-@ term climatic changes = = 
 Climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of global warming . Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline , reduced snow cover , evapotranspiration patterns , and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe . This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds , causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course . 
 Since 2007 , and particularly in 2012 and early 2013 , the jet stream has been at an abnormally low latitude across the UK , lying closer to the English Channel , around 50 ° N rather than its more usual north of Scotland latitude of around 60 ° N. However , between 1979 and 2001 , it has been found that the average position of the jet stream has been moving northward at a rate of 2 @.@ 01 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 25 mi ) per year across the Northern Hemisphere . Across North America , this type of change could lead to drier conditions across the southern tier of the United States and more frequent and more intense tropical cyclones in the tropics . A similar slow poleward drift was found when studying the Southern Hemisphere jet stream over the same time frame . 
 = = Other upper @-@ level jets = = 
 = = = Polar night jet = = = 
 The polar @-@ night jet stream forms only during the winter months when the nights are much longer , hence polar nights , in their respective hemispheres at around 60 ° latitude . The polar night jet moves at a greater height of about 80 @,@ 000 feet ( 24 @,@ 000 m ) than it does during the summer . During these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the equator . This difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere , which , when combined with the Coriolis effect , create the polar night jets , that race eastward at an altitude of about 30 miles ( 48 km ) . The polar vortex is circled by the polar night jet . The warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex , but not enter it . Within the vortex , the cold polar air becomes increasingly cold with neither warmer air from lower latitudes nor energy from the Sun during the polar night . 
 = = Low level jets = = 
 There are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets . 
 = = = Barrier jet = = = 
 A barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains , with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains . The mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent . In the North American Great Plains a southerly low @-@ level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season , normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours . A similar phenomenon develops across Australia , which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut @-@ off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent . 
 = = = Valley exit jet = = = 
 A valley exit jet is a strong , down @-@ valley , elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain . These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20 m / s ( 45 mph ) at a height of 40 – 200 m above the ground . Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation but are significantly weaker . 
 They are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems , such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US . Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases . 
 = = = Africa = = = 
 The mid @-@ level African easterly jet occurs during the Northern Hemisphere summer between 10 ° N and 20 ° N above West Africa , and the nocturnal poleward low @-@ level jet occurs in the Great Plains of east and South Africa . The low @-@ level easterly African jet stream is considered to play a crucial role in the southwest monsoon of Africa , and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season . The formation of the thermal low over northern Africa leads to a low @-@ level westerly jet stream from June into October . 
 = Ramón Emeterio Betances = 
 Ramón Emeterio Betances y Alacán ( April 8 , 1827 – September 16 , 1898 ) was a Puerto Rican nationalist . He was the primary instigator of the Grito de Lares revolution and is considered to be the father of the Puerto Rican independence movement . Since the Grito galvanized a burgeoning nationalist movement among Puerto Ricans , Betances is also considered " El Padre de la Patria " ( Father of the [ Puerto Rican ] Nation ) . Because of his charitable deeds for people in need , he also became known as " El Padre de los Pobres " ( " The Father of the Poor " ) . 
 Betances was also a medical doctor and surgeon in Puerto Rico , and one of its first social hygienists . He had established a successful surgery and ophthalmology practice . Betances was also an abolitionist , diplomat , public health administrator , poet , and novelist . He served as representative and contact for Cuba and the Dominican Republic in Paris , France . 
 An adherent of Freemasonry , his political and social activism was deeply influenced by the group 's philosophical beliefs . 
 = = Early years = = 
 = = = Ancestry = = = 
 Betances was born in Cabo Rojo , Puerto Rico , in the building that now houses the " Logia <unk> de Betances " ( " Betances ' Cradle Masonic Lodge " ) . Betances ' parents were Felipe Betanzos Ponce , a merchant born in Hispaniola ( in the part that would later become the Dominican Republic ; the surname Betanzos transformed into Betances while the family resided there ) , and María del Carmen Alacán de Montalvo , a native of Cabo Rojo and of French ancestry . They were married in 1812 . 
 Betances claimed in his lifetime that a relative of his , Pedro Betances , had revolted against the Spanish government of Hispaniola in 1808 and was tortured , executed , and his body burned and shown to the populace to dissuade them from further attempts . Meanwhile , Alacán 's father , a sailor , led a party of volunteers that tried to apprehend the pirate Roberto Cofresí y Ramírez de Arellano in 1824 and did arrest some of Cofresí 's crew , for which he was honored by the Spanish government . 
 Betances was the fourth of six children ; the oldest of which would die shortly after birth ; Betances was the only male among the surviving siblings . The family was described as being of mixed race in records of the day . His mother died in 1837 , when he was nine years old , and his father remarried in 1839 ; the five children he had with María del Carmen Torres Pagán included Ramón 's half @-@ brother Felipe Adolfo , who was not involved in politics ( according to Ramón ) but was nevertheless arrested following the Grito de Lares years later . 
 His father eventually bought the Hacienda Carmen in what would later become the nearby town of Hormigueros , and became a wealthy landowner . He owned 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 8 km2 ) of land , a small sugar mill , and some slaves , who shared their duties with free workers . There is speculation that he later freed his slaves , persuaded by his son Ramón . 
 = = = First years in France = = = 
 = = = = Primary education = = = = 
 The young Betances received his primary education from private tutors contracted by his father , a Freemason who owned the largest private library in town . His parents ' attitude towards religion and civil authority shaped his personal beliefs in both subjects . His father would eventually send him to France , to study at the then @-@ named " Collège Royal " ( later named the Lycée Pierre @-@ de @-@ Fermat ) in Toulouse when he was ten years old . A Franco @-@ Puerto Rican family , Jacques Maurice Prévost and María <unk> Bey ( who also was a native of Cabo Rojo ) were appointed as his tutors . Prévost opened a drug store in Mayagüez , Puerto Rico , but was forced to return to France ( particularly to his native town , <unk> ) for not having finished his pharmacy studies . There is also speculation that Prévost was a Freemason , as was Betances ' father . 
 Betances accompanied the couple in Prévost 's return to his country , and would be under their indirect tutelage while boarding at the school . He showed interest in natural and exact sciences early on , and also became a good fencer . 
 = = = = Legal " whitening " of family = = = = 
 While Ramón was in France , his father sought to move the family 's registration from the " mixed race " to the " white " ( Caucasian ) classification of families in Cabo Rojo . The process , when successful , entitled the <unk> to further legal and property rights for him and his family , and was necessary to allow his daughter , Ana María , to marry José Tió , who was a Caucasian . In the case of Betances ' father , the process lasted two years , and was formalized in 1840 , but not before having to have the family 's lineage and religious affiliations exposed to the general public , something that embarrassed them all . Betances was considerably annoyed by the entire ordeal , since he was the first to acknowledge that he and his entire family were not " <unk> " ( " whitish " , a legal term ) but " <unk> " ( " blackish " , as Betances mocked it in his letters ) instead . To him the procedure reeked of hypocrisy . 
 = = = = Medicine studies = = = = 
 In 1846 , Betances obtained his baccalauréat ( high school diploma ) . After an extended vacation in Puerto Rico , he went on to study medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris from 1848 until 1855 , with a short interlude at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier for specific courses in the summer of 1852 . 
 At the time of his arrival in Paris , Betances witnessed the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution and its backlash , the June Days Uprising , earlier that year . His future political views were directly shaped by what he saw and experienced at the time . He considered himself " an old soldier of the French Republic " . Inspired by the proclamation of the 2e République , he rejected Puerto Rican aspirations for autonomy ( sought from Spain by Puerto Rican politicians since 1810 ) in favor of Puerto Rican independence . 
 In 1856 , he graduated with the titles of Doctor in Medicine and Surgeon . He was the second Puerto Rican to graduate from the University ( after Pedro Gerónimo Goyco , a later political leader native of Mayagüez who would eventually interact with Betances when both returned to Puerto Rico ) . Among Betances ' teachers were : Charles @-@ Adolphe <unk> , Jean Cruveilhier , Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> , Armand Trousseau , Alfred @-@ Armand @-@ Louis @-@ Marie Velpeau and Auguste <unk> .

 While Betances was studying medicine in France , his father died ( in August 1854 ) and his sister Ana María would be forced to take over the Hacienda Carmen 's management . By 1857 the heirs were forced to give the operation 's output to a holding company headed by Guillermo <unk> .

 = = = Cholera epidemic of 1856 = = = 
 Betances returned to Puerto Rico in April 1856 . At the time , a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island . The epidemic made its way to Puerto Rico 's western coast in July 1856 , and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard . At the time , Betances was one of five doctors that would have to take care of 24 @,@ 000 residents . Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora ( who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on ) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action . 
 An emergency subscription fund was established by some of the city 's wealthiest citizens . Betances and Basora had the city 's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers . A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery , and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it ( which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio , the Mayagüez municipal hospital , which still serves the city ) . However , the epidemic struck the city soon after ; Betances ' stepmother and one of his brothers @-@ in @-@ law would die from it . By October 1856 Betances would have to take care of the entire operation on his own temporarily . 
 At the time , he had his first confrontation with Spanish authorities , since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish @-@ born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease ( they demanded preferential and immediate treatment , and he openly despised them for it ) . For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera epidemic of 1856 , Betances was commended by the city 's government . However , when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city , Betances ( who was the acting chief surgeon ) was passed over , in favor of a Spanish newcomer . 
 Basora and Betances were eventually honored with streets named after each in the city of Mayagüez . The main thoroughfare that crosses the city from north to south is named after Betances ; a street that links the center of the city with the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez is named after Dr. Basora . 
 = = Exile from and return to Puerto Rico = = 
 = = = Abolitionist = = = 
 Betances believed in the abolition of slavery , inspired not only on written works by Victor <unk> , John Brown , Lamartine and Tapia , but also on personal experience , based on what he saw at his father 's farm and in daily Puerto Rican life . Based on his beliefs , he founded a civic organization in 1856 , one of many others that were later called the Secret Abolitionist Societies by historians . Little is known about them due to their clandestine nature , but Betances and Salvador Brau ( a close friend who later became the official Historian of Puerto Rico ) describe them in their writings . Some of these societies sought the freedom and free passage of maroons from Puerto Rico to countries where slavery had been abolished already ; other societies sought to liberate as many slaves as possible by buying out their freedom . 
 The objective of the particular society Betances founded was to free children who were slaves , taking advantage of their need to receive the sacrament of Baptism at the town church , Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria , which is now the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Mayagüez . Since buying the freedom of slave children cost 50 pesos if the child had been baptized , and 25 pesos if the child had not , Betances , Basora , Segundo Ruiz Belvis and other members of the society waited next to the baptismal font on Sundays , expecting a master to take a slave family to baptize their child . Before the child was baptized , Betances or his partners gave money to the parents , which they in turn used to buy the child 's freedom from his master . The child , once freed , was baptized minutes after . This action was later described as having the child receive the " aguas de libertad " ( waters of liberty ) . Similar events occurred in the city of Ponce . 
 The baptismal font where these baptisms were performed still exists , and is owned by a local family of merchants , the Del Moral family , who keep it at their Mayagüez house . 
 As of 2007 the baptismal font has been donated to the Mayagüez Cathedral , Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria , by Doña Elda Del Moral . It had been in conservation from 1963 until donated .

 The Spanish governor of Puerto Rico , Fernando Cotoner , threatened Betances with exile in 1858 because of his abolitionist tactics . Betances took a leave of absence from his duties as director of the local hospital and again left Puerto Rico for France , followed by Basora . Soon , his half @-@ sister Clara and her husband , Justine <unk> , would also leave for Paris with his niece , María del Carmen <unk> . 
 María del Carmen , nicknamed Lita , was born in 1838 . She had met Betances when she was 10 , and Betances became instantly fond of her . Once he returned to Puerto Rico from his medical studies he requested the necessary ecclesiastical permissions to marry her ( due to the degree of consanguinity between them ) , which were granted in Rome ( then part of the Papal States ) after an extended delay . Their marriage was supposed to occur on May 5 , 1859 in Paris , but Lita fell sick with typhus and died at the <unk> house of Dr. Pierre <unk> , a friend from Betances ' medical school days , on April 22 , 1859 ( the Good Friday of that year ) . 
 Betances was psychologically devastated by Lita 's death . Accompanied by his sister , brother @-@ in @-@ law , local friends and a few Puerto Rican friends residing in Paris at the time ( which included Basora , Francisco <unk> and another Cabo Rojo native , future political leader Salvador Carbonell ) , Betances had Lita buried on April 25 . Her body was later reburied in Mayagüez , on November 13 of that year . Salvador Brau , a historian and close friend , later wrote that once Betances returned to Puerto Rico with Lita 's body , he suspended all personal activities besides his medical work , spent a considerable amount of time caring for her tomb at the Mayagüez cemetery , and assumed the physical aspect that most people identify Betances with : dark suit , long unkempt beard , and " Quaker " hat . 
 Betances immersed himself in work , but later found time to write a short story in French , La <unk> de Boriquén ( The Boriquén Virgin ) , inspired in his love for Lita and her later death , and somewhat influenced by Edgar Allan Poe 's writing style . Cayetano Coll y Toste later described the story of Lita and Betances in the story La Novia de Betances ,

 After returning to Puerto Rico in 1859 , Betances established a very successful surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez . Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro @-@ monarchy journalist José Pérez <unk> regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time . His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years . In 1895 , while Betances was living in Paris , the manufacturers of the <unk> de Scott ( a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today , manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times ) , paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean , based on his solid reputation as a doctor . 
 Betances introduced new surgical and aseptic procedures to Puerto Rico . With the assistance of Venezuelan anesthesiologist Pedro Arroyo , Betances performed the first ever surgical procedure under chloroform in Puerto Rico , in November 1862 . 
 At the same time he spent a considerable amount of time serving Mayagüez 's disadvantaged on a pro bono basis . He gave many donations to the poor , and because of this he became known as " The Father of the Poor " among " <unk> " according to his contemporary , Eugenio María de Hostos . 
 = = = = Exile in the Dominican Republic = = = = 
 The Dominican Republic had its second war for independence in 1844 , which was successful in obtaining independence from Haiti . Spain <unk> the country at the request of its then @-@ dictator , Gen. Pedro Santana ( who attempted to benefit personally from the event ) , in 1861 . A third revolt , the War of Restoration , sought independence from the Spanish in 1863 . Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base , since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration of slavery in the occupied territories , and was thus sympathetic to their cause . Their stronghold , however , was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola . 
 At the same time , the Spanish government , which ruled over Puerto Rico , attempted to banish Betances for a second time , but he and Segundo Ruiz Belvis ( a lawyer and city administrator who became his closest friend and political companion ) fled the island before they were apprehended . Both fled to the northern city of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic in 1861 , where Betances established a close personal friendship with Gen. Gregorio Luperón , the military leader of the northern pro @-@ independence faction who led the efforts to restore Dominican sovereignty over their country . Betances was also a collaborator of Dominican priest ( and later Archbishop of Santo Domingo and one @-@ time president of the country ) , Fernando Arturo de <unk> , who was the revolt 's ideological leader ( as well as its delegate in Puerto Rico when he was himself exiled by the restored republican government ) . These two friendships would prove to be key to Betances ' own efforts to achieve Puerto Rican independence later on . 
 The volatility of the Dominican situation was severe at the time : Luperón fought a guerrilla war against the Spanish and Santana and became vice @-@ president of the country ( in 1863 ) , only to be exiled to Saint Thomas because of his opposition to president Buenaventura Báez ' wishes to annex the country to the United States ( in 1864 ) , to later return , provoke a coup d 'état and be part of a three @-@ way presidency ( 1866 ) , only to be exiled once again ( 1868 ) . Whenever Luperón was in the Dominican Republic , Betances could use it as a base of operations for his later political and military objectives , while offering Luperón logistical and financial assistance in return . 
 Since Betances ' exile depended on who was governing Puerto Rico at the time , a change in government allowed him to return to Mayagüez in 1862 . However , a few years later , ( 1868 ) Luperón and Betances would both end up exiled in Saint Thomas .

 After returning to Puerto Rico , Betances and Ruiz proposed the establishment of a municipal hospital to take care of the city 's poor . The hospital , named Hospital San Antonio , opened on January 18 , 1865 , with subscription funds and an assignment from the Spanish local government . The Hospital San Antonio is now an obstetrics and pediatrics hospital in the city . 
 Ruiz was a Freemason who invited Betances to join his lodge , the Logia Unión Germana in nearby San Germán . They both founded ( or revived , depending on the source ) the Logia <unk> , so as to have a local lodge in Mayagüez . Based on his Masonic beliefs , Ruiz also attempted to establish a university in the city , for which he mortgaged his house . However , the Spanish government actively discouraged the founding of secondary education institutions in Puerto Rico ( so as not to have " seedlings for revolt " come out of them ) , and the project was canceled . 
 = = = = Simplicia Jiménez = = = = 
 Betances met his lifelong companion , Simplicia <unk> Jiménez Carlo , in 1864 . Jiménez apparently was born in what would later become the Dominican Republic , on July 28 , 1842 . Her mother 's last name , Carlo , rather common in Cabo Rojo , implies that her family had ties to the town . She worked for one of Betances ' sisters between 1863 and 1864 , and he met her once at his sister 's house . Apparently she was infatuated with him strongly enough to appear at his door with a pair of suitcases , asking him to give her shelter , since " no gentleman would leave a woman alone on the street at night . " Jiménez then became Betances ' common @-@ law wife for thirty @-@ five years , and survived his death in 1898 . They would not have any children . Their godchild , Magdalena <unk> , was eventually adopted by the couple as their daughter . Little else is documented about Jiménez in history books , and Betances rarely mentions her in his works and correspondence . 
 While still living in Mayagüez , Betances built a house for himself and his wife , which they only lived in for less than two years ; the house , named the Casa de los Cinco Arcos ( House of the Five Arches ) , still stands on the street that bears his name near the corner with Luis Muñoz Rivera street , south of the city 's center . Apparently a single , elderly man lives in the house to this day .

 The Spanish government was involved in several conflicts across Latin America : war with the Dominican Republic , Peru and Chile ( see below ) , slave revolts in Cuba , a bad economic situation in its colonies , among others . It attempted to appease the growing discontent of the citizens of its remaining colonies in the continent by setting up a board of review that would receive complaints from representatives of the colonies and attempt to adjust legislation that affected them . This board , the " Junta <unk> de <unk> de Ultramar " ( Overseas Informative Reform Board ) would be formed by representatives of each colony , in proportion to their collective population , and would meet in Madrid . The Junta would report to the then Minister of Foreign Affairs , Emilio Castelar . 
 The Puerto Rican delegation was freely elected by those eligible to vote ( male Caucasian property owners ) , in a rare exercise of political openness in the colony . Segundo Ruiz Belvis was elected to the Junta representing Mayagüez , something that horrified the then governor general of the island . To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates , including its leader , José Julián Acosta , the Junta had a majority of Spanish @-@ born delegates , which would vote down almost every measure they suggested . However , Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy ( including its Cuban members , who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor ) . Once he became prime minister in 1870 , Castelar did approve an abolition bill , praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members , sincerely moved by Acosta 's arguments . 
 However , beyond abolition , proposals for autonomy were voted down , as were other petitions to limit the unlimited power the governor general would have upon virtually all aspects of life in Puerto Rico . Once the Junta members returned to Puerto Rico , they met with local community leaders in a famed meeting at the Hacienda El Cacao in Carolina , Puerto Rico in early 1865 . Betances was invited by Ruiz and did attend . After listening to the Junta members ' list of voted @-@ down measures , Betances stood up and retorted : " Nadie <unk> dar lo que no tiene " ( No one can give others what they don 't have for themselves ) , a phrase that he would constantly use through the rest of his life when referring to Spain 's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms . He would then suggest setting up a revolt and proclaim independence as soon as possible . Many of the meeting 's attendants sided with Betances , to the horror of Acosta . 
 = = = = Organizer of the Grito de Lares = = = = 
 In late June 1867 Betances and at least 12 more potential " revolutionaries " were exiled from Puerto Rico by then governor Gen. José María <unk> y <unk> as a preventive measure , including Goyco and Ruiz . A battalion of local soldiers had revolted in San Juan earlier , protesting about their poor pay , compared to that of their Spanish counterparts living in Puerto Rico . Betances later stated that the revolt ( called the " <unk> de <unk> " by historians ) was unrelated to his revolutionary plans , and that he actually did not mind the troops stationed in Puerto Rico that much , since they would have been ill @-@ prepared for stopping a well @-@ developed pro @-@ independence revolt at the time anyway . <unk> feared that the United States , which had made an offer to purchase what were then the Danish Virgin Islands , would rather instigate a revolt in Puerto Rico so as to later annex the island — which would make a better military base in the Caribbean — at a lesser economic cost . His fears were not without base , since the then American consul in the island , Alexander Jourdan , suggested precisely this to then Secretary of State William H. Seward , but only after the expulsions ( September 1867 ) . 
 Some of the expelled ( such as Carlos Elías Lacroix and José Celis Aguilera ) set up camp in Saint Thomas . Betances and Ruiz , on the other hand , left for New York — where Basora had previously gone — soon after . They soon founded the " Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico " , along with other Puerto Ricans living in the city . After signing a letter that could serve as proof of his intentions of becoming a United States citizen ( mainly to prevent his arrest elsewhere ) Betances then returned to the Dominican Republic in September 1867 , where he attempted to organize an armed expedition that was to invade Puerto Rico . However , under threat of arrest by Buenaventura Báez — who saw Betances as siding with his enemies and wanted him executed — Betances took asylum at the United States embassy in Santo Domingo , and headed for Charlotte Amalie soon after . 
 = = = = The Ten Commandments of Free Men = = = = 
 Betances was responsible for numerous proclamations that attempted to arouse Puerto Rican nationalistic sentiment , written between 1861 and his death . The most famous of these is " Los Diez <unk> de los <unk> libres " ( The Ten Commandments of Free Men ) , written in exile in Saint Thomas in November 1867 . It is directly based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , adopted by France 's National Assembly in 1789 , which contained the principles that inspired the French Revolution . 
 = = = = The Grito and its aftermath = = = = 
 Meanwhile , Ruiz Belvis , who headed the Committee , was supposed to gather financial support for the incoming Puerto Rican revolution through a tour of South America . He had received an invitation from Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna , a Chilean diplomat , to coordinate a common front against Spanish interests in all of Latin America ( Spain was still threatening Chile after the Chincha Islands War , and any revolution in the Caribbean would have been a welcome distraction ) . Vicuña promised to gather necessary support in Chile , Peru , Ecuador and Venezuela to help the Puerto Rican independence cause . 
 However , Ruiz died in Valparaíso , Chile soon after his arrival in the country . He reportedly had uremia and a urethral obstruction , both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene , which killed him soon after . Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts : that Ruiz 's brother , Mariano Ruiz Quiñones ( who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao ) , died of the same condition soon after ( suggesting a genetic predisposition to it ) , that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition , and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later , in 1887 , that discussed the condition , out of what he had described as many years of second @-@ guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz 's life . 
 Betances was shaken psychologically by news of Ruiz 's death , and also literally soon after : he and his wife also experienced an earthquake and tsunami on November 18 , 1867 , while in Saint Thomas . According to a letter he wrote , he and his wife vacated the building just before it collapsed , and were forced to live in a camp while aftershocks kept shaking the island for close to a month . 
 Gregorio Luperón met Betances in Saint Thomas , and offered to assist the Puerto Rican revolution , in exchange for help to overthrow Báez once the right circumstances were met . As a consequence , Betances organized revolutionary cells in Puerto Rico from exile , which would be led by leaders such as Manuel Rojas and Mathias Brugman . Betances instructed Mariana Bracetti to knit a flag for the revolution using the colors and basic design similar to that of the Dominican Republic ( which in turn was almost identical to a French military standard ) . Betances was also supposed to send reinforcements to the Puerto Rican rebels through the use of a ship purchased by Puerto Rican and Dominican revolutionaries , " El Telégrafo " ( which was to be shared by both ) , but the ship was confiscated soon after arrival by the government of the then Danish ( later United States ) Virgin Islands . 
 Eventually all these factors led the way to the abortive insurrection known as the " Grito de Lares " , whose date had to be brought forward to September 23 , 1868 . The Grito found Betances between Curaçao and Saint Thomas , struggling to send reinforcements in time for the revolt . 
 After the failed insurrection , Betances did not return to Puerto Rico , except for " secret " visits , according to the obituary written about him by the New York Herald after his death . There is no evidence of these , although Betances suggests a visit did occur at some time between 1867 and 1869 , and perhaps again in the 1880s . 
 = = = = In New York = = = = 
 Betances fled to New York City in April 1869 , where he again joined Basora in his efforts to organize Puerto Rican revolutionaries into additional activities leading to independence . He joined the Cuban Revolutionary Junta , whose members were more successful at their drive for armed revolution for Cuba , which had started with the " Grito de Yara " , just two weeks after the Grito de Lares . He also lobbied the United States Congress successfully against an annexation of the Dominican Republic by the United States , requested in a vote by a majority of voters in a referendum in 1869 . He also befriended Venezuelan military leader and former president José Antonio Páez in his final days . Betances stayed in New York from April 1869 through February 1870 . 
 = = = = In Hispaniola = = = = 
 Somewhat disillusioned by his experience in New York City ( he had philosophical differences with some leaders of the Antillean liberation movements , particularly with Eugenio María de Hostos ) , Betances spent a short interlude in Jacmel , Haiti in 1870 at the request of its then @-@ president , Jean <unk> @-@ Saget , who supported Betances ' efforts to have a liberal government for the Dominican Republic take power . He later spent some time in the Cibao valley ( in both Santiago de los Caballeros and Puerto Plata ) where Luperón and Betances attempted to organize another revolt , this time against conservative elements in the Dominican Republic . 
 While in New York , Betances wrote and translated numerous political treatises , proclamations and works that were published in the newspaper " La Revolución " , under the pseudonym " El <unk> " ( The Antillean One ) . He was vehement about the need for natives of the Greater Antilles to unite into an Antillean Confederation , a regional entity that would seek to preserve the sovereignty and well @-@ being of Cuba , Haiti , the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico . 
 Betances also promoted direct intervention of Puerto Ricans in the Cuban independence struggle , which eventually happened in the Cuban War of Independence ( 1895 – 98 ) . Spain had promoted political reform in Puerto Rico , and the local political climate was not conducive to a second revolution at the time . Therefore , Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas , Curaçao and Haiti to the Cuban rebels in October 1871 , since their struggle was deemed as a priority . 
 Betances admired the United States of America for its ideals of freedom and democracy , but despised Manifest Destiny and the Monroe Doctrine , and sensed that both philosophies were being used as excuses for American interventions on the continent . When Cuban revolutionaries requested help from the United States for reinforcing their armed struggle against Spain , Betances warned them against giving too much away . He feared American interventionism in the affairs of a free Cuba , and vehemently attacked Cuban leaders who suggested the annexation of Cuba by the United States . Some of his fears became reality years later , when the Platt Amendment became a " de facto " part of the Cuban constitution ( 1901 ) . 
 = = Return to France = = 
 Expecting to bring some stability to his personal life , Betances had Simplicia Jiménez meet him again in Haiti ( she had been living in St. Croix since he was evicted from Saint Thomas , to ensure her safety ) , and returned with her to Paris where he continued to fight for Puerto Rico 's independence for close to 26 years . He established his medical office at 6 ( bis ) , Rue de <unk> ( 48 @.@ <unk> ° N 2 @.@ <unk> ° E ﻿ / 48 @.@ <unk> ; 2 @.@ <unk> ﻿ ( Betances medical office ) ) , four streets away from the city 's Palais Garnier . 
 One of the events that gave Betances great satisfaction was the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico , which was made official on March 22 , 1873 . He reminded people that abolition would not have happened without the direct intervention of Puerto Ricans in the Spanish political process , and was thus hopeful that the islanders would assume a more proactive role in seeking their freedom from Spain . With time , Betances became essentially the representative of the liberal governments of the Dominican Republic for as long as they lasted , and the representative of the Cuban " government in arms " , or insurrection . 
 = = = Diplomatic and revolutionary activities = = = 
 = = = = Diplomat for the Dominican Republic = = = = 
 Soon after his return to France , Betances became the first secretary to the Dominican Republic 's diplomatic mission to France , but virtually assumed the role of ambassador . He also became the commercial representative of the Dominican government in Paris , Bern and London . At one time Betances attempted to be a venture capital partner on a failed enterprise that attempted to commercialize the use of Samaná Bay to benefit the Dominican Republic , and also to prevent foreign interests ( particularly the United States ) from taking over the bay , which was considered a primary strategic geographical feature of Hispaniola , in both commercial and military terms . 
 Luperón would eventually arrive in Paris as a named ambassador , but Betances ' connections in the city proved to be key to whatever success Luperón had as a diplomat in France . They would assume this role until political turmoil in the Dominican Republic forced Luperón to return and lead yet another revolt , which had another Puerto Plata native , Ulises Heureaux , installed as president . Betances sought support for Luperón 's efforts , and gave him tactical and financial assistance from France . 
 Heureaux , however , became a despot once he assumed the presidency . Luperón felt betrayed and went again into exile in Saint Thomas . Eventually he died of cancer , not before visiting Betances in France for a last time and being allowed to return to the Dominican Republic to die , as a gesture of good will from Heureaux . Due to Heureaux 's protracted presidency and blatant acts of corruption , Betances ( who had called Heureaux his " grandson " in letters he had previously written to him ) was forced to cut ties to the Dominican Republic for good ( two plots of land that he owned both there and in Panama were used for agricultural experiments , but were later left unattended ) . Betances writes in his letters that he had spent the equivalent of US $ 20 @,@ 000 ( in 1880 dollars , roughly equivalent to US $ 400 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) on expenditures on behalf of the Dominican diplomatic office . He did not expect the Dominican government to be able to reimburse him . 
 = = = = Support for Cuba 's independence and José Maceo 's freedom = = = = 
 Immediately after returning to Paris , Betances became a key contact for the Cuban insurgency in Paris . He made several fund raising efforts , including one that attempted to fund quinine shipments to the Cuban rebels , to ease their pain when infected by malaria in the island battlefields . These efforts outlasted the Pact of <unk> , which ended the Ten Years ' War in 1878 . Betances also used his diplomatic contacts to guarantee humane treatment ( and eventually freedom from imprisonment ) to José Maceo , the brother of Antonio Maceo , the later military leader of the Cuban War of Independence , when both Antonio and José were arrested by the Spanish government in 1882 . The Maceo brothers both escaped imprisonment , were recaptured in Gibraltar and turned over to the Spanish authorities , but José remained in jail long after Antonio regained his liberty and fled to New York City . Betances even used Lord Gladstone as a mediator , and attempted to convince him of having Jamaica ( where his family had properties ) join an Antillean Federation . 
 = = = = Betances and Máximo Gómez = = = = 
 When Puerto Rico experienced a period of severe political repression in 1887 by the Spanish governor of the time , Romualdo Palacio ( which led to the arrest of many local political leaders , including Román Baldorioty de Castro ) , Máximo Gómez , who was living in Panama at the time ( at the time , he supervised a laborers ' brigade during the construction of the Panama Canal ) offered his services to Betances , sold most of his personal belongings to finance a revolt in Puerto Rico , and volunteered to lead any Puerto Rican troops had such revolt occur . The revolt was deemed unnecessary later in the year , when the Spanish government recalled Palacio from office to investigate charges of abuse of power from his part , but Gómez and Betances established a friendship and logistical relationship that lasted until Betances ' death in 1898 . 
 = = = = Betances and José Martí = = = = 
 Years later , due to Betances ' experience as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts , a fund raiser for the Cuban independence cause , and as a diplomat , José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France . Betances never met Martí personally , but Martí did know Betances ' younger sister , <unk> , who lived in New York City and shared her brother 's revolutionary ideals . Martí assisted her financially in her final days , out of admiration for the Betances ' family . Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí . Soon after , Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895 , an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to the leadership of the Cuban insurrection movement . 
 = = = = Betances and Tomás Estrada Palma = = = = 
 In April 1896 Betances was granted diplomatic credentials on behalf of the revolutionary government of Cuba . He became an active fund raiser and recruiter on behalf of the Cuban pro @-@ independence movement . He also served as press officer and intelligence contact for the Cuban rebels in exile , and attempted to coordinate support for the pro @-@ independence movement in the Philippines . 
 Betances openly hated Estrada when he first met him in the late 1870s , but grew more tolerant of him with time , and even defended Estrada 's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party . The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada 's leadership with great skepticism , since Estrada sympathized with the idea of having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba . They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba . Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations , at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down , which eventually did happen . 
 = = = = The Intentona de Yauco = = = = 
 In 1897 , Antonio Mattei <unk> , a wealthy coffee plantation owner from Yauco , visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City . There he met with Ramón Emeterio Betances , Juan de Mata <unk> and Aurelio Méndez Martínez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup . The uprising , which became known as the Intentona de Yauco was to be directed by Betances , organized by Aurelio Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Juan Ríus Rivera . The coup , which was the second and last major revolt against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico failed . 
 Betances was also a government representative for some of the governments of Haiti while in Paris . He was also technically a diplomat for the United States of America once . 
 = = = = Morales Plan = = = = 
 Through coordination with Betances and local pro @-@ independence leaders in Puerto Rico , a Dominican military leader , Gen. José Morales , made plans to invade Puerto Rico in the late 1890s , to supply local revolutionaries with supplies and mercenaries , and take advantage of the weak Spanish military presence in Puerto Rico ( there were only 4 @,@ 500 Spanish soldiers in the island at the time , and 1 @,@ 000 of them were later redirected to Cuba to fight the Cuban insurrection ) . However , the Cuban Revolutionary Party rejected the plan as being too expensive . 
 Betances , who had collected more money in France for the Party than the plan 's potential cost , grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement 's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause . By then , some of the Party 's followers stationed in France wanted Betances to be stripped of his posts and assignments . At least two of them insulted him publicly , and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez 's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically . 
 Given the events happening in Cuba at the time , Betances thought that his diplomatic work was more important than ever . However , his failing health ( he had uremia , and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden to his heart and kidneys ) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba . His illness , which lasted more than a year , prevented him from performing medical work , and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness , until his death . 
 = = = The Cánovas Affair = = = 
 There is some speculation that the assassination of Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo in 1897 was at least supported or influenced by Betances , and possibly even planned by him ( although there is no physical link that can be established that might link Betances to the event itself ) . 
 Betances ' role in the Cánovas assassination is described by Puerto Rican ( born in France ) author Luis <unk> in his biography about Betances ( written in 1901 ) , and partially corroborated by later historians . These sources establish that Betances ' circle of friends at the time included various Italian anarchists exiled in Paris , Domenico Tosti being one of them . Tosti and his friends would hold regular social events , during one of which Angiolillo was introduced to Betances . 
 Impressed by Betances ' credentials , Angiolillo later approached Betances before the incident , and discussed his plans with him , which originally implied killing one or more young members of the Spanish royal family . Betances then dissuaded him from doing this . Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead . There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo 's travel to Spain , and used his contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity . Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded ( although Betances , who was a fan of firearms himself — he taught a Cuban revolutionary leader on how to use a Remington machine gun once — gave at least one as a gift to one of his acquaintances ) . 
 Betances sympathized with anarchists like Angiolillo , and hated monarchists like Cánovas , but this alone would not justify direct action from Betances into taking Cánovas ' life . Betances did state at the time , however , that " in Spain <unk> is only one true retrograde and reactionary leader , and he is precisely the one who confronts Cuba with a policy of ' ( spending in a war up to ) the very last man and the very last peseta , ' the one who tries to suffocate all efforts that her patriots do to free her , and that man is Antonio Cánovas del Castillo . " 
 Angiolillo , in true solidarity with the European anarchist current , sought to avenge the execution and / or torture of those implicated in a bombing against a Roman Catholic religious procession in Barcelona , which occurred in 1896 , and for which Cánovas sought the maximum penalties allowed by law . 
 The truth is that Puerto Rican liberal interests benefited directly from the Cánovas assassination , since by Cánovas ' death a pact made ( previous to the event ) between the new Spanish prime minister , Práxedes Mateo Sagasta , and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after . It allowed the establishment of a new autonomy charter for the island territory , which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers than at any other time before or since . 
 Before his execution , Angiolillo claimed sole responsibility for the assassination . When asked about his involvement in the Cánovas affair , Betances said : " No <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( " We don 't applaud it , but we don 't cry over it , either " ) , and added : " Los <unk> <unk> <unk> lo que deben <unk> " ( " True revolutionaries do what they ought to do " ) . Betances ' ambiguous response blurs the true level of his involvement in the Cánovas assassination . 
 = = = Legion of Honor award = = = 
 Betances was awarded the rank of <unk> ( Knight ) of the Legion of Honor by the French government in July 1887 , for his work as a diplomat for the Dominican Republic , and for his work as a medical doctor in France . He had been offered the award as early as 1882 , but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility , until friends from Puerto Rico persuaded him to accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico , and not as a personal award . The French Legion of Honor ( Légion d 'honneur ) is the premier order of France , and its award is one of great distinction . 
 = = = Efforts to counter the U.S. annexation of Puerto Rico = = = 
 In 1898 Betances attempted to use his diplomatic contacts to impede a Puerto Rico annexation by the United States , which was deemed imminent by the events following the sinking of the USS Maine . He knew that Puerto Ricans would welcome an American invasion , but was vehement about the possibility of the United States not conceding independence to Puerto Rico . 
 Betances was willing to accept some political concessions to the American government in exchange for independence , and exchanged some privileged intelligence information ( about the level of debt Spain had attained while fighting the Cuban insurrection ) with the then @-@ ambassador of the United States to France , Horace Porter , so as to show goodwill towards the United States . 
 Frustrated by what he perceived as the unwillingness of Puerto Ricans to demand their independence from the United States while the island territory was annexed ( the event occurred just days before his death ) , he uttered his final political stance : " No <unk> colonia , ni con España , ni con los Estados Unidos " ( " I don 't want a colony status , neither with Spain nor with the United States " ) . When reminded by de Hostos through a letter of what was happening in the island , he responded , highly frustrated , with a phrase that has become famous since : " ¿ Y qué les <unk> a los <unk> que no se <unk> ? " ( " And what 's wrong with Puerto Ricans that they haven 't yet rebelled ? " ) 
 Betances ' last days were chaotic , not only because of the events in the Caribbean , but also because of what happening in his own household . Jiménez ' mental state is reported as dubious by then . Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic ( probably ) or even a morphine addict ( unlikely ) by then , and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors . Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances ' intelligence dossiers , as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris . Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him , which they did until he died . 
 = = Death = = 
 Betances died at 10 : 00 a.m. , local time , in Neuilly @-@ sur @-@ Seine on Friday , September 16 , 1898 . His remains were cremated soon after and entombed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery of Paris on Monday , September 19 . He had requested that no formal ceremony be made for his funeral . His common law @-@ wife Simplicia survived him for over twenty years . A look at his will implies that , besides a life insurance policy payout and two parcels of land in the Dominican Republic , Betances died almost in poverty . 
 As early as in February 1913 , poet and lawyer Luis <unk> Torres had publicly requested that Betances ' wishes to have his ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled . The Nationalist Association ( predecessor of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ) , under the presidency of José Coll y <unk> , was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act that would allow the transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris , France to Puerto Rico . Seven years after the act 's approval , the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates , Alfonso Lastra <unk> , to serve as an emissary and bring Betances ' remains from France . 
 Betances ' remains arrived in San Juan , Puerto Rico on August 5 , 1920 , and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then estimated at 20 @,@ 000 mourners . The large crowd , which had assembled near the port of San Juan as early as 4 : 00 a.m. ( AST ) that morning , was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico since the death of Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier . Media reporters of the day were surprised by the size of the crowd , given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico ( at least in the open ) for the 31 years before his death , and had been dead over 21 years afterwards . 
 A funeral caravan organized by the Nationalist Party transferred the remains from the capital to the town of Cabo Rojo . It took the caravan two days to make the 120 @-@ mile ( 193 km ) route . Once Betances ' remains reached the city of Mayagüez , 8 @,@ 000 mourners paid their respects . Betances ' remains were laid to rest in Cabo Rojo 's municipal cemetery . A few decades later his remains were moved to a monument designed to honor Betances in the town 's plaza . There is a bust created by the Italian sculptor Diego Montano alongside the Grito de Lares revolutionary flag and the Puerto Rican flag in the plaza , which is also named after Betances . 
 A marble plaque commemorating Betances was unveiled at his Paris house by a delegation of Puerto Rican , Cuban and French historians on the <unk> anniversary of his death , on September 16 , 1998 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 According to Puerto Ricans and French historians in three different fields ( medicine , literature and politics ) , Betances left a legacy that has been considerably understated , and is only being assessed properly in recent times . 
 = = = Complete Works = = = 
 Betances ' two primary biographers , Paul Estrade and Félix Ojeda Reyes , have announced the publication of a compilation of Betances ' complete works , comprising 14 volumes . José Carvajal is the collection 's editor . The first two volumes were formally published in Mayagüez on April 8 , 2008 . The first volume features most of Betances ' written works about medicine ; the second features intimate letters and document excerpts Betances wrote to family and friends over a span of 39 years . A third volume , which compiles some of Betances ' literary works , was published in 2009 . 
 The Voz del Centro Foundation in Puerto Rico released a series of youth @-@ oriented books named " Voces de la Cultura - Edición Juvenil " that same year ; its first title being " Doctor Ramón Emeterio Betances : Luchador por la libertad y los pobres " ( " Doctor R.

 = = = Political and sociological = = = 
 = = = = In Puerto Rico = = = = 
 The political and sociological consequences of Betances ' actions are definite and unequivocal . He was the first openly nationalistic political leader in Puerto Rico , and one of the first pro @-@ independence leaders in the island nation 's history ( Among Puerto Ricans , Antonio Valero de Bernabé and Andrés Vizcarrondo — earlier pro @-@ independence leaders for the Latin American revolutions — could not achieve the success Betances had years later within Puerto Rico ) . The Grito de Lares , using an often @-@ quoted phrase that dates from 1868 , " was the birth of Puerto Rican nationality , with Betances as its obstetrician " . Nationalistic expressions in Puerto Rico — be they public affirmations , newspaper articles , poems , town meetings or outright revolts — were almost nonexistent before the 1810s election of Ramón Power y <unk> to the Spanish Cortes , most of them were defined within the framework of loyalty to Spain as a metropolitan power ( and thus subordinate to Spanish rule over Puerto Rico ) , and many of them were quickly suppressed by the Spanish government , which feared an escalation of nationalistic sentiment that , in other countries , led to the independence movements of Latin America . 
 Although the seeds of both proactive government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares , and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of <unk> as a political alternative in the island , the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost a direct consequence of the event . To put it simply , if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day , almost all of it can be traced back to Betances and his political work . 
 Betances is considered a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism . His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the <unk> century . These ideas , considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era , had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation 's political and social history . His ideas on race relations alone had a major impact on economics and the social makeup of the island . 
 = = = = In the Greater Antilles = = = = 
 Political events in Puerto Rico and Cuba between the late 1860s and 1898 forced a liberalization of Spanish policy towards both territories , and Betances was directly involved as a protagonist in both circumstances . As a firm believer in " <unk> " ( the common improvement and unity of the countries that formed the Greater Antilles ) Betances was also a strong supporter of the sovereignty of the Dominican Republic and Haiti . A Dominican historian and political leader , Manuel Rodríguez <unk> , likened Betances ' revolutionary work to that performed by Tadeusz Kościuszko for Poland , Lithuania and the United States of America . Paul Estrade , Betances ' French biographer , likens him to Simón Bolívar , Antonio José de Sucre , Bernardo O 'Higgins and José de San Martín . 
 José Martí considered Betances one of his " teachers " , or sources of political inspiration , and his diplomatic and intelligence work in France on behalf of the Cuban revolutionary junta greatly aided the cause , before it was directly influenced by the intervention of Gen. <unk> <unk> as governor and commander of the Spanish forces in Cuba , and by the Maine incident later on . 
 Paul Estrade , Betances ' French biographer , assesses his legacy as an Antillean this way : " The Antilles have developed political , social and scientific ideas that have changed the world , and that Europe has used . Not everything has ( a European ) source . Betances is the maximum expression of this reality . " 
 = = = Medical = = = 
 Betances wrote two books and various medical treatises while living in France . His doctoral thesis , " Des Causes de l <unk> " ( The Causes for Miscarriage ) examines various possible causes for the spontaneous death of a fetus and / or its mother , was later used as a textbook on gynecology at some European universities . According to at least one medical practitioner who examined it in 1988 , his attempt to explain the theory behind spontaneous contractions leading to childbirth were not very different from modern @-@ day theories on the matter . 
 Betances ' experiences handling the Mayagüez cholera epidemic led to another book , " El <unk> : Historia , <unk> <unk> , <unk> y Tratamiento " ( Cholera : History , Preventive Measures , Symptoms and Treatments ) , which he authored and published in Paris in 1884 and expanded in 1890 . The book was later used as a public health textbook in dealing with similar cholera epidemics in Latin America . 
 Betances also wrote several medical articles while in France . One of the articles examines elephantiasis ; another deals with surgical castration , called " <unk> " at the time . Both books were also based on personal experience : there is evidence about a surgery he performed in Mayagüez on a Spanish government official with an elephantiasis lesion of the scrotum the size of a grapefruit for which the costs were paid for by the local government ; another patient he operated upon had a lesion that weighed 26 lb ( 12 kg ) He also wrote an article on urethral obstructions in male patients ( see above ) .

 Betances was also one of the first Puerto Rican " writers @-@ in @-@ exile " . In 1851 , a small group of Puerto Rican university students in Europe formed the " Sociedad <unk> de <unk> Históricos de la Isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico " , a society that attempted to research and catalog historical documents about Puerto Rico from firsthand government sources . Betances became the Society 's researcher in France . The result of the Society 's research was published in an 1854 book , for which Betances contributed . Inspired by Alejandro Tapia y Rivera , the Society 's organizer , who had written a novel inspired in Puerto Rican indigenous themes while studying in Madrid , Betances writes his novel : " Les Deux Indiens : <unk> de la <unk> de Borinquen " ( The Two Indians : an episode of the conquest of Borinquen ) , and publishes it in Toulouse in 1853 , with a second edition published in 1857 under the pseudonym " Louis Raymond " . This novel would be the first of many literary works by Betances ( most of which were written in French ) , and is notable for its indirect praise of Puerto Rican nationhood which , he suggests , was already developed in pre @-@ Columbian Puerto Rico . This type of " <unk> literature " would become commonplace in Latin America in later years . He also wrote poetry in both French and Spanish for literary magazines in Paris , chiefly inspired by Alphonse de Lamartine and Victor Hugo .

 = Russian battleship Pobeda = 
 Pobeda , ( Russian : <unk> , translit . Victory ) , was the last of the three Peresvet @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy at the end of the nineteenth century . The ship was assigned to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur from 1903 . During the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 1905 , she participated in the battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea . Having escaped serious damage in these engagements , Pobeda was sunk by gunfire during the Siege of Port Arthur , and then salvaged by the Japanese and placed into service under the name Suwo ( <unk> ) . 
 Rearmed and re @-@ boilered by the Japanese , Suwo was reclassified by the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) as a coastal defense ship in 1908 and served as a training ship for several years . She was the flagship of the Japanese squadron that participated in the Battle of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I and continued in that role until she became a gunnery training ship in 1917 . The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably scrapped around that time . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The design of the Peresvet class was inspired by the British second @-@ class battleships ( typically faster , but with thinner armor and smaller guns than first @-@ class battleships ) of the Centurion class . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce @-@ raiding armored cruisers like the Russian ships Rossia and Rurik , and the Peresvet class was designed to support the armored cruisers . This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor . 
 Pobeda was 434 feet 5 inches ( 132 @.@ 4 m ) long overall , had a beam of 71 feet 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 79 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . Designed to displace 12 @,@ 674 long tons ( 12 @,@ 877 t ) , she was almost 600 long tons ( 610 t ) overweight and displaced 13 @,@ 320 long tons ( 13 @,@ 530 t ) . Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men . The ship was powered by three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Pobeda , however , reached a top speed of 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 3 mph ) from 15 @,@ 578 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 617 kW ) during her sea trials in October 1901 . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 060 long tons ( 2 @,@ 090 t ) of coal , which allowed her to steam for 6 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's main battery consisted of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . The secondary armament consisted of eleven Canet 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the bow , underneath the forecastle . Several smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) QF guns , twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns and eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . She was also armed with five 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , three above water and two submerged . The ship carried 45 mines to be used to protect her anchorage . Pobeda 's waterline armor belt consisted of Krupp cemented armor and was 4 – 9 inches ( 102 – 229 mm ) thick . The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 9 in ( 229 mm ) and her deck ranged from 2 to 3 inches ( 51 to 76 mm ) in thickness . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Pobeda ( Victory ) was ordered on 26 April 1898 from the Baltic Works and construction began on 30 May 1898 at the company 's Saint Petersburg shipyard , well before the formal keel @-@ laying ceremony on 21 February 1899 . The ship was launched on 10 May 1900 and towed to Kronstadt on 31 August 1901 for fitting out . She made her machinery trials in October , well before she was completed the next year . She sailed to Reval ( modern Tallinn ) on 1 August to participate in the naval review held there a few days later to commemorate the visit of the German Kaiser , Wilhelm II , to Russia . Pobeda entered service upon completing her artillery trials on October 1902 , although she was not officially accepted until 10 March 1903 , at a cost of 10 @,@ 050 @,@ 000 rubles . She had already sailed from Libau on 13 November 1902 and arrived at Port Arthur on 13 June 1903 for assignment to the Pacific Squadron . 
 = = = Battle of Port Arthur = = = 
 After the Japanese victory in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 , tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea . A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 , as it had promised . Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901 , but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems . Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs . The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea . These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable . The Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased , so as to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea . 
 On the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 , the IJN launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . Pobeda was not hit in the initial torpedo @-@ boat attack , and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō , attacked . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Pobeda was hit once or twice amidships near the waterline , losing two men killed and four wounded , but the shell ( s ) failed to penetrate the ship 's armor and little damage was done . 
 On 22 March , Pobeda joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur 's harbor and hit the Japanese battleship Fuji once , killing seven men . She participated in the action of 13 April , when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov 's flagship , the battleship Petropavlovsk . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships , he turned back for Port Arthur , and Petropavlovsk struck a mine laid by the Japanese the previous night . The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and Makarov was one of the 677 killed . When Pobeda was returning to port after Petropavlovsk sank , she struck a mine herself , but was able to steam to the harbor under her own power despite an 11 ° list . Her repairs were completed on 9 June although some of her guns were removed during this time to reinforce the defenses of the port . Pobeda lost a total of three 6 @-@ inch , two 75 @-@ millimeter , one 47 @-@ millimeter and four 37 @-@ millimeter guns . She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok . The new fleet commander , Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft , ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle . Pobeda bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July . 
 = = = Battle of the Yellow Sea = = = 
 The Japanese bombardment of 9 August , coupled with a direct order from Tsar Nicholas II , forced Vitgeft to make another attempt to reach Vladivostok . The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok the next morning . At 12 : 25 , it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea . Pobeda was third in line during the battle , and was not seriously damaged during the early long @-@ range stage of the action . Around 18 : 00 , two 12 @-@ inch shells from the battleship Asahi penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship Tsesarevich , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman , severely wounding the captain , and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn . Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft , the Russian battleline started to execute the same turn , causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich , including Pobeda , to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship . 
 As the Japanese ships continued to pound the Tsesarevich , the battleship Retvizan boldly charged Tōgō 's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet , the flagship of the squadron 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky . The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships , badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away . Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur , but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings because Peresvet 's topmasts had been shot away and were only gradually recognized . Although Pobeda was struck by eleven large @-@ caliber hits that killed 4 men and wounded 29 , including one below the waterline , they failed to penetrate her armor and she reached Port Arthur without any difficulties . The hits did , however , knock out one 10 @-@ inch gun and three 75 @-@ millimeter guns . 
 = = = Siege of Port Arthur = = = 
 Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August , the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke . The new commander , Rear Admiral Robert N. Viren , decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron 's ships . This proved to make little difference and Pobeda was struck by several 5 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) and 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch shells on 28 September that did no significant damage . The Japanese bombardment with medium guns continued for the next month and a half and the ship was repeatedly struck , without much effect . Japanese troops were able to seize 203 Hill which overlooked the harbor on 5 December . This allowed the Imperial Japanese Army 's 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships ; they hit Pobeda approximately 30 times and sank her in shallow water on 7 December 1904 . Russian attempts to destroy the ship before they surrendered were frustrated because her vital parts were already underwater . 
 = = Japanese career = = 
 Pobeda was refloated by Japanese engineers on 17 October 1905 and was classified as a 1st @-@ class battleship by the IJN . She was renamed as Suwo on 25 October , after the eponymous ancient province . She steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal , where she arrived on 16 December and began temporary repairs . Her reconstruction at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal began in May 1906 and lasted until 10 October 1908 . 
 To improve her stability , Suwo 's forward fighting top was removed . The 6 @-@ inch bow gun was also removed and all of her light guns were replaced by 20 QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns . Two above @-@ water 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men . 
 Suwo was re @-@ designated as a 1st class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912 and became a training ship for cadets and engineers . Initially assigned to the 1st Standing Squadron when World War I began , she shortly afterwards became the flagship of the 2nd Squadron , commanded by Vice Admiral Kato Sadakichi . The squadron was tasked to blockade the German @-@ owned port of Tsingtao , China , and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city . Tango and the other ships of the squadron , reinforced by the British pre @-@ dreadnought HMS Triumph , bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November . Suwo served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915 – 16 before becoming a gunnery training ship at Yokosuka for the rest of the war . In April 1922 , in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty , Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal . While her armor was being removed , the ship capsized on 13 July . She was probably scrapped in 1922 – 23 , but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked , serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946 . 
 = Andreacarus voalavo = 
 Andreacarus voalavo is a parasitic mite found on the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus . First described in 2007 , it is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus , which are found on other Malagasy rodents . The length of the idiosoma , the main body , is 630 to 670 μm in females and 450 to 480 μm in males . Unlike A. eliurus , this species lacks distinct sternal glands ( secretory organs ) between two <unk> ( sensory organs ) on the lower part of the female body . The pilus <unk> , a sensory organ on the chelicera , is serrate , which distinguishes it from A. gymnuromys . Females of A. gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield ( covering part of the underparts ) and shorter setae ( bristles ) on the upperparts . 
 = = Taxonomy and ecology = = 
 Andreacarus voalavo was named in 2007 by Ashley Dowling , Andre <unk> , and Barry <unk> on the basis of 15 specimens found on an individual of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was collected in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe @-@ Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar . The specific name , voalavo , is taken from the generic name of the type host . Voalavo gymnocaudus , the only known host , is only found in the Anjanaharibe @-@ Sud and Marojejy massifs of the Malagasy Northern Highlands . A. voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus , found on other Malagasy rodents . They are members of the genus Andreacarus , which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa . 
 = = Description = = 
 In the female , the pilus <unk> , a sensory organ on the chelicera ( mouthpart ) , is serrate , not smooth as in A. gymnuromys . The idiosoma ( main part of the body ) is 630 to 670 μm long and 370 to 435 μm wide and the dorsal shield ( covering the upper side ) is 620 to 655 μm long and 360 to 370 μm wide . The dorsal setae ( bristles ) are long relative to A. gymnuromys . The sternal shield ( on the lower side of the body ) is 115 to 125 μm long and 184 to 200 μm wide and is more ornamented than in A. gymnuromys . Unlike A. eliurus , A. voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands ( secretory organs ) between the <unk> ( sensory organs ) <unk> and <unk> on the lower side of the body . The other shields on the lower side of the body are the <unk> shield ( 232 to 253 by 170 to 182 μm ) , the <unk> shield ( 140 to 147 by 117 to 127 μm ) , and the anal shield ( 140 to 147 by 117 to 127 μm ) . On the soft part of the cuticle , there are nine pairs of setae . The first segments of the legs , the coxae , lack hooks . On the coxae of the third pair of legs , the setae at the back are spur @-@ like . 
 The idiosoma of the male is 450 to 480 μm long and 270 to 300 μm wide , the dorsal shield is 440 to 475 by 250 to 270 μm , and the <unk> shield is 360 to 395 μm and 189 to 207 μm wide .

 The 67th Boat Race took place on 23 March 1910 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford were reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race . In a race umpired by Frederick I. Pitman , Oxford won by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 14 seconds , taking their overall lead in the competition to 36 – 30 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2015 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1909 race by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , and led overall with 35 victories to Cambridge 's 30 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the 1882 and 1883 races , Harcourt Gilbey Gold ( Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four @-@ time Blue ) and W. F. C. Holland who had rowed for Oxford four times between 1887 and 1890 . Cambridge were coached by William Dudley Ward ( who had rowed in 1897 , 1899 and 1900 races ) , Raymond Etherington @-@ Smith ( who had rowed in 1898 and 1900 ) and David Alexander Wauchope ( who had rowed in the 1895 race ) . For the seventh year the umpire was old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who rowed for Cambridge in the 1884 , 1885 and 1886 races . 
 According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater , the Dark Blues " did not have any very promising new material from which to make up [ their ] crew " but was impressed by a " very stylish " Philip Fleming who had been included as Oxford 's number seven . Cambridge 's coaches worked to re @-@ introduce a more traditional style of rowing but like Oxford , " their material was not very good " . Although they lost Eric Fairbairn late in the build @-@ up to the race , Drinkwater considered them to be " a pretty , lively crew to look at " . As a result of unfavourable tides , the race was scheduled to be held on the Wednesday of Holy Week which , according to Drinkwater , " caused considerable controversy " . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 8 @.@ 875 lb ( 80 @.@ 0 kg ) , 4 @.@ 375 pounds ( 2 @.@ 0 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge 's boat contained three rowers with Boat Race experience , including R. W. M. Arbuthnot , J. B. <unk> and Edward Gordon Williams , the latter making his third consecutive appearance in the event , having won a bronze medal in the men 's eight in the 1908 Summer Olympics . Oxford saw four crew members return , including Duncan Mackinnon , Stanley Garton , Robert Bourne and cox A. W. F. Donkin . Three participants in the race were registered as overseas Blues : Oxford 's bow M. B. Higgins and Cambridge 's number four C. P. Cooke were Australian while Light Blue cox C. A. Skinner was from South Africa . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford . In bright sunshine and a light breeze , umpire Pitman started the race at 12 : 30 p.m. Cambridge made the better start and led Oxford until one of the Light Blues " caught a crab " , allowing the Dark Blues to take the lead . Even with a slower stroke rate , Oxford were a quarter of a length ahead by Craven Steps but the lead was short @-@ lived as Cambridge spurted to lead by the Mile Post . Unable to make further gains , the Light Blues began to lose ground around the unfavourable bend in the river , with Oxford spurting and gaining almost one length in ten strokes . 
 At The Doves pub , another spurt saw Oxford go one length clear , which they gradually extended along the rest of the course to win by three and a half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 14 seconds , the slowest winning time since the 1907 race . It was their second consecutive victory and took the overall record in the event to 36 – 30 in their favour . 
 = El Toro ( Six Flags Great Adventure ) = 
 El Toro , a Spanish term meaning The Bull , is a wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson , New Jersey . Designed by Intamin of Switzerland , it opened to the public on June 11 , 2006 . Intamin also worked with members of Rocky Mountain Construction to build the ride . When it opened , it had the steepest drop of any wooden roller coaster in the world at 76 degrees , until the record was broken by T Express in 2008 by one degree . Overall , its structure height of 181 feet ( 55 m ) is ranked fourth , its drop height of 176 feet ( 54 m ) is ranked second , and its top speed of 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) is ranked fourth among all wooden roller coasters in the world . It was also the first wooden roller coaster to use a cable lift as opposed to the traditional chain lift . 
 El Toro is the main attraction of the Mexican @-@ themed section , Plaza Del Carnaval . It replaced the Viper roller coaster that closed in 2004 . 
 = = History = = 
 El Toro sits on the former site of Viper , which closed in 2004 . Everything was removed in early 2005 except for the station . El Toro was announced on September 28 , 2005 along with Bugs Bunny National Park , a new themed area for children . It was also announced El Toro would be part of a new themed area known as Plaza del Carnaval . The lift hill was topped off on December 20 , 2005 . The ride started testing on Memorial Day weekend in 2006 . The ride had a surprise opening on June 11 then held its grand opening on June 12 . 
 El Toro has several similarities to Viper , the coaster that it replaced . The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper 's station , the only part of Viper that was not torn down . The station previously held two Viper trains at once , with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear . The ramp that was previously Viper 's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access , as El Toro has a new exit on the other side of the station . During El Toro 's construction , the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built . Like El Toro , Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop . 
 El Toro suffered a malfunction with the lift motor in early August 2013 . The motor was sent to Maryland to be fixed . El Toro reopened on August 30 , after it had been down for several weeks .

 El Toro means " The bull " in Spanish , which is the theme of the ride . The cars are themed as " bulls " with bull heads on the front . The ride 's queue is surrounded by the Southwestern @-@ style buildings of Plaza del Carnaval , and also has abandoned " wagon wheels " and Spanish posters along a wall separating the queue from the ride . 
 = = = Layout = = = 
 After departing from the station , the train makes a turn to the left , passing through the ride 's structure . It then begins to climb the 181 @-@ foot ( 55 m ) tall cable lift hill . Once the entire train is on the lift the cable increases its speed to 13 mph . Once at the top of the lift the speed of the cable gently slows down , but it is barely noticeable on the ride . After cresting the top of the lift , the train briefly travels forward and makes a 180 degree turn to the left . It then drops 176 feet ( 54 m ) at a 76 degree angle , reaching a top speed of 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) . As the train reaches the bottom of the drop it comes close to the track above , creating a <unk> @-@ effect . It then travels up a 112 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) camelback hill followed by a second camelback hill at 100 feet ( 30 m ) . It then rises and then travels through a 180 degree downward @-@ banked turn to the right , and up another banked turn to the left . The train goes through a small second hill that speeds past the station and the lakeside . The ride then makes another turn and up a smaller hill where riders experience ejector airtime . After coming down the drop , the ride snakes through twists and turns . After coming out of the twister section , the train slows down as it moves through small S turn hills and into the brake run . 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 El Toro operates with two trains with six cars per train . Riders are arranged two across in three rows for a total of 36 riders per train . It has a capacity of 1 @,@ 200 guests per hour . The trains are simply known as " Train A " ( light brown ) and " Train B " ( dark brown ) . The trains have padded " wings " at shoulder level to prevent riders from being thrown too far to the side in the final twister section . El Toro 's <unk> are U @-@ shaped . 
 In 2010 , one of the trains was re @-@ themed to endorse Stride Gum . The train was wrapped in Stride Gum advertisements , showing a different flavor of Stride gum on each car . The advertisements remained on the train for the entire 2011 season , but were removed before the start of the 2012 season and replaced with Kia Soul advertising . 
 = = = Track = = = 
 The wooden track is approximately 4 @,@ 400 feet ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) in length and the height of the lift is approximately 181 feet ( 55 m ) . El Toro is very different from a traditional wooden roller coaster because it uses prefabricated wooden track . It was built and designed by Intamin but they also worked with members of Rocky Mountain Construction to build the ride . Instead of carpenters cutting , shaping , and laying down the track on site by hand , the track is laser cut in a factory . This means that the track is manufactured to a higher degree of precision than could be achieved by hand . The " Plug and Play " aspect of the coaster speeds construction of the coaster since track does not have to be completely manufactured on site . In addition , because of the speed of construction , the costs of building the coaster are lowered due to fewer man @-@ hours spent on the construction .

 = Glazer ownership of Manchester United = 
 Manchester United Football Club is an English football club based in Old Trafford , Greater Manchester . The club was formed as Newton Heath LYR Football Club , the works team of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot in Newton Heath , in 1878 . The club split from the railway company in 1892 and remained under private ownership for almost 100 years , changing its name to Manchester United after being saved from bankruptcy in 1902 . 
 The club went public in 1990 and was the subject of takeover bids from property trader Michael Knighton and Rupert Murdoch 's BSkyB corporation before Malcolm Glazer 's stake was announced in September 2003 . By the end of the year , Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3 @.@ 17 % to around 15 % , which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004 . His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus 's 28 @.@ 7 % stake in May 2005 pushed his own up to around 57 % , well over the 30 % threshold that would force him to launch a takeover bid . A few days later , he took control of 75 % of the club 's shares , allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange , and within a month , the Glazers took 98 % ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company , forcing a squeeze out of the remaining 2 % . The final purchase price of the club totalled almost £ 800 million . 
 Most of the capital used by Glazer to purchase Manchester United came in the form of loans , the majority of which were secured against the club 's assets , incurring interest payments of over £ 60 million per annum . The remainder came in the form of PIK loans ( payment in kind loans ) , which were later sold to hedge funds . Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs , which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company 's shares in Red Football ( and thus the club ) . The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14 @.@ 25 % per annum . Despite this , the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club . In January 2010 , the club carried out a successful £ 500 million bond issue , and by March 2010 , the PIKs stood at around £ 207 million . The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means . In August 2012 , as part of further refinancing , the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering ( IPO ) on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) . 
 Some Manchester United fans opposed Glazer 's takeover of the club , particularly once they realised the level of debt that the club would have to take on after having been debt @-@ free for so many years . Since 2005 , the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust has been working on a way of returning ownership of the club to supporters ; in 2010 , they met with a group of wealthy Manchester United fans – dubbed the " Red Knights " – to discuss a billion @-@ pound takeover bid . However , the bid fell through when the Red Knights refused to meet the Glazers ' valuation of the club . 
 = = Background = = 
 Manchester United was formed as Newton Heath L & YR F.C. in 1878 by the workers in the Carriage and Wagon Works of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway 's Newton Heath depot . In 1901 , the club was in over £ 2 @,@ 500 of debt and facing a winding @-@ up order ; however , they were saved by local brewer John Henry Davies , who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902 . After Davies ' death in 1927 , the club fell into financial difficulties once again , but James W. Gibson stepped in as a new financial benefactor in 1931 . Gibson himself died in 1951 , but while ownership of the club passed to his widow , Violet , control of the club passed to director and former player Harold Hardman . 
 Meanwhile , a local businessman named Louis Edwards began accruing shares in Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman 's death in 1965 . His son , Martin Edwards , purchased a percentage of shares from Alan Gibson – son of former owner James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980 . During Martin Edwards ' time as chairman , Manchester United was the subject of several takeover bids ; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell , who bid £ 10 million in February 1984 , but the sale fell through before any serious talks could take place . In 1989 , property magnate Michael Knighton was on the verge of completing a £ 20 million takeover , but his financial backers pulled out at the last minute and he had to be content with merely a seat on the board . 
 Manchester United was floated on the stock market in 1991 , and they received yet another takeover bid in 1998 , this time from Rupert Murdoch 's BSkyB Corporation . The Manchester United board accepted a £ 623 million offer , but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999 . A few years later , a power struggle emerged between the club 's manager , Sir Alex Ferguson , and his horse @-@ racing partners , John Magnier and J. P. McManus , who had gradually become the largest shareholders via their company , Cubic Expression . In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar , Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager , and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen 's influence . 
 Meanwhile , Avram Glazer – the son of Malcolm Glazer – was looking into investment in European football . The Glazer family already owned several businesses in the United States and had purchased the Tampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League franchise in 1995 . They convinced the local government to fund a new stadium for the Buccaneers in 1998 and the franchise won its first Super Bowl in January 2003 .

 Following the Manchester United board 's search for new investors , the Glazers purchased their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003 , spending around £ 9 million on a 2 @.@ 9 % stake , which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football . On 26 September 2003 , it was reported that they had increased their share to 3 @.@ 17 % , taking their shareholding above the 3 % threshold that required them to inform the club 's management . There had already been considerable speculation about the possibility of a takeover of the club , either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties . By 20 October , they had increased their shareholding to 8 @.@ 93 % , and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15 % of the club and had met David Gill , its chief executive , to discuss their intentions . On 12 February 2004 , the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16 @.@ 31 % and the following day 's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid . The club 's share price increased by 5 % that day , valuing the club at a total of £ 741 million . The Glazers increased their shareholding to over 19 % the following June , although they were still not the largest shareholders . Their shareholding continued to increase , nearing 30 % by October 2004 . Upon reaching 30 % , they would have to launch a formal takeover bid . 
 On 12 May 2005 , Red Football announced that it had reached an agreement with shareholders J. P. McManus and John Magnier to purchase Cubic Expression 's 28 @.@ 7 % stake in the club , which gave the Glazers a controlling stake with just under 57 % of the club 's shares . They then managed to secure the stake of the third @-@ largest stakeholder , Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson , taking their share total to 62 % of the club . By 13 May , the Glazers had bought a further 12 @.@ 8 % stake taking their total ownership to 74 @.@ 81 % , just shy of the 75 % threshold that would allow them to end the club 's public limited company ( PLC ) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange . On 16 May , the Glazers took their shareholding in Manchester United to 75 @.@ 7 % , and a month later , on 22 June , they removed the club 's shares from the stock exchange for the first time in 14 years . 
 The Glazers ' shareholding increased gradually to 76 @.@ 2 % by 23 May , when they made their final offer of 300 pence per share , with a deadline of 3 p.m. on 13 June . On 26 May , the Manchester United board wrote to the remaining shareholders indicating their intention to sell their own shares and advising the others to follow suit ; in the same letter , chairman Sir Roy Gardner and non @-@ executive directors Ian Much and Jim O 'Neill offered their resignations . Despite the board 's encouragement , the Glazers ' share in the club had only reached 97 @.@ 3 % by 14 June , short of the 97 @.@ 6 % threshold required for a compulsory buyout of all remaining shareholders , prompting them to extend the deadline on their offer to purchase the remaining shares until 27 June . A statement released on 28 June said that Red Football 's shareholding had reached 98 % ( 259 @,@ 950 @,@ 194 shares ) , prompting a squeeze out of the remaining shareholders . The final valuation of the club was almost £ 790 million ( approximately $ 1 @.@ 5 billion at the exchange rate at the time ) . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As a result of the Glazer takeover , a small group of disgruntled Manchester United supporters created a new club called F.C. United of Manchester . This so @-@ called " phoenix club " was accepted into the North West Counties Football League second division , six promotions away from The Football League , and secured promotion in each of its first three seasons , twice as league champions . 
 Following the takeover , Manchester United continued to thrive , with the 2005 – 06 season seeing Old Trafford 's capacity being expanded and a lucrative new shirt sponsorship deal signed in April 2006 with American company AIG ( which had a large stake in a hedge fund company that helped to fund Glazer 's takeover of the club ) . Increased revenue from TV rights to each competition the club participates in , as well as its various sponsorship deals , also boosted the club 's profitability . This came despite fears among many supporters that the debt incurred in buying the club could lead to insolvency . 
 Contrary to the fears of many fans , the Glazers took action to ensure that Gill and veteran manager Sir Alex Ferguson remained at Manchester United , citing the duo 's success with the club . In 2006 , Malcolm Glazer 's other two sons , Kevin and Edward , and his daughter , Darcie , were appointed to the Manchester United board as non @-@ executive directors . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 The debt taken on by the Glazers to finance the takeover was split between the club and the family ; between £ 265 million and £ 275 million was secured against Manchester United 's assets , putting the club into debt for the first time since James Gibson saved them in 1931 . This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds : Citadel , Och @-@ Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital . The total amount was £ 660 million , on which interest payments came to £ 62 million a year . The club stated , " The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year , which is why lenders want to invest in the club ... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market . " The Manchester United Supporters Trust responded , " ' The amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge ... The interest payment is one thing but what about the actual £ 660 million ? It is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices , which , as we always suspected , means the fans will effectively be paying for someone to borrow money to own their club . " Under the terms of the Glazers ' refinancing , as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010 , the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14 @.@ 25 % to 16 @.@ 25 % , resulting in annual payments of around £ 38 million . 
 On 11 January 2010 , shortly before an announcement that Red Football 's debt had increased to £ 716 @.@ 5 million ( $ 1 @.@ 17 billion ) , Manchester United announced their intention to refinance the debt through a bond issue worth approximately £ 500 million . They managed to raise £ 504 million in just under two weeks , meaning that they were able to pay off almost all of the £ 509 million owed to international banks . The bonds were issued in two tranches , one with a coupon rate of 8 @.@ 75 % worth £ 250 million , and the other with a coupon rate of 8 @.@ 375 % worth $ 425 million . The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £ 45 million per annum , with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017 . Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015 . These include the carving out of £ 95 million in cash , the sale and lease @-@ back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington , and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50 % of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year . 
 On 16 November 2010 , it was revealed that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £ 220 million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010 . The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16 @.@ 25 % , as the club 's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) by more than five times . However , the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment , raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds ; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party , the sale of some or all of the family 's other businesses , and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate .

 A fan campaign known as " Love United Hate Glazer " has existed since the origin of the family 's bid to take over the club . The campaign has involved the spreading of the slogan and the acronym " <unk> " around various locations via stickers and graffiti . A number of banners have also been displayed in the stands at Old Trafford . 
 Despite its restructuring , the announcement about the club 's debt prompted vociferous protests from Manchester United fans on the weekend of 23 January 2010 , both at Old Trafford and at the club 's Carrington training facility . A non @-@ violent protest was organised by the club 's supporters groups , following up on the " Love United Hate Glazer " campaign that had existed since 2005 , and encouraging match @-@ going fans to wear green and gold , the colours of Manchester United 's precursor club , Newton Heath . A few days later , on 30 January , reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans with a view to buying out the Glazers ' controlling interest in the club . The group then met with Keith Harris , a Manchester United fan and the chairman of investment bank Seymour Pierce , to broker a takeover . 
 On 2 March 2010 , further reports emerged that the group – dubbed the " Red Knights " – had met again to discuss the possibility of a billion @-@ pound takeover of the club . Those present at the meeting included investment bank Goldman Sachs ' chief economist and former Manchester United director Jim O 'Neill and lawyer Mark Rawlinson , a partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer , as well as Duncan <unk> , the chief executive of the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust , and Keith Harris , Executive Chairman of Seymour Pierce . The initial goal of the group was to increase the Supporters ' Trust 's membership to at least 100 @,@ 000 , to demonstrate the fans ' support for a change in ownership . To better promote themselves , the Trust enlisted the services of Blue State Digital , the Internet strategy firm that worked on Barack Obama 's 2008 presidential election campaign . 
 Later that day , Manchester United announced that their gross debt for the final three months of 2009 totalled £ 507 @.@ 5 million , a reduction of £ 30 @.@ 6 million compared to the same period in 2008 . They also reported pre @-@ tax profits of £ 6 @.@ 9 million , an increase of £ 9 @.@ 6 million after making a loss of £ 2 @.@ 7 million the previous year . This announcement was accompanied by a statement from the Glazers ' spokesperson that the club was not for sale , as well as public support from David Gill , who claimed that the Glazers were " running the club the right way " . 
 Meanwhile , membership of the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust passed the 100 @,@ 000 mark on 3 March , before exceeding 125 @,@ 000 a week later . The green @-@ and @-@ gold scarf campaign also grew , with large portions of the Old Trafford crowd showing the colours . Following Manchester United 's 4 – 0 victory over Milan in their Champions League first knockout round tie , former Manchester United player David Beckham was seen wearing a scarf that had been thrown onto the pitch ; however , he later claimed that he was merely showing his support for Manchester United , and that the running of the club is " not [ his ] business " . It was also claimed that United manager Alex Ferguson would be prepared to invest his own money in the Red Knights ' bid , but he dismissed these reports as " absolute rubbish " . 
 Given the amount of debt on Manchester United 's books at the time , some analysts estimated in 2010 that any takeover bid would have had to total more than £ 2 billion , of which around £ 1 @.@ 6 billion would be needed to match the Glazers ' valuation of the club – double what they paid for the club in 2005 . However , the Red Knights publicly stated that they would only pay " a fair price " when their takeover bid finally came . On 11 March 2010 , the Red Knights appointed Nomura Securities Co. as their advisers for their takeover bid . Nomura previously advised the Manchester United board before the Glazers ' bid to buy the club . The Red Knights later admitted that they would not make a bid for the club before the end of the 2009 – 10 season , but it was believed that their preferred bid option would have involved retaining the £ 500 million bond issued by the Glazers . Two @-@ thirds of a further £ 700 million would be provided by 30 – 40 wealthy Manchester United fans , with the remainder provided by fund @-@ raising from ordinary fans . Once the club was secured , shares would then be offered to fans , allowing them to take ownership of the club . Despite these plans , the Red Knights put their takeover bid " on hold " in June 2010 , citing " inflated valuation aspirations " in the media as the reason . Having already stated that they would only pay a " sensible " amount for the club , the group was thought to have baulked at the suggestion that the Glazers ' valuation of the club was significantly higher than the amount they were willing to pay . 
 = = New York share issue = = 
 In 2011 , rumours surfaced that the Glazers intended to list a number of shares in Manchester United on an Asian market such as Hong Kong or Singapore , in an attempt to raise a potential £ 400 – 600 million . The Singapore flotation looked to be gaining traction in August 2011 , when it emerged that the club had applied to list its shares on the Singapore Exchange ; approval for the listing was given in September 2011 . 
 In June 2012 , after several months with no further developments on the Singapore front , several sources reported that the club was considering moving its share issue to the United States , and in July 2012 , an application was made for the club to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) , with a target of raising $ 100 million ( £ 64 million ) . More details of the sale were released at the end of July , with the club announcing that they intended to sell 16 @.@ 7 million shares ( approximately 10 % of the club ) at between $ 16 and $ 20 each , raising up to $ 330 million ( £ 210 million ) . Shares in the club would be divided into two groups , with Class A shares sold to the public and Class B shares retained by the Glazer family . 
 Ahead of the opening of the IPO , concerns were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering . Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club 's debts , it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers . Furthermore , holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend , and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers ' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares , essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers . These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $ 16 – 20 each to $ 14 each , representing a potential total sale value of $ 233 million ( £ 150 million ) . 
 The shares debuted on the NYSE on 10 August 2012 , and initially showed a slight rise to $ 14 @.@ 05 per share , but closed the day back at the offer price of $ 14 each , valuing the club as a whole at $ 2 @.@ 3 billion , and making it one of the most valuable sports teams in the world . One of the biggest investors in the IPO was American billionaire George Soros , whose investment company purchased about 3 @.@ 1 million class A shares ( 1 @.@ 9 % of the club ) , valued at $ 40 @.@ 7 million ( £ 25 @.@ 8 million ) at the time . Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £ 359 @.@ 7 million after the share sale paid off £ 62 @.@ 6 million of bonds . The club 's debts were further remedied in May 2013 , after a new loan deal was agreed that would save the club £ 10 million a year in interest payments on debts now totalling around £ 307 million . 
 In March 2014 , American investment group Baron Capital purchased 24 % of all of the shares available on the NYSE ( equivalent to 5 @.@ 8 % of the entire club , but widely misreported as 2 @.@ 4 % ) . At the closing price on the day of purchase of $ 15 @.@ 84 per share , Baron Capital 's total investment was valued at $ 151 million ( £ 90 million ) . In September 2014 , Baron Capital raised its stake in the club to 9 @.@ 2 % of the entire club ( equivalent to 37 @.@ 8 % of all shares available on the NYSE . )

 = Caernarfon Castle = 
 Caernarfon Castle ( Welsh : Castell Caernarfon ) is a medieval fortress in Caernarfon , Gwynedd , north @-@ west Wales cared for by Cadw , the Welsh Government 's historic environment service . There was a motte @-@ and @-@ bailey castle in the town of Caernarfon from the late 11th century until 1283 when King Edward I of England began replacing it with the current stone structure . The Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales and as a result the defences were built on a grand scale . There was a deliberate link with Caernarfon 's Roman past and the Roman fort of Segontium is nearby . 
 While the castle was under construction , town walls were built around Caernarfon . The work cost between £ 20 @,@ 000 and £ 25 @,@ 000 from the start until the end of work in 1330 . Despite Caernarfon Castle 's external appearance of being mostly complete , the interior buildings no longer survive and many of the building plans were never finished . The town and castle were sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English . Caernarfon was recaptured the following year . During the Glyndŵr Rising of 1400 – 1415 , the castle was besieged . When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the English throne in 1485 , tensions between the Welsh and English began to diminish and castles were considered less important . As a result , Caernarfon Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair . 
 Despite its dilapidated condition , during the English Civil War Caernarfon Castle was held by Royalists , and was besieged three times by Parliamentarian forces . This was the last time the castle was used in war . Caernarfon Castle was neglected until the 19th century when the state funded repairs . In 1911 , Caernarfon Castle was used for the investiture of the Prince of Wales , and again in 1969 . It is part of the World Heritage Site " Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first fortifications at Caernarfon were built by the Romans . Their fort , which they named Segontium , is on the outskirts of the modern town . The fort sat near the bank of the River Seiont ; it is likely that the fort was positioned here due to the sheltered nature and as traffic up the Seiont would have been able to supply Segontium . Caernarfon derives its name from the Roman fortifications . In Welsh , the place was called " y <unk> yn <unk> " , meaning " the stronghold in the land over against Môn " ; Môn is the Welsh name for Anglesey . Little is known about the fate of Segontium and its associated civilian settlement after the Romans departed from Britain in the early 5th century . 
 = = Early castle = = 
 Following the Norman Conquest of England , William the Conqueror turned his attention to Wales . According to the Domesday Survey of 1086 , the Norman Robert of Rhuddlan was notionally in charge of the whole of northern Wales . He was killed by the Welsh in 1088 . His cousin the Earl of Chester , Hugh d 'Avranches , reasserted Norman control of north Wales by building three castles : one at an unknown location somewhere in Meirionnydd , one at <unk> on Anglesey , and another at Caernarfon . This early castle was on a peninsula , bounded by the River Seiont , the Menai Strait ; it would have been a motte and bailey , defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks . While the motte , or mound , was integrated into the later Edwardian Castle , the location of the original bailey is uncertain , although it may have been to the north @-@ east of the motte . Excavations on top of the motte in 1969 revealed no traces of medieval occupation , suggesting any evidence had been removed . It is likely that the motte was surmounted by a wooden tower known as a keep . The Welsh recaptured Gwynedd in 1115 , and Caernarfon Castle came into the possession of the Welsh princes . From contemporary documents written at the castle , it is known that Llywelyn the Great and later Llywelyn ap Gruffudd occasionally stayed at Caernarfon . 
 = = Edwardian castle = = 
 War broke out again between England and Wales on 22 March 1282 . The Welsh leader , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , died later that year on 11 December . His brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd continued to fight against the English , but in 1283 Edward I was victorious . Edward marched through northern Wales , capturing castles such as that at Dolwyddelan , and establishing his own at Conwy . War finally drew to a close in May 1283 when Dolbadarn Castle , Dafydd ap Gruffudd 's last castle , was captured . Shortly after , Edward began building castles at Harlech and Caernarfon . The castles of Caernarfon , Conwy and Harlech were the most impressive of their time in Wales , and their construction – along with other Edwardian castles in the country – helped establish English rule . The master mason responsible for the design and orchestrating the construction of the castle was probably James of Saint George , an experienced architect and military engineer who played an important role in building the Edwardian castles in Wales . According to the Flores Historiarum , during the construction of the castle and planned town , the body of the Roman emperor Magnus Maximus was discovered at Caernarfon and Edward I ordered his reburial in a local church . 
 The construction of the new stone castle was part of a programme of building which transformed Caernarfon ; town walls were added , connected to the castle , and a new quay was built . The earliest reference to building at Caernarfon dates from 24 June 1283 , when a ditch had been dug separating the site of the castle from the town to the north . A <unk> , a type of stockade , was created around the site to protect it while the permanent defences were under construction . Timber was shipped from as far away as Liverpool . Stone was quarried from nearby places , such as from Anglesey and around the town . A force of hundreds worked on the excavation of the moat and digging the foundations for the castle . As the site expanded , it began to encroach on the town ; houses were cleared to allow the construction . Residents were not paid compensation until three years later . While the foundations for the stone walls were being created , timber @-@ framed apartments were built for Edward I and Eleanor of Castile , his queen . They arrived at Caernarfon on either 11 or 12 July 1283 and stayed for over a month . 
 Construction at Caernarfon Castle continued over the winter of 1283 / 1284 . The extent of completion is uncertain , although architectural historian Arnold Taylor speculated that when Edward and Eleanor visited again in Easter 1284 the Eagle Tower may have been complete . The Statute of Rhuddlan , enacted on 3 March 1284 , made Caernarfon a borough and the administrative centre of the county of Gwynedd . According to tradition , Edward II was born at Caernarfon on 25 April 1284 . Edward was created Prince of Wales in 1301 , with control over Wales and its incomes . Since then the title has traditionally been held by the eldest son of the monarch . According to a famous legend , the king had promised the Welsh that he would name " a prince born in Wales , who did not speak a word of English " and then produced his infant son to their surprise ; but the story may well be apocryphal , as it can only be traced to the 16th century . In 1284 , Caernarfon was defended by a garrison of forty men , more than the thirty @-@ strong garrisons at Conwy and Harlech . Even in peace time , when most castles would have a guard of only a few men , Caernarfon was defended by between twenty and forty people due to its importance . 
 By 1285 , Caernarfon 's town walls were mostly complete . At the same time work continued on the castle . Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292 . Edward I 's campaign of castle @-@ building in Wales cost £ 80 @,@ 000 between 1277 and 1304 , and £ 95 @,@ 000 between 1277 and 1329 ; by 1292 £ 12 @,@ 000 had been spent on the construction of Caernarfon 's castle – of which the southern facade was furthest along – and town walls . As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon , the plan was to build the castle 's northern facade last . 
 In 1294 , Wales broke out in rebellion led by Madog ap Llywelyn , prince of Wales . As Caernarfon was the centre of administration in Gwynedd and a symbol of English power , it was targeted by the Welsh . Madog 's forces captured the town in September , and in the process heavily damaged the town walls . The castle was defended by just a ditch and a temporary barricade . It was quickly taken and anything flammable was set alight . Fire raged across Caernarfon , leaving destruction in its wake . In the summer of 1295 , the English moved to retake Caernarfon . By November the same year , the English began refortifying the town . Rebuilding the town walls was a high priority , and £ 1 @,@ 195 ( nearly half the sum initially spent on the walls ) was spent on completing the job two months ahead of schedule . Attention then shifted to the castle and on finishing the work that had halted in 1292 . Once the rebellion was put down , Edward began building Beaumaris Castle on the Isle of Anglesey . The work was overseen by James of Saint George ; as a result , Walter of Hereford took over as master mason for the new phase of construction . By the end of 1301 , a further £ 4 @,@ 500 had been spent on the work with the focus of work on the northern wall and towers . The accounts between November 1301 and September 1304 are missing , possibly because there was a hiatus in work while labour moved north to help out with England 's war against Scotland . Records show that Walter of Hereford had left Caernarfon and was in Carlisle in October 1300 ; he remained occupied with the Scottish wars until the autumn of 1304 when building at Caernarfon resumed . Walter died in 1309 and his immediate subordinate , Henry of <unk> , took over the position of master mason . Construction continued at a steady rate until 1330 . 
 From 1284 to 1330 , when accounts end , between £ 20 @,@ 000 and £ 25 @,@ 000 was spent on Caernarfon 's castle and town walls . Such a sum was enormous and dwarfed the spending on castles such as Dover and Château Gaillard , which were amongst the most expensive and impressive fortifications of the later 12th and early 13th centuries . Subsequent additions to Caernarfon were not major , and what remains of the castle is substantially from the Edwardian period . Despite the expense , much of what was planned for the castle was never carried out . The rears of the King 's Gate ( the entrance from the town ) and the Queen 's Gate ( the entrance from the south @-@ east ) were left unfinished , and foundations in the castle 's interior mark where buildings would have stood had work continued . 
 = = Later history = = 
 For around two centuries after the conquest of Wales , the arrangements established by Edward I for the governance of the country remained in place . During this time the castle was constantly garrisoned , and Caernarfon was effectively the capital of north Wales . There was a degree of discrimination , with the most important administrative jobs in Wales usually closed to Welsh people . Tension between the Welsh and their English conquerors spilled over at the start of the 15th century with the outbreak of the Glyndŵr Rising ( 1400 – 1415 ) . During the revolt , Caernarfon was one of the targets of Owain Glyndŵr 's army . The town and castle were besieged in 1401 , and in November that year the Battle of Tuthill took place nearby between Caernarfon 's defenders and the besieging force . In 1403 and 1404 , Caernarfon was besieged by Welsh troops with support from French forces ; the garrison at the time was around thirty . The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne in 1485 heralded a change in the way Wales was administered . The Tudors were Welsh in origin , and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English . As a result , castles such as Caernarfon , which provided secure centres from which the country could be administered , became less important . They were neglected , and in 1538 it was reported that many castles in Wales were " <unk> <unk> and <unk> in decaye for <unk> of <unk> reparations " . 
 In Caernarfon 's case the walls of the town and castle remained in good condition , while features which required maintenance – such as roofs – were in a state of decay and much timber was rotten . Conditions were so poor that of the castles seven towers and two gatehouses , only the Eagle Tower and the King 's Gate had roofs by 1620 . The domestic buildings inside the castle had been stripped of anything valuable , such as glass and iron . Despite the disrepair of the domestic buildings , the castle 's defences were in a good enough state that during the English Civil War in the mid @-@ 17th century it was garrisoned by Royalists . Caernarfon Castle was besieged three times during the war . The constable was John Byron , 1st Baron Byron , who surrendered Caernarfon to Parliamentarian forces in 1646 . It was the last time Caernarfon Castle saw fighting . Although it was ordered in 1660 that the castle and town walls should be dismantled , the work was aborted early on and may never have started . 
 Despite avoiding slighting , the castle was neglected until the late 19th century . From the 1870s onwards , the government funded repairs to Caernarfon Castle . The deputy @-@ constable , Llewellyn Turner oversaw the work , in many cases controversially restoring and rebuilding the castle , rather than simply conserving the existing stonework . Steps , battlements , and roofs were repaired , and the moat to the north of the castle was cleared of post @-@ medieval buildings that were considered to spoil the view , despite the protest of locals . Under the auspices of the Office of Works and its successors since 1908 , the castle was preserved due to its historic significance . In 1911 , Caernarfon was used for the investiture of the Prince of Wales for the first time when Prince Edward ( later Edward VIII ) , eldest son of the newly crowned King George V ; the ceremony was held there at the insistence of then @-@ Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George , a Welshman raised in Caernarfonshire . In 1969 , the precedent was repeated with the investiture of Charles , Prince of Wales . Although Caernarfon Castle has been the property of the Crown since it was built , it is currently cared for by Cadw ( English : to keep ) , the Welsh Government 's historic environment division , responsible for the maintenance and care of Wales ' historic buildings . In 1986 , Caernarfon was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites as part of the " Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd " in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site . The castle houses the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum . During 2015 a new " entrance pavilion " was built , designed by architects Donald Insall Associates . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Caernarfon Castle 's design was partly influenced by a desire to make the structure impressive as a symbol of the new English rule in Wales . This was particularly acute as Caernarfon was made the centre of government in the northern part of the country . The Edwardian castle 's layout was mostly dictated by the lay of the land , although the inclusion of the previous castle 's motte played a part . It is a narrow enclosure , roughly in the shape of a figure eight . It was divided into two enclosures , upper and lower " wards " in the east and west respectively , with the eastern containing royal accommodation , although this was never completed . The divide was supposed to be established by a range of fortified buildings , however these too were never built . 
 <unk> along the curtain wall are several polygonal towers from which flanking fire could be deployed . There were battlements on the tops of walls and towers , and along the southern face were firing galleries ; it was intended to include galleries along the northern face but they were never built . In the opinion of military historian Allen Brown , this combined to make Caernarfon Castle " one of the most formidable concentrations of fire @-@ power to be found in the Middle Ages " . Most of the northern towers stand had four @-@ storeys including a basements . The Eagle Tower at the western corner of the castle was the grandest . It has three turrets which were once surmounted by statues of eagles . The tower contained grand lodgings , and was probably built for Sir Otton de Grandson , the first justiciar of Wales . A basement level contained a water gate , through which visitors travelling up the River Seiont could enter the castle . Water was drawn from a well in the eponymous Well Tower . 
 Caernarfon 's appearance differs from that of other Edwardian castles through the use of banded coloured stone in the walls and in its polygonal , rather than round , towers . There has been extensive academic debate over the interpretation of these features . Historian Arnold Taylor argued that the design of the castle was a representation of the Walls of Constantinople . The conscious use of imagery from the Byzantine Roman Empire was therefore an assertion of authority by Edward I , and influenced by the legendary dream of Magnus Maximus , a Roman emperor . In his dream Maximus had seen a fort , " the fairest that man ever saw " , within a city at the mouth of a river in a mountainous country and opposite an island . Edward interpreted this to mean Segontium was the city of Maximus ' dream and drew on the imperial link when building Caernarfon Castle . Recent work by historian Abigail Wheatley suggests that the design of Caernarfon was indeed an assertion of Edward 's authority , but that it drew on imagery from Roman sites in Britain with the intent of creating an allusion of Arthurian legitimacy for the king . 
 There were two main entrances , one leading from the town ( the King 's Gate ) and one allowing direct access to the castle without having to proceed through the town ( the Queen 's Gate ) . Their form was typical of the time – a passage between two flanking towers . If the King 's Gate had been completed , a visitor would have crossed two drawbridges , passed through five doors , under six portcullises , and negotiated a right @-@ angle turn before emerging into the lower enclosure . The route was overlooked by numerous arrow loops and murder holes . A statue of Edward II was erected in a niche overlooking the town , above the entrance to the King 's Gate . In the opinion of architectural historian Arnold Taylor , " No building in Britain demonstrates more strikingly the immense strength of medieval fortifications than the great twin @-@ towered gateway to Caernarfon Castle . " The Queen 's Gate is unusual in that its entrance is above ground level ; this was due to the integration of the earlier motte , raising the ground level of the interior . Externally , the gate would have been approached by a stone ramp which is no longer present . 
 While the curtain wall and its towers survive largely intact , all that remains of the buildings contained within the castle are the foundations . While royal lodgings were in the upper ward , the lower contained buildings such as the kitchens . The kitchens were located immediately west of the King 's Gate . On the basis of their insubstantial foundations , Taylor suggests that the kitchens were not strongly built . The other key feature of the castle 's domestic side , was the Great Hall . Caernarfon 's abutted the south side of the lower ward and was 30 @.@ 5 metres ( 100 ft ) . Though only the foundations survive , in its heyday the Great Hall would have been an impressive building , featuring fine architecture , and used to host royal entertainment . Had Caernarfon been completed as intended , it would have been able to contain a royal household of several hundred people . 
 = Battle of Wanat = 
 The Battle of Wanat occurred on July 13 , 2008 , when about 200 Taliban guerrillas attacked NATO troops near Quam , in the Waygal district in Afghanistan 's far eastern province of Nuristan . The position was defended primarily by United States Army soldiers of the 2nd Platoon , Chosen Company , 2nd Battalion , 503rd Infantry Regiment ( Airborne ) , 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team . 
 The Taliban surrounded the remote base and its observation post , attacking it from Quam and surrounding farmland . They destroyed much of the U.S. heavy munitions , broke through American lines , and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft . The United States claimed to have killed at least 21 Taliban fighters for the loss of nine U.S. soldiers killed and 27 wounded , and four Afghan National Army ( ANA ) soldiers wounded . The U.S. deaths were the most in a single battle since the start of U.S. operations in 2001 . 
 The Battle of Wanat has been described as one of the bloodiest Taliban attacks of the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts . In contrast to previous roadside bombings and haphazard attacks and ambushes , this attack was well @-@ coordinated with fighters from many insurgent groups with an effort that was disciplined and sustained which was able to precisely target key equipment such as a wire @-@ guided missile launcher . 
 The battle became the focus of debate in the United States , generating " a great deal of interest and scrutiny among military professionals and from outside observers " mainly due to the relatively " significant number of coalition casualties " . Several investigations were launched into events leading up to the battle . The initial investigation was completed in August 2008 . In July 2009 , Senator James Webb requested that the U.S. Army formally investigate the battle and previous investigation . Lieutenant General Richard F. Natonski conducted another investigation in late 2009 which led to orders of reprimand for the chain of command . In June 2010 , the U.S. Army revoked the reprimands . They stated that no negligence was involved and said of the soldiers that " by their valor and their skill , they successfully defended their positions and defeated a determined , skillful , and adaptable enemy " . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2008 , NATO forces in southeastern Afghanistan deployed sub @-@ company @-@ sized patrols to the Pakistan border to disrupt supplies flowing to the Taliban from the Federally Administered Tribal Regions of Pakistan . They established small patrol bases , which came under regular attack by Taliban forces . 
 In June , a small contingent of 48 American and 24 Afghan troops , 72 in total , were operating in and around Wanat , a mountain Quam that was the center of the Waygal District government and about five miles from the coalition military base Camp Blessing . On July 4 , a U.S. Army helicopter attacked vehicles they claimed were firing on them and killed 17 people . Locals claimed those killed were civilians , including doctors and nurses from a local clinic . Both sides reported Forward Observation Base Bella was under attack by indirect fire . Intel reports said that the FOB was going to be overrun from within the base as well . The helicopter attack was in response to the indirect fire received from a mortar tube that was being fired from the bed of a Toyota Hilux pick @-@ up . The initial Taliban radio transmissions that were intercepted reported that the " Big Gun had been hit " ( mortar tube ) and the Taliban commander had been killed . A few hours after the helicopter attacked , with the Chosen Company commander and the troops in contact confirming the targets , the Taliban radio reports changed to " they killed the shop keeper ( that had the same name as the Taliban commander ) , the big gun was not damaged and all the enemy wounded and KIA were civilians . " Five days before the battle , on July 8 , a platoon from the Second Battalion , 503rd Infantry Regiment , 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team established Vehicle Patrol Base ( <unk> ) Kahler and a separate observation post called " OP Top Side " near Wanat . 8 July , 2nd Platoon , Chosen Company , departed from Camp Blessing after sunset in a ground assault convoy for the 90 @-@ minute @-@ long drive to Wanat . The convoy contained five <unk> armored Humvees . There was one for each of the three rifle squads , a vehicle for platoon headquarters , and the last vehicle containing the TOW missile squad . The Humvees mounted heavy weapons , two with 50 @-@ cal machine guns , and two with MK @-@ 19 40mm automatic grenade launchers in protected cupolas to provide extra firepower and protection . Their goal was to create a Combat Outpost ( COP ) to connect with and provide security for the local populace , coordinate $ 1 @.@ 4 million in reconstruction projects , and disrupt Taliban activity . The brigade was to be relieved by a newly arriving U.S. Army unit in two weeks . 
 The patrol base was situated on an open field about 300 meters long by 100 meters wide surrounded on two sides by buildings which composed the Quam . July 9 , a six @-@ man engineer squad arrived by Chinook helicopter . They brought a Bobcat loader and a shipping container with engineer equipment . The soldiers reinforced the base with existing terrain , sandbags , barbed wire , and used the Bobcat to fill a number of <unk> barriers ( essentially wall @-@ sized sandbags ) around the three squad positions and to create a firing pit for the big 120 @-@ mm mortar . However , the Bobcat broke down for one day , and could not lift high enough to place barriers to a 7 @-@ foot height , but were placed to just a 4 @-@ foot level , which would make it vulnerable to direct fire from guns or rockets which the attackers would exploit . The troops dug many of the fortifications and trenches with hand shovels . Still in preparation at the time of the attack , some areas were only protected by a barrier of concertina wire , but with no posts or stakes , the wire was just placed on the ground . 
 The Afghan company contracted to bring heavy construction equipment delayed its arrival to until 13 July . It was decided that soldier labor with the aid of an engineer squad and a Bobcat front end loader already at Bella would be good enough to prepare an initial defense in the six days until heavier equipment arrived . The number of men at the base was judged enough to defend against intelligence estimates that placed the insurgent forces in the local area at only about 150 experienced fighters , though they did not know that attackers would be backed up by other guerrilla groups from neighboring regions as far away as Pakistan and Kashmir . While they thought it was possible the base might be attacked while the camp was being prepared , they thought it unlikely . Platoon Sergeant <unk> later remarked " I was expecting harassing fire from any one of the high ground in every direction . I did not think the village itself would let the AAF [ Anti @-@ Afghan Force ] turn their village into a battle zone . 
 Soldiers at the base noticed warning signs , including groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village , which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost , and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains . At a dinner meeting in the village , a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains , and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby . The day before the attack , the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field , creating background noise that masked the sounds of the advancing fighters . 
 Although the Americans believed that 100 or 200 attacked the base , a senior Afghan defense ministry official who did not reveal his name told Al Jazeera that he had information it was between 400 and 500 fighters . Tamim <unk> , former governor of Nuristan , believed that numerous Taliban and Pakistani militant and terrorist groups banded together from surrounding regions including Kunar and the <unk> tribal agency in neighboring Pakistan . According to U.S. intelligence groups operating in the region included Taliban , al @-@ Qaeda , Kashmir @-@ based Lashkar @-@ e @-@ Taiba and Pakistan @-@ based , ( as of 2013 still located in 1 of many strongholds in the <unk> agency of <unk> administered Tribal areas in Kunar and Nuristan of Afghanistan ) , <unk> @-@ i @-@ Islami . According to the Long War Journal , Al Qaeda 's senior leadership including Ayman al Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden were thought to shelter in the region ( Bin Laden was then in Pakistan ) . Taliban spokesman stated " The fighting in Afghanistan is getting heavier . When the Americans drop bombs on civilians ordinary people want revenge – that 's why they are joining the Taliban , strengthening us " pointing out their " ability to enter the bases and kill Americans . " A NATO spokesman believed that the Taliban had moved into and expelled a nearby Khel ( small village @-@ tribe subdivision ) for the attack . On the evening of July 12 , Taliban soldiers moved into Wanat and ordered the villagers to leave . Undetected by the <unk> / <unk> soldiers , they set up firing positions inside Kors and a mosque next to and overlooking the perimeter . 
 = = Battle = = 
 About 4 : 20 a.m. on July 13 , Taliban forces opened fire on the base with machine guns , rocket @-@ propelled grenades , and mortars . Another 100 militants attacked the observation post from farmland to the east . 
 The initial attack hit the forward operating base 's mortar pit , knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition . The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee @-@ mounted TOW missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets . The mortars and TOW launcher which were to provide the heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers . The explosion of the mortar shells hurled the anti @-@ tank missiles into the command post . 
 From the American perspective , the most serious situation was the attack concentrated on a small team situated at the small observation post " <unk> " nestled among rocks under a tree 50m to <unk> outside the main base . The first round hit accurately , wounding or stunning every soldier . Pfc. Tyler Stafford was blown out of his machine @-@ gun position next to Spc . Matthew Phillips who threw a grenade before he was mortally wounded . Cpl. Jason Bogar fired hundreds of rounds from his automatic weapon until the barrel became white @-@ hot and jammed and then tended to Stafford 's wounds . A rocket grenade wounded Sgt. Ryan M. Pitts , who was also tended by Bogar with a tourniquet around Pitts ' leg before switching to another gun . Bogar then jumped from the outpost bunker to get close enough to kill insurgents who were firing down upon the men from the village hotel . Once outside the bunker , he was shot through the chest and killed . The surviving soldiers then ran from the outpost to the main post , leaving Pitts behind . Alone , Pitts was able to hold @-@ off the Taliban from overrunning his position until his comrades returned two hours later and he was evacuated to receive medical care . 
 Four U.S. soldiers were killed within the first 20 minutes of the battle , another died later , and at least three others were wounded . Three times teams of soldiers from the main base ran through Taliban fire to resupply the observation post and carry back the dead and wounded . 
 The U.S. troops responded with machine guns , grenades , and claymore mines . Artillery guns at Camp Blessing fired 96 155mm artillery rounds . The Taliban briefly breached the wire of the observation post before being driven back . After almost half an hour of intense fighting at the observation post , only one soldier remained . He was seriously wounded and fought alone until reinforcements arrived . Some militants also managed to get past the main base 's eastern barriers . Two American soldiers , platoon leader First Lieutenant Jonathan P. Brostrom , 24 , of Hawaii and Corporal Jason <unk> , were killed trying to deliver ammunition to the observation post . American soldiers were at times flushed out of their fortifications by what they thought were grenades , but which were actually rocks thrown by the attackers . Brostrom , <unk> , and another soldier may have been killed by an insurgent who penetrated the wire perimeter . 
 AH @-@ 64 Apache attack helicopters and a Predator unmanned aircraft drone armed with Hellfire missiles arrived over the base about 30 minutes after the battle began . During the battle , U.S. soldiers were resupplied by UH @-@ 60 Blackhawk helicopter with fire support from the AH @-@ 64 Apache Helicopters . Injured troops were evacuated to nearby Camp Wright , where members of E Troop , 2nd – 17th Cavalry , 101st Airborne Division would wait to rearm and refuel the UH @-@ 60 's and AH @-@ 64 's . Later , a B @-@ 1B Lancer bomber , A @-@ 10 , and F @-@ 15E Strike Eagle aircraft were called in . The militants withdrew about four hours later . After the militants retreated , mop up operations followed , and the Taliban withdrew from the town . 
 Nine U.S. soldiers were killed in the attack , mainly in the observation post . Between 21 and 52 militants were reported killed with another 20 to 40 wounded , but coalition forces found only two Taliban bodies after the battle . The attack was the highest death toll for American troops in the country since Operation Red Wings three years earlier . 
 = = Operational issues = = 
 Civilian deaths caused by allied operations had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban , who were allowed to move into the Quam . The residents may have been further dismayed by the failure of the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , to address the concerns of a delegation of elders and <unk> in Kabul two days previously . 
 Coalition troops had noticed other warning signs . The day before the attack , the " Spin <unk> " ( Pashto for " White Beards " – influential tribal elders ) of Wanat conducted a Jirga , ( elder community council @-@ experienced male members of the Quam have a right to attend ) , without the post 's Officer @-@ in @-@ Charge . As well , the villagers began pouring waste water into an area of dead space near the post more frequently , which may have concealed the movement of militants within the village . 
 A 2009 U.S. Army report criticized the brigade commander , Colonel Chip Preysler , and the battalion commander , Lieutenant Colonel William Ostlund , citing the lack of supplies , equipment , and drinking water for troops stationed in Wanat . At the same time , the report praised the performance of its soldiers under fire . 
 The same report criticized the actions of the involved commanding officers as being counterproductive to military goals , stating that " The highly kinetic approach favored by TF Rock ... rapidly and inevitably degraded the relationships between the U.S. Army and the <unk> population . " 
 This statement , portraying the operational approaches of the 173rd Airborne Brigade ( TF Bayonet ) and 2 @-@ 503 PIR ( TF Rock ) in a negative light , is contradicted by David Kilcullen in his book , The Accidental Guerrilla . Kilcullen stated that in March 2008 @,@ 
 The fact that Kunar has bucked the general trend [ downward trend in security across the country ] seems largely to be the result of a consistent U.S. strategy of partnering with local communities to separate the insurgents from the people , bring tangible benefits of governance and development to the population , and help the population choose their own local Khan 's ( Protectors , usually military ) , through elections . 
 Kilcullen also noted a statement by a previous U.S. commander in Kunar regarding LTC William Ostlund , the 2 @-@ 503 commander : " Bill O. understood deeply that the effect of Coalition operations on the people was the key question . "

 = = = U.S. withdrawal = = = 
 After the battle , Major General Jeffrey J. <unk> , U.S. Army commander of coalition troops in Regional Command East , Afghanistan , decided to abandon the patrol base and sent additional U.S. troops to assist the base evacuation . Three days after the engagement the United States and Afghan armies withdrew from Wanat . An ISAF statement says ISAF and Afghan security forces " will continue to perform regular patrols near the village of Wanat . " The coalition forces continued to maintain a larger patrol base about four miles away from Wanat and concentrated on protecting the larger Pech River Valley . 
 The district police force for the area was disarmed by the Americans and the district chief and police chief were briefly detained and questioned . Both were released within 24 hours according to a spokesperson for the district chief . 
 Speaking at a Pentagon news conference after the attack , U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Navy Admiral Mike Mullen said the incident indicated that " all involved with operations on the ( Pakistan @-@ Afghanistan , especially the <unk> Kunar , Kashmir , and Nuristan ) , border must do a better job of policing the region and eliminating the extremists ' safe havens in Pakistan 's federally administered tribal areas that are launching pads for attacks on coalition forces . " The Associated Press reported that the attack underscored a general gain in strength of Afghan militants . 
 However , the 173rd Brigade Commander , Colonel Charles Preysler , specifically rebutted that conclusion in an interview on July 20 , 2008 . He stated that previous media accounts of the engagement mischaracterized the level of development of the platoon 's defences . He also said that the withdrawal of the platoon did not constitute " abandoning " the position because no permanent defensive infrastructure was developed or left behind . He further stated that the position was " not overrun in any shape , manner , or form " , adding that , " It was close combat to be sure — hand grenade range . " 
 = = = U.S. Army investigation = = = 
 An investigation by the U.S. Army , completed on August 13 and released to the public the first week of November 2008 , found that the Taliban attackers had been assisted by the Afghan local police ( ALP ) , forces and a district leader . The evidence included large stocks of weapons and ammunition discovered in the police barracks in Wanat after the battle . The stocks were much more than could be used by the villages ' 20 @-@ man police force and included dirty weapons which appeared to have been used recently . In response to the report , <unk> concluded that the governor and local police chief " had probably been acting under duress and had been cooperative with American troops . " The governor was absolved of blame in the attack but it was unclear about what was done with the local police chief . 
 The investigation also examined whether the Army had intelligence about a possible assault and whether the troops had access to it . The report found that despite reports earlier in July that 200 to 300 militants had been massing to attack another remote outpost in the vicinity , including numerous reports from local villagers that an attack was imminent , the commanders at Wanat had no reason to expect such a large frontal assault . The report , however , criticized the " incredible amount of time " — 10 months — it took NATO military leaders to negotiate arrangements over the site of the outpost , giving the Taliban plenty of time to coordinate and plan an attack on the base .

 In July 2009 , U.S. Senator James Webb asked the U.S. DoD Inspector General to formally examine the battle and the U.S. Army 's investigation into the event . In his request , Webb cited an unreleased report from the Army 's Combat Studies Institute by a contractor , Douglas Cubbison , that criticized how senior Army leaders in Afghanistan , especially Ostlund and <unk> , acted before the assault at Wanat . According to that report , soldiers at the Wanat base were critically short of basic necessities such as water and sandbags and had complained repeatedly , to no avail , that their base was in a precarious position . Cubbison had written the report at the request of Lieutenant General William B. Caldwell IV , commander of the United States Army Combined Arms Center . Cubbison wrote that a few days before the battle , on July 4 , a U.S. Army helicopter mistakenly attacked and killed 17 civilians , including all of the doctors and nurses at a local clinic , infuriating local Afghans . Platoon leader Brostrom and company commander Captain Matthew Myer told their commanders that they expected a retaliatory attack and asked for extra surveillance . Brostrom 's father , retired Army Colonel David . P. Brostrom , alerted Webb 's office to the Army historian 's report . Said Brostrom , " After I read the report , I was sick to my stomach . " 
 Letters of reprimand were issued to Colonel Charles Preysler , Lieutenant Colonel William Ostlund and Captain Myer for " failing to properly prepare defenses " at Wanat , Pentagon officials said March 12 . That same month , Myer was awarded the Silver Star for his actions during the battle of Wanat . 
 On September 30 , 2009 , U.S. Central Command commander General David H. Petraeus appointed U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Richard F. Natonski to lead a new inquiry into the battle and which would look into related issues " beyond the tactical level . " A later review was conducted by General Charles C. Campbell which " focused on the totality of circumstances that included and affected actions at Wanat " , including interviews of the officers involved , and reviews of previous investigations with the exception of the Fort Leavenworth Combat Studies Institute ( CSI ) narrative — stating that it had " not undergone pre @-@ publication vetting and academic review in accordance with standing CSI research protocols " . Campbell concluded that the officers involved were not at fault : 
 [ The officers ] were neither negligent nor derelict in the performance of their duties , exercising a degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstance . To criminalize command decisions in a theater of complex combat operations is a grave step indeed . It is also unnecessary , particularly in this case . It is possible for officers to err in judgment — and to thereby incur censure — without violating a criminal statute . This is particularly true where the errors are those of omission , where the standards come from multiple non @-@ punitive doctrinal publications , where there is less than complete and certain knowledge of enemy capabilities and intent , and where commanders enjoy wide discretion in their exercise of their command prerogatives and responsibilities . 
 In June 2010 , General Campbell revoked the officers ' reprimands , citing that they would have a " chilling effect " on ground operations . The Army said that the second look at the incident proved that the officers were " neither negligent nor derelict " and " by their valor and their skill , they successfully defended their positions and defeated a determined , skillful , and adaptable enemy who masses and attacks at times , ways and places of his choosing " Secretary of the Army John McHugh was also humbled by their courage , stating " We remain grateful for and humbled by their extraordinary courage and valor . " Gen. George W. Casey Jr . , Army chief of staff further commended the performance of the soldiers : 
 In every review and study conducted to date , the courage , valor , and discipline of the soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised . These soldiers were well @-@ trained , well @-@ led , and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat . They persevered in a fashion that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity . Our hearts go out to the families of the fallen soldiers . 
 Upset over Campbell 's decision , family members of those killed in action wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Army asking that the findings of Natonski 's investigation be upheld and the reprimands reinstated . In addition to the family members , the letter was signed by Senators Daniel Akaka , Jim Webb , Saxby Chambliss , Patty Murray , and Claire McCaskill . 
 In November 2010 , the U.S. Army 's Combat Studies Institute published a historical account of the Battle of Wanat . The official U.S. Army history of the battle , published in December 2010 , places little blame on the senior officers involved , instead blaming the uncertain nature of war , mistakes by junior officers , lack of knowledge by Army officers on the Wanat region 's complex political situation , and lack of intelligence that the attack forces would be drawn from the entire region , not just the local area .

The park , located 110 – 180 kilometres ( 68 – 112 mi ) west of Calgary in the province of Alberta , encompasses 6 @,@ 641 square kilometres ( 2 @,@ 564 sq mi ) of mountainous terrain , with numerous glaciers and ice fields , dense coniferous forest , and alpine landscapes . The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise , connecting to Jasper National Park in the north . Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west , while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast . The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff , in the Bow River valley . 
 The Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff 's early years , building the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet , and attracting tourists through extensive advertising . In the early 20th century , roads were built in Banff , at times by war internees from World War I , and through Great Depression @-@ era public works projects . Since the 1960s , park accommodations have been open all year , with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s . Millions more pass through the park on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway . As Banff has over three million visitors annually , the health of its ecosystem has been threatened . In the mid @-@ 1990s , Parks Canada responded by initiating a two @-@ year study , which resulted in management recommendations , and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity . 
 Banff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions , including montane , subalpine , and alpine . The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline , above which is primarily rocks and ice . Mammal species such as the grizzly , cougar , wolverine , elk , bighorn sheep and moose are found , along with hundreds of bird species . Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded . The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east and over newer rock strata between 80 and 55 million years ago . Over the past few million years , glaciers have at times covered most of the park , but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield , the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies . Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes .

 Throughout its history , Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests . The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve , in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there , and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests . The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve , which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield .

 Archaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10 @,@ 300 B.P. Prior to European contact , aboriginals , including the Stoneys , Kootenay , <unk> T 'ina , Kainai , <unk> , and <unk> , resided in the region where they hunted bison and other game . 
 With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871 , Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad . Construction of the railroad began in 1875 , with Kicking Horse Pass chosen , over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass , as the route through the Canadian Rockies . Ten years later , on 7 November 1885 , the last spike was driven in Craigellachie , British Columbia .

 With conflicting claims over discovery of hot springs in Banff , Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres ( 10 sq mi ) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885 . Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act , enacted on 23 June 1887 , the park was expanded to 674 km2 ( 260 sq mi ) and named Rocky Mountains Park . This was Canada 's first national park , and the third established in North America , after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks . The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers .
