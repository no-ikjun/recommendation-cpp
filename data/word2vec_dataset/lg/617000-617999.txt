 The Adams Avenue Parkway is a one @-@ half @-@ mile @-@ long ( 800 m ) private toll road in the U.S. state of Utah connecting U.S. Route 89 ( US @-@ 89 ) to Interstate 84 ( I @-@ 84 ) near Washington Terrace , Utah . The roadway opened in 2001 at a cost of $ 8 @.@ 9 million and was created after decades of requests by locals to connect the existing Adams Avenue to I @-@ 84 . This allowed commuters to bypass the rest of US @-@ 89 through Washington Terrace to I @-@ 84 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The main access to the south end of the parkway is from I @-@ 84 at exit 85 , a pre @-@ existing diamond interchange with a local road in South Weber named 475 East . The four @-@ lane , 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) toll road , which has no shoulders or sidewalks , begins at Cottonwood Drive , I @-@ 84 's north side frontage road . It immediately crosses a bridge over the Weber River ( the Davis @-@ Weber County line and north limit of South Weber ) and the Union Pacific Railroad 's Evanston Subdivision ( the south limit of Washington Terrace ) . The parkway then curves northwest and climbs out of the Weber River 's floodplain with a maximum grade of nine percent , reaching the toll plaza most of the way up the hill . 
 After one intersection with 5900 South , which presently serves only the toll road company 's headquarters and a single commercial building , private maintenance gives way to a four @-@ lane city street with sidewalks just shy of 5800 South . The roadway continues northeasterly to the top of the hill near 5600 South , where pre @-@ existing Adams Avenue ( 500 East ) heads north , passing the Ogden Regional Medical Center to an intersection with Washington Boulevard ( US @-@ 89 ) on the Washington Terrace @-@ South Ogden border . Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into Ogden as a minor street one block east of US @-@ 89 , with a gap near 4600 South and more north of downtown Ogden . In 2006 approximately 1 @,@ 400 cars traveled the parkway on an average weekday .

 Tolls are collected in cash or via an ExpressCard account , a prepaid system that offers a discount for a $ 10 deposit to the account .

Previously emergency vehicles ( ambulances ) were not charged a toll , however beginning July 3 , 2003 , they must pay the standard $ 1 toll . To allow quick passage through the toll barrier , these vehicles pay through a charge account . The Utah Department of Transportation worked out an agreement during local road construction for four days in 2003 to allow commuters to use the parkway free of charge . 
 = = History = = 
 The parkway was opened in 2001 after just under a year of construction and almost two decades of community requests . Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens urged the state to connect I @-@ 84 directly to Adams Avenue , bypassing the congested US @-@ 89 . Then @-@ governor Mike Leavitt suggested that a private company rather than the state would need to build the road . 
 The roadway cost $ 8 @.@ 9 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 3 million in 2015 ) to build , of which the state provided $ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 3 million in 2015 ) . Additional funds came from taxes levied on property owners along the parkway . The entire stretch of road between Washington Boulevard and I @-@ 84 was built by the Adams Avenue Turnpike LLC ; however , they returned most of the road to local authorities . The only portion not kept was a one @-@ half @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) segment between about 5800 South and I @-@ 84 . 
 The roadway is defined under Weber County Ordinance , Title 31 , which grants a franchise to Adams Avenue Turnpike LLC for an initial term of 50 years ( expiring in 2051 ) .

 = Marcellus Formation = 
 Marcellus Formation ( also classified as the Marcellus Subgroup of the Hamilton Group , Marcellus Member of the Romney Formation , or simply the Marcellus Shale ) is a Middle Devonian age unit of marine sedimentary rock found in eastern North America . Named for a distinctive outcrop near the village of Marcellus , New York , in the United States , it extends throughout much of the Appalachian Basin . The shale contains largely untapped natural gas reserves , and its proximity to the high @-@ demand markets along the East Coast of the United States makes it an attractive target for energy development and export . 
 <unk> , the Marcellus is the lowest unit of the Devonian age Hamilton Group , and is divided into several sub @-@ units . Although black shale is the dominant lithology , it also contains lighter shales and interbedded limestone layers due to sea level variation during its deposition almost 400 million years ago . The black shale was deposited in relatively deep water devoid of oxygen , and is only sparsely fossiliferous . Most fossils are contained in the limestone members , and the fossil record in these layers provides important paleontological insights on faunal turnovers . The black shales also contain iron ore that was used in the early economic development of the region , and uranium and pyrite which are environmental hazards . The fissile shales are also easily eroded , presenting additional civil and environmental engineering challenges . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The Marcellus Formation is a black shale that may contain limestone beds and concentrations of iron pyrite ( FeS2 ) and siderite ( <unk> ) . Its sedimentary structure , or bedding , is moderately well developed . Like most shales , it tends to split easily along the bedding plane , a property known as <unk> . Lighter colored shales in the upper portion of the formation tend to split into small thin @-@ edged fragments after exposure . These fragments may have rust stains from exposure of pyrite to air , and tiny gypsum ( CaSO4 · 2H2O ) crystals from the reaction between pyrite and limestone particles . Fresh exposures of the <unk> shale may develop the secondary mineralization of orange limonite ( FeO ( OH ) · nH2O ) , and the pale yellow efflorescence or bloom of sulfur , associated with acid rock drainage . 
 Pyrite is especially abundant near the base , and the upper contacts of limestones , but <unk> <unk> and euhedral crystals of pyrite occur throughout the organic @-@ rich deposits . The Marcellus also contains uranium , and the radioactive decay of the uranium @-@ 238 ( 238U ) makes it a source rock for radioactive radon gas ( 222Rn ) . 
 Measured total organic content of the Marcellus Formation ranges from less than 1 % in eastern New York , to over 11 % in the central part of the state , and the shale may contain enough carbon to support combustion . The more organic @-@ rich black shales can be bituminous , but are too old to contain bituminous coal formed from land plants . In petroleum geology , these black shales are an important source rock that filled conventional petroleum reservoirs in overlying formations , are an unconventional shale gas reservoir , and are an impermeable seal that traps underlying conventional natural gas reservoirs . To the west the formation may produce liquid petroleum ; further <unk> heating during deeper burial more than 240 million years ago cracked this oil into gas . 
 = = = Extent = = = 
 The Marcellus is found throughout the Allegheny Plateau region of the northern Appalachian Basin of North America . In the United States , the Marcellus shale runs across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions of New York , in northern and western Pennsylvania , eastern Ohio , through western Maryland , and throughout most of West Virginia extending across the state line into extreme western Virginia . The Marcellus bedrock in eastern Pennsylvania extends across the Delaware River into extreme western New Jersey . It also exists in the subsurface of a small portion of Kentucky and Tennessee . Below Lake Erie , it can be found crossing the border into Canada , where it stretches between Port Stanley and Long Point to St. Thomas in southern Ontario . 
 = = = = Outcrops = = = = 
 The Marcellus appears in outcrops along the northern margin of the formation in central New York . There , the two joint planes in the Marcellus are nearly at right angles , each making cracks in the formation that run perpendicular to the bedding plane , which lies almost level . These joints form smooth nearly vertical cliffs , and the intersecting joint planes form projecting corners in the rock faces . Once exposed , the weathered faces lose most of their organic carbon , turning from black or dark gray to a lighter shade of gray . 
 Outcrops of the Marcellus can contain very small beds that resemble coal . The New York outcrops , and others further south in Pennsylvania and New Jersey , were extensively excavated in the early 19th century , sometimes at great expense , in the false hope of finding <unk> coal seams . In Perry County , Pennsylvania along the Juniata River the false coal beds become up to .3 m ( 1 ft ) thick , but they did not produce a valuable fuel , despite the considerable effort expended to mine it from the surrounding hills . Seaweed and marine plants probably formed the false coal . True coal is formed from terrestrial plants , which only began to appear in Marcellus and later fossils . 
 Close proximity to the surface of Marcellus bedrock south of the New York outcrops makes an east @-@ west band running through the city of Syracuse a high @-@ risk area for radon as an indoor air pollutant . From the surface exposures along the northern and eastern margins , the formation descends to depths of over 2 @,@ 700 m ( 8 @,@ 900 ft ) below the surface in southern Pennsylvania . 
 = = = Structural geology = = = 
 <unk> beds are exposed in sections of the folded Ridge @-@ and @-@ Valley Appalachians , including exposures on the flanks and axis of the Broad Top <unk> in south central Pennsylvania . Exposed beds are nearly horizontal on the Allegheny Plateau , but upturned to form slightly overturned beds found along the Allegheny Front . From Wind Gap , Pennsylvania heading south , the dip of the beds <unk> , becoming vertical at <unk> on the Lehigh River . Nearby , in the Lehigh Gap area of Pennsylvania , the Marcellus is extensively faulted , and the beds are steeply overturned , with a reverse dip angle of up to 40 ° south . 
 The Marcellus Shale and the fine @-@ grained shales near the middle of the Mahantango Formation are classified by geologists as slope @-@ formers . Marcellus and Mahantango shale beds dipping at 60 ° to 75 ° to the west form the west facing slopes of Tonoloway Ridge on the west flank of the Cacapon Mountain anticline in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia . On the eastern limb of this anticline , beds of these shales dipping to the east at a shallower angle also form the steep slopes on the east side of Warm Springs Ridge . 
 = = = <unk> geology = = = 
 The Marcellus is easily eroded , and is also found underlying low areas between some Appalachian ridges , forming linear valleys of moderate relief . These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion @-@ resistant strata that form the surrounding higher ground . The soils formed from the Marcellus and the overlying Hamilton shales are deep , free of stones , and well suited for agriculture . Sampling of soil formed on the Marcellus bedrock showed the dominant mineralogy consisted of quartz , illite , montmorillonite , muscovite , and biotite , with phases of <unk> and trona appearing at depths closer to the bedrock . 
 <unk> beds of the soft shale also capture streams and rivers with relatively straight segments in strike valleys such as the <unk> Creek and McMichael Creek at the foot of The Poconos , and the long , straight section of the Lost River in West Virginia . Below Port Jervis , New York , the <unk> Ridge deflects the Delaware River into the Minisink Valley , where it follows the southwest strike of the eroded Marcellus beds along the Pennsylvania – New Jersey state line for 40 km ( 25 mi ) to the end of the ridge at <unk> Bend in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . The Minisink is a buried valley where the Delaware flows in a bed of glacial till that buried the eroded Marcellus bedrock during the last glacial period . This buried valley continues along the strike of the Marcellus southwest from the bend through Stroudsburg , Pennsylvania , and northeast from Port Jervis toward the Hudson River , along the route of the Delaware and Hudson Canal . 
 = = = Deposition = = = 
 Early in the Acadian orogeny , as the Acadian Mountains were rising up , the black and gray shales of the Hamilton Group began accumulating as erosion of the mountains deposited terrigenous sediments from the land into the sea . The Marcellus Shale was formed from the very first deposits in a relatively deep , <unk> and oxygen @-@ starved ( anoxic ) , trough that formed parallel to the mountain chain . These clastic fragments of rock were carried in braided streams to the ancient Catskill Delta , a river delta probably similar to the present day Niger Delta of Africa . 
 Smaller particles remained suspended longer in this <unk> sea , flowing offshore as turbidites in a slow but persistent underwater avalanche . They finally came to rest at the bottom of the Acadian <unk> in the Appalachian Basin , hundreds of meters from shore , at depths that may have been 150 m ( 490 ft ) or more beneath the surface . Alternatively , the basin may have been as shallow as 50 metres ( 160 ft ) or less , if the warm water was sufficiently stratified so that oxygen rich surface water did not mix with the anoxic bottom water . The Marcellus deposition produced a transgressive black shale , because it was deposited in deepening conditions when the basin floor dropped as the mountains rose up . 
 The dark shale facies of the Marcellus were formed from flysch , a fine mud deposited in the deep water ; it buried the underlying Onondaga limestone beds , as the deepening sea cut off the supply of carbonates that form limestone . Organic matter , probably dominated by plankton , also settled to the bottom , but the normal aerobic decay process was inhibited in the anaerobic environment thereby preserving the organic carbon . Uranium was also incorporated in these organic muds <unk> , meaning it was deposited at the same time , rather than being introduced to the formation later . The organic matter scavenged trace elements from the seawater , including the redox @-@ sensitive elements uranium , rhenium , molybdenum , osmium , chromium , and selenium . 
 The Marcellus was deposited during a period of development of land plants , when atmospheric oxygen was increasing , resulting in a reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , and the seawater where it was deposited . Named members of the Marcellus reflect two composite depositional sequences , with a general coarsening upward cycle that continues into the base of the overlying Mahantango Formation . The <unk> of lighter shale and limestone members is attributed to relatively short @-@ term oscillations in basin depth . Later deep water depositional sequences formed the overlying Brallier Formation and Harrell Formation . 
 = = = = Age = = = = 
 On the geological timescale , the Marcellus occurs in the Middle Devonian epoch , of the Devonian period , in the Paleozoic era , of the Phanerozoic eon . Radiometric dating of a Marcellus sample from Pennsylvania placed its age at 384 million years old , and a sample from the bentonite at the top of the Onondaga at 390 ± 0 @.@ 5 million years old . 
 Relative age dating of the Marcellus places its formation in the Cazenovia subdivision of the Givetian faunal stage , or 391 @.@ 9 to 383 @.@ 7 million years ago ( Ma ) . The Union Springs member , at the base of the Marcellus in New York , has been dated to the end of the Eifelian , the stage which immediately preceded the Givetian . <unk> dark shales in the formation mark the <unk> Event , a late @-@ Eifelian @-@ stage marine anoxic event also associated with an extinction event .

 In the first Pennsylvania Geological Survey , begun in 1836 , Henry Darwin Rogers classified the Marcellus as the " <unk> Lower Black Slate " which he numbered " No . VIII b . " In the first New York State Geological Survey , also begun that year , James Hall established the term " Marcellus Shale " in his 1839 report titled " Marcellus Shales in Seneca County . " Professor Hall also argued in 1839 against formulating geological names based on observed characteristics that may vary from place to place or need revision in the future , and in favor of location @-@ based nomenclature where " the rock or group will receive its name from the place where it is best developed . " His arguments proved persuasive , and the location @-@ based name for this , and many of the other group names he published based on exposures in New York , were adopted in the second Pennsylvania survey , and are now widely accepted . 
 = = = = Overlying = = = = 
 In the first New York survey , the Marcellus shale was placed below the Hamilton Group at the base of the Erie division of the New York system , but this taxonomy is obsolete . 
 In current practice , the Marcellus Formation ( abbr . Dm or <unk> ) is classified as the basal unit of the Hamilton Group ( <unk> ) , lying beneath the Mahantango Formation ( <unk> ) member of this group in Pennsylvania and Maryland . In New York , the Mahantango , also of Middle Devonian age , is further divided . There the Marcellus is separated from the overlying Skaneateles Formation , a more clastic and fossiliferous dark shale , by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed . 
 In West Virginia , the Marcellus may be separated from the brown shales of the Mahantango by occasional sandstone beds and concretions , or it may lie directly below the younger Late Devonian Harrel Formation ( or its lateral equivalents ) because of a <unk> , which represents a gap in the geological record due to a period of erosion or non @-@ deposition . In eastern Ohio the Hamilton Group also lies <unk> beneath the <unk> Shale Member of the West Falls Formation , another transgressive black shale tongue with similar characteristics to the Marcellus . 
 = = = = Underlying = = = = 
 The Marcellus shale is typically found deposited on the limestone of the Onondaga Formation ( Don ) , which extends down to the end of the Early Devonian period . The contact between them may be sharp , gradational , or erosional . In southwestern Ontario , Canada , north of Lake Erie , the Marcellus overlies the Dundee Formation , a lateral equivalent of the Onondaga . In Pennsylvania , the Marcellus forms a sharp conformable contact with the Onondaga 's <unk> Limestone member . A thin pyrite @-@ carbonate bed is also found at the base of the Marcellus black shale in the exposures of south central Pennsylvania , above a thin <unk> green shale bed , which lies upon the Onondaga limestone . 
 In eastern New York , the contact between the Marcellus and Onondaga ( where present ) is gradational . In western New York , the Union Springs member of the Marcellus <unk> overlies the Seneca member of the Onondaga Limestone , or the stratigraphically higher Cherry Valley Limestone member may rest directly and unconformably upon the Onondaga in the absence of the Union Springs shale . The local disappearance of units of the Onondaga suggests that its upper contact with the Marcellus can be erosional . In Erie County in western New York , both the upper and lower contact of the Marcellus are eroded away . 
 In eastern West Virginia the Marcellus overlies the <unk> Group , consisting of the dark gray or green , calcitic , mostly <unk> Needmore Shale , which grades westward into the Huntersville Chert . To the south and west , the Hamilton Group grades laterally into the Millboro Shale formation in southern West Virginia and Virginia , which grades into the lower part of the Chattanooga Shale of Tennessee . 
 The <unk> is gradational with the underlying Needmore Formation shale . South of the Mason @-@ Dixon line , due to the difficulty in differentiating the Millboro and Needmore shales with the limited exposures available , and initial uncertainty in correlation with the New York survey , they were mapped as the Romney Formation , a unit containing all the Middle Devonian strata , named for an exposure at Romney , West Virginia . The correlations were established by 1916 through tracing the New York exposures across Pennsylvania and Maryland into West Virginia , so under the principle of scientific priority , the Romney classification is now obsolete ; but its Marcellus and underlying Needmore shale members are still found grouped in an undifferentiated map unit ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = = = Tioga ash beds = = = = = 
 Tioga <unk> or K @-@ bentonite – stratigraphic unit about .6 m ( 2 ft ) thick that consists of several discrete , relatively thin volcanic ash falls – is also included at the base of the Marcellus in eastern Pennsylvania . In 1843 it was described without being named by Hall , and more than 100 years passed before it was eventually named for the natural gas field in Tioga County , Pennsylvania , where it was encountered when drilling gas wells . It is a regional stratigraphic marker , used by geologists to identify the Marcellus , and correlate laterally equivalent strata . Difficulty in correctly identifying the more than 80 different ash falls during the Devonian period , collected in 15 or more beds , has also led to many <unk> . 
 From Virginia to New York the Tioga is widely distributed , running across the central and northern parts of the Appalachian basin , an areal extent exceeding 265 @,@ 000 km2 ( 102 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . Explosive eruptions associated with the Acadian orogeny originating near present @-@ day central Virginia released the ash into the atmosphere . It was dispersed across the Appalachian , Michigan , and Illinois Basins by the southern trade winds , because this area was in the southern hemisphere during the Devonian period . The volcanic origin of the ash is evidenced by its distinctive mineralogy – the ash was deposited directly upon the water , so its angular quartz grains differ from the clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea . As the volcanic ash settled to the bottom , it was <unk> with these terrigenous components , producing a distinctive lithology in the sedimentary rock . 
 The Tioga may appear in the formation as a gray , brown , black , or olive bed , or parting , consisting of coarse crystal tuff or <unk> shale , thinly laminated , with sand @-@ sized mica flakes . The Tioga ash bed zone consists of eight ash beds labeled according to their stratigraphic order from A ( oldest ) to H ( youngest ) , and another bed known as the Tioga middle coarse zone . Its basal beds are found within the uppermost beds of the Onondaga Limestone or Needmore Shale , and the uppermost ash bed within the lowermost part of the Marcellus or Millboro Shale . In western New York state , the Tioga Ash Bed B marks the boundary between the Moorehouse and Seneca Members of the Onondaga Formation , but in the central part of the state , and the southern part of the basin , the ash beds are actually in the Marcellus . This indicates that deposition of the Marcellus there began earlier , since the ash beds represent a single epoch in geologic time . 
 = = = = Thickness = = = = 
 Maximum thickness of the Marcellus ranges from 270 m ( 890 ft ) in New Jersey , to 12 m ( 40 ft ) in Canada . In West Virginia , the Marcellus Formation is as much as 60 m ( 200 ft ) thick . In extreme eastern Pennsylvania , it is 240 m ( 790 ft ) thick , thinning to the west , becoming only 15 m ( 49 ft ) thick along the Ohio River , and only a few feet in Licking County , Ohio . The thinning , or stratigraphic convergence , from east to west is caused by decreasing grain size in the clastic deposits , which entered the basin from the east . The beds finally " pinch out " westward because deposition was limited by the Cincinnati Arch , the bulge that formed the west shore of the basin . Where the formation is relatively thick , it is divided into several members , and as the formation continues to thicken to the east , these members are further divided . Some workers chose to classify the Marcellus as a subgroup , and classify some of the members as separate formations . 
 = = = = Named members = = = = 
 A local Purcell limestone member , 15 to 30 m ( 49 to 98 ft ) of inter @-@ bedded calcitic shale and limestone , divides the Marcellus in eastern Pennsylvania . The Purcell is stratigraphically equivalent to the Cherry Valley Limestone member in New York , a <unk> <unk> , consisting of skeletal limestones , with shaly intervals between its lower massive limestone layer , thick nodular limestone / <unk> , and upper limestone layer . Other named members include the <unk> Shale , Cardiff Shale , Chittenango shale , Solsville sandstone , Union Springs shale and limestone , and Stony Hollow shale and limestone . The Union Springs , Cherry Valley , and Oatka Creek merge beneath Lake Erie , into the Bell Shale , Rockport Quarry Limestone , and Arkona Shale of Ontario . 
 The Union Springs is an organic @-@ rich , <unk> , thinly bedded , blackish gray to black shale with mudstone concretionary layers , and thin silt bands at the bottom . To the east , it becomes the <unk> Member , a darker , less organic shale with fewer limestone layers . To the west the Union Springs beds thin , with its upper limestones merging with the overlying calcareous Cherry Valley Member . A regional unconformity appears in western New York , as the Union Springs lenses in and out , and then reappears in northwest Pennsylvania and northeast Ohio between the Onondaga and Cherry Valley . 
 In Western and central New York , the uppermost member is the dark grey to black organic @-@ rich Oatka Creek shale . Unlike the other Devonian shales in this region , the gray shale at the top of the Oatka Creek thickens gradually to the west , as well as the east , where it divides into the Cardiff member lying above the Chittenango member in central New York . Organic @-@ rich , fissile , sooty black shales make up the Chittenango Member . At the base of the Chittenango , above the <unk> Member shale , lies the <unk> Hill Bed , a highly <unk> <unk> limestone . 
 Further east , the homogeneous Cardiff divides into the Bridgewater , Solsville , and <unk> shale members , from base to top . The Bridgewater is a fissile dark silty shale with relatively rare fossils . A thin concretionary zone lies above , then the Solsville grades from a gray calcareous shale , to sandy siltstones and fine sandstones at the top , with the gray shale of the <unk> shale and <unk> overlying it . 
 In south central Pennsylvania , the Marcellus is mapped with three members , from top to base : The Mahanoy Member ( <unk> ) , a dark gray to grayish black silty shale and siltstone ; the Turkey Ridge Member ( <unk> ) , an olive to dark @-@ gray fine to medium grained sandstone ; and the Shamokin Member ( <unk> ) , a dark gray to grayish black fissile carbonaceous shale that is calcareous in places near the base . The Turkey Ridge is commonly mapped in the Mahantango Formation , or included in the Montebello Formation ( <unk> ) , and only the Shamokin correlates with the Marcellus on adjacent map sheets . In extreme eastern Pennsylvania , the Broadhead Creek member , a dark gray silty shale with dark gray shaly limestone concretions , appears above the Stony Hollow and Union Springs , in a layer up to 275 m ( 902 ft ) thick . 
 = = = Fossils = = = 
 There are relatively sparse inclusions of fossilized marine fauna found in the Marcellus , but these fossils are still important to paleontology . For example , the Marcellus contains the oldest known diverse collection of thin @-@ shelled mollusks still having well preserved shell microstructure . It is also where <unk> , an extinct shelled swimmer similar to a squid , make their first appearance in the fossil record . Life on land also enters the fossil record in the Marcellus , with the trunks of <unk> conifer trees that floated out to sea to be preserved in the black shale . 
 Marcellus fossils include specimens of the large clam @-@ like brachiopod <unk> . External molds of crinoids , plant @-@ like animals related to starfish also known as " sea lilies , " are found in the formation , with the molds partially filled with limonite ; brachiopod and bivalve ( clam ) molds have also been found in the shale . Small conical <unk> are commonly found in the Chittenango Member . The <unk> Hill bed contains <unk> and <unk> including brachiopods , coral @-@ like bryozoans , small bivalves and gastropods ( snails ) , incorporated after the faunal turnover when <unk> and Eifelian Schoharie / Onondaga fauna were replaced by the Givetian Hamilton fauna . 
 The Solsville member contains well preserved bivalves , gastropods , and brachiopods . These shellfish lived in the benthic zone at the bottom of marginal marine to open marine environments that existed west of the ancient Catskill Delta . The fossil record in this member shows the base was dominated by deposit feeders , while the upper layers were dominated by filter feeders . This can be correlated to the lithology : the finer sediments of the shales at the base of this member would contain abundant adherent organic matter for deposit feeders , but would tend to foul the gills of filter feeders when suspended ; the coarser sediments of the sandstones at the top would have contained less organic matter to support deposit feeders . Below the Solsville , at the base of the Otsego in eastern New York , a coral bed is found ; another coral bed can be seen at the top of the Marcellus near Berne , New York . 
 A diverse , eel @-@ like conodont fauna occurs in the limestone of the Cherry Valley Member , which is also known for its rich <unk> and <unk> cephalopod fauna . Originally named the <unk> Limestone , it produces their fossilized remains with shells that can be larger than .3 metres ( 1 ft ) across . It also contains the " <unk> Graveyard " in the Schoharie Valley of eastern New York , an unusual accumulation of abundant coiled and straight shells of several types of large adult cephalopods . This bed lacks juvenile fossils , indicating that if their behavior was similar to modern squid , this may have been an area where these Devonian cephalopods reproduced and died . This stratigraphic interval also provides an excellent example of incursion <unk> , which are sudden appearances and disappearances of fossil taxa in relatively thin sections of the rock unit . In the Cherry Valley , the taxa do not reoccur ; instead each thin concretionary limestone bed contains different species of <unk> . The Cherry Valley and Union Springs also contain well @-@ preserved <unk> .

 The Marcellus natural gas trend , which encompasses 104 @,@ 000 square miles and stretches across Pennsylvania and West Virginia , and into southeast Ohio and upstate New York , is the largest source of natural gas in the United States , and production was still growing rapidly in 2013 . The Marcellus is an example of shale gas , natural gas trapped in low @-@ permeability shale , and requires the well completion method of hydraulic fracturing to allow the gas to flow to the well bore . The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns — and thus , considerable controversy . 
 = = = Iron = = = 
 At the base of the Marcellus , in the pyrite @-@ carbonate bed between the carbonaceous black shale and a green calcareous shale bed , pyrite , carbonate , and groundwater reacted to form <unk> iron oxide and gypsum . As far as the ground water necessary for the conversion could penetrate , the pyrite @-@ carbonate was converted to a usable brown hematite iron ore along the outcrops and near the bedrock surface . The Marcellus iron ore was actively mined in south Central Pennsylvania from its discovery in the late 18th century , until it was supplanted by the rich ore beds of the Iron Range of Minnesota in the early 20th century . The ore was easily located and worked from shallow pits and shafts , but once the usable upper deposits were removed , or if a mine shaft entered the bed too far below the surface , only unusable unconverted pyritic deposits were found . 
 Hematite ore was converted to pig iron in charcoal @-@ fired stone blast furnaces that were constructed throughout the Juniata River region near the workable ore deposits from the Marcellus and other formations . Iron products from this area , known as " Juniata Iron , " were produced during the period between the American Revolution and the American Civil War . These blast furnaces were important to the economy of the region at the time , but the cold blast stone furnaces typically employed were inefficient , and consumed significant amounts of timber from the nearby hardwood forests , which ultimately led to their demise . A typical furnace used 2 @,@ 400 kg ( 5 @,@ 300 lb ) of hematite ore and 7 @.@ 3 m3 ( 200 imp bu ) of charcoal to produce 910 kg ( 2 @,@ 010 lb ) of pig iron , and could produce several thousand pounds per day , which required logging more than 4 @,@ 000 m2 ( 1 acre ) of forest daily . 
 The ore from the Marcellus varied in thickness , becoming <unk> thin , and even disappearing altogether in places between the workable beds . The quality of the ore also varied , and it was not always profitable to smelt , as several furnaces built near iron ore mines in the Marcellus were abandoned before the ore and timber resources used to fuel them became scarce . 
 Ore found interbedded in the black slaty shale contained a relatively high proportion of carbon which was burned in the furnace , and sulfur , which produced a usable but " red @-@ short " iron . Red @-@ short iron has the undesirable properties of oxidizing more easily , and a tendency to crack , especially when heated to a red @-@ hot state . In some locations in Pennsylvania the quality of the ore was quite good , with relatively deep veins containing 45 % iron , and very low sulfur . In Virginia , the Marcellus ore occasionally contained zinc , which produced a characteristic green flame in the furnace as it was consumed , but deposited a hard mass of impure zinc oxide known as cadmia , which built up over time near the top of the flue , and had to be removed periodically to keep it unobstructed . 
 = = = = Iron pigments = = = = 
 Drainage that reacted with the pyrite inclusions also deposited a form of bog iron near several outcrops of the Marcellus . In the 19th century , iron ore from these deposits was used as a mineral paint pigment . After being heated in a kiln and finely ground , it was mixed with linseed oil , and used to paint exterior wood on barns , covered bridges , and railroad cars . In addition to the bog iron , at several sloped locations in eastern Pennsylvania brown hematite was found lying on the Marcellus bedrock buried beneath the soil . These deposits were also excavated and used for mineral paint during that time . A bed of hematite paint ore is also found almost directly below the Marcellus , but it is actually part of the underlying Oriskany Formation .

 Iron rich " ferruginous waters " emanating from chalybeate springs near the base of the Marcellus in Bedford , Pennsylvania were believed to have healing powers by Native Americans . The Bedford Springs Hotel was a mineral spa built in 1802 around a series of mineral springs , including one of these , its " iron spring " . The Chalybeate Springs Hotel , built nearby in 1851 around three other mineral springs including another chalybeate spring , became a " resort for invalids " . The iron @-@ rich waters were prescribed for anemia and related complications . Both of these mineral springs contain iron in the form of dissolved iron carbonate , which gives these waters a " slightly inky taste " . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 The Marcellus has also been used locally for shale aggregate and common fill , although the pyritic shales are not suitable for this purpose because of acid rock drainage and volumetric expansion . In the 19th century , this shale was used for walkways and roadways , and was considered superior " road metal " because the fine grained fragments packed together tightly , yet drained well after a rain . 
 The dark slaty shales may have the necessary cleavage and hardness to be worked , and were quarried for low grade roofing slate in eastern Pennsylvania during the 19th century . The slates from the Marcellus were inferior to the Martinsburg Formation slate quarried further south , and most quarries were abandoned , with the last significant operation in Lancaster County . The Marcellus black slate was also quarried in Monroe County , Pennsylvania , for school slates used by students in 19th @-@ century rural schools . 
 Carbonaceous shales , such as the Marcellus , are a possible target for carbon capture and storage for mitigation of global warming . Because carbon adsorbs carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) at a greater rate than methane ( CH4 ) , carbon dioxide injected into the formation for geological sequestration could also be used to recover additional natural gas in a process analogous to enhanced coal bed methane recovery , but the practical value of this theoretical technique is not yet known . Scientists believe that adsorption would allow sequestration at shallower depths than absorption in deep saline formations , which must be at least 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) below the surface to maintain liquid CO2 in a supercritical state . 
 = = = Engineering issues = = = 
 Exposures from cut and fill road construction in Virginia and Pennsylvania have resulted in localized acid rock drainage due to oxidation of the pyrite inclusions . The newly exposed shale on the cut face weathers rapidly , allowing air and water into the unexcavated rock , resulting in acidic surface runoff after precipitation events . Acidic runoff disrupts aquatic ecosystems , and highly acidic soil contaminated by this runoff will not support vegetation , which is unsightly , and can lead to problems with soil erosion . 
 Natural decomposition of the shale into smaller fragments can affect slope stability , necessitating shallower slopes that require more material be disturbed in cut and fill work , exacerbating the acid rock drainage problem . The cut material cannot be used as fill beneath roads and structures due to volumetric expansion , compounding the problem . The Tioga ash beds contain bentonite clay which presents a landslide hazard in the unexcavated rock as well . 
 Damage to structures constructed on fill consisting of pyritic Marcellus shale has been caused by expansion from sulfuric acid ( H2SO4 ) runoff reacting with the calcite ( CaCO3 ) in the shale to produce gypsum ( CaSO4 ) , which has double the molar volume . Other sulfate minerals that can be produced by reactions with pyrite include anhydrite , <unk> , <unk> , jarosite , and alunite . The reactions have generated a heave pressure on the order of 500 kPa ( 10 @,@ 000 pounds per square foot ) , but may be able to generate four times this pressure enough to heave foundations in a 5 @-@ story building . Limestone , which is used to neutralize the acid drainage , can actually exacerbate the expansion problem by promoting sulfate – sulfate reactions that form the minerals <unk> and <unk> , which have even higher molar volumes . 
 Drilling boreholes through the Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic . The Marcellus has a relatively low density , and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids . The shale is relatively fragile , and may fracture under pressure , causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the borehole known as lost circulation . The formation may also be under @-@ pressurized , further complicating the drilling process . 
 = Alexander Godley = 
 General Sir Alexander John Godley , GCB , KCMG ( 4 February 1867 – 6 March 1957 ) was a senior British Army officer . He is best known for his role as commander of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and II Anzac Corps during the First World War . 
 Born in Chatham , Godley joined the British Army in 1886 . He fought in the Boer War and afterwards served in a number of staff positions in England . In 1910 he went to New Zealand as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces . Promoted to temporary major general , he reorganised the country 's military establishment . Following the outbreak of the First World War , the New Zealand government appointed him as commander of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force , which he led for the duration of the war . 
 During the Gallipoli campaign , Godley commanded the composite New Zealand and Australian Division , before taking over command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps for the final stages of the campaign . Promoted to lieutenant general , he had a brief period in command of I Anzac Corps before being given command of the II Anzac Corps . He led the corps for most of its service on the Western Front . Regarded as a cold and aloof commander , his popularity was further dented in October 1917 when he insisted on continuing an offensive in the Ypres salient when weather and ground conditions were not favourable . His corps suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle . In 1918 , II Anzac Corps was re @-@ designated as British XXII Corps and he led it for the remainder of the war . 
 After the war , Godley spent time in occupied Germany as commander of firstly the IV Corps and then , from 1922 to 1924 , the British Army of the Rhine . In 1924 he was promoted to general and was made General Officer , Commanding , of England 's Southern Command . He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1928 and was Governor of Gibraltar for five years until his retirement in 1933 . During the Second World War he commanded a platoon of the Home Guard . He died in 1957 at the age of 90 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Alexander Godley was born in Chatham , Kent , England , on 4 February 1867 , the eldest son of William Godley , a British Army captain of Irish heritage . His father 's brother was John Robert Godley , the founder of Canterbury , New Zealand . When Godley was 13 , his father died leaving the family in dire financial straits . 
 Godley intended to enter the Royal Navy but changed his mind and chose to pursue a career with the British Army . With the aid of his family 's connections , he was educated at Haileybury College and entered the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , in 1885 . He was commissioned into the Royal Dublin Fusiliers the following year as a lieutenant , and became the unit 's adjutant . 
 An enthusiastic horseman , Godley engaged in hunting and polo , becoming extremely proficient in the latter sport . He later played in the first international polo match between England and Argentina at the Hurlingham Club in Buenos Aires . To supplement his pay , he trained polo ponies . 
 Godley remained with the Fusiliers until 1896 , at which time he was promoted to captain and appointed adjutant of the Mounted Infantry at Aldershot . Later that year he volunteered for service in Mashonaland , where he assisted in the suppression of a rebellion in the province . After serving with the Special Service Battalion of the Mounted Infantry , he returned to England the following year and was promoted brevet major . 
 = = Boer War = = 
 In 1898 Godley attended Staff College at Camberley but , following the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899 , ended his studies early to volunteer for service in Africa . Along with other officers of the Special Service Battalion , he helped to raise irregular mounted regiments . Godley was later adjutant to Colonel Robert Baden @-@ Powell and was present during the Siege of Mafeking . He was also chief staff officer to Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Plumer and later commanded the Rhodesian Brigade . In 1900 , Godley transferred to the Irish Guards before being appointed to the staff at Aldershot as commander of the Mounted Infantry . Three years later he transferred to <unk> Military Camp , commanding the Mounted Infantry there until 1906 . 
 = = Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces = = 
 Godley was a colonel and serving on the staff of 2nd Division when , in 1910 , he accepted the position of Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces , as the New Zealand Army was then known . He had some reservations about his new appointment ; he had been in line for command of an infantry brigade and was concerned that being posted to remote New Zealand would be detrimental to his career . He arrived in New Zealand to take up his duties in December 1910 . 
 Promoted to temporary major general , Godley , together with fourteen British Army officers seconded to the New Zealand Military Forces , was tasked with reorganising and instilling professionalism in the military establishment of the country . Compulsory military training had recently been introduced by the government but with little thought as to its implementation . In refining the New Zealand Military Forces , Godley drew heavily on the recommendations of Lord Herbert Kitchener , who had visited New Zealand earlier in the year on an inspection tour . 
 Godley established the Territorial Force , which replaced the outdated and recently disbanded Volunteer Force . He organised the structure of the New Zealand Military Forces into four military districts , with each district to be capable of raising an infantry and a mounted brigade . The districts had a specified number of battalions and regiments organised along the lines of the British Army . He also formed a New Zealand Staff Corps to train and administer the Territorial Force . The quality of small arms and other personal equipment provided to the country 's military personnel were improved and orders placed for new artillery pieces and machine @-@ guns . 
 By 1914 the Territorial Force had some 30 @,@ 000 men involved in divisional level training camps ; two years previously , the manpower and logistical constraints of the force was such that only battalion level camps could be achieved . When General Ian Hamilton , the Inspector General of Overseas Forces , visited New Zealand in 1914 , he was impressed with the level of preparedness of the country 's military . This reflected positively on Godley 's work , and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year . 
 From 1912 , Godley began putting plans in place for the rapid deployment of a New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) in the event of war in Europe . He anticipated that Imperial Germany would be the likely enemy and envisaged deployment to either Europe or possibly Egypt , to counter the likely threat to the Suez Canal in the event Turkey aligned itself with Germany . He envisioned the expected deployment would be co @-@ ordinated with an Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) and liaised with the Australian Chief of General Staff , Brigadier General Joseph Gordon , and the possibility of a composite division was discussed . The question of Germany 's possessions in the South Pacific was also raised , and it was agreed that New Zealand would have responsibility for German Samoa , while Australia dealt with German New Guinea . The arrangements Godley put in place for deployment for the NZEF were soon put to the test , for when the First World War began , a New Zealand occupation force was quickly assembled to occupy German Samoa . 
 = = First World War = = 
 The New Zealand government authorised the formation of the NZEF for service in the war in support of Great Britain , with Godley , having relinquished his position as commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces to Major General Alfred William Robin , as its commander . Godley would retain command of the NZEF for the duration of the war , making regular reports to James Allen , the New Zealand Minister of Defence . By October 1914 , the NZEF consisted of 8 @,@ 500 men and , along with Godley , embarked from Wellington for Europe . The NZEF was intended for service on the Western Front but was diverted to Egypt while in transit , following the entry of Turkey into the war . In Egypt , the NZEF underwent an intensive period of training under Godley 's supervision . Despite his strict approach to training and discipline , he was a relatively enlightened commander for his time ; he discreetly established drinking canteens and venereal disease treatment centres for his men . 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 Prior to the start of the Gallipoli Campaign , Godley was made commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division , a composite formation of infantry brigades of the NZEF and the AIF . His new command was one of two infantry divisions of the newly formed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps , commanded by General William Birdwood . 
 Although an extremely competent administrator , there were reservations within the New Zealand government following Godley 's appointment as commander of the division . Allen , although publicly supportive of Godley , privately believed an alternative commander should be found after the division completed its training . Godley was a distant and remote divisional commander , not popular with most soldiers of his command . He also favoured the professional officers of the NZEF , most of whom were seconded from the British Army , over those drawn from the Territorial Force . 
 On the day of the landing at Gallipoli , 25 April 1915 , Godley came ashore on Gallipoli at midday . Consulting with Major General William Bridges that afternoon , Godley was of the view that the Allied forces , dealing with stiffer than expected resistance , should be evacuated ahead of an expected attack by Turkish forces the next morning . Although Bridges agreed with Godley , the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force , Sir Ian Hamilton , ordered them to hold fast . 
 Godley continued as divisional commander for most of the campaign at Gallipoli . Of tall stature , he made constant tours of the front line amidst jokes that the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height . On one visit to Quinn 's Post on 7 May , he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack . Despite his inspections , his reputation amongst the rank and file of the division did not improve . Nor was his co @-@ ordination of offensive operations sound ; during the August offensive , his lack of oversight allowed one of his brigade commanders , Brigadier General Francis Johnston , a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF , to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements . On the morning of 8 August , the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position . Johnstone did not order his reinforcements forward until later that day . Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks . 
 When Birdwood took over command of the newly formed Dardanelles Army , Godley became commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps for the final stages of the Gallipoli campaign and was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on 25 November 1915 . With his appointment as corps commander , he also effectively took over responsibility for the administration of the AIF . The same month it was decided to evacuate the Allied forces from Gallipoli . Although much of the detailed planning for the evacuation was left to his Chief of Staff , Brigadier General Brudenell White , Godley closely inspected the plans before giving his approval . The evacuation was successfully carried out on the nights of 19 and 20 December , with Godley departing on the first night . Following the withdrawal , he was made Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his services at Gallipoli , on the recommendation of General Sir Charles Monro , who had replaced Hamilton as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force . 
 = = = Reforming in Egypt = = = 
 The NZEF and the AIF had returned to Egypt following their withdrawal from Gallipoli . The number of reinforcements from both New Zealand and Australia were more than enough to bring the existing ANZAC divisions back up to strength , and in January 1916 Godley proposed forming new divisions from the surplus reinforcements . These were the New Zealand Division and the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions . The new formations , together with the existing divisions , formed the I ANZAC Corps ( the renamed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ) and II ANZAC Corps . 
 Godley was named as commander of I ANZAC Corps which included the original AIF divisions , the 1st and 2nd Divisions , and the newly formed New Zealand Division . These divisions were engaged in defensive duties along the Suez Canal . However , following the German attack at Verdun in February , it was decided that the planned move of I ANZAC Corps to the Western Front be expedited . Birdwood was to take the corps to France , and on 28 March 1916 , he exchanged commands with Godley , who took over II ANZAC Corps . 
 = = = Western Front = = = 
 Godley 's II ANZAC Corps consisted of the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions along with the ANZAC Mounted Division , and it took over the defensive duties of the I ANZAC Corps . The two Australian divisions were still relatively raw and Godley oversaw the intensive training of both formations . By the end of May 1916 , he considered the divisions to be the equal of the 1st and 2nd Australian divisions , which were by that time on the Western Front . The following month , the divisions of II ANZAC Corps began departing for France . Godley went on leave for a short time during this period of transition for his corps . In July , he returned to duty and II ANZAC Corps took over the section of the front line previously occupied by the I ANZAC Corps , near Armentieres . Later that same month , the 5th Division participated in the Battle of Fromelles in support of the neighbouring British XI Corps . It , together with the 4th Division , would later be transferred to the Somme . 
 Godley 's rank of lieutenant general was made substantive in September 1916 and he continued to lead the II ANZAC Corps while the I ANZAC Corps was engaged in the Battle of the Somme . In October , the New Zealand Division , blooded on the Somme , joined II ANZAC Corps along with the 3rd Division , previously based in England . The corps , attached to the Second Army , performed well in its first major engagement , the Battle of Messines . Writing to Allen after the battle , Godley regarded the capture of Messines as " ... the greatest success of the war so far , all of it achieved with much lighter casualties than those incurred on the Somme . " Despite this success , in August , Godley 's poor standing amongst the NZEF was publicly raised by a member of the New Zealand Parliament who had visited the front earlier in the year . 
 While serving on the Western Front , Godley continued to fulfill his role as the overall commander of the NZEF in addition to his corps command . By September 1917 , as reinforcements from New Zealand continued to arrive on the Western Front to replace the casualties lost in the major battles of the previous two years , Allen , still the Minister of Defence , was concerned by the drain on New Zealand 's manpower . Allen considered that Australia and Canada were not making their proper contributions to the war effort . In response , Godley pointed out that the Australian divisions had seen more action than the New Zealanders . 
 Godley 's II ANZAC Corps played an important role in the Passchendaele offensive in October 1917 . Following the success of his corps at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917 , Godley believed the morale of the Germans was low , and pushed for further attacks to secure the Passchendaele Ridge . This was in concert with the preference of Field Marshal Douglas Haig , the commander of the British Expeditionary Force . However , Godley 's superior officer , General Herbert Plumer , preferred to halt the offensive as the weather had deteriorated immediately after the battle . An attack on 9 October by the 49th and 66th Divisions , both British formations attached to II ANZAC Corps , was hampered by the poor weather which showed no signs of abating and achieved very limited gains . 
 Despite this , and at Godley 's urging , a further attack was planned for 12 October , this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division . By now the ground was a sea of mud and a lack of preparation on the part of Godley 's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery . Godley 's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare . The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions . After the battle , Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division ( which amounted to around 2 @,@ 900 casualties ) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen , and a friend , Clive Wigram , who was the assistant private secretary to King George V. 
 Notwithstanding Godley 's efforts to placate him , Allen again raised his concerns over the extent of New Zealand 's contributions to the war relative to Australia 's and sought further explanation for the New Zealand losses of 12 October . Allen was also beginning to query the quality of British generalship . Godley raised the prospect of being replaced as commander of the NZEF , and proposed Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell , the commander of the New Zealand Division , as his successor . This never eventuated and Godley remained the commander of the NZEF until its disbandment in late 1919 . 
 In January 1918 , II ANZAC Corps had its Australian contingent transferred and it was redesignated as British XXII Corps . Two months later , the New Zealand Division was transferred to VII Corps . Godley 's corps was now composed largely of British Army divisions with a small contingent of New Zealand corps units . After being involved in the defence of the Allied positions during the German Spring Offensive of late March , it then participated , under French command , in the Second Battle of the Marne in July . Godley was temporary commander of III Corps in the Battle of Mont Saint @-@ Quentin during the early phase of the Hundred Days Offensive in August 1918 before returning to command of XXII Corps . 
 By the close of the war , Godley had been mentioned in despatches ten times . He also received a number of foreign decorations as a result of his war service . After an award of the French Croix de Guerre , he was appointed in 1918 to the French Legion of Honour as a Grand Officier , having previously been made a Croix de Commandeur in 1917 . He was also awarded the Serbian Great Officer Cross of the Order of the White Eagle ( with Swords ) in October 1916 , the Belgian Order of the Crown in 1917 and the Belgian Croix de guerre in 1918 . 
 = = Postwar career = = 
 After the war , Godley became Commander of IV Corps which was based in Germany as an occupation army , but he remained responsible for administration of the NZEF until it was disestablished in November 1919 . From 1920 to 1922 , he was Military Secretary to the Secretary of State for War . He then returned to Germany as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the British Army of the Rhine . Promoted to general in 1923 , the following year he was appointed commander of England 's Southern Command . 
 In August 1928 , Godley was appointed to the governorship of Gibraltar , a position in which he remained until his retirement in 1933 . Godley was considered the ablest of the immediate post war governors although he made a misjudgement in interfering in the politics of the Royal Calpe Hunt . The King had to intercede after Godley removed the master of the hunt creating large divisions that were not repaired until his successor took charge . 
 He always held his New Zealand soldiers in high esteem , even if that respect was not reciprocated , and made tours of New Zealand in 1934 and 1935 . When made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in January 1928 , he included in his coat of arms an image of a New Zealand infantryman . 
 In late 1936 , Godley was considered a possible candidate for the governorship of New South Wales but was ultimately not appointed to the position . In his retirement Godley wrote a number of professional articles and his memoirs , Life of an Irish Soldier , were published in 1939 . He later wrote and published British Military History in South America . 
 In June 1939 , Godley 's wife Louise , who he had married in 1898 , died in England . The couple were childless . She had lived in New Zealand during Godley 's term as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces , and had also accompanied him to Egypt during the war . While in Egypt , she had been mentioned in despatches for her work in setting up and running a hospital in Alexandria for New Zealand soldiers . A wreath was sent for the funeral by the New Zealand government on behalf of its citizens . 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Godley offered his services to the New Zealand government , but got no response . He later commanded a platoon of the Home Guard . 
 Alexander Godley died at the age of 90 in a rest home at Oxford on 6 March 1957 . His remains were cremated after a funeral service at Woodland St. Mary 's Church in Berkshire was held on 14 March 1957 . A memorial service was held at the Royal Military Chapel at the Wellington Barracks in London on 21 March 1957 . The service was attended by a representative of Queen Elizabeth II .

 " Fading " is a song by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna from her fifth studio album , Loud ( 2010 ) . The song was written by Jamal Jones and Ester Dean , whilst production of the song was completed by Jones under his production name , Polow da Don . Musically , the song samples Irish instrumentalist and singer @-@ songwriter Enya 's " One by One " , whilst lyrically , the song is about leaving a man in a relationship . After Loud had strong digital download sales in the United Kingdom , " Fading " charted at number 187 on that country 's singles chart in November 2010 . The song received generally positive reviews from music critics , who praised da Don 's production , but one critic criticized Rihanna for copying herself and failing to create something different . Some critics also compared it to one of Rihanna 's previous singles , " Take A Bow " . The song has also been performed on select dates of the Loud Tour ( 2011 ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 Recording sessions for Loud began in February 2010 , and continued for six months , overlapping with Rihanna 's Last Girl on Earth Tour and during production of her debut feature film , Battleship . At the beginning of March 2011 , Rihanna asked fans to help her select her next single , following the release of " S & M " . Via Twitter , fans were asked to choose from " Cheers ( Drink to That ) " , " Man Down " , " California King Bed " or " Fading " . The most popular choice would have its video filmed at the end of March 2011 . On March 12 , 2011 , it was confirmed that fans had selected " California King Bed " as the next single to be released from the album in the United States . In August 2011 , a new version of " Fading " was leaked online , without the Enya sample .

 " Fading " was written by Jamal James and Ester Dean , whilst production of the song was completed by Polow da Don and samples Enya 's " One by One " from her album A Day Without Rain ( 2000 ) . The song was recorded by Sandy Vee at The Bunker Studio 's in Paris , France in 2010 . Musically , the song features a piano and violin led instrumental whilst lyrically , " Fading " is about the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend because she feels that they have become distant and their relationship has faded . The lyrics of the song feature Rihanna adopting a vocal diction which urges her boyfriend to leave and walk away from the relationship , " Go on , be gone / Bye bye so long / Can 't you see we 're fading away " . As noted by Emily Mackay of NME , the song is reminiscent of one of the singer 's previous songs about a relationship gone awry , " Take A Bow " , in lyrical content and musicality . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon Loud 's release , multiple music critics wrote about " Fading " as part of their review , many of whom praised the production of the song . Emily Mackay of NME wrote about the song as part of an overall review of the album , writing " A weird baroque pop opening , violin stabs and treated vocals , builds slowly into a rolling and shuddering beat and soft , sad @-@ toned piano . Mesfin Fekadu of The Boston Globe called the track " exceptional " and compared the lyrical content to that of one of Rihanna 's previous singles " Take A Bow " , writing that Rihanna is skilled at putting out songs about being the woman in a relationship who leaves the man , as she does in " Fading " . Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Polow da Don 's production of the song , writing " ' Fading ' <unk> with long and short elements — sustained choruses and staccato verses , edgeless keyboard chords and notes that are suddenly truncated — to capture the ambivalence of a failing romance . " Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone commented that the singer manages to remain " serene " on the song , even with the sampling of Enya 's " One by One " , and added that " maybe the good girl gone bad is getting better ? " , in reference to Rihanna 's third studio album title , Good Girl Gone Bad ( 2007 ) . 
 Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly simply wrote of " Fading " that the song , a " walk away ballad " , is a " gorgeously synthesized moment of sweet defiance " . David Driver of Sputnikmusic wrote that " Fading " , along with " California King Bed " , are both " well @-@ done , soulful ballads " and that they are " completely free " of the sulky tones which could be found on some compositions on Rihanna 's previous album , Rated R ( 2009 ) . Colin Gentry of 4Music also noted in his review that the song communicates a passionate expression of grief to the listener . Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound wrote that the song was one of the best on the album , commenting that it stands out " sonically " . Burleson added that it is " a hopeful , piano and string @-@ based R & B " song , and compared to the work of late 1990s artists such as Aaliyah and Faith Evans . Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media criticized " Fading " as well as Rihanna herself , for copying " [ her ] own lightweight R & B formula so much it 's redundant " .

 The Whistler Sliding Centre ( French : Centre des sports de <unk> de Whistler ) is a Canadian bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton track located in Whistler , British Columbia , that is 125 km ( 78 mi ) north of Vancouver . The centre is part of the Whistler Blackcomb resort , which comprises two ski mountains separated by Fitzsimmons Creek . Located on the lowermost slope of the northern mountain ( Blackcomb Mountain ) , Whistler Sliding Centre hosted the bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton competitions for the 2010 Winter Olympics . 
 Design work started in late 2004 with construction taking place from June 2005 to December 2007 . <unk> Pierre Lueders and Justin <unk> of Canada took the first run on the track on 19 December 2007 . Certification took place in March 2008 with over 200 runs from six different start houses ( the place where the sleds start their runs ) , and was approved both by the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation ( FIBT ) and the International Luge Federation ( FIL ) . Training runs took place in late 2008 in preparation for the World Cup events in all three sports in early 2009 . World Cup competitions were held in February 2009 for bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton . The top speed for all World Cup events set by German luger Felix Loch at 153 @.@ 98 km / h ( 95 @.@ 68 mph ) .

 On 12 February 2010 , the day of the Olympic opening ceremonies , Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili was killed during a training run while reportedly going 143 @.@ 3 km / h ( 89 @.@ 0 mph ) . This resulted in the men 's singles event being moved to the women 's singles and men 's doubles start house while both the women 's singles and men 's doubles event were moved to the junior start house . During actual luge competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics , there were only two crashes , which resulted in one withdrawal . Skeleton races on 18 – 19 February had no crashes though two skeleton racers were disqualified for technical reasons . Bobsleigh competitions had crashes during all three events . This resulted in supplemental training for both the two @-@ woman and the four @-@ man event following crashes during the two @-@ man event . Modifications were made to the track after the two @-@ man event to lessen the frequency of crashes as well . A 20 @-@ page report was released by the FIL to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) on 12 April 2010 and to the public on FIL 's website on 19 April 2010 regarding Kumaritashvili 's death . Safety concerns at Whistler have affected the track design for the Sliding Center <unk> that will be used for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi . This includes track simulation and mapping to reduce top speeds by 6 to 9 km / h ( 3 @.@ 7 to 5 @.@ 6 mph ) for the Sochi track . 
 Constructed on part of First Nations spiritual grounds , the track won two provincial concrete construction awards in 2008 while the refrigeration plant earned Canada 's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design " gold " certification two years later .

 At the 115th IOC Session held at Prague in 2003 , Vancouver was chosen to host the 2010 Winter Olympics over Pyeongchang , South Korea , and Salzburg , Austria . On 15 November 2004 , it was announced that Stantec Architecture Limited , which designed the 2002 Winter Olympic bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton track in Park City , Utah , in the United States , would provide detail design and site master plan of the track . The company was advised by the German track engineering firm IBG . IBG had designed the tracks used in Oberhof , Germany , the 1988 Winter Olympics in ( Calgary ) and the 2006 Winter Olympics ( Cesana Pariol ) . The German firm is also the designer of the Russian National Sliding Centre , the venue for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi . 
 Site construction of the facility began on 1 June 2005 following environmental approval from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act . Safety and security was then put in place on the site . During its peak of construction activities in the summer of 2006 , more than 500 workers were involved both at the Sliding Centre and at the Whistler Nordic Venue ( now Whistler Olympic Park ) . A core group of 60 workers was involved with track construction from June 2005 to December 2007 . Basic track construction was completed in November 2007 though fit @-@ out and testing continued into 2008 .

 The first run was on 19 December 2007 with Canadian bobsledder Pierre Lueders and his brakeman Justin <unk> starting at the Junior Start house ( Location where the sliders start their run on the track ) 520 m ( 1 @,@ 710 ft ) down the 1 @,@ 450 m ( 4 @,@ 760 ft ) track . A total of six runs were made under the auspices of the FIBT . The Canadian Luge Association opened a branch at the track in February 2008 . Luge tests occurred in late February 2008 and among the participants were Tatjana Hüfner ( Germany ) , Erin Hamlin ( United States ) , Armin <unk> ( Italy ) , and Regan <unk> ( Canada ) . Bobsleigh participants during certification in March 2008 included Sandra <unk> ( Germany ) , Lueders ( Canada ) , and Shauna <unk> ( United States ) while skeleton participants included Kristan Bromley ( Great Britain ) , Kerstin Jürgens ( Szymkowiak since summer 2008 – Germany ) , and Jon Montgomery ( Canada ) . Over 200 runs were taken from six different starting positions on the track . 
 Praise was given both by the FIBT and the FIL over the successful certification of the track . The Vancouver Organizing Committee ( VANOC ) reviewed the recommendations made from both the FIBT and the FIL to fine tune the track . Canadian teams continued testing and training at the track until 20 March 2008 . A total of <unk> runs ( 335 bobsleigh , 1077 luge , and 743 skeleton ) took place at the track with a total of 15 crashes . Final track inspection by the FIL Executive Board took place 25 – 27 September 2008 before the International Training Week later that year .

 International Training Week for luge took place at the track 7 – 15 November 2008 . A total of <unk> runs took place during the training with several injuries occurring , most notably Loch , the 2008 men 's singles world champion , who injured his shoulder . In a 9 December 2008 press release , the Centre was continuing certification by adding protections on the track against crashes and weather . FIL President Josef Fendt stated that the track 's speed was too high with top speeds reaching 149 km / h ( 93 mph ) during training . From the <unk> runs executed during the International Training week for luge , there were 73 crashes , a crash rate of three percent which was normal during new track testing . Three lugers , including Loch , were sent to the hospital , but were later released . Italy 's <unk> stated that " The track can be tackled . " and " does not see big problems for the athletes " while Fendt called for the top track speed for future tracks to be lowered to 135 or 136 km / h ( 84 or 85 mph ) where possible . For the 2008 – 09 World Cup season at the Centre , <unk> runs were made for bobsleigh ( 2153 ) , luge ( <unk> ) , and skeleton ( <unk> ) . After the World Cup event on 20 – 21 February 2009 , Austria 's Andreas Linger described the track as " fast , incredibly fast . " 
 Loch stated that luge speeds for men 's singles reached 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) before turn three at the women 's singles and men 's doubles ' start house . A total of <unk> runs for bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton were made at the track during the four @-@ week time period for the World Cup events . FIL President Fendt stated that " [ my ] technical delegate told me this week that the Games could start tomorrow and the track would be ready . " and he appreciated the whole Whistler Sliding Centre At the 2008 – 09 World Cup season finale , 135 athletes participated ( 67 men , 42 women , and 26 doubles ) though 144 athletes from 23 nations were registered . During the Luge World Cup event that weekend , 186 runs took place with 16 crashes .

 The first bobsleigh and skeleton training week took place on 25 – 31 January 2009 to prepare for their respective World Cup events on 5 – 7 February 2009 . A total of 250 competitors from 24 nations took part in the World Cup practice for all five events ( Bobsleigh two @-@ man , bobsleigh two @-@ woman , bobsleigh four @-@ man , and men 's and women 's skeleton ) . Competition and weather affected testing and World Cup runs for the two @-@ week time period . A team of 118 personnel and 276 volunteers worked consecutive weeks at the Training Week and World Cup events . Track director Craig Lehto stated that the volunteer efforts were similar to what he had seen both at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary . The final two days of competition had 3000 total spectators . Medical services , led by VANOC and FIBT medical director Dr. David McDonagh , tested themselves with first responder care and mock scenarios that included athlete extraction from the sled if the accident was severe enough . These services were tested again during the Luge World Cup competition on 20 – 21 February 2009 . A total of 15 @,@ 000 spectators attended all five days for the bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton World Cup events , all sold out . FIBT President Robert H. Storey stated that the Centre " ... is fast , technical , demanding , and interesting . " . A total of 235 athletes participated in the 2008 – 09 World Cup event ( 92 four @-@ man , 54 two @-@ man , 40 two @-@ woman , 28 men 's skeleton , and 21 women 's skeleton ) .

 A paid training session took place 27 October – 7 November 2009 at the Centre for bobsleigh teams in preparation for the 2010 Games . On 9 – 15 November 2009 , a second International Training Week for luge took place in preparation for the 2010 Games with the participation of 156 athletes from 27 nations . Venezuela 's Werner Hoeger was knocked unconscious during a practice run on 13 November 2009 and was denied any further make @-@ up runs . During training that week , Hoeger expressed concern about the safety of the track . These concerns called for the resignation of track director Ed Moffat , father of lugers Chris and Mike , to offer equal runs to all lugers in future events , to have Canada forfeit any extra training runs that were negotiated for the 2014 Winter Olympics , and for the Canadian Luge Association be reprimanded for unethical actions and not providing a safe sliding environment , especially after speeds were 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) higher than expected . Canadian Luge Association officials declined to comment though they stated to the New York Times that the lugers received up to three times the amount of training runs offered in the run @-@ up to the 2006 Winter Olympics at Cesana Pariol . 
 Team Canada ( luge ) did not participate in the World Cup event in Lillehammer , Norway during 12 – 13 December 2009 to train at the Sliding Centre and to compete at the Canadian National Championships that took place on 17 December 2009 . A training restriction went into effect on 31 December 2009 where only host nation Canada and athletes from developing nations were allowed to train before the 2010 Games . For the 2009 – 10 season , there were a total of <unk> runs among bobsleigh ( <unk> ) , luge ( <unk> ) , and skeleton ( <unk> ) with a total of 115 crashes among the three sliding disciplines .

 The Centre 's official website was launched in late June 2008 . Public self @-@ guided walking tours ran from 3 July through 31 August 2008 . The cost to the public was 5 Canadian dollars ( C $ 5 ) with children under 12 admitted free . World Cup competition for bobsleigh and skeleton took place on 2 – 8 February 2009 while luge took place on 20 – 21 February 2009 . The track was a finalist for the 2012 FIL World Luge Championships along with Altenberg , Germany , at the 2008 FIL Congress in Calgary , Alberta , but the track withdrew its bid before the 28 June 2008 selection . During a 4 – 5 April 2009 weekend meeting of the FIL Commission at St. Leonhard , Austria , it was recommended that the Centre be host for the 2013 FIL World Luge Championships . This was confirmed on 19 – 20 June 2009 at the 57th FIL Congress meeting in Liberec , Czech Republic . 
 Post @-@ Olympic usage is a responsibility of the Whistler 2010 Sports Legacies which operates the Sliding Centre , Whistler Olympic Park , and the Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village .

 On 12 February 2010 , hours before the opening ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics , Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili suffered a crash during a training run exiting out of turn 16 . Kumaritashvili was injured when he flew off the track and collided with a steel pole . He was going 143 @.@ 3 km / h ( 89 @.@ 0 mph ) at the time of the crash . He died later that day from the injuries sustained in that crash . His accident came after other crashes during that week . This reignited concerns about the track 's safety . Kumaritashvili was the first Olympic athlete to die at the Winter Olympics in training since 1992 and the first luger to die in a practice event at the Winter Olympics since Kazimierz Kay @-@ <unk> of Great Britain was killed at the luge track used for the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck . It was also luge 's first fatality since 10 December 1975 when an Italian luger was killed . A joint statement was issued by the FIL , the IOC , and VANOC over Kumaritashvili 's death . Training was suspended for the rest of that day . According to the Coroners Service of British Columbia and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , the cause of Kumaritashvili 's death was him coming out of turn 15 late and then not compensating before turn 16 . 
 As a preventive measure , an extra 100 ft ( 30 m ) of wall was added after the end of Turn 16 , and the ice profile was changed . Also , the men 's singles luge event start was moved from its start house to the one for both the women 's singles and men 's doubles event . Women 's singles and men 's doubles start was moved to the Junior start house of the track , located after turn 5 . Germany 's Natalie <unk> complained that it was not a women 's start but more of a Kinder ( " children " in ( German ) ) start . Her teammate Hüfner , who had the fastest speed on the two practice runs at 82 @.@ 3 mph ( 132 @.@ 4 km / h ) , stated that the new start position " does not help good starters like myself . " American Erin Hamlin , the 2009 women 's singles world champion , stated the track was still demanding even after the distance was lessened from 1 @,@ 193 to 953 m ( 3 @,@ 914 to 3 @,@ 127 ft ) and one was still hitting 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . 
 During a 14 February 2010 interview with Reuters , FIL Secretary @-@ General Svein Romstad stated that the federation considered cancelling the luge competition in the wake of Kumaritashvili 's death two days earlier . Romstad stated that " [ Kumaritashvili ] ... made a mistake " on the crash though " any fatality is unacceptable " . Additionally , Romstad stated that the start houses were moved to their current locations " mostly for an emotional reason " . Because of Kumaritashvili 's death , the FIL is working with the Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee over making the Russian National Sliding Centre in <unk> Polyana slower in speed . Canada 's Alex Gough commented on 14 February ( two days after Kumaritashvili 's death ) that " We ’ ve got the world championships here in a few years ( 2013 ) so hopefully we can actually have a race " instead of the start at the Junior start house . 
 On 18 February 2010 , FIL President Fendt issued the following statement : 
 " At the conclusion of the luge competition at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games , our thoughts are with the family of Nodar Kumaritashvili . We again offer our heartfelt condolences to them , to his friends and to the entire Georgian Luge Federation . Nodar Kumaritashvili will forever stay in the hearts of all the members of the Luge family . 
 This has also been a difficult time for the Olympic athletes who competed in these Games . Their solidarity and sportsmanship was a tribute to the friend we lost . The International Luge Federation is touched by the outpouring of compassion and sympathy from people around the world . We will leave Whistler determined to do all we can to prevent a recurrence of this tragic event . 
 Kumaritashvili was buried in his hometown of Bakuriani , on 20 February 2010 . Georgian National Olympic Committee president Gia <unk> and Georgia president Mikheil Saakashvili raised concern and anger toward the Sliding Centre 's organizers that the safety concerns were not addressed .

 On 11 February 2010 , Romania 's Violeta <unk> was knocked unconscious after hitting several walls during a training run . She was strapped to a backboard and placed on a stretcher though her arms were moving . <unk> withdrew before the women 's singles event . 
 In the first run of the men 's doubles luge competition on 17 February 2010 , Austria 's team of Tobias <unk> and Markus <unk> survived a crash on turn 16 where they came in at too high of an elevation . Tobias tried to correct the oversteer only to have the cousins collide on the opposite side of the ice wall , causing both to go airborne momentarily . Neither suffered any injury . 
 Mihaela <unk> of Romania suffered the only crash of ten actual competitive runs ( four men single , four women single , and two doubles ) , and that was during the second run of the women 's singles event . Each of the five days of luge competition was attended by a sold @-@ out crowd of 12 @,@ 000 spectators .

 Bobsleigh practice began on 17 February 2010 with the two @-@ man event . Eight crashes among 57 runs took place that day . Three crashes occurred during the two @-@ man practice session on 18 February 2010 . Supplemental practice was offered on 19 February 2010 to both the two @-@ woman and four @-@ man events out of caution , and further preparation for both events that took place the following week . 
 For the first run on 20 February 2010 , a sled from Australia crashed out and did not finish , while a sled from Great Britain was disqualified when the sled 's brakeman was ejected during the first run . Liechtenstein 's sled crashed out during the first run and finished , but did not start the second run . During the two @-@ man event , runs three and four on 21 February 2010 were rescheduled to 16 : 00 PST ( 00 : 00 UTC on 22 February ) for run three and 17 : 35 PST ( 01 : 35 UTC on the 22nd ) for run four due to unseasonable warm weather . Temperatures reached 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) on the afternoon of the 20th and were expected to reach 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) on the afternoon of the 21st . No crashes occurred in the final two runs of the event . Germany 's André Lange and Kevin <unk> won the two @-@ man event . 
 Reactions from <unk> about the track during the two @-@ man event varied from exciting to anxious to dangerous . The Associated Press spoke to 13 of the 21 drivers who competed at the two @-@ woman event on 23 – 24 February 2010 and the only one who did not feel safe on the track was Erin Pac of the United States . The three German drivers who competed in the two @-@ woman event stated through a team spokeswoman that they had no safety concerns about the track . 
 Minor changes were made to the track on 22 February 2010 after bobsleigh four @-@ man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice . Following a meeting with 11 team captains , practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would be easier for sleds to get through the rest of the track without crashing . FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton . 
 After track alterations were done on 23 February 2010 , the two fastest four @-@ man practice times were done by Germany 's Lange and the United States ' Steven Holcomb . Australia withdrew its four @-@ man team on 23 February 2010 after two of its crew members suffered concussions from crashes sustained during track practice . Australia 's chef de mission Ian Chesterman stated that the decision was not taken lightly and was done on the side of safety . 
 In the two @-@ woman event , defending world champion Nicole Minichiello of Britain had her sled flip over after turn 12 during the third run , but both Minichiello and her brakeman Gillian Cooke walked away from the crash . Minichiello and Cooke decided not to start the final run . In the final run , Russia @-@ 2 's sled crashed which kept them at their finishing position of 18th . Meanwhile , the Germany @-@ 2 sled of Cathleen Martini and Romy Logsch was in fourth place after the third run , but was disqualified after Martini crashed in turn 13 of the final run , causing Logsch to be ejected from the sled . Both Martini and Logsch walked away from the crash by themselves . Before this incident , Martini had never crashed before in her career . Canada 's <unk> Humphries and Heather Moyse won the event . 
 Lange had the fastest practice times in the four @-@ man event on the 24th with the final two practices taking place on the 25th . 
 For the four @-@ man event 's first two runs on 26 February , defending world champion Holcomb recorded the fastest track times in both runs while defending Olympic champion Lange had the fastest start times .

 Kumaritashvili 's death raised concerns about athlete safety at the Winter Olympics . As of 21 February 2010 , there were 30 crashes in bobsleigh and luge at the Sliding Centre . Debate was raised on tightening qualification standards in weeding out unqualified athletes , in requiring a large number of training runs , in slowing down the sliding tracks , or in combining the three . The Russian National Sliding Centre planned for the bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton events at the 2014 Winter Olympics has not been built though organizers already said that it is designed to be 6 to 9 km / h ( 3 @.@ 7 to 5 @.@ 6 mph ) slower than The Whistler Sliding Centre . Sochi 's Sliding Centre will be monitored via 3 @-@ D computer graphics and simulation . The IOC has improved safety standards over the years such as lowering obstacles for the equestrian three @-@ day event , requiring protective head gear for boxing and ice hockey , and tightening qualification standards to preclude athletes not qualified for the event . FIBT President Storey wanted to wait to review safety of bobsleigh , luge , and skeleton until after the 2010 Games , stating that track designers needed to find a balance between challenges and dangers on the track . Track designer <unk> told Sport Bild that perhaps track walls should be raised 40 to 50 cm ( 16 to 20 in ) on future courses though a risk @-@ proof course may not be possible . According to VANOC , over 30 @,@ 000 runs were made prior to the games with neither the FIBT nor the FIL issuing public danger warnings about the track . IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that he " will do everything in my power that this should not happen again in the future " . 
 The FIL published their reports in regards to Kumaritashvili 's death following the FIL Commissions Meeting in St. Leonhard , for both sport and technical commissions on 9 – 11 April 2010 . This report was prepared by Romstad and Claire <unk> , FIL Vice @-@ President Sport Artificial Track . The 20 @-@ page report was released by the FIL to the IOC on 12 April 2010 and was released on FIL 's website to the public on 19 April 2010 . Documents released in February 2011 showed that the speed of the course was a concern for several years before Kumaritashvili 's death .

It represents the beating of the Thunderbird 's huge wings filled with thunder in the air . 
 Originally budgeted for C $ 55 million , the track 's actual costs were C $ 105 million ( € 68 million ) . The track is made of 350 metric tons ( 340 long tons ; 390 short tons ) of reinforced concrete that was applied using pressurized spraying to reach a maximum thickness of 6 in ( 15 cm ) . Additionally , the track contains 12 km ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) of steel conduit , 600 awnings , and 700 lights . A total of 350 track footings were used to set the track on its proper foundation . Forty percent of those footings were completed by July 2006 . There are over 100 km ( 62 mi ) of ammonia refrigeration piping used to keep the track frozen . Sloping and curves were contoured to within 1 to 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 039 to 0 @.@ 118 in ) of the planned design course . Ice thickness is 2 to 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 1 @.@ 97 in ) that is maintained by hand . There are 36 on @-@ track video cameras and 42 " timing eyes " located at the Sliding Centre . The track also includes a control tower and administration buildings . There are two spectator overpasses ( between turns 1 and 2 , and turns 6 and 7 ) and three spectator underpasses ( between turns 8 and 9 , turns 11 and 12 , and turns 15 and 16 ) .

 To promote sustainability , the site was selected directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area . It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area . For energy efficiency , trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track . The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system . Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on @-@ site , and could provide other heat uses in the future . Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse . Other on @-@ site buildings also followed similar green building design principles .

 = Siege of Naxos ( 499 BC ) = 
 The Siege of Naxos ( 499 BC ) was a failed attempt by the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras , operating with support from , and in the name of the Persian Empire of Darius the Great , to conquer the island of Naxos . It was the opening act of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , which would ultimately last for 50 years . 
 Aristagoras had been approached by exiled Naxian aristocrats , who were seeking to return to their island . Seeing an opportunity to bolster his position in Miletus , Aristagoras sought the help of his overlord , the Persian king Darius the Great , and the local satrap , Artaphernes to conquer Naxos . <unk> to the expedition , the Persians assembled a force of 200 triremes under the command of Megabates . 
 The expedition quickly descended into a debacle . Aristagoras and Megabates quarreled on the journey to Naxos , and someone ( possibly Megabates ) informed the Naxians of the imminent arrival of the force . When they arrived , the Persians and Ionians were thus faced with a city well prepared to undergo siege . The expeditionary force duly settled down to besiege the defenders , but after four months without success , ran out of money and were forced to return to Asia Minor . 
 In the aftermath of this disastrous expedition , and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant , Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against Darius the Great . The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus . Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed , with no decisive effect , before the Persians regrouped and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus . At the Battle of Lade , the Persians decisively defeated the Ionian fleet and effectively ended the rebellion . Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold , Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria , who had supported the revolt . In 492 BC therefore , the first Persian invasion of Greece , would begin as a consequence of the failed attack on Naxos , and the Ionian Revolt . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the Greek Dark Ages that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization , significant numbers of Greeks had emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there . These settlers were from three tribal groups : the Aeolians , Dorians and Ionians . The Ionians had settled about the coasts of Lydia and Caria , founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia . These cities were Miletus , Myus and Priene in Caria ; Ephesus , Colophon , Lebedos , Teos , Clazomenae , Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia ; and the islands of Samos and Chios . The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus , in around 560 BC . The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great . The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule . Elsewhere in the empire , Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects — such as the priesthood of Judea . No such group existed in Greek cities at this time ; while there was usually an aristocracy , this was inevitably divided into feuding factions . The Persians thus settled for the sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city , even though this drew them into the Ionians ' internal conflicts . Furthermore , a tyrant might develop an independent streak , and have to be replaced . The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task ; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens ' hatred , while staying in the favour of the Persians . 
 About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia , and in the reign of the fourth Persian king , Darius the Great , the stand @-@ in Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament . Aristagoras 's uncle Histiaeus had accompanied Darius on campaign in 513 BC , and when offered a reward , had asked for part of the conquered Thracian territory . Although this was granted , Histiaeus 's ambition alarmed Darius 's advisors , and Histiaeus was thus further ' rewarded ' by being compelled to remain in Susa as Darius 's " Royal Table @-@ Companion " . Taking over from Histiaeus , Aristagoras was faced with bubbling discontent in Miletus . 
 Indeed , this period in Greek history is remarkable for the social and political upheaval in many Greek cities , particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens . The island of Naxos , part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea , was also in this period affected by political turmoil . Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant <unk> , a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos , until around 524 BC , when he was overthrown by the Spartans . After this , a native aristocracy seems to have flourished , and Naxos became one of the most prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands . Despite its success , Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife , and shortly before 500 BC , the population seized power , expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy . 
 In 500 BC , Aristagoras was approached by some of the exiles from Naxos , who asked him to help restore them to the control of the island . Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos , Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia , Artaphernes , with a proposal . If Artaphernes provided an army , Aristagoras would conquer the island in Darius 's name , and he would then give Artaphernes a share of the spoils to cover the cost of raising the army . Furthermore , Aristagoras suggested that once Naxos fell , the other Cyclades would also quickly follow , and he even suggested that Euboea could be attacked on the same expedition . Artaphernes agreed in principle , and asked Darius for permission to launch the expedition . Darius assented to this , and a force of 200 triremes was assembled in order to attack Naxos the following year . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The Persian fleet was duly assembled in the spring of 499 BC , and sailed to Ionia . Artaphernes put his ( and Darius 's ) cousin Megabates in charge of the expedition , and dispatched him to Miletus with the Persian army . They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces , and then embarked and set sail . In order to avoid warning the Naxians , the fleet initially sailed north , towards the Hellespont , but when they arrived at Chios they doubled back and headed south for Naxos . 
 Herodotus recounts that Megabates made inspections of the ships ( probably whilst beached for the night ) , and came across one ship from <unk> which had not posted any sentries . Megabates ordered his guard to find the captain of the ship , Scylax , and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship 's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship . News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision . When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras 's wishes , Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself . Predictably , Megabates was furious with Aristagoras , who in turn retorted " But you , what have you to do with these matters ? Did not <unk> send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid you ? Why are you so meddlesome ? " . According to Herodotus , Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force . 
 Modern historians , doubting that a Persian commander would have sabotaged his own invasion , have suggested several other possible scenarios . It is , however , impossible to know exactly how the Naxians became aware of the invasion , but undoubtedly they were aware , and began to make preparations . Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition , but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields , gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 Herodotus does not provide complete numbers for either side , but gives some idea of the strength of the two forces . Clearly , since they were fighting on home territory , the Naxian forces could theoretically have included the whole population . Herodotus says in his narrative that the " Naxians have eight thousand men that bear shields " , which suggests that there were 8 @,@ 000 men capable of equipping themselves as hoplites . These men would have formed a strong backbone to the Naxian resistance . 
 The Persian force was primarily based around 200 triremes . It is not clear whether there were additional transport ships . The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men , including 14 marines . In the second Persian invasion of Greece , each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines , and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes . Furthermore , the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each . This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 40 – 45 soldiers — triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight . If the Persian force at Naxos was similarly made up , then it would have contained somewhere in the region of 8 @,@ 000 to 9 @,@ 000 soldiers ( in addition to many unarmed rowers ) . 
 = = Siege = = 
 When the Ionians and Persians arrived at Naxos , they were faced by a well @-@ fortified and supplied city . Herodotus does not explicitly say , but this was presumably the eponymous capital of Naxos . He provides few details of the military actions that ensued , although there is a suggestion that there was an initial assault on the city , which was repelled . The Ionians and Persians thus settled down to besiege the city . However , after four months , the Persians had run out of money , with Aristagoras also spending a great deal . Thoroughly demoralised , the expedition prepared to return to Asia Minor empty handed . Before leaving , they built a stronghold for the exiled Naxian aristocrats on the island . This was a typical strategy in the Greek world for those exiled by internal strife , giving them a base from which to quickly return , as events permitted . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With the failure of his attempt to conquer Naxos , Aristagoras found himself in dire straits ; he was unable to repay Artaphernes the costs of the expedition , and had moreover alienated himself from the Persian royal family . He fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes . In a desperate attempt to save himself , Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects , the Milesians , to revolt against their Persian masters , thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt . Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras 's personal motives , it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway , the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians . Aristagoras 's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box ; they incited rebellion across Ionia ( and Aeolis and Doris ) , and tyrannies were everywhere abolished , and democracies established in their place . 
 Having brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt , Aristagoras evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to fight the Persians . In the winter of 499 BC , he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies . He failed to persuade the Spartans , but the cities of Athens and Eretria agreed to support the rebellion . In the spring of 498 BC , an Athenian force of twenty triremes , accompanied by five from Eretria , for a total of twenty @-@ five triremes , set sail for Ionia . They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus . This force was then guided by the Ephesians through mountains to Sardis , Artaphernes 's satrapal capital . The Greeks caught the Persians unawares , and were able to capture the lower city . However , the lower city then caught on fire , and the Greeks , demoralised , then retreated from the city , and began to make their way back to Ephesus . The Persian troops in Asia Minor followed the Greek force , catching them outside Ephesus . It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians , and were completely routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus . The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities , while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships , and sailed back to Greece . 
 Despite these setbacks , the revolt spread further . The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis , and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities . They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion . Furthermore , seeing the spread of the rebellion , the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion . For the next three years , the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus , and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years . At the height of the Persian counter @-@ offensive , Aristagoras , sensing the untenability of his position , decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus , and of the revolt , and he left Miletus . Herodotus , who evidently has a rather negative view of him , suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled . 
 By the sixth year of the revolt ( 494 BC ) , the Persian forces had regrouped . The available land forces were gathered into one army , and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re @-@ subjugated Cypriots , and the Egyptians , Cilicians and Phoenicians . The Persians headed directly to Miletus , paying little attention to other strongholds , presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its centre . The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea , leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians . The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade , off the coast of Miletus . The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade , so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect . Although this was unsuccessful at first , when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians , the Samian contingent accepted the Persian offer . As the Persian and Ionian fleets met , the Samians sailed away from the battle , causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line . Although the Chian contingent and a few other ships remained , and fought bravely against the Persians , the battle was lost . 
 With defeat at Lade , the Ionian Revolt was all but ended . The next year , the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds , and began the process of bringing peace to the region . The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire , and as such represents the first phase of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold , Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt . Moreover , seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire , he decided to conquer the whole of Greece . In 492 BC , the first Persian invasion of Greece , the next phase of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt .

 = Tropical Storm Alpha ( 2005 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Alpha was the twenty @-@ third named storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . The twenty @-@ one names from the predetermined A – W list having been used , Alpha was the first tropical storm ever to be given a name from the Greek alphabet . On October 20 , Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ five formed from a tropical wave near the Windward Islands . It became a tropical storm on October 23 , and reached its peak intensity but weakened again before making landfall in the Dominican Republic that afternoon . Crossing the island of Hispaniola it weakened to a tropical depression , and persisted until October 24 , when it dissipated . Its remnant low was absorbed by Hurricane Wilma 's large circulation . 
 Alpha dumped torrential rain on the island of Hispaniola , making it the eighth wettest storm to impact poverty @-@ stricken Haiti . It caused 26 deaths , 17 of them in Haiti and all of them caused by floods and rain @-@ related landslides . Roads were blocked for weeks and hundreds of houses were destroyed . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Alpha 's origins were from a tropical wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October 20 . Satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west @-@ northwest with increasing convective activity . In an area of light wind shear , the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well @-@ defined cyclonic circulation . On October 22 , the area of low pressure organized into Tropical Depression 25 , southeast of Hispaniola . Shortly thereafter , satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed , and the associated convection had started banding . Later that same day , the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha ; this was the first time the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane . 
 When Alpha came within the Doppler weather radar range of Puerto Rico , the radar suggested that an eyewall @-@ like feature had developed . Alpha was tracking along the southwest edge of a subtropical ridge . With nearby Hurricane Wilma 's large circulation , Alpha was experiencing strong southerly flow from Wilma . Alpha , with its small circulation , was then faced with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola , which led forecasters to believe Alpha was soon to dissipate . Shortly after Alpha reached its peak intensity on October 23 its wind decreased . While convection remained in bands , the low level circulation was disrupted by land . This left the center ill @-@ defined and difficult to locate . 
 Late on October 23 , Alpha made landfall in Hispaniola , quickly decreasing in intensity as it did so . After making landfall , the storm weakened , leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status . Because of the weakening , and the strong southerly flow from nearby Hurricane Wilma , it was hard to determine whether a low @-@ level circulation was present . However , satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to the north of Hispaniola . It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day , now re @-@ emerging over open waters . The storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that the system was weakening . On October 24 the low @-@ level center had completely dissolved , and only a small area of convective activity persisted . Thus the system had dissipated , and was a remnant low pressure system when the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisories of Alpha . Shortly thereafter , the remnant low was absorbed into the circulation of Hurricane Wilma on October 25 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On October 22 , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the island of Hispaniola and a tropical storm watch for Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas . The tropical storm watch was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm warning . In the Dominican Republic , authorities ordered the evacuation of at least 30 @,@ 000 people living in areas where flooding was possible . On October 22 and 23 , the Haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha 's rainfall . Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma 's passage between October 8 and 19 , so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire . The country 's Centre National de <unk> issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides . The local government of the Sud @-@ Est Department ordered the evacuation of its capital city , Jacmel . The national government mobilized personnel and resources of the Direction of Civil Protection , the <unk> Permanent de Gestion des <unk> et des <unk> ( <unk> ) , and the National Police to pre @-@ arranged Emergency Operation Centres . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Although the storm 's circulation technically made landfall near Barahona in the Dominican Republic , the bulk of its impact occurred in the country 's poorer neighbor , Haiti . When Alpha arrived on Hispaniola it brought between 4 inches ( 101 mm ) and 7 @.@ 9 in ( 201 mm ) of rain which triggered floods and landslides . The road between Port @-@ au @-@ Prince and the Haiti 's Sud Department was closed at Grand @-@ Goâve in the Ouest department . In the coastal city of Léogâne near Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , bridges were closed to cars but not to pedestrians . <unk> rivers east of Marigot and west of Jacmel closed roads in that region , and the main road between Jérémie and Les Cayes was also closed . Elsewhere in the country , landslides temporarily blocked several other major roads . Gonâve Island , which had been suffering a brutal drought , was stricken by floods which overwhelmed and washed away pipes of the water draining system in Nan <unk> . 
 Damages in Haiti were mostly confined to the Ouest , Sud @-@ Est , and Grand 'Anse departments . In Haiti , 17 people died . Two drowned when a river overflowed in Grande Anse and two more died after being electrocuted during flooding , one in the Port @-@ au @-@ Prince suburb of Carrefour and the other in the southern town of Jacmel . The rest of the deaths were the results of landslides and flooding in various areas in the country . Across the country , 243 houses were destroyed , and 191 more were damaged . 
 Nine people were killed in the Dominican Republic : two fishermen went missing at sea during the storm and the others were swept away by flood waters when rivers burst their banks in <unk> and Puerto Plata . Otherwise , the damage in the Dominican Republic was minimal . 
 The Haitian government did not request international assistance , although The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ( MINUSTAH ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the Haitian Red @-@ Cross , which were already working in Haiti , took on some supporting roles . In response to local flooding , the Jacmel Regional branch of the Red Cross distributed an additional 400 water purification tablets , 11 boxes of high @-@ energy biscuits , and 10 boxes of body soap . 
 = = Naming and records = = 
 Since all the twenty one predetermined hurricane names were exhausted after Hurricane Wilma , the Greek alphabet was used and the storm was designated Alpha once it reached tropical storm status . The name Alpha had been used before in the Atlantic for a subtropical storm , but 2005 was the first season to have a tropical storm Alpha . 
 At the time it was thought that Alpha was the twenty @-@ second storm of the season , and so was the storm which broke the 1933 season 's record for most storms in a single season . However post @-@ season analysis revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October 4 , which made Alpha the twenty @-@ third storm of the season . Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek @-@ alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted . 
 = SMS Seeadler = 
 SMS Seeadler ( " His Majesty 's Ship Seeadler — Sea Eagle " ) was an unprotected cruiser of the Bussard class , the third member of a class of six ships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . Her sister ships included Bussard , the lead ship , along with Falke , Condor , Cormoran , and Geier . Seeadler was built at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Danzig in late 1890 , launched in February 1892 , and commissioned in August of that year . Intended for colonial service , Seeadler was armed with a main battery of eight 10 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and had a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 knots ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) . 
 Seeadler spent almost her entire career abroad . Following her commissioning , she joined the protected cruiser Kaiserin Augusta on a visit to the United States for the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus 's discovery of the Americas . She thereafter went to German East Africa , where she was stationed until 1898 . She returned to Germany briefly for a modernization in 1898 – 1899 , before being assigned to the South Seas Station in German New Guinea . During her tour in the Pacific , she participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900 . Her assignment in the Pacific was interrupted by the 1905 Maji @-@ Maji Rebellion in German East Africa , which prompted the German Navy to send Seeadler there . 
 Seeadler remained in East Africa for the next nine years , returning to Germany finally in January 1914 . She had spent over thirteen years abroad since her 1899 modernization , the longest period of continuous overseas service of any major German warship . After arriving in Germany , she was decommissioned . She was not mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , being too old to be of any fighting value . She was instead used as a mine storage hulk outside Wilhelmshaven . On 19 April 1917 , her cargo of mines exploded and destroyed the ship , though there were no casualties . Her wreck was never raised for scrapping . 
 = = Design = = 
 Seeadler was 83 @.@ 9 meters ( 275 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 7 m ( 42 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 42 m ( 14 @.@ 5 ft ) forward . She displaced 1 @,@ 864 t ( 1 @,@ 835 long tons ; 2 @,@ 055 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by four coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . These provided a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 kn ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) and a range of approximately 2 @,@ 950 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 460 km ; 3 @,@ 390 mi ) at 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with eight 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns in single pedestal mounts , supplied with 800 rounds of ammunition in total . They had a range of 10 @,@ 800 m ( 35 @,@ 400 ft ) . Two guns were placed side by side forward , two on each broadside , and two side by side aft . The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon . She was also equipped with two 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes , both of which were mounted on the deck . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Seeadler , named for the sea eagle , was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Danzig in late 1890 . She was launched on 2 February 1892 , originally named <unk> . The shipyard director , Kapitän zur See <unk> gave the launching speech . She was completed by 27 June 1892 , when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy . The ship was renamed on 17 August when she was commissioned , since Kaiser Wilhelm II decided to rename his first yacht <unk> instead . Seeadler began her sea trials the same day . On 25 October , she was accidentally rammed by the armored corvette Bayern in Kiel , but she suffered only light damage . Her trials lasted until 17 November ; she formally entered service with the fleet on 15 March 1893 . 
 After her commissioning , <unk> was slated to replace Schwalbe in the East African Station in German East Africa . But first , Seeadler and the protected cruiser Kaiserin Augusta conducted a good @-@ will visit to the United States , a belated celebration of the 400th anniversary of Columbus 's first voyage across the Atlantic . The ships left Kiel on 25 March , but due to a mistaken estimate for the amount of coal that would be necessary to cross the Atlantic , Seeadler ran out of fuel while en route . Kaiserin Augusta took the cruiser under tow to Halifax , where she refilled her coal bunkers . The two cruisers reached Hampton Roads on 18 April . Ships from nine other navies , including the US Navy , arrived for a major celebration in New York harbor that was reviewed by Grover Cleveland , the President of the United States . Seeadler attracted particular attention due to her yacht @-@ like appearance . 
 = = = Deployment to East Africa = = = 
 After the conclusion of the festivities in the United States , Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic , first to the Azores , before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea . There , she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June . Seeadler proceeded to Bombay , India for a period of routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August . The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar , where she met the survey ship Möwe , the other vessel on the East Africa Station . On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa ; a group of slave traders had attacked the small detachment of <unk> ( police force ) stationed there . The colonial army , the Schutztruppe ( protection force ) was unavailable to reinforce the police troops , and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralize the threat . 
 Seeadler thereafter proceeded to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese Moçambique . A rebellion in the Portuguese colony threatened German nationals residing in the city ; Seeadler evacuated the civilians and took them to Zanzibar , where they arrived on 15 November . During this period , Möwe was transferred to German New Guinea , and Seeadler 's sister ships Condor and Cormoran arrived in German East Africa . Condor was to reinforce Seeadler and Cormoran was to continue on to the Pacific , but the latter remained in the area temporarily to strengthen the German naval force in the region . This was done both to observe the damage to German economic interests in Moçambique and as a show of force to prevent British encroachment on Delagoa Bay , which was the only supply port for the independent Transvaal . In January 1895 , Condor took over Seeadler 's role on the East African coast . 
 On 10 January , Seeadler departed for Bombay , where her boilers were repaired in a major overhaul . Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work . Seeadler was back in service by May , and on 18 May she departed Bombay , arriving in East Africa on 31 May . Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific . The rest of the year was uneventful for Seeadler , though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa . The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15 @,@ 000 German nationals in the Transvaal , along with the investment of 500 million gold marks in the country . The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria , the capital of the Transvaal , but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant . Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled . In mid @-@ February 1896 , she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul . 
 After completing her repairs , Seeadler was ordered to German South @-@ West Africa on 28 April to assist the Schutztruppe in suppressing a local rebellion . The ship was tasked with interrupting the shipment of weapons from British arms dealers to the rebels . Seeadler thereafter proceeded to Swakopmund on 5 May ; she was joined there by the gunboat Hyäne . The two ships sent forces ashore to defend the city . At the end of the month , Seeadler returned to East Africa . On 2 October , she steamed to Zanzibar to take the deposed Sultan Khalid bin Barghash to Dar es Salaam following the brief Anglo @-@ Zanzibar War . On 20 December , Seeadler was again called to Lourenço Marques after the German consul there , Graf von Pfeil was attacked by Portuguese colonial police . Condor joined her there on 2 January 1897 to strengthen the show of force . Seeadler thereafter proceeded to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul . 
 The following two years proceeded uneventfully . In January 1898 , Seeadler again returned to Cape Town for an overhaul before being ordered to return to Germany on 3 May . She left Dar es Salaam three days later and arrived in Aden on 31 May . There she met Schwalbe , which was replacing her in East Africa . Seeadler returned to Kiel on 26 June , and she was placed out of service on 9 July for a major overhaul in Danzig . The work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft , and the changes included removing the main mast and cutting down her rigging to a topsail schooner rig . On 3 October 1899 , Seeadler was recommissioned and was ordered to replace her sister Falke on the South Seas Station in German New Guinea . She departed Kiel on 19 October and stopped in Tangiers on 27 – 28 October to force restitution from the Moroccan government for German financial damages . Seeadler then proceeded to Germany 's south @-@ Pacific colonies , arriving on 15 November . 
 = = = Deployment to the Pacific = = = 
 Following her arrival in the Pacific , Seeadler first went to the Admiralty Islands on 18 January 1900 in response to the murder of European businessmen by natives there . Starting on 30 January , she took a cruise to tour the German holdings in the area that lasted for several weeks . Stops included the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands , both of which had been recently purchased from Spain . In May , a cruise to German Samoa followed ; there she met Cormoran . The two ships then toured the islands with the governor of German Samoa , Wilhelm Solf , and the Samoan chief , Mata 'afa Iosefo aboard Seeadler . In July 1900 , following the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China the previous year , Seeadler was sent from the South Seas Station to assist in the Western suppression of the Boxers . She arrived in Tsingtau in the Kiautschou Bay concession and joined the ships of the East Asia Squadron . She spent the following months off Chinese harbors with the armored cruiser Fürst Bismarck and the protected cruiser Hertha . 
 On 24 April 1901 , Seeadler was ordered to steam to the island of Yap in the Carolines to assist the stranded Norddeutscher Lloyd postal steamer SS München . A pair of tugboats had managed to pull the steamer free by the time Seeadler arrived on 3 May , though the cruiser 's crew assisted with repairs to the ship 's damaged hull . Seeadler thereafter returned to East Asia and resumed her patrols of Chinese harbors , though during this period she also visited Japanese harbors as well . These duties lasted until the end of 1902 . During Seeadler 's operations in China , her crew suffered only one casualty from enemy action . On 2 January 1903 , her sister Bussard arrived to take her place in East Asian waters , allowing Seeadler to return to the South Seas Station . Seeadler underwent a periodic overhaul in Uraga , outside Tokyo , Japan from 3 August to 14 September . 
 Following the outbreak of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in February 1904 , Seeadler was recalled to Tsingtau to be prepared for any possible hostilities involving Germany . During this period , Cormoran was replaced by Condor ; the two cruisers were joined by Seeadler 's old consort from East Africa , the survey vessel Möwe . In early 1905 , Seeadler conducted goodwill visits to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , before returning to Tsingtau in April . On 28 June , with the Russo @-@ Japanese War winding down following the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima , Seeadler was detached from the East Asia Squadron , permitting her return to the South Seas Station . While en route to her station area , Seeadler received an order to return to Africa during a stop at Ponape on 20 August . Her presence was necessary there to help put down a major uprising , the Maji Maji Rebellion , that had broken out in July . Seeadler ran aground twice , at Labuan and Singapore on her way to East Africa , but both incidents caused no damage . She arrived in Dar es Salaam on 1 October . 
 = = = Return to East Africa = = = 
 In mid @-@ October , Seeadler sent a landing party ashore at <unk> to protect the coastal telegraph line there . By mid @-@ December , she had returned to Dar es Salaam , before proceeding to Kilwa on 17 January 1906 . The cruiser was back in Dar es Salaam on 24 January . Another overhaul at Cape Town followed from 10 February to 16 March . By this time , the situation in East Africa had calmed , and the light cruiser Thetis , which had also been sent to suppress the Maji @-@ Maji uprising , was sent back to Germany . Seeadler nevertheless remained in the region , and was formally assigned to the East Africa Station in early 1907 . In October 1907 , then @-@ Korvettenkapitän ( Corvette Captain ) Hugo Meurer served as the ship 's commanding officer . He would hold the position until June 1909 
 In 1908 , Seeadler was joined by Bussard on the East Africa Station . From 18 February to 18 March , Seeadler underwent another overhaul at Cape Town . She thereafter proceeded to German South @-@ West Africa , stopping in Walvis Bay and Swakopmund . There , she cruised with the gunboat Panther in March and early April . On 18 April , she was back in Dar es Salaam . Another period of dockyard repairs followed from 12 to 26 September , this time in Bombay . The rest of 1908 continued uneventfully for Seeadler , as did the next few years . The only significant event came in early November 1911 , when Seeadler pulled the Hamburg @-@ Bremen @-@ Afrika <unk> steamer SS Irmgard free after she ran aground off Quelimane . In 1913 , the mayor of Cape Town hosted delegations from Seeadler and the British protected cruiser HMS Hermes . And at the end of December , the princes Leopold and Georg of Bavaria visited Seeadler in Dar es Salaam while on an overseas tour . 
 = = = Later service = = = 
 On 9 January 1914 , Seeadler departed East Africa for the last time , bound for Germany . She had spent nearly thirteen and a half years abroad , the longest uninterrupted period of overseas service of any major German warship . Her replacement , her sister Geier , had not yet arrived but was en route . Seeadler stopped in Aden on 22 January , and arrived in Kiel on 18 March . She was then moved to Danzig and decommissioned . On 6 May 1914 , she was reclassified as a gunboat . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines since she was no longer fit for active service . She was towed to Wilhelmshaven and anchored in the outer roadstead . On 19 April 1917 , her cargo exploded while she was moored in the Jade outside Wilhelmshaven . The explosion destroyed the ship , but there were no casualties ; her wreck was never raised . 
 = Wyangala = 
 Wyangala / <unk> / is a small village in the Lachlan Valley , near the junction of the Abercrombie and Lachlan Rivers , just below the Wyangala Dam wall . It is in the South West Slopes of New South Wales , Australia , and about 320 km ( 200 mi ) west of the state capital , Sydney . 
 The village was named after a Wiradjuri word of unknown meaning . The Wiradjuri people were the original inhabitants of the Lachlan Valley , with campsites along river flats , on open land and by rivers . In 1817 John Oxley and George William Evans were the first Europeans to explore the valley . White settlement commenced several years later in the 1830s , leading to violent clashes between the native population and the settlers . 
 The present @-@ day village was established in 1928 , during the construction of Wyangala Dam . However , in the same area , there was a scattered pioneering settlement known as Wyangala Flats , which was established in the 1840s . This settlement was submerged under water following the completion of Wyangala Dam in 1935 . Although Wyangala grew substantially during periods of dam construction , the population dwindled in the subsequent years . This resulted in the removal of houses and the closure of most businesses , leaving Wyangala with a small primary school , a Catholic church , sports fields and parks , in addition to other facilities . There are no buildings of historical note , as the original purpose of the village was to solely provide utilitarian accommodation for the construction workers . 
 Attractions in the area include Lake Wyangala ( used for power generation , water @-@ sports and fishing activities ) , a nine @-@ hole golf course , walking and mountain bike trails , and the 1 @.@ 37 km ( 0 @.@ 85 mi ) long dam wall itself . Wyangala has a warm and temperate climate with a diverse range of native and exotic plants and animals , including threatened and endangered species . The flora , fauna and village residents occupy a hilly landscape dominated by granite , with large rock outcrops and boulders throughout the entire area . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = European settlement and the Wiradjuri people = = = 
 The Wiradjuri people were the original custodians of the region surrounding Wyangala . These skilled hunter @-@ fisher @-@ gatherers wore possum @-@ skin cloaks and lived along river flats , on open ground and by rivers . They were , and still remain , the largest indigenous group in New South Wales , with tribal lands encompassing the Macquarie , the Lachlan and the Murrumbidgee rivers . 
 Archaeological investigations have identified over 200 Wiradjuri campsites around Wyangala , suggesting the native population in the area was originally high . Campsites were located on gentle hill slopes , on elevated crests and on alluvial / <unk> terraces near the Lachlan River course . 
 The name ' Wyangala ' ( pronounced / <unk> / ) originates from a Wiradjuri word of unknown meaning . However , similar sounding words in the Wiradjuri language indicate it may mean troublesome or bad ( <unk> ) white ( <unk> ) . The village , situated adjacent the Lachlan River , inherited this name , as did the scattered pioneering settlement of Wyangala Flats . 
 On 27 May 1815 , Deputy Surveyor George William Evans was the first European to discover the headwaters of the Lachlan River , naming it in honour of the NSW Governor , Lachlan Macquarie . Two years later Lieutenant John Oxley , with Evans by his side , explored the Lachlan from its junction with the <unk> River to the Great <unk> Swamp , a distance of 1 @,@ 450 km ( 900 mi ) . As Oxley progressed down the Lachlan , he had friendly encounters with the Wiradjuri people , noting that the language they spoke was distinctly different from that used by the indigenous population on the coast . By the time Oxley had reached the <unk> Swamp , he could advance no further due to the presence of ' impassable ' marshland , eventually being forced to abandon the journey and to turn back . Oxley believed he had reached a marshy inland sea , concluding that the interior of Australia was ' uninhabitable ' and unfit for settlement . 
 Despite Oxley 's bleak assessment of the Lachlan Valley , European settlement of the area began several years after the expedition . In 1831 Arthur Rankin and James Sloan , both cattlemen from Bathurst , were the first white settlers to move into the Valley . Encroachment on traditional Wiradjuri lands resulted in violent clashes between the indigenous population and the settlers . In the midst of this ongoing conflict , new land was made available in the Wyangala area by the colonial government . By the 1840s occupation licenses for land at Wyangala Flats were being auctioned from the Bathurst Police Office , and by 1860 country lots at Wyangala were selling from the <unk> Police Office for £ 1 an acre . At this time and until the construction of the 1935 dam , the land at Wyangala was primarily used for wool production . 
 The conflict with the Wiradjuri people lessened by the 1850s , as gold mining and free selection brought new settlers to the area . The unrelenting tide of Europeans overwhelmed the indigenous population , resulting in the occupation of traditional lands , the destruction of sacred sites , and perhaps most damaging of all , the introduction of new diseases . This eventually led to the displacement and the decline of the Wiradjuri people . 
 = = = Gold and bushrangers = = = 
 Gold mining was prevalent in the nearby Mount McDonald area in the late 1800s and early 1900s after reef gold was discovered in 1880 . The quartz reefs were found by Donald McDonald and his party as they were prospecting the mountain ranges around Wyangala . It was mere chance that McDonald happened upon the gold — he had failed to find the precious metal in areas where he was looking . On the day of the discovery , he was returning to his campsite and saw sunlight reflecting off something beneath a tree , this turned out to be the first piece of gold . This eventually led to the discovery of two gold @-@ rich quartz reefs . As news of his discovery spread , miners were drawn to the area and slowly the township of Mount McDonald grew out of the forest . In its prime , the town had 
 some 600 persons living there as well as many people in the surrounding district . A school , at least one ( Catholic ) Church , banks , a general store ... a resident doctor and the inevitable pubs . 
 By the late 1920s , as mining declined , the town faded away . A hamlet of no more than 4 or 5 houses exists where the Mt McDonald township once stood . 
 Although most of the gold mining activity was limited to Mount McDonald , alluvial gold and precious gems were also found along the banks of the Lachlan River at Wyangala in the early 1900s . However , the find was not significant enough to see commercial interest . 
 The discovery of gold in other parts of New South Wales in the years prior to that found at Mount McDonald , led to increased bushranger activity . During the 1860s and 1870s the Lachlan Valley had serious problems with bushrangers , notably gangs led by Frank Gardiner , John Gilbert and Ben Hall , amongst others . Frank Gardiner was one of the most successful bushrangers of the time . His final robbery , which also was to be his greatest haul , occurred in 1862 at <unk> Rocks . In this instance , Gardiner along with Ben Hall , John Gilbert and others , robbed a ' gold escort ' carrying in the range of ₤ 14 @,@ 000 – ₤ 22 @,@ 000 in gold and cash . It was rumored that Gardiner convinced the gang members to bury their share of the gold in a mountain cave near Wyangala . 
 Somewhere on a rock @-@ strewn mountain near the Fish River that empties into the Wyangala Dam , a fortune in stolen gold lies hidden . 
 Gardiner was to give the gang members a signal when it was safe to recover the gold . This was never to happen , as Gardiner was eventually exiled to the United States after being sent to prison . Five years after the heist , an Irishman arrived in New South Wales with a rough map marking the location of the gold , purportedly drawn by Gardiner . Even with this map and years of searching , no trace of the gold was ever found . By the late 1800s improved police efficiency was bringing to a close the era of the bushranger , many of whom had been gaoled , exiled , shot or hanged . This decline in criminal activity coincided with a general push to populate the region , the introduction of telegraph communications , and the development of transport infrastructure .

 By the early 1900s , unreliable river flows were stifling development in the Lachlan Valley . In 1902 the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales recognised the need for water conservation . Recurrent droughts and their associated effects on waterways , were impacting production and causing significant livestock deaths . The Assembly considered options to address the problem , including a proposal to build a reservoir at Wyangala . Previous surveys of the Lachlan Valley had identified Wyangala as being the only suitable location for a large water storage . These early discussions eventually led to the construction of the 1935 dam and the beginnings of present @-@ day Wyangala village . 
 = = = = 1928 – 1935 dam construction = = = = 
 To promote development in the region and to provide a reliable water supply , a dam was needed to regulate the Lachlan river @-@ flow . Following the completion of Burrinjuck Dam on the Murrumbidgee River , work started on Wyangala Dam . The official sod @-@ turning ceremony to mark the beginning of the A £ 1 @.@ 3 million project was performed by the NSW Premier , Sir Thomas Bavin , on 17 December 1928 . The ceremony was not conducted in the usual manner of turning over a sod of soil , it was achieved through the detonation of explosives , removing tonnes of earth and rock . 
 The ' galvanized @-@ iron town of Wyangala ' was established to house the construction workers on land once owned by the Green family — pioneering settlers . By January 1930 Wyangala had become a bustling center with 450 workers and their families in the village , and 74 children attending the new primary school . In the words of a district resident 
 the township is progressing rapidly . The most important buildings are : One post and telegraph office , two stores , two bakers ' shops , one police station , one medical practitioner , one butcher 's shop , one public hall and school , one church , one boarding @-@ house for the men employed at the works , one G.S. bank , one temporary power house , and about 40 private residences ... When the dam is full the water will cover our house . I should think it will be a nice sight when completed . A new road has just been built from Woodstock to the dam . It runs through some wonderful scenery . A 32 @-@ passenger bus runs from Woodstock to the dam tri @-@ weekly . 
 This major undertaking was not without incident . Four men died during the construction of the dam , the first being Leslie Jeffrey , falling into the Lachlan River and drowning in 1929 . His death was followed by that of Walter Watt , a laborer ( 1931 ) , Wickliffe Brien , a <unk> ( 1931 ) and Patrick Lewis , a carpenter ( 1933 ) . 
 The original pioneering settlement and cemetery were submerged under water after the dam was completed in 1935 . 
 = = = = 1961 – 1971 dam upgrade = = = = 
 Wyangala failed to hold the surging floodwaters of the devastating 1952 deluge , which was greater than any water mass it had been designed to withstand . 
 Due to concerns about the original dam capacity to withstand floods and a projected increase in demand for water by the agricultural industry in the region , Wyangala Dam was upgraded and enlarged from 1961 to 1971 . With post @-@ war immigration at its height , the Wyangala population swelled with a multinational workforce . Housing for these workers and their families was provided in temporary demountable dwellings within the village . At this time and also during the 1935 dam build , utilitarian construction prevailed , giving Wyangala no dwellings of historical note . 
 The ten year , A £ 18 million enlargement project increased the storage capacity of the dam threefold . The total surface area of the upgraded reservoir was 5 @,@ 390 ha ( 13 @,@ 300 acres ) , storing 1 @,@ 220 @,@ 000 ML ( 43 @,@ 000 × 10 ^ 6 cu ft ) ( two and a half times the volume of Sydney Harbour ) , within a catchment of 8 @,@ 300 km2 ( 3 @,@ 200 sq mi ) . 
 The opening ceremony for the upgraded dam was scheduled to be performed by Sir Roden Cutler , Governor of NSW on February 8 , 1971 . However , because of heavy rains and road flooding three days prior to the event , the opening was delayed until August 6 , 1971 . Over 2000 guests and officials attended the ceremony . In the months and years following the dam opening , the population of Wyangala decreased significantly ; houses used by workers on the north @-@ west and north @-@ east sides of the village were removed , leaving only the houses seen in the present day village , just below the dam wall . 
 = = = = Post office , school and church = = = = 
 By March 1929 , with dam construction underway ( see above ) , up to 60 letters arrived in the village every day or two , whenever a vehicle made the trip from Cowra to Wyangala . With over 350 workers and their families already in the growing village , the lack of a post office or telegraph office was a great inconvenience to the residents . To alleviate this issue , and to provide the residents with a reliable postal service , Wyangala Dam Post Office was opened on 14 March 1929 . The newly opened post office stamped mail with a Type 2C postmark , which had a full stop after the ‘ W ’ of ‘ N.S.W. ’ . 
 Throughout the subsequent years , the village post office became an integral part of the Wyangala community , providing the expected postal and , at times , banking services ( as an agent for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ) . In the post @-@ telegraph era , a manual telephone exchange was also located within the post office . The postmaster / mistress would run the telephone exchange in conjunction with running the post office . The telephone exchange was automated in the late 1980s and the post office itself was closed in 1998 . 
 Postmasters / mistresses from the 1970s until closure , included : 
 Ken and Peggy Bloomfield ( 1970s ) 
 Rosa and Graham Parr ( 1970s to early 1980s ) 
 Geoff and Vicki Scott ( early to mid 1980s ) 
 Jim and Yvonne Thomas ( mid 1980s to early 1990s ) 
 Peter <unk> ( 1990s ) 
 Wyangala Dam Public School was established not long after the opening of the village post office , in 1929 . At the time it was the district 's second school . Its initial purpose was to provide primary level education for the children of the Dam construction workers . Since establishment , the school has been located at three different sites around the village . The first was near the present @-@ day bowling club , and then near the Vic Roworth Conference Center , and finally during the 1960s , it was moved to its current location on Waugoola Road . Notably , there was an earlier school at Wyangala , which was established 22 years prior . This school ran for six years and closed in 1913 . 
 The number of children attending the school has varied widely over the years , ranging from 70 + in 1930 , to 160 in the 1960s , to 20 + in the early 1980s , to under 10 in the 2000s . 
 The first church in Wyangala was a small building made from timber and corrugated iron , built during the construction of the 1935 dam . As with the village school , it was originally located near the present @-@ day country club , opposite the bowling green . After the dam was completed , the church was purchased by Mr Bert <unk> and transported to a property near Grenfell , where it was re @-@ erected and licensed as an Anglican place of worship on 17 November 1935 , eventually becoming consecrated by Bishop Wylde on 19 August 1953 . 
 The current church , St Vincent 's , was built at the center of the village under the direction of Aub Murray , with interdenominational help . It is of cinder block construction , with an iron roof . The church was officially opened on 19 November 1954 . The day after the opening , as preparations were being made for the first mass , a storm knocked down the rear wall of the church . Rebuilding the wall delayed the first mass until 5 December 1954 . 
 = = = = Murder = = = = 
 The only recorded case of a suspected murder in Wyangala village occurred in July 1935 , when the coroner , Mr H. D. Pulling found the death of Mr John Neilson , a worker at the dam , was caused by a bullet wound to the head . The suspects were named as Mrs Mavis Neilsen ( the victim 's wife ) and Mr Claude Charnock ( a family friend ) . Both suspects claimed the shooting was accidental and self @-@ inflicted . However , evidence from the post mortem , conducted by Dr Mahon of Cowra , and that of another witness , indicated the wound could not be self @-@ inflicted . 
 The suspects were charged and brought to trial in September 1935 , the Crown alleging that they conspired together to kill Mr John Neilson . A short time into the trial , before the prosecution could complete their case , there was a dramatic turn of events when the jury indicated they did not wish to continue , as ' the evidence was not good enough to convict the accused ' . The prosecutor appealed to the jury to wait to hear more witness and police testimony . However , after taking no more than a few seconds to consider the request , the jury members agreed there was no point continuing . Consequently , the judge acquitted both the accused and allowed them to go free .

 The village has a small one @-@ teacher primary school , Wyangala Dam Public School , located on Waugoola Rd . Students come from the nearby rural area , the villages of Wyangala and <unk> Falls , and the Mt McDonald hamlet . The school emphasises environmental education and runs a plant nursery , which provides trees and other flora to the local community . 
 Not far from the school , also on Waugoola Rd , there is a Catholic church , St Vincent 's , which serves as a community hall for village activities , in addition to providing mass services on Saturdays and Sundays . 
 Adjacent the village is a nine @-@ hole golf course , bowling green , tennis courts and cricket field . These facilities are managed by the Wyangala Country Club . 
 In August 2013 Wyangala Cricket Oval was officially renamed Matt Morrison Oval , in honour of Matt Morrison who had died earlier in the year . Development of the Wyangala Cricket Club oval and much of the sponsorship of the Wyangala Golf Club was attributed to him . 
 Sports clubs in Wyangala include the fishing , cricket , golf , bowling and ski clubs . The Fishing Club ( Wyangala <unk> ) has regular events and fishing competitions throughout the year , including inter @-@ club competitions . The Cricket Club competes in a district cricket competition with surrounding towns including , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Grenfell and Cowra teams . The Golf Club , on the other hand , has occasional challenges and events during the year ; and the Bowling Club holds regular casual meetings . The Ski Club has a club house on Main Beach of Wyangala Dam and holds occasional events during the year .

 The Wyangala Country Club , on the hillside opposite the village , has one restaurant , the Country Club Bistro , in addition to having a bar and entertainment facilities . Locals congregate at the club for regular sports club meetings , for discussion forums addressing important village issues , and for other community activities . 
 The village Service Station / store is located at the nearby Wyangala Waters State Park entrance . Diesel , Premium ULP , and Regular ULP are available . The store has a range of fishing and camping supplies , in addition to take away food and other supplies . 
 Wyangala has two conference venues , the first being the Vic Roworth Conference Center within the village , and the other being the community hall in Wyangala Waters State Park . Both have seating capacities for tens of participants . 
 There is one holiday house in the village , near Wyangala Dam Public School . Additional accommodation is found at Wyangala Waters State Park , which contains numerous powered and unpowered camping sites , five bungalows , three cottages , one lodge , seven cabins and <unk> <unk> cabins . 
 As early as the mid 1930s , Wyangala was earmarked as a major tourist attraction and important fishing ground for the Lachlan Valley . The objective of turning Wyangala into a ' national playground ' and resort was the vision of Reg Hailstone , a civic leader of the 1940s and 1950s . Although Wyangala never became a ' tourist resort ' , Hailstone 's vision for a national playground was fulfilled over the proceeding years . 
 Lake Wyangala ( the impounded reservoir within the Dam ) is a significant and popular inland fishing location . The lake contains : 
 Bream 
 Brown and Rainbow Trout 
 Carp 
 Catfish 
 Murray Cod 
 Silver , Golden and Macquarie Perch 
 Through the spring and summer seasons , Lake Wyangala is also utilised for various water sports , such as canoeing , jet @-@ skiing , sailing , swimming and water skiing . There are walking and mountain bike trails through bushland near the village and the State Park , and houseboat hire is available for those seeking the opportunity to explore the lake and catch fish . <unk> located within the Park are currently not operating . <unk> Park , just below the Dam wall , has BBQ facilities for picnics and other gatherings . 
 The 1 @.@ 37 km ( 0 @.@ 85 mi ) long Dam wall is a notable landmark in the Lachlan Valley . It is 85 m ( 279 ft ) high ( as tall as a 25 story building ) , and has a width at its base of 304 m ( 997 ft ) . It can be viewed from various locations around the village and from nearby lookouts , as well as from many kilometers away on <unk> Falls Road . Historically , it was possible to drive across the top of the wall . However , as of June 2014 , vehicle access was closed following the completion of an alternative access road ( Trout Farm Road ) and bridge downstream of the village .

 Wyangala has a diverse range of native and exotic plants and animals , including vulnerable , threatened and endangered species . Flora and fauna found in and around the village include : 
 For major fish species in Lake Wyangala and the Lachlan River , see Attractions . 
 The aforementioned plant and animal species inhabit the geological subdivision known as the Lachlan Fold Belt . It is a zone folded and faulted with Early Silurian Wyangala Granite , which has intruded passively , deformed Ordovician greywackes and <unk> . 
 The local Wyangala landform is characterised by granite rock outcrops and large boulders , scattered throughout a hilly landscape . This contributes greatly to the soils of the area , which are largely formed from the weathering of granite . They include fragile , shallow stony soils on the steep slopes , to naturally acidic and <unk> soils on the lower slopes . These soils are prone to degradation issues , and are susceptible to erosion , nutrient loss and salinity . 
 The climate is warm and temperate in Wyangala , with significant rainfall throughout the year . According to Köppen climate classification it is classified as Cfa . The average annual temperature in Wyangala is 15 @.@ 2 ° C ( 59 @.@ 4 ° F ) , and it receives about 600 mm ( 24 in ) precipitation .

 In 2009 NSW State Water Corporation announced plans to permanently close public road access over Wyangala Dam wall , because of the introduction of ' tough new security measures ' and to comply with occupational health and safety requirements . This new policy was to coincide with a significant upgrade and increase in height of the Dam wall . State Water proposed that alternative access be provided to Wyangala via Mt McDonald Road . This announcement angered locals , as they believed the implications of such a change had not been considered . Concerns included : 
 Access to Wyangala Dam Public School , where children would need to travel 60 km ( 37 mi ) to get to school and back , instead of having a 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) journey 
 Local workers on the ' wrong ' side of the dam wall not being able to make the long detour via Mt McDonald Rd 
 The dangers of the narrow curves and bends on Mt McDonald road 
 Access time and ease of access for emergency services vehicles to Wyangala 
 The possible decline in patronage of Wyangala Waters State Park and Wyangala Country Club ( it is estimated over 75 % of visitors enter Wyangala via the Dam wall road ) 
 The concerns voiced by local citizens , emergency services and local councils resulted in a review of the decision to reroute traffic through Mt McDonald road . Subsequently , a report prepared by Ian Armstrong recommended that a bridge be built across the Lachlan River , downstream of the village to give alternate access to Wyangala . This recommendation was accepted by most locals as the only viable option , even though there was dissent from people affected by the new road and bridge . 
 In June 2014 , the bridge ( Wyangala Bridge ) and new road ( Trout Farm Road ) were completed . As a result , vehicle access across the top of Wyangala Dam wall was closed .

 At the beginning of 2013 Wyangala Waters State Park advertised for expressions of interest to remove the water slides from within the Park . The slides had not been in use due to problems of Park management finding a suitable operator . This unexpected announcement by the Park resulted in an extensive campaign to save the slides . 
 Following the public outcry , the former NSW Deputy Premier , Andrew Stoner , put on hold plans to remove the slides , and moving forward , to appoint a group to review the slides future . This decision was welcomed by locals and the shire mayor , Bill West , who considered the slides " a very important tourist attraction ... and popular part of Cowra Shire " . As of June 2015 , no decision has been made regarding the future of the slides .

 In 2015 , only 5 students were attending Wyangala Dam Public School . This significant decline in numbers has been attributed to the ageing population of the Wyangala community and the lack of any new young families within the village and surrounding area . Consequently , the school is at risk of closure if student numbers do not increase . A meeting to discuss the future of schooling within the village was held on 23 June 2015 with the Director of Public Schools Orange Network , allowing village residents and current and former students to ask questions and to present the case for keeping the school open . Any decision by the NSW Department of Education and Training regarding the schools future is to be decided later in 2015 . However , village residents have indicated they will create a working group to launch a campaign to attract new students to the school .

Part of the NCAA 's Division I , the Hoyas field 23 varsity level sports teams , most of which participate in the Big East Conference , with the exception of the Division I FCS Patriot League in football . In late 2012 , Georgetown and six other Catholic , non @-@ FBS schools announced that they were departing the Big East for a new conference . The rowing and sailing teams also participate in east coast conferences . The men 's basketball team is the school 's most famous and most successful program , but Hoyas have achieved success in a wide range of sports . 
 The team name is derived from the mixed Greek and Latin chant , " Hoya Saxa , " ( meaning " What Rocks " ) which gained popularity at the school in the late nineteenth century . The name Hoyas came into use in the 1920s . Most teams have their athletic facilities on the main campus of Georgetown University . The men 's basketball team plays most of their home games at the Verizon Center in downtown Washington , D.C. and the baseball team plays at Shirley Povich Field in Cabin John , Maryland . Lee Reed took over as the school 's athletic director in April 2010 .

 = = = The word " <unk> " = = = 
 The University admits that the precise origin of the term " Hoya " is unknown . At some point before 1893 , students well @-@ versed in classical languages combined the Greek <unk> or <unk> , meaning " what " or " such " , and the Latin <unk> to form Hoya Saxa ! , or " What Rocks ! " This cheer may either refer to the stalwart defense of the football team , or to the baseball team , which was nicknamed the " Stonewalls " , or to the actual stone wall that surrounds the campus . 
 After World War I , the term " Hoya " was increasingly used on campus , including for the newspaper and the school mascot . In 1920 , students began publishing the campus 's first sports newspaper under the name The Hoya , after successfully petitioning the Dean of the College to use it instead of the proposed name , The Hilltopper . " Hilltoppers " was also a name sometimes used for the sports teams . By the fall of 1928 , the newspaper had taken to referring to the sports teams as the Hoyas . This was influenced by a popular half time show at football games , where the mascot , a dog nicknamed " Hoya , " would entertain fans . 
 Georgetown 's unique team name has caused opponents to mock Georgetown with chants including " What 's a Hoya ? " Harrison High School , located in Kennesaw , Georgia , is the only other institution in the country licensed to share this name . However , Georgetown Preparatory School , which separated from the University in 1927 , uses the name " Little Hoyas " for its sports teams and shares the University 's blue and gray color scheme . 
 = = = Mascot = = = 
 Georgetown 's nickname is The Hoyas , but its mascot is " Jack the Bulldog . " Various breeds of dogs have been used by the sports teams as mascots since the early 1900s . Several notable bull terriers like Sergeant Stubby and " Hoya " were used at football games in the 1920s , as was a Great Dane in the 1940s . However , in 1951 , the school suspended its football program because of the increasing cost of the game financially and academically , which left the school without an official live mascot . 
 In 1964 , the school permitted exhibition football games to resume , and students financed the purchase of a young English bulldog named Royal Jacket , whom they intended to rename " Hoya " , but he only responded to the <unk> " Jack " . This breed was chosen to represent the school because of their " tenacity . " The athletics department subsequently adopted as its logo a drawing of a bulldog sporting a blue and gray freshman beanie . The original Jack retired in 1967 , but the name was carried over to his successors . In 1977 , the university began the tradition of dressing up a student in a blue and gray bulldog costume , replacing the live bulldog , though several dogs periodically joined the costumed mascot during the 1980s and 1990s . 
 In 1999 , Scott R. Pilarz , S.J. , with the help of the Hoya Blue fan club , revived the tradition of an official live bulldog named Jack , to work along with the costumed mascot . When Pilarz left for the University of Scranton in 2003 , taking Jack with him , Georgetown secured a new bulldog puppy and found another Jesuit , Christopher Steck , S.J. , to care for him . The current bulldog is named " John S. Carroll , " a play on the name of Georgetown 's founder , which name allows for continuation of the " Jack the Bulldog " nickname . After Jack injured his leg in 2012 , two Georgetown parents donated a younger bulldog puppy , who the school refers to as " Jack Jr . " 
 = = = Colors = = = 
 Blue and gray are the official colors of Georgetown University and its athletic teams . The colors are an important reminder of the school 's past . During the American Civil War , Prussian blue was commonly used in Union uniforms , while cadet grey was used in Confederate uniforms . These colors were introduced by the rowing team in 1876 , who deemed blue and gray " appropriate colors for the [ Boat ] Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College . " Girls from neighboring Georgetown Visitation sewed the original uniforms together for the team and presented the Boat Club with a blue and gray banner reading " <unk> Euro " ( <unk> than the Wind ) . 
 The basketball and lacrosse teams use gray as their primary color in home jerseys , with blue in away jerseys . White is also frequently used as an accent to these colors , and is actually the main color in the football and baseball teams ' away jerseys and the soccer team 's home jerseys . Campus spirit groups often encourage students to " bleed Hoya blue , " a slogan used on <unk> and bumper stickers sold to fans . Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games , and sellouts are referred to as a " gray out . " Though various shades are used , the primary ones suggested by the school 's identification policy are <unk> 409 and <unk> 282 , which is the same shade as Oxford Blue . 
 = = = Fight song = = = 
 The Georgetown Fight Song , known as " There Goes Old Georgetown " , is actually an amalgamation of three songs , only the oldest of which , 1913 's " The Touchdown Song " , contains the lyric " here goes old Georgetown " . Students combined a version of " The Touchdown Song " with " Cheer for Victory " , written in 1915 , and " The Hoya Song " , written in 1930 , both of which are included in their entirety . The authors of these songs , and of the combined version , are unknown . 
 Georgetown 's fight song is rare among U.S. university fight songs for mentioning other colleges by name . Specifically , it mentions Yale University , Harvard University , Princeton University , College of the Holy Cross , the United States Naval Academy , and Cornell University , who were all rivals of Georgetown in the early to mid @-@ 20th century , and mocks their fight songs . In recent years the Hoyas only play Cornell and Holy Cross regularly ( in football ) , and many of these schools no longer use the fight songs that Georgetown 's song mocks .

Jason King of the Vibe magazine deemed the song as " cloned from the DNA of the raucous ' Crazy in Love ' " while Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine referred to it as " ' Crazy in Love ' lite " . Some reviewers , however , were negative to the parallels drawn between the two songs . Andy Kellman of Allmusic , an online music database , wrote that " [ ' Déjà Vu ' ] " had the audacity to not be as monstrous as ' Crazy in Love ' " , referring to the commercial success the latter experienced in 2003 . The internet @-@ based publication Pitchfork Media 's writer Ryan Dombal claimed that " this time [ Beyoncé ] out @-@ <unk> the beat " . 
 Sasha Frere @-@ Jones of The New Yorker deemed the lyrics as a " perplexing view of memory " , while Chris Richards of The Washington Post characterized Beyoncé as a " love @-@ dazed girlfriend " in the song . Jody Rosen of the Entertainment Weekly referred to " Déjà Vu " as an " oddly flat " choice as a lead single . Jaime Gill of Yahoo ! Music regarded " Déjà Vu " as a good choice for a single but concluded that it does lack " the kind of killer chorus " to suggest that Beyoncé would take one further step " to outright global domination " . On the other hand , Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that Jay @-@ Z shows up " as calmly boastful as ever " in the song but he only makes Beyoncé 's " sound more insecure " . Kelefa Sanneh of the same publication noted that " the refrain doesn 't give Beyoncé a chance really to show off " and further described the song as a " fair @-@ to @-@ middling single from a singer who is the opposite of desperate " .

" 
 According to an MTV News staff report , as of July 2006 , more than two thousand people had signed an online petition addressed to Beyoncé 's record label , Columbia , demanding a reshoot for the video . By the end of August 2006 , 5000 additional fans had signed it . The petition requested the clip to be taped again because it was considered to be " an underwhelming representation of the talent and quality of previous music @-@ video projects of Ms. Beyoncé " .

 = Oxford Castle = 
 Oxford Castle is a large , partly ruined Norman medieval castle on the western side of central Oxford in Oxfordshire , England . Most of the original moated , wooden motte and bailey castle was replaced in stone in the 11th century and played an important role in the conflict of the Anarchy . In the 14th century the military value of the castle diminished and the site became used primarily for county administration and as a prison . 
 Most of the castle was destroyed in the English Civil War and by the 18th century the remaining buildings had become Oxford 's local prison . A new prison complex was built on the site from 1785 onwards and expanded in 1876 ; this became HM Prison Oxford . 
 The prison closed in 1996 and was redeveloped as a hotel . The medieval remains of the castle , including the motte and St George 's Tower and crypt , are Grade I listed buildings and a Scheduled Monument . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 According to the Abingdon Chronicle , Oxford Castle was built by the Norman baron Robert D 'Oyly the elder from 1071 – 73 . D 'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and William the Conqueror granted him extensive lands in Oxfordshire . Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage , and William directed D 'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town . In due course D 'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle . Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 , but not every castle in existence at the time was recorded in the survey . 
 D 'Oyly positioned his castle to the west side of the town , using the natural protection of a stream of the River Thames on the far side of the castle , now called Castle Mill Stream , and diverting the stream to produce a moat . There has been debate as to whether there was an earlier English fortification on the site , but whilst there is archaeological evidence of earlier Anglo @-@ Saxon habitation there is no conclusive evidence of fortification . Oxford Castle was clearly an " urban castle " but it remains uncertain whether local buildings had to be demolished to make room for it . The Domesday Book does not record any demolition , so the land may have already been empty due to the damage caused by the Norman seizure of the town . Alternatively the castle may have been imposed over an existing street front which would have required the demolition of at least several houses . 
 The initial castle was probably a large motte and bailey , copying the plan of the castle that D 'Oyly had already built 12 miles ( 19 km ) away at Wallingford . The motte was originally about 60 feet ( 18 m ) high and 40 feet ( 12 m ) wide , constructed like the bailey from layers of gravel and strengthened with clay facing . There has been debate over the sequencing of the motte and the bailey : it has been suggested that the bailey may have built first , which would make the initial castle design a ringwork rather than a motte and bailey . 
 By the mid @-@ 12th century Oxford Castle had been significantly extended in stone . The first such work was St George 's Tower , built of coral rag stone in 1074 , 30 by 30 feet ( 9 m × 9 m ) at the base and tapering significantly toward the top for stability . This was the tallest of the castle 's towers , possibly because it covered the approach to the old west gate of the city . 
 Inside the walls the tower included a crypt chapel , which may be the site of a previous church . The crypt chapel originally had a nave , chancel and an apsidal sanctuary . It is a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches . In 1074 D 'Oyly and his close friend , Roger d 'Ivry endowed a chapel with a college of priests . At an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George . 
 Early in the 13th century the wooden keep on top of the motte was replaced with a ten @-@ sided stone shell keep , 58 feet ( 18 m ) , closely resembling those of Tonbridge and Arundel Castles . The keep enclosed a number of buildings , leaving an inner courtyard only 22 feet ( 7 m ) across . Within the keep , stairs led 20 feet ( 6 m ) down to an underground 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) wide stone chamber , with an Early English hexagonal vault and a 54 feet ( 16 m ) deep well providing water in the event of siege . 
 = = = Role in the Anarchy and Barons War = = = 
 Robert D 'Oyly the younger , Robert D 'Oyly the elder 's nephew , had inherited the castle by the time of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s . After initially supporting King Stephen , Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda , Stephen 's cousin and rival for the throne , and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle . Stephen responded by marching unexpectedly from Bristol in December , attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle . Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle , called Jew 's Mount and Mount Pelham , on which he placed siege engines , largely for show , and proceeded to wait for Matilda 's supplies to run low over the next three months . Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period , and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time . 
 Matilda responded by escaping from the castle ; the popular version of this has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow , being lowered down the walls with three or four knights , before escaping through Stephen 's lines in the night as the king 's sentries tried to raise the alarm . The chronicler William of Malmesbury , however , suggests Matilda did not descend the walls , but instead escaped from one of the gates . Matilda safely reached Abingdon @-@ on @-@ Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day . Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney for the remainder of the war . At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D 'Oyly , Robert D 'Oyly the younger 's son , in 1154 . 
 In the Barons ' War of 1215 – 17 the castle was attacked again , prompting further improvements in its defences . In 1220 Falkes de Breauté , who controlled many royal castles in the middle of England , demolished the Church of St <unk> to the south @-@ east of the castle and built a moated barbican to further defend the main gate . The remaining wooden buildings were replaced in stone , including the new Round Tower which was built in 1235 . King Henry III turned part of the castle into a prison , specifically for holding troublesome University clerks , and also improved the castle chapel , replacing the older barred windows with stained glass in 1243 and 1246 . Due to the presence of Beaumont Palace to the north of Oxford , however , the castle never became a royal residence . 
 = = = 14th – 17th centuries = = = 
 By 1327 the fortification , particularly the castle gates and the barbican , was in poor condition and £ 800 was estimated to be required for repairs . From the 1350s onwards the castle had little military use and was increasingly allowed to fall into disrepair . The castle became the centre for the administration of the county of Oxford , a jail , and a criminal court . Assizes were held there until 1577 , when plague broke out in what became known as the " Black Assize " : the Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire , two knights , eighty gentlemen and the entire grand jury for the session all died , including Sir Robert D <unk> , a relative of the founder of the castle . Thereafter assizes ceased to be held at the castle . 
 By the 16th century the barbican had been demolished to make way for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing . By 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all around the edge of the bailey wall . In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert <unk> , who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613 . The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years . By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state , with a large crack running down the side of the keep . 
 In 1642 the English Civil War broke out and the Royalists made Oxford their capital . Parliamentary forces successfully besieged Oxford in 1646 and the city was occupied by Colonel Ingoldsby . Ingoldsby improved the fortification of the castle rather than the surrounding town , and in 1649 demolished most of the medieval stonework , replacing it with more modern earth bulwarks and reinforcing the keep with earth works to form a probable gun @-@ platform . In 1652 , in the third English Civil War , the Parliamentary garrison responded to the proximity of Charles II 's forces by pulling down these defences as well and retreating to New College instead , causing great damage to the college in the process . In the event , Oxford saw no fresh fighting ; early in the 18th century , however , the keep was demolished and the top of the motte landscaped to its current form . 
 = = = Role as prison = = = 
 After the Civil War , Oxford Castle served primarily as the local prison . As with other prisons at the time , the owners , in this case Christ Church College , leased the castle to wardens who would profit by charging prisoners for their board and lodging . The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners , such as Mary Blandy in 1752 . For most of the 18th century , the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair . In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times , and criticised its size and quality , including the extent to which vermin infested the prison . Partly as a result of this criticism , it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison . 
 In 1785 the castle was bought by the Oxford County Justices and rebuilding began under the London architect William Blackburn . The wider castle site had already begun to change by the late 18th century , with New Road being built through the bailey and the last parts of the castle moat being filled in to allow the building of the new Oxford Canal terminus . Building the new prison included demolishing the old college attached to St George 's chapel and repositioning part of the crypt in 1794 . The work was completed under Daniel Harris in 1805 . Harris gained a reasonable salary as the new governor and used convict labour from the prison to conduct early archaeological excavations at the castle with the help of the antiquarian Edward King . 
 In the 19th century the site continued to be developed , with various new buildings built including the new County Hall in 1840 – 41 and the Oxfordshire Militia Armoury in 1854 . The prison itself was extended in 1876 , growing to occupy most of the remaining space . In 1888 national prison reforms led to the renaming of the county prison as HM Prison Oxford . 
 = = = Today = = = 
 Since 1954 the two oldest parts of the castle have been Grade I listed buildings : the 11th @-@ century motte with its 13th @-@ century well @-@ chamber , and the 11th @-@ century St George 's tower with its crypt chapel and the 18th @-@ century D @-@ wing and Debtors ' Tower . The site is protected as a Scheduled Monument . 
 The prison was closed in 1996 and the site reverted to Oxfordshire County Council . The Oxford Prison buildings have since been redeveloped as a restaurant and heritage complex , with guided tours of the historic buildings and open courtyards for markets and theatrical performances . The complex includes a hotel in the Malmaison chain , Malmaison Oxford , occupying a large part of the former prison blocks , with cells converted as guest rooms . However , those parts of the prison associated with corporal or capital punishment have been converted to offices rather than being used for guests . The mixed @-@ use heritage project , officially opened on 5 May 2006 , won the <unk> Project of the Year Award 2007 . 
 = Sang Penari = 
 Sang Penari ( The Dancer ) is a 2011 Indonesian film based on the trilogy of novels Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk by Ahmad Tohari and directed by Ifa Isfansyah . Starring Nyoman Oka Antara and Prisia Nasution , it tells the story of a young man and his friendship with his small village 's new ronggeng . 
 The second adaptation of the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk trilogy , Sang Penari required two years of research to better present the historical context , including the 30 September Movement and ensuing anti @-@ communist actions ; these details , censored in the original trilogy by the New Order government , were more explicit than in the novels . Although the film was set and shot in Purwokerto , Central Java , neither of the leads was ethnic Javanese . Nasution , cast in her debut role , is Batak , while Antara is Balinese . 
 Upon its release on 10 November 2011 , Sang Penari was critically praised . Tohari called it a " sublime adaptation of his work " , while <unk> <unk> of the Jakarta Globe described its socio @-@ cultural elements as worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy . At the 2011 Indonesian Film Festival , Sang Penari won four awards , including Best Picture , out of nine nominations . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1953 , two tempeh <unk> makers in Dukuh Paruk , a small hamlet in Banyumas , Central Java , accidentally sell poisoned tempeh , which kills many residents , including the much respected ronggeng ( local traditional dancer ) . The residents of the hamlet begin panicking and rioting , causing the tempeh makers to commit suicide . Their daughter , Srintil , survives and is raised by her grandfather Sakarya ( <unk> Simatupang ) . 
 Ten years later in 1963 , Srintil ( Prisia Nasution ) and Rasus ( Nyoman Oka Antara ) are fast friends . Rasus also has romantic feelings for her . With the hamlet starved and in a depression since the loss of its ronggeng , Sakarya receives a vision that Srintil will become a great ronggeng , capable of saving the hamlet from starvation . He then convinces Srintil to become a ronggeng . She then tries to proves herself to Kartareja ( Slamet Rahardjo ) , the hamlet 's ronggeng caretaker and his wife ( Dewi Irawan ) by dancing at the grave of Ki <unk> , the hamlet 's founder . Her attempt is only successful after Rasus gave her the ronggeng amulet belonged to the late ronggeng of Dukuh Paruk . Seeing this amulet , Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder 's spirit . Meanwhile , Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar ( Lukman Sardi ) arrived in the hamlet and convincing local farmers to join the party , saying that the Communist party are the only ones who can help save the wong <unk> ( underclass ) of Dukuh Paruk and their starved hamlet . 
 After the success of her dance at the grave of Ki <unk> , Srintil is told that she must undergo a ritual before she can truly become a ronggeng , called <unk> <unk> ( literally " opening the veil " ) ; her virginity will be sold to the highest bidder . This upsets Rasus , who tells Srintil that he is not comfortable with her becoming a ronggeng . Srintil says that she will give her virginity to Rasus , and on the day of the <unk> <unk> they have sex in a goat shack ; that evening , Srintil has sex with two other " highest bidders " and becomes a full ronggeng . 
 Devastated , Rasus runs away from the hamlet leaving Srintil broken @-@ hearted , and joins a local army base , where he befriends Sergeant Binsar ( Tio Pakusadewo ) . Binsar teaches him to read and wins Rasus ' trust . Meanwhile , the residents of Dukuh Paruk start to embrace communism under Bakar 's leadership , despite their unawareness of political knowledge . During Rasus ' military time , Dukuh Paruk 's ronggeng troupe which includes Kartareja , Sakarya , Sakum the blind <unk> player , and Srintil becomes increasingly popular and become involved in many rally events organised by the communist party . 
 Two years later , following the failed Communist @-@ led coup d 'état in Jakarta . Rasus is sent by Binsar in operations to clear the presence of Communists in the area . However , when Dukuh Paruk 's turn comes in the massacre , Rasus hurries back , leaving his army comrades to his hamlet to find and save Srintil . He found Dukuh Paruk have been destroyed and void of its inhabitants , leaving only Sakum , the blind <unk> player . His continued effort ended in vain as Rasus arrives in a hidden army concentration camp just as Srintil is taken away by the army and disappear along with the rest of Dukuh Paruk 's residents . 
 Ten years later , Rasus met a street dancer and a blind man in a village close to Dukuh Paruk who resemble Srintil and Sakum . He quickly stops her , giving her the amulet of Dukuh Paruk 's ronggeng which he found in Dukuh Paruk during his search for Srintil ten years ago . The dancer nervously accepts it and leave Rasus , who smiles , signalling his recognition of his love Srintil . The movie ends with the dancer and the blind man dancing away and disappear in the horizon .

 Sang Penari was directed by Ifa Isfansyah . Husband and wife team Wong <unk> and Titi Sjuman were chosen to do the scoring , which they spent a month and a half on ; they later said that work on the film brought them closer together . Shanty Harmayn , who had previously worked on Pasir Berbisik ( Whispering Sands ; 2004 ) , was chosen to produce , while Salman Aristo , known for his scripts for Ayat @-@ Ayat Cinta ( Verses of Love ; 2008 ) and Laskar Pelangi ( Rainbow Warriors ; 2009 ) spearheaded the writing . The screenplay went through twelve drafts and took two years of research . 
 Sang Penari is based on the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk ( Ronggeng of Paruk Hamlet ) by Ahmad Tohari ; it is the second adaptation of the work , after Darah dan Mahkota Ronggeng ( Blood and Crown of a Dancer ) , directed by <unk> Yazid and starring Ray Sahetapy and <unk> Beatrice , in 1983 . The film was shot mostly in Banyumas , Central Java . Director Ifa Isfansyah attempted to cast the lead role of Srintil there , but failed after several months looking . 
 Isfansyah eventually chose a new actress , Prisia Nasution . Balinese actor Nyoman Oka Antara , who had previously played in Ayat @-@ Ayat Cinta ( Verses of Love ; 2008 ) and Perempuan <unk> <unk> ( The Girl With the <unk> Around Her Neck ; 2009 ) , was cast in the leading male role . The film also featured Slamet Rahardjo , Dewi Irawan , Hendro Djarot , Tio Pakusadewo , Lukman Sardi , and Teuku <unk> <unk> in supporting roles ; Happy Salma also had a cameo as a dancer .

 Sang Penari touches on the history of communism in Indonesia , focusing on the nation 's communist party spreading its ideology and the government 's purge of the Communist Party 's members from 1965 – 1966 , which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand . It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings , following Arifin C. Noer 's G30S / PKI ( 1984 ) and Riri Riza 's Gie ( 2005 ) . Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film , the repressive New Order government would have had him shot . 
 Sang Penari features many spoken lines in the <unk> language spoken in the area . It also features several aspects of Indonesian culture , including batik and Javanese music .

It is primarily developed by Atlus and currently owned by Sega . The first entry in the series , Digital Devil Story : Megami Tensei , was released in 1987 and its success spawned one sequel , and later multiple subseries that form part of the Megami Tensei franchise . Aside from role @-@ playing games , the series includes examples of multiple genres such as tactical role @-@ playing , action role @-@ playing , and massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing . The first two titles in the series were published by Bandai Namco ( then Namco ) , but have been almost always published by Atlus in Japan and North America since the release of Shin Megami Tensei . For Europe , Atlus publishes the games through third @-@ party companies . 
 The series was originally based on Digital Devil Story , a science fiction novel series by Aya Nishitani . The series takes its name from the first book 's subtitle . Most Megami Tensei titles are stand @-@ alone entries with their own stories and characters . Recurring elements include plot themes , a story shaped by player choices , and game mechanics , the most notable being the ability to fight using and often recruit creatures ( Demons , Persona ) to aid the player in battle . Elements of multiple philosophies and religions , occultism , cyberpunk and early science fiction have all been incorporated into the series at different times . 
 Most of the early titles have not been localized , originally due to heavy religious influences then taboo in western video games . While not maintaining as high a profile as series such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest , it is highly popular in Japan and maintains a strong following in the west , finding critical and commercial success . Since the release of Shin Megami Tensei : Nocturne in 2003 , the Shin Megami Tensei moniker has been attached to most entries in the west to help with marketing . The series has become well known for its artistic direction , challenging gameplay , and music . The series has equally raised controversy over its mature content , dark themes , and use of Christian religious imagery . Additional media includes manga adaptations , and anime films and TV series .

 Two entries have been released for the Famicom : Digital Devil Story : Megami Tensei in 1987 , and Digital Devil Story : Megami Tensei II in 1990 . The two titles are unrelated to each other in terms of story , and each introduced the basic gameplay and story mechanics that would come to define the series . Two entries were released for the Super Famicom : Shin Megami Tensei in 1992 , and Shin Megami Tensei II in 1994 . 
 After a nine @-@ year gap , Shin Megami Tensei III : Nocturne was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 . Its <unk> Edition director 's cut was released in Japan and North America in 2004 , and in Europe in 2005 . The numeral was dropped for its North American release , and its title changed to Shin Megami Tensei : Lucifer 's Call in Europe . The next entry , Shin Megami Tensei : Strange Journey , was released for the Nintendo DS in 2009 in Japan and 2010 in North America . Shin Megami Tensei IV for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2013 in Japan and North America , and a year later in Europe as a digital @-@ only release . Another game set in the same universe , Shin Megami Tensei IV : Apocalypse , was released for the 3DS in February 2016 in Japan . 
 In addition to the main series , three Shin Megami Tensei spin @-@ off games exist . The first is Shin Megami Tensei If ... , released in the same year and on the same system as Shin Megami Tensei II . The second , Shin Megami Tensei : Nine , was released for the Xbox in 2002 . Originally designed as a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game ( MMORPG ) , it was later split into a dual single @-@ player and multiplayer package , and the single @-@ player version released first . The online version was delayed and eventually cancelled as the developers could not manage the required online capacities using Xbox Live . A true MMORPG , Shin Megami Tensei : Imagine , was released for Microsoft Windows in 2007 in Japan , 2008 in North America , and 2009 in Europe . Western service was terminated in 2014 when Marvelous USA , the game 's then @-@ handlers , shut down their PC Online game department . Its Japanese service is set to end in May 2016 . 
 = = = = Persona = = = = 
 Persona is the largest and most popular spin @-@ off from the Megami Tensei series . The first entry in the series , Megami Ibunroku Persona ( originally released overseas as Revelations : Persona ) was released in 1996 in Japan and North America . The first Persona 2 title , Innocent Sin , was released in 1999 in Japan . The second game , Eternal Punishment , was released in 2000 in Japan and North America . Persona 3 was released in 2006 in Japan , 2007 in North America , and 2008 in Europe . Its sequel , Persona 4 , was released in 2008 in Japan and North America , and in 2009 in Europe . A sixth entry in the series , Persona 5 , is scheduled for release in 2016 in Japan and 2017 in North America . In addition to the main Persona games are spin @-@ offs , so far focused on Persona 3 and 4 : the canon spin @-@ off Persona Q : Shadow of the Labyrinth , two fighting games Persona 4 Arena and its sequel Arena Ultimax , and rhythm game Persona 4 : Dancing All Night . While Persona 3 and 4 used the Shin Megami Tensei moniker , it was dropped for the Persona 4 Arena duology and Persona 4 Golden as it would have made the titles too long to be practical . 
 = = = = Other spin @-@ offs = = = = 
 Aside from Persona , there are other spin @-@ off series covering multiple genres . After the release of Shin Megami Tensei II , Atlus began focusing work on building spin @-@ offs and subseries that would form part of the Megami Tensei franchise . The Devil Summoner subseries began in 1995 with the release of Shin Megami Tensei : Devil Summoner . It was followed by Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers in 1997 , and two prequels set in 1920s Tokyo and revolving around demon summoner Raidou Kuzunoha : Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army and Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon . 
 Shortly after Nocturne 's release , a duology titled Digital Devil Saga ( Digital Devil Saga : Avatar Tuner in Japan ) was created based around similar systems to Nocturne , and was also intended as a more accessible gaming experience . Two tactical role @-@ playing games have been developed by Atlus for the DS under the Devil Survivor moniker : the original Devil Survivor and Devil Survivor 2 . Both have received expanded ports for the 3DS . Other subseries include Last Bible , Devil Children and Majin Tensei . Two notable stand @-@ alone spin @-@ offs are Jack Bros. , and Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯ FE , a crossover with Intelligent Systems ' Fire Emblem series .

 Several titles in the franchise have received anime and manga adaptations : Persona 3 received both a four @-@ part theatrical adaptation ( No. 1 , Spring of Birth , No. 2 , Midsummer Knight 's Dream , No. 3 , Falling Down , No. 4 , Winter of Rebirth ) , and a non @-@ canon spin @-@ off series titled Persona : Trinity Soul . Persona 4 received two adaptations : Persona 4 : The Animation , based on the original game , and Persona 4 : The Golden Animation , based on its expanded PlayStation Vita port . A live @-@ action television series based on the original Devil Summoner was broadcast between 1997 and 1998 . Devil Survivor 2 also received an anime adaptation of the same name , while the Devil Children series received two anime adaptations . Multiple Shin Megami Tensei and Persona titles have received manga and CD drama adaptations . Action figures and merchandise related to Persona have also been produced . 
 = = Common elements = = 
 Despite most games in the series taking place in different continuities , they do share certain elements . One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment , specifically modern @-@ day Tokyo . This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy @-@ based gaming franchises of the time , as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions of it from the past . Shin Megami Tensei II is one of the notable early exceptions , as it is set in a science fiction @-@ styled future despite still including fantasy elements . Two more recent notable departures were Strange Journey , which shifted the focus to Antarctica to portray the threat on a global scale , and Shin Megami Tensei IV , which included a medieval @-@ stage society existing separately from a modern @-@ day Tokyo . 
 The series title translates as " Rebirth of the Goddess " : this has carried over into the current Shin Megami Tensei series , which has been officially translated as " True Goddess <unk> " . The word " <unk> " refers to the cycle of reincarnation that ties into many Megami Tensei stories . The reborn goddess of the title has multiple meanings : it refers to a female character in each game that could be interpreted as the goddess , and is also representative of the drastic changes a location undergoes during a game . The concept of reincarnation was also included in narratives and gameplay mechanics to tie in with these themes . The series ' overarching title has been truncated to " MegaTen " by series fans . Originating in Japan , the abbreviation has become a common term for the series among its fans . 
 = = = Gameplay = = = 
 The gameplay in the series has become notable for its high difficulty , along with several mechanics that have endured through the years . A key element present since the first Megami Tensei is the ability to recruit demons to fight alongside the player in battle , alongside the ability to fuse two different demons together to create a more powerful demon . Equivalents to these systems appear in the later Persona titles . The game 's most recognizable battle system is the Press Turn system , first introduced in Nocturne . The Press Turn System is a turn @-@ based battle mechanic governing both the player party and enemies , where either party are rewarded an extra turn for striking an enemy 's weakness . A Moon Phase System or equivalent , in which phases of the moon or changes in the weather affected the behavior of enemies , is also featured in multiple games . 
 The layout of the first two Megami Tensei games were noticeably different from later games : Megami Tensei used a 3D first @-@ person perspective , while Megami Tensei II used a combination of first @-@ person 3D displays for battle and top @-@ down 2D displays for navigation . The change was suggested by staff members who did not want players getting lost in a large 3D environment . The 2D / first person viewpoint continued until Nocturne , which switched to a third @-@ person perspective . This was done due to a condition similar to car sickness called " 3D sickness " with first person shooters in Japan at the time : the developers wanted something for players to focus on . The first @-@ person perspective was reintroduced in Strange Journey , and incorporated into IV 's battles along with navigable 3D environments . 
 = = = Plots and themes = = = 
 Each title focuses on the extraordinary invading the ordinary world , though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things : Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed to survive in a world ruled over by tyrannical deities , while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people . That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles : while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead 's gender is not out of the question , many staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character . Throughout its lifetime , the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism , various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism , early science fiction , Jungian psychology and archetypes , occultism , punk , and cyberpunk . The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts , enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash . 
 The stories of the core Shin Megami Tensei titles frequently include fighting against a tyrannical God . The method of story @-@ telling in the series can involve traditional use of cutscenes and spoken dialogue ( Persona , Digital Devil Saga ) , or a text @-@ based minimalist approach that places emphasis on atmosphere ( Nocturne ) . A tradition within the core Shin Megami Tensei series is to focus on a single playable character as opposed to a group . A recurring character is Lucifer , the fallen angel who stands against God and is portrayed in multiple forms to represent his omnipotence . Since Megami Tensei II , the series has used a morality @-@ based decision system , where the player 's actions affect the outcome of the story . In Megami Tensei II , the alignments were defined as " Law " ( the forces of God ) and " Chaos " ( the army of Lucifer ) . In future games , an additional " Neutral " route was included where the player could reject both sides . Selected games have been thematically or otherwise linked to a particular alignment . Shin Megami Tensei II , due to events prior to the story , focuses on the " Law " alignment . For Nocturne , all the characters were roughly aligned with " Chaos " , which was done both to bring variety to the series and allow the development team more creative freedom . Shin Megami Tensei IV : Apocalypse is restricted to a " Neutral " alignment while still having multiple endings . The three @-@ tired alignment was used in Strange Journey , and continued into Shin Megami Tensei IV . 
 = = Development and history = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 The Megami Tensei series began life as a media expansion of the Digital Devil Story series , a set of science @-@ fantasy novels written by Aya Nishitani during the 1980s . The series ' creators were Kouji Okada ( credited as Cozy Okada in English ) , Ginichiro Suzuki , and Ginichiro 's son Kazunari . The first book in the Digital Devil Story series , Megami Tensei ( 女神転生 , lit . " Reincarnation of the Goddess " ) , provided the title for the original game , while the game 's story was based on both the first book and the third book Tensei no <unk> ( <unk> , lit . " Demise of the Reincarnation " ) . The game was developed at Atlus and published by Bandai Namco ( then Namco ) . Although they wanted to incorporate as much of the original story as possible , the limited capabilities of the Famicom made this goal nearly impossible . The game proved popular in Japan , and effectively launched the Megami Tensei franchise , with its more ambitious direct sequel following in 1990 . During the development of Shin Megami Tensei , which was driven by the concept of a Super Famicom game with the company 's brand on it , the team slowly decided that they wanted to break the then @-@ current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content . Despite this attitude , the staff considered Shin Megami Tensei to be a remake of Megami Tensei II . In many of these earlier games , staff members at Atlus had cameos . The majority of the Megami Tensei series is developed by Atlus ' R & D Department 1 . Other developers have been involved with the series : these include Multimedia Intelligence Transfer ( Last Bible series ) , Lancarse ( Strange Journey ) , <unk> ( Imagine ) and Nex Entertainment ( Nine ) , and Arc System Works ( Persona 4 Arena ) . 
 Most of the games up to 2003 were handled by Okada , but when he departed to form his own company Gaia , Kazuma Kaneko became the series ' creative director . There are two main writers in the franchise : Shogo Isogai and Ryutaro Ito . Ito first worked on Megami Tensei II , joining the team after development to write the script , along with working with the script and being part of the debug team . Isogai 's first work for the series was the script for Shin Megami Tensei II . The next entry If ... was also written by Ito , and designed as a departure from the grand scale of previous games , instead being set within a cloistered school environment . His final work for the series was the first Devil Summoner . Isogai also worked on Shin Megami Tensei II and If ... , and later worked on multiple Devil Summoner games , Nocturne and Strange Journey . The music for the first five main Megami Tensei titles was composed by Tsukasa Masuko . For Nocturne , Shoji Meguro , who had done work on earlier spin @-@ off titles , was brought in . He later became well known for his work on the Persona titles . 
 = = = Art design = = = 
 The Shin Megami Tensei and Persona art styles have been defined by two different artists : Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima . Kaneko had a long history with the series , having done some work on the original Megami Tensei titles . His first prominent work for the series was on Shin Megami Tensei , who worked on both the sprite art and promotional artwork for the game 's characters and demons . He was also responsible for suggesting many of the game 's darker features , defining the series ' eventual identity . Before designing each demon , Kaneko looks up his chosen subject to get their mythological background , and uses that in their design . Many of Kaneko 's demon designs were influenced by both creatures and deities from world mythology , and monsters from popular culture like Godzilla . Alongside working on Shin Megami Tensei II , If ... and Nocturne , he also did character designs for the first three Persona games . Kaneko 's style has been described as " cold [ and ] stoic " , evolving into that state over time to keep the artwork as close as possible to the in @-@ game render . 
 Soejima 's first work for the series was as part of the digital coloring team for the first Devil Summoner . He later had minor roles in artwork and character design in the first Persona and Soul Hackers . He later did the secondary characters for the Persona 2 duology , and was also part of the team checking over the PlayStation ports of the first three Shin Megami Tensei games , as well as minor work on Nocturne . Soejima was chosen as the lead designer for Persona 3 by Kaneko , as Kaneko wanted the younger staff members to gain experience . Persona 3 proved challenging for Soejima as he needed to refine his drawing style and take the expectations of series fans into account . He would go on to design for Persona 3 FES and Portable , Persona 4 and Persona 5 . Soejima 's drawing style is recognized as being lighter @-@ toned than Kaneko 's work on the Shin Megami Tensei games . 
 Other designers have also worked on the series . For Nine , the developers wanted to have a new style to suit the game 's original vision , so the characters were designed by animator Yasuomi Umetsu . Another designer for the series is Masayuki Doi , who had made a name for himself with the Trauma Center series ; and designed the main characters for Shin Megami Tensei IV . Inspired in his work by Kaneko 's designs , he created the main characters ' clothing to be a blend of Japanese and western fashions while incorporating design elements from the Star Wars series . For the Devil Survivor games , Atlus were aiming to appeal to a wider audience and reinvigorate the Megami Tensei franchise , hiring Suzuhito Yasuda as character designer for this purpose . Some monsters in the second Devil Survivor were designed by manga artist <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 For a long time , the Megami Tensei franchise was not exported to western territories despite there being a recognized market . The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used , which were considered taboo in western game markets , and Nintendo 's strict content guidelines for overseas releases . Later , many of these early works were prevented from coming overseas due to their age , which would have put them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market . Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America 's then @-@ current approval policies . The first title in the franchise to be localized was the action spin @-@ off Jack Bros. ; the first role @-@ playing game in the franchise to receive an overseas release was the first Persona game . This was done to give Atlus ' North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete with the likes of Final Fantasy , Suikoden and Breath of Fire . According to Okada , the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of Persona to make it more acceptable for an overseas audience . Though it managed to establish the franchise overseas , the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience , including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from a Japanese to African @-@ American . The first Persona 2 title , Innocent Sin , needed to be passed over due to shortage of manpower and the fact that development was focused on the second title , Eternal Punishment . 
 Nocturne was the first release in the Shin Megami Tensei series to be released overseas . After the release of Nocturne , Atlus ' overseas branches decided to add the Shin Megami Tensei moniker to future releases within the Megami Tensei franchise to help market the games . Despite many of the original games not bearing the moniker , it ultimately worked in Atlus ' favor as , regardless of title differences , the games chosen for localization were all part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise , and using the core Shin Megami Tensei moniker kept all the titles under a single banner . Before this decision was made , the series was given the localized title Revelations , used for the first Persona and the first Last Bible . Later , changes to titles were made to make them less unwieldy , such as with Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army . Called <unk> Kuzunoha vs. The Super @-@ Powered Army in Japan , the title was altered as it sounded " goofy " in English . By the time Strange Journey was in development , the franchise had a strong presence overseas , so the team created Strange Journey with localization in mind : the two aspects actively linked with this were the game 's setting in Antarctica as opposed to modern @-@ day Japan , and the fact that it was not given a numeral . Starting with Shin Megami Tensei IV , the company decided to actively promote the franchise overseas to North America , Europe and mainland Asia . After 2016 , due to Atlus USA 's merger with Sega of America , Sega took over North American publishing duties , although the Atlus brand remained intact . 
 In general , Atlus publishes Megami Tensei games in Japan and North America , but as they lack a European branch , they publish titles in the region through third @-@ party companies such as Ghostlight and NIS America . Their latest partnership , after their deal with NIS America ended with the publication of Odin Sphere <unk> , was with European publishing firm Deep Silver to publish multiple titles in the region , including Shin Megami Tensei IV : Apocalypse and Persona 5 . Atlus has occasionally published titles digitally in Europe .

 Prior to its popularity in the west , the game was a major franchise in Japan , having sold over 4 million units by 2003 . By November 2014 , the series has sold approximately 13 million packaged units worldwide , with the combined series grouped within the Megami Tensei franchise accounting for 7 million and the Persona series accounting for 6 @.@ 2 million . Megami Tensei is one of Atlus ' best @-@ selling and most important franchises . 
 Japanese website 4Gamer.net referred to the series as one of Japan 's biggest role @-@ playing franchises . UGO Networks writer K. Thor Jensen cited the first Megami Tensei game as the first successful use of cyberpunk aesthetics in video games , saying that the series ' mix of science fiction elements and the occult " create a truly unique fictional cyberpunk world " . Nintendo Power has noted that Atlus always mixes " familiar gameplay " with surprising settings when creating games for the series , citing Persona , with its " modern @-@ day horror stories " and " teams of Japanese high @-@ school kids " , as the perfect example . The editor also added that Strange Journey followed a similar system , calling it a " science @-@ fiction makeover " of the series . In an article about the interaction of Japanese and Western gaming culture , 1UP.com mentioned the Shin Megami Tensei subseries alongside Nippon Ichi Software 's Disgaea series . Kurt Kalata wrote : " [ They ] may not be big sellers , but they 've garnered underground success and attracted thousands of obsessed fans . " GameSpot writer Andrew Vestal referred to the series as the third biggest series in Japan after Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest . IGN 's Matt Coleman mentioned Nocturne in the article " A History of Console RPGs " , referring to its content as " challenging stuff for a genre that used to be all about princess saving and evil cleansing " . 
 Digital Devil Story : Megami Tensei II and Shin Megami Tensei both appeared on Famitsu 's 2006 " Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time " audience poll at No. 58 and No. 59 , respectively . RPGFan 's " Top 20 RPGs of the Past Decade " list was topped by the two Digital Devil Saga games , followed by Persona 3 in second place , while Persona 4 ranked fourth place . Kalata , writing for Gamasutra , referred to Nocturne as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre . GameTrailers cited the Press Turn system as one of the best JRPG battle systems in existence , with particular reference to the version used in Shin Megami Tensei IV . 
 Alongside its critical acclaim , the series has garnered controversy both in Japan and overseas . Amongst the material cited are its demon negotiation mechanic , depictions of suicide and cannibalism , religious criticism , its use and mixture of Christian and occult imagery , political references , depictions of homosexuality , and its sometimes @-@ strange demon designs . Specific examples have been cited by western journalists . The original release of Persona caused concern due to the title 's religious implications . 1UP.com 's 2007 game awards , which ran in the March 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly , Persona 3 was given the " Most controversial game that created no controversy " award : the writers said " Rockstar 's Hot Coffee sex scandal and Bully 's boy @-@ on @-@ boy kissing 's got nothing on this PS2 role @-@ player 's suicide @-@ initiated battles or subplot involving student @-@ teacher dating . " GamesRadar included the series on its list of " Controversies Waiting to Happen " , saying that the lack of public outcry was due to its niche status when compared to other series with similar content . Writing for 1UP.com in a later article , Kalata traced this use of controversial content back to the Digital Devil Story novels , which depicted violence and rape committed by demons , and said that " Such violence is not particularly rare in the land of Japanese animation , but it became even more disturbing in [ Megami Tensei II ] " . 
 = Hurricane Juan = 
 Hurricane Juan was a significant tropical cyclone that heavily damaged Canada in late September 2003 . It was the tenth named storm and the sixth hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season . Juan formed southeast of Bermuda on September 24 from a tropical wave that had tracked across the subtropical Atlantic Ocean . It tracked northward and strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream , reaching Category 2 strength on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale on September 27 . The hurricane peaked in intensity with sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) that same day , losing some strength as it raced over cooler waters toward the coast of Nova Scotia . Juan made landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect in the Halifax Regional Municipality early on September 29 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Juan retained hurricane strength while crossing Nova Scotia from south to north , though it weakened to a tropical storm over Prince Edward Island . It was absorbed by another extratropical low later on September 29 near Anticosti Island in the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence . 
 The hurricane inflicted extensive damage across central Nova Scotia and into Prince Edward Island , with lesser damage east and west of the storm centre . Most of the damage occurred as a result of the intense winds that buffeted the region . Juan 's passage resulted in eight fatalities and over CA $ 300 million ( US $ 200 million ) in damage . It was described as the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893 .
