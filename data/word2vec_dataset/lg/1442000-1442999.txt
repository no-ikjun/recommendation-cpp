 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms , in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing . It can be difficult to confirm , especially early on , since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems . The McDonald criteria , which focus on clinical , laboratory , and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas , is the most commonly used method of diagnosis with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance . While the above criteria allow for a non @-@ invasive diagnosis , some state that the only definitive proof is an autopsy or biopsy where lesions typical of MS are detected . 
 Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease . In those who seek medical attention after only one attack , other testing is needed for the diagnosis . The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging , analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials . Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination ( lesions or plaques ) . Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and , by elimination , demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation . Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system . The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for <unk> bands of IgG on electrophoresis , which are inflammation markers found in 75 – 85 % of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways . These brain responses can be examined using <unk> and sensory @-@ evoked potentials . 
 = = = Clinical course = = = 
 Several phenotypes ( commonly named types ) , or patterns of progression , have been described . <unk> use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course . They are important not only for prognosis but also for treatment decisions . In 1996 , the United States National Multiple Sclerosis Society described four clinical courses . This set of courses was later reviewed by an international panel in 2013 , adding clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) and radiologically isolated syndrome ( RIS ) as phenotypes , but leaving the main structure untouched . 
 relapsing @-@ remitting ( RRMS ) 
 secondary progressive ( SPMS ) 
 primary progressive ( PPMS ) 
 progressive relapsing ( <unk> ) . 
 The relapsing @-@ remitting subtype is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet ( remission ) with no new signs of disease activity . Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems , the latter in about 40 % of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease . This describes the initial course of 80 % of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks , this is sometimes referred to as benign MS , although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term . On the other hand , the term malignant multiple sclerosis is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period . The relapsing @-@ remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) . In CIS , a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination , but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis . 30 to 70 % of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS. 
 Secondary progressive MS occurs in around 65 % of those with initial relapsing @-@ remitting MS , who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission . Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear . The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing @-@ remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19 years . 
 The primary progressive subtype occurs in approximately 10 – 20 % of individuals , with no remission after the initial symptoms . It is characterized by progression of disability from onset , with no , or only occasional and minor , remissions and improvements . The usual age of onset for the primary progressive subtype is later than of the relapsing @-@ remitting subtype . It is similar to the age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing @-@ remitting MS , around 40 years of age . 
 Progressive relapsing MS describes those individuals who , from onset , have a steady neurologic decline but also have clear superimposed attacks . This is the least common of all subtypes . 
 Unusual types of MS have been described ; these include <unk> 's disease , <unk> concentric sclerosis , Schilder 's diffuse sclerosis , and Marburg multiple sclerosis . There is debate on whether they are MS variants or different diseases . Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children , taking more time to reach the progressive stage . Nevertheless , they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do . 
 = = Management = = 
 Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis , several therapies have proven helpful . The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack , preventing new attacks , and preventing disability . As with any medical treatment , medications used in the management of MS have several adverse effects . Alternative treatments are pursued by some people , despite the shortage of supporting evidence . 
 = = = Acute attacks = = = 
 During symptomatic attacks , administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids , such as methylprednisolone , is the usual therapy , with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile . Although , in general , effective in the short term for relieving symptoms , corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long @-@ term recovery . The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis . 
 = = = Disease @-@ modifying treatments = = = 
 = = = = Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis = = = = 
 As of 2016 , nine disease @-@ modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing @-@ remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) including : interferon beta @-@ 1a , interferon beta @-@ 1b , glatiramer acetate , mitoxantrone , natalizumab , fingolimod , teriflunomide , dimethyl fumarate and <unk> . Their cost effectiveness as of 2012 is unclear . In May 2016 the FDA approved daclizumab for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults , with requirements for postmarketing studies and submission of a formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategy . 
 In RRMS they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks . The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first @-@ line treatments and are roughly equivalent , reducing relapses by approximately 30 % . Early @-@ initiated long @-@ term therapy is safe and improves outcomes . Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first @-@ line agents ; however , due to issues of adverse effects is a second @-@ line agent reserved for those who do not respond to other treatments or with severe disease . Mitoxantrone , whose use is limited by severe adverse effects , is a third @-@ line option for those who do not respond to other medications . Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults . The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod , teriflunomide , and dimethyl fumarate , as of 2011 , is not yet entirely clear . 
 = = = = Progressive multiple sclerosis = = = = 
 No treatment has been shown to change the course of primary progressive MS and as of 2011 only one medication , mitoxantrone , has been approved for secondary progressive MS. In this population tentative evidence supports mitoxantrone moderately slowing the progression of the disease and decreasing rates of relapses over two years . 
 = = = = Adverse effects = = = = 
 The disease @-@ modifying treatments have several adverse effects . One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons ( up to 90 % with subcutaneous injections and 33 % with intramuscular injections ) . Over time , a visible dent at the injection site , due to the local destruction of fat tissue , known as <unk> , may develop . Interferons may produce flu @-@ like symptoms ; some people taking glatiramer experience a post @-@ injection reaction with flushing , chest tightness , heart palpitations , and anxiety , which usually lasts less than thirty minutes . More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons , systolic dysfunction ( 12 % ) , infertility , and acute myeloid leukemia ( 0 @.@ 8 % ) from mitoxantrone , and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab ( occurring in 1 in 600 people treated ) . 
 <unk> may give rise to hypertension and slowed heart rate , macular edema , elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels . Tentative evidence supports the short @-@ term safety of teriflunomide , with common side effects including : headaches , fatigue , nausea , hair loss , and limb pain . There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development . Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems . While dimethyl fumarate may lead to a reduction in the white blood cell count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials . 
 = = = Associated symptoms = = = 
 Both medications and <unk> have been shown to improve some symptoms , though neither changes the course of the disease . Some symptoms have a good response to medication , such as an unstable bladder and spasticity , while others are little changed . For neurologic problems , a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life ; however , it is difficult to specify a ' core team ' as many health services may be needed at different points in time . Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level . There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines , though there is good evidence that specific approaches , such as exercise , and psychology therapies , in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective . 
 = = = Alternative treatments = = = 
 Over 50 % of people with MS may use complementary and alternative medicine , although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined . The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent . Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens , vitamin D , relaxation techniques such as yoga , herbal medicine ( including medical cannabis ) , hyperbaric oxygen therapy , self @-@ infection with <unk> , reflexology , and acupuncture . Regarding the characteristics of users , they are more frequently women , have had MS for a longer time , tend to be more disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 The expected future course of the disease depends on the subtype of the disease ; the individual 's sex , age , and initial symptoms ; and the degree of disability the person has . Female sex , relapsing @-@ remitting subtype , optic neuritis or sensory symptoms at onset , few attacks in the initial years and especially early age at onset , are associated with a better course . 
 The average life expectancy is 30 years from the start of the disease , which is 5 to 10 years less than that of unaffected people . Almost 40 % of people with MS reach the seventh decade of life . Nevertheless , two @-@ thirds of the deaths are directly related to the consequences of the disease . Suicide is more common , while infections and other complications are especially dangerous for the more disabled . Although most people lose the ability to walk before death , 90 % are capable of independent walking at 10 years from onset , and 75 % at 15 years . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 MS is the most common autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system . As of 2010 , the number of people with MS was 2 – 2 @.@ 5 million ( approximately 30 per 100 @,@ 000 ) globally , with rates varying widely in different regions . It is estimated to have resulted in 18 @,@ 000 deaths that year . In Africa rates are less than 0 @.@ 5 per 100 @,@ 000 , while they are 2 @.@ 8 per 100 @,@ 000 in South East Asia , 8 @.@ 3 per 100 @,@ 000 in the Americas , and 80 per 100 @,@ 000 in Europe . Rates surpass 200 per 100 @,@ 000 in certain populations of Northern European descent . The number of new cases that develop per year is about 2 @.@ 5 per 100 @,@ 000 . 
 Rates of MS appear to be increasing ; this , however , may be explained simply by better diagnosis . Studies on <unk> and geographical patterns have been common and have led to a number of theories about the cause . 
 MS usually appears in adults in their late twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in childhood and after 50 years of age . The primary progressive subtype is more common in people in their fifties . Similar to many autoimmune disorders , the disease is more common in women , and the trend may be increasing . As of 2008 , globally it is about two times more common in women than in men . In children , it is even more common in females than males , while in people over fifty , it affects males and females almost equally . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Medical discovery = = = 
 Robert Carswell ( 1793 – 1857 ) , a British professor of pathology , and Jean Cruveilhier ( 1791 – 1873 ) , a French professor of pathologic anatomy , described and illustrated many of the disease 's clinical details , but did not identify it as a separate disease . Specifically , Carswell described the injuries he found as " a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy " . Under the microscope , Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard <unk> ( 1836 – 1908 ) noted in 1863 that the inflammation @-@ associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels . 
 The French neurologist Jean @-@ Martin Charcot ( 1825 – 1893 ) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868 . Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations , Charcot called the disease <unk> en plaques . 
 = = = Diagnosis = = = 
 The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868 . He published what now is known as the " Charcot Triad " , consisting in nystagmus , intention tremor , and telegraphic speech ( scanning speech ) Charcot also observed cognition changes , describing his patients as having a " marked <unk> of the memory " and " conceptions that formed slowly " . 
 Diagnosis was based in Charcot triad and clinical observation until Schumacher made the first attempt to standardize criteria in 1965 by introducing some fundamental requirements : Dissemination of the lesions in time ( DIT ) and space ( DIS ) , and that " signs and symptoms cannot be explained better by another disease process " . Both requirements were later inherited by Poser criteria and McDonald criteria , whose 2010 version is currently in use . 
 During the 20th century theories about the cause and pathogenesis were developed and effective treatments began to appear in the 1990s . 
 = = = Historical cases = = = 
 There are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS and lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot . 
 A young woman called <unk> who lived in Iceland around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but , after praying to the saints , recovered them seven days after . Saint <unk> of Schiedam ( 1380 – 1433 ) , a Dutch nun , may be one of the first clearly identifiable people with MS. From the age of 16 until her death at 53 , she had intermittent pain , weakness of the legs , and vision loss — symptoms typical of MS. Both cases have led to the proposal of a " Viking gene " hypothesis for the dissemination of the disease . 
 Augustus Frederick d 'Este ( 1794 – 1848 ) , son of Prince Augustus Frederick , Duke of Sussex and Lady Augusta Murray and the grandson of George III of the United Kingdom , almost certainly had MS. D 'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease . His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846 , although it remained unknown until 1948 . His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss ( amaurosis <unk> ) after the funeral of a friend . During his disease , he developed weakness of the legs , clumsiness of the hands , numbness , dizziness , bladder disturbances , and erectile dysfunction . In 1844 , he began to use a wheelchair . Despite his illness , he kept an optimistic view of life . Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist W. N. P. <unk> , nom @-@ de @-@ plume of Bruce Frederick Cummings ( 1889 – 1919 ) , who maintained a detailed log of his diagnosis and struggle . His diary was published in 1919 as The Journal of a Disappointed Man . 
 = = Research = = 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 There is ongoing research looking for more effective , convenient , and tolerable treatments for relapsing @-@ remitting MS ; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes ; neuroprotection strategies ; and effective symptomatic treatments . 
 During the 2000s and 2010s , there has been approval of several oral drugs that are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use . Several more oral drugs are under investigation , including <unk> and <unk> . <unk> was announced in August 2012 and is in a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones . Similarly , studies aimed to improve the efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies are occurring . This includes the use of new preparations such as the PEGylated version of interferon @-@ β @-@ 1a , which it is hoped may be given at less frequent doses with similar effects . Request for approval of peginterferon beta @-@ 1a is expected during 2013 . 
 Monoclonal antibodies have also raised high levels of interest . <unk> , daclizumab , and <unk> monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab , <unk> and <unk> have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments . Their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects , the most important of which being opportunistic infections . Related to these investigations is the development of a test for JC virus antibodies , which might help to determine who is at greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab . While monoclonal antibodies will probably have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future , it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated with them . 
 Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs . The main rationale for using a number of medications in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms and , therefore , their use is not necessarily exclusive . <unk> , in which one drug improves the effect of another are also possible , but there can also be drawbacks such as the blocking of the action of the other or worsened side @-@ effects . There have been several trials of combined therapy , yet none have shown positive enough results to be considered as a useful treatment for MS. 
 Research on neuroprotection and regenerative treatments , such as stem cell therapy , while of high importance , are in the early stages . Likewise , there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease . Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS . 
 = = = Disease biomarkers = = = 
 While diagnostic criteria are not expected to change in the near future , work to develop biomarkers that help with diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is ongoing . New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti @-@ myelin antibodies , and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid , but none of them has yielded reliably positive results . 
 At the current time , there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis . Several promising approaches have been proposed including : interleukin @-@ 6 , nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase , <unk> , and <unk> @-@ A. Since disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons , the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as <unk> , tau , and N @-@ <unk> are under investigation . Other effects include looking for biomarkers that distinguish between those who will and will not respond to medications . 
 Improvement in neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) carry a promise for better diagnosis and prognosis predictions , although the effect of such improvements in daily medical practice may take several decades . Regarding MRI , there are several techniques that have already shown some usefulness in research settings and could be introduced into clinical practice , such as double @-@ inversion recovery sequences , magnetization transfer , diffusion tensor , and functional magnetic resonance imaging . These techniques are more specific for the disease than existing ones , but still lack some standardization of acquisition protocols and the creation of normative values . There are other techniques under development that include contrast agents capable of measuring levels of peripheral macrophages , inflammation , or neuronal dysfunction , and techniques that measure iron deposition that could serve to determine the role of this feature in MS , or that of cerebral perfusion . Similarly , new PET <unk> might serve as markers of altered processes such as brain inflammation , cortical pathology , apoptosis , or <unk> . <unk> against the <unk> potassium channel may be related to MS. 
 = = = Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency = = = 
 In 2008 , vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves narrowing of the veins draining the brain , which he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ( CCSVI ) . He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study , performed a surgical procedure , later called in the media the " liberation procedure " to correct it , and claimed that 73 % of participants improved . This theory received significant attention in the media and among those with MS , especially in Canada . Concerns have been raised with Zamboni 's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled , and its assumptions about the underlying cause of the disease is not backed by known data . Also , further studies have either not found a similar relationship or found one that is much less strong , raising serious objections to the hypothesis . The " liberation procedure " has been criticized for resulting in serious complications and deaths with unproven benefits . It is , thus , as of 2013 not recommended for the treatment of MS. Additional research investigating the CCSVI hypothesis are under way .

 Baconnaise is a bacon @-@ flavored mayonnaise @-@ based product that is ovo vegetarian and kosher certified . It was created by Justin Esch and Dave Lefkow , founders of J & D 's Foods , in November 2008 , and sold 40 @,@ 000 jars within six months . It was test @-@ marketed in Grand Forks , North Dakota , to determine consumer interest . After being featured on both The Daily Show and The Oprah Winfrey Show , sales of Baconnaise increased significantly , with more than a million jars sold . 
 = = History = = 
 In an interview with ABC News , Esch and Lefkow stated that they came up with the original idea for bacon products and their first invention , Bacon Salt , while making a joke about the subject over a meal at a diner . The money for their startup came from the $ 5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America 's Funniest Home Videos . The idea to make bacon <unk> came from a customer 's request . Together , they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company . 
 Baconnaise has been featured on the The Daily Show with Jon Stewart several times as a repeat joke . In 2009 , Jon Stewart used it in a skit that drew negative attention from Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer 's Leslie Kelly . Stewart commented , " Baconnaise , for people who want to get heart disease but , you know , too lazy to actually make bacon . " In 2010 , Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J & D 's Foods . According to J & D 's Foods , a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made , but it was declined by Comedy Central . Using it as a prop in a later episode , Stewart referred to Baconnaise as " capitalism 's greatest triumph " . 
 Baconnaise was discussed on The Oprah Winfrey Show on April 24 , 2009 , when Esch and Lefkow were interviewed by Winfrey via Skype . After her guests and she ate sandwiches that used the product , she commented , " Vegetarian and kosher ! Thanks Justin and Dave ! Get your own Baconnaise ! " After her endorsement , the traffic on the company website and telephones overwhelmed its systems . Lefkow stated that a year after the show aired over a million jars of <unk> were sold . 
 = = Production = = 
 Esch and Lefkow have stated that they started with just mayonnaise and bacon and worked with chefs to determine how to have mayonnaise that tastes like bacon without having bacon as an ingredient . Lefkow stated that developing and refining the taste of Baconnaise resulted in him having " nothing but bacon and mayonnaise for breakfast for the next six months . " Lefkow refined the taste of Baconnaise by comparing real bacon to the developing product . 
 Baconnaise contains no bacon , artificial flavors , or MSG , but the actual process and ingredients in the product are a trade secret . A complete list of the ingredients includes : soybean oil , water , egg yolk , <unk> acid , yeast extract , stabilizer ( microcrystalline cellulose , modified food starch , <unk> gum , <unk> gum , gum arabic ) , cultured dextrose , salt , sugar , dehydrated garlic , paprika , dehydrated onion , spice , natural smoke flavor , natural flavors , tocopherols , calcium disodium EDTA , and <unk> yeast extract . 
 J & D 's Foods also released a light version of Baconnaise . Marketed as Baconnaise Lite , it contains 30 Cal per serving and less fat than the original Baconnaise . Baconnaise is sold in 15 @-@ oz ( 443 @-@ ml ) plastic jars .

 The product 's marketing test was at Pike Place Market in Seattle , where it sold up to 120 jars a week . The product debuted in October 2008 , at the Seattle Semi Pro Wrestling League in the Heaven 's Night Club . The event featured a costumed fight between mayonnaise and a slab of bacon .

 Will Goldfarb of the website Serious Eats reviewed Baconnaise , stating , " [ it ] works fairly well as a sandwich condiment , but the assertive smokiness can overpower mild ingredients . " Goldfarb recommended it as a sandwich condiment , but cautioned against using it in dips , salad dressings , and fish dishes . The " Baconnaise Lite " was met with a positive review from " Hungry Girl " , though the reviewer noted its name was " a bit of an oxymoron " .

 = Copa Libertadores = 
 The Copa Libertadores de América ( Portuguese : Copa Libertadores da América ) is an annual international club football competition organized by CONMEBOL since 1960 . It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in Latin American football . The tournament is named in honor of the Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for liberators ) , the main leaders of the South American wars of independence , so a literal translation of its name into English would be " Liberators of America Cup " . 
 The tournament is currently sponsored by Bridgestone and is thus known as the Copa Bridgestone Libertadores . The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime . At the beginning , only the champions of the South American leagues participated . In 1966 , the runners @-@ up of the South American leagues began to join . In 1998 , Mexican teams were invited to compete , and have contested regularly since 2000 , when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams . Today at least three clubs per country compete in the tournament , while Argentina and Brazil each have five clubs participating . Traditionally , a group stage has always been used but the number of teams per group has varied several times . 
 In the present format , the tournament consists of six stages , with the first stage taking place in early February . The six surviving teams from the first stage join 26 teams in the second stage , in which there are eight groups consisting of four teams each . The eight group winners and eight runners @-@ up enter the final four stages , better known as the knockout stages , which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August . The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana . 
 Independiente of Argentina are the most successful club in the cup 's history , having won the tournament seven times . Argentine clubs have accumulated the most victories with 23 wins , while Brazil has the largest number of different winning teams , with a total of 10 clubs having won the title . The cup has been won by 24 different clubs , 12 of which have won the title more than once , and won consecutively by six clubs . The defending champions were Argentine side River Plate , who won their third title after beating Tigres <unk> of Mexico . 
 = = History = = 
 The clashes for the Copa Río de La Plata between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay kindled the idea of a continental competition in the 1930s . In 1948 , the South American Championship of Champions ( Spanish : Campeonato <unk> de Campeones ) , the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores , was played and organized by Chilean club Colo @-@ Colo after years of planning and organization . Held in Santiago , it brought together the champions of each nation 's top national leagues . The tournament was won by Vasco da Gama of Brazil . 
 In 1958 , the basis and format of the competition was created by Peñarol 's board leaders . On March 5 , 1959 , at the 24th South American Congress held in Buenos Aires , the competition was approved by the International Affairs Committee . In 1966 , it was named in honor of the heroes of South American liberation , such as José Gervasio Artigas , Bernardo O 'Higgins , José de San Martín , Pedro I , and Simón Bolívar , among others . 
 = = = Beginnings : 1960 – 1969 = = = 
 The first edition of the Copa Libertadores took place in 1960 . Seven teams participated : Bahia of Brazil , Jorge <unk> of Bolivia , Millonarios of Colombia , Olimpia of Paraguay , Peñarol of Uruguay , San Lorenzo of Argentina and Universidad de Chile . All these teams were domestic champions of their respective leagues in 1959 . The first Copa Libertadores match took place on April 19 , 1960 . It was won by Peñarol , who defeated Jorge <unk> 7 – 1 . The first goal in Copa Libertadores history was scored by Carlos Borges of Peñarol . The Uruguayans won the first ever edition , defeating Olimpia in the finals , and successfully defended the title in 1961 . The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition , when the sublime football of a Santos team led by Pelé , considered by some the best club team of all time , earned worldwide admiration . Os <unk> , also known as O <unk> Branco ( the white ballet ) won the title in 1962 defeating defending champions Peñarol in the finals . A year later , O Rei and his compatriot Coutinho demonstrated their skills again in the form of tricks , dribbles , <unk> , and goals including two in the second leg of the final at La <unk> , to subdue Boca Juniors 2 – 1 and retain the trophy . 
 Argentine football finally inscribed their name on the winner 's list in 1964 when Independiente became the champions after disposing of reigning champions Santos and Uruguayan side Nacional in the finals . Independiente successfully defended the title in 1965 ; Peñarol would defeat River Plate in a playoff to win their third title , and Racing would go on to claim the spoils in 1967 . One of the most important moments in the tournament 's early history occurred in 1968 which saw Estudiantes participate for the first time . 
 Estudiantes , a modest neighborhood club and a relatively minor team in Argentina , had an unusual style that prioritized athletic preparation and achieving results at all costs . Led by coach Osvaldo <unk> and a team built around figures such as Carlos <unk> , Oscar <unk> and Juan Ramón Verón , went on to become the first ever <unk> of the competition . The <unk> won their first title in 1968 by defeating Palmeiras . They successfully defended the title in 1969 and 1970 against Nacional and Peñarol , respectively . Although Peñarol was the first club to win three titles , Estudiantes were the first to win three consecutive titles . 
 = = = Argentine decade : 1970 – 1979 = = = 
 The 1970s were dominated by Argentine clubs , with the exception of three seasons . In a rematch of the 1969 finals , Nacional emerged as the champions of the 1971 tournament after overcoming an Estudiantes squad depleted of key players . With two titles already under their belt , Independiente created a winning formula with the likes of Francisco Sa , José Omar Pastoriza , Ricardo <unk> and Daniel Bertoni : pillars of the titles of 1972 , 1973 , 1974 , and 1975 . Independiente 's home stadium , La Doble <unk> , became one of the most dreaded venues for visiting teams to play at . The first of these titles came in 1972 when Independiente came up against Universitario de Deportes of Peru in the finals . Universitario became the first team from the Pacific coast to reach the finals after eliminating Uruguayan giants Peñarol and defending champions Nacional at the semifinal stage . The first leg in Lima ended in a 0 – 0 tie , while the second leg in Avellaneda finished 2 – 1 in favor of the home team . Independiente successfully defended the title a year later against Colo @-@ Colo after winning the playoff match 2 – 1 . Los Diablos Rojos retained the trophy in 1974 after defeating São Paulo 1 – 0 in a hard @-@ fought playoff . In 1975 , Unión Española also failed to dethrone the champions in the finals after losing the playoff 2 – 0 . 
 The reign of Los Diablos Rojos finally ended in 1976 when they were defeated by fellow Argentine club River Plate in the second phase in a dramatic playoff for a place in the finals . However , in the finals River Plate themselves would be beaten by Cruzeiro of Brazil , which was the first victory by a Brazilian club in 13 years . 
 After having the trophy elude them in 1963 at the hands of Pelé 's Santos , Boca Juniors finally managed to appear on the continental football map . Towards the end of the decade , the Xeneizes reached the finals in three consecutive years . The first was in 1977 in which Boca earned their first victory against defending champions Cruzeiro . After both teams won their home legs 1 – 0 , a playoff at a neutral venue was chosen to break the tie . The playoff match finished in a tense 0 – 0 tie and was decided by a penalty shootout . Boca Juniors won the trophy again in 1978 after thumping Deportivo Cali of Colombia 4 – 0 in the second leg of the finals . In the following year , it looked as though Boca Juniors would also achieve a triple championship , only to have Olimpia end their dream after a highly volatile second leg match in Buenos Aires . As in 1963 , Boca Juniors had to watch as the visiting team lifted the Copa Libertadores in their home ground and Olimpia became the first ( and , as of 2015 , only ) Paraguayan team to lift the Copa . 
 = = = Pacific emergence and last Uruguayan triumphs : 1980 – 1989 = = = 
 Nine years after their first triumph , Nacional won their second cup in 1980 after overcoming Internacional . Despite Brazil 's strong status as a football power in South America , 1981 marked only the fourth title won by a Brazilian club . Flamengo , led by stars such as Zico , Júnior , Leandro , <unk> , Nunes , Cláudio <unk> , Tita and <unk> , sparkled as the <unk> 's Golden Generation reached the pinnacle of their careers by beating Cobreloa of Chile . After 16 years of near @-@ perennial failure , Peñarol would go on to win the cup for the fourth time in 1982 after beating the 1981 finalists in consecutive series . First , the <unk> disposed of defending champions Flamengo 1 – 0 in the last match of the second phase at Flamengo 's home ground , the famed Estádio do Maracanã . In the final , they repeated the feat , beating Cobreloa in a decisive second leg match 1 – 0 in Santiago . Grêmio of Porto Alegre made history by defeating Peñarol to become the champion in 1983 . In 1984 , Independiente won their seventh cup , a record that stands today , after defeating title holders Grêmio in a final which included a 1 – 0 win in the first away leg , highlighting Jorge <unk> and a veteran Ricardo <unk> . 
 Another team rose from the Pacific , as had Cobreloa . Colombian club América reached three consecutive finals in 1985 , 1986 and 1987 but like Cobreloa they could not manage to win a single one . In 1985 , Argentinos Juniors , a small club from the neighborhood of La Paternal in Buenos Aires , astonished South America by eliminating holders Independiente in La Doble <unk> 2 – 1 during the last decisive match of the second round , to book a place in the final . Argentinos Juniors went on to win an unprecedented title by beating America de Cali in the play @-@ off match via a penalty shootout . After the frustrations of 1966 and 1976 , River Plate reached a third final in 1986 and were crowned champions for the first time ever after winning both legs of the final series against America de Cali , 2 – 1 at the Estadio Pascual Guerrero and 1 – 0 at Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio <unk> . Peñarol won the Cup again in 1987 after beating America de Cali 2 – 1 in the decisive playoff ; it proved to be their last hurrah in the international scene as Uruguayan football , in general , suffered a great decline at the end of the 1980s . The <unk> fierce rivals , Nacional , also won one last cup in 1988 before falling from the continental limelight . 
 It was not until 1989 that a Pacific team finally broke the dominance of the established Atlantic powers . Atlético Nacional of Medellín won the final series , thus becoming the first team from Colombia to win the tournament . Atletico Nacional faced off against Olimpia losing the first leg in Asunción 2 – 0 . Because Estadio Atanasio Girardot , their home stadium , did not have the minimum capacity CONMEBOL required to host a final , the second leg was played in Bogota 's El <unk> with the match ending 2 – 0 in favor of Atletico Nacional . Having tied the series , Atletico Nacional become that year 's champions after winning a penalty shootout which required four rounds of sudden death . Goalkeeper René <unk> cemented his legendary status with an outstanding performance as he stopped four of the nine Paraguayan kicks and scored one himself . The 1989 edition also had another significant first : it was the first ever time that no club from Argentina , Uruguay , or Brazil managed to reach the final . That trend would continue until 1992 . 
 = = = Renaissance : 1990 – 1999 = = = 
 Having led Olimpia to the 1979 title as manager , Luis Cubilla returned to the club in 1988 . With the legendary goalkeeper Ever Hugo Almeida , Gabriel González , Adriano Samaniego , and star Raul Vicente Amarilla , a rejuvenated <unk> boasted a formidable side that promised a return to the glory days of the late 1970s . After coming up short in 1989 against Atlético Nacional , Olimpia reached the 1990 Copa Libertadores finals after defeating the defending champion in a climactic semifinal series decided on penalties . In the finals , Olimpia defeated Barcelona of Ecuador 3 – 1 in aggregate in a relatively comfortable victory to win their second title . Olimpia reached the 1991 Copa Libertadores finals , once again , defeating Atlético Nacional in the semifinals and facing Colo @-@ Colo of Chile in the final . Led by Yugoslavian coach Mirko Jozić , the Chilean squad beat the defending champion 3 – 0 . The defeat brought Olimpia 's second golden era to a close . 
 In 1992 , São Paulo rose from being a mere great in Brazil to become an international powerhouse . Manager Telê Santana turned to the Paulistas ' youth and instilled his style of quick , cheerful , and decisive football . Led by stars such as <unk> , Müller , <unk> , Cafu , Palhinha , São Paulo beat Newell 's Old Boys of Argentina to begin a dynasty . In 1993 São Paulo successfully defended the title by thumping Universidad Católica of Chile in the finals . The Brazilian side became the first club since Boca Juniors in 1978 to win 2 consecutive Copa Libertadores . Like Boca Juniors , however , they would reach another final in 1994 only to lose the title to Vélez Sársfield of Argentina in a penalty shoot @-@ out . 
 With a highly @-@ compact tactical lineup and the goals of the formidable duo Jardel and Paulo Nunes , Grêmio won the coveted trophy again in 1995 after beating an Atlético Nacional led , once again , by the iconic figure of René <unk> . Jardel finished the season as top scorer with 12 goals . The team coached by Luiz Felipe Scolari was led by defender ( and captain ) <unk> and the skilful midfielder <unk> . In the 1996 season , figures such as Hernán Crespo , Matías <unk> and Enzo <unk> helped River Plate secure its second title after defeating América de Cali in a rematch of the 1986 final . 
 The Copa Libertadores stayed on Brazilian soil for the remainder of the 1990s as Cruzeiro , Vasco da Gama and Palmeiras took the spoils . The cup of 1997 pitted Cruzeiro against Peruvian club Sporting Cristal . The key breakthrough came in the second leg of the final when Cruzeiro broke the deadlock with just under 15 minutes left in a match attended by over 106 @,@ 000 spectators in the Mineirão . Vasco da Gama defeated Barcelona SC with ease to record their first title in 1998 . The decade ended on a high note when Palmeiras and Deportivo Cali , both runners @-@ up in the competition before , vied to become winners for the first time in 1999 . The final was a dramatic back @-@ and @-@ forth match that went into penalties . Luiz Felipe Scolari managed to lead yet another club to victory as the <unk> won 4 – 3 in São Paulo . 
 This decade proved to be a major turning point in the history of the competition as the Copa Libertadores went through a great deal of growth and change . Having long been dominated by teams from Argentina , Brazil began to overshadow their neighbors as their clubs reached eight finals and won six titles in the 1990s . 
 From 1998 onwards , the Copa Libertadores was sponsored by Toyota and became known as the Copa Toyota Libertadores . That same year , Mexican clubs , although affiliated to CONCACAF , started taking part in the competition thanks to quotas obtained from the Pre @-@ Libertadores which pitted Mexican and Venezuelan clubs against each other for two slots in the group stage . The tournament was expanded to 36 teams and economic incentives were introduced by an agreement between CONMEBOL and Toyota Motor Corporation . All teams that advanced to the second stage of the tournament received $ 25 @,@ 000 for their participation . 
 = = = Decade of <unk> : 2000 – 2009 = = = 
 During the 2000 Copa Libertadores , Boca Juniors returned to the top of the continent and raised the Copa Libertadores again after 22 years . Led by Carlos Bianchi , the <unk> , along with outstanding players like Mauricio Serna , Jorge Bermúdez , Óscar Córdoba , Juan Roman Riquelme , and Martín Palermo , among others , revitalized the club to establish it among the world 's best . The Xeneizes started this legacy by defeating defending champion Palmeiras in the final series . Boca Juniors won the 2001 edition after , once again , defeating Palmeiras in the semifinals and Cruz Azul in the final series to successfully defend the trophy . Cruz Azul became the first ever Mexican club to reach the final after great performances against River Plate and an inspired Rosario Central . Like their predecessors from the late 1970s however , Boca Juniors would fall short of winning three consecutive titles . As with Juan Carlos Lorenzo 's men , the Xeneizes became frustrated as they were eliminated by Olimpia , this time during the quarterfinals . Led by World Cup winner @-@ turned manager Nery <unk> , Olimpia would overcome Grêmio ( after some controversy ) and surprise finalists São Caetano . Despite this triumph , Olimpia did not create the winning mystique of its past golden generations and bowed out in the round of 16 the following season , after being routed by Grêmio 6 – 2 , avenging their controversial loss from the year before . 
 The 2003 tournament became an exceptional show as many teams such as América de Cali , River Plate , Grêmio , Cobreloa , and Racing , among others , brought their best sides in generations and unexpected teams such as Independiente Medellín and <unk> became revelations in what was , arguably , the best Copa Libertadores in history . The biggest news of the competition was previous champion Santos . Qualifying to the tournament as Brazilian champion , coached by Emerson Leão and containing marvelous figures such as Renato , Alex , Léo , Ricardo Oliveira , Diego , Robinho , and Elano , the <unk> became a symbol of entertaining and cheerful football that resembled Pelé 's generation of the 1960s . Boca Juniors once again found talent in their ranks to fill the gap left by the very successful group of 2000 – 2001 ( with upcoming stars Rolando <unk> , Roberto <unk> and Carlos Tevez ) . Boca Juniors and Santos would eventually meet in a rematch of the 1963 final ; Boca avenged the 1963 loss by defeating Santos in both legs of the final . Carlos Bianchi won the Cup for a fourth time and became the most successful manager in the competition 's history and Boca Juniors hailed themselves <unk> . Boca reached their fourth final in five tournaments in 2004 but were beaten by surprise @-@ outfit Once Caldas of Colombia , ending Boca 's dream generation . Once Caldas , employing a conservative and defensive style of football , became the second Colombian side to win the competition . 
 <unk> their semifinal exit in 2004 , São Paulo made an outstanding comeback in 2005 to contest the final with Atlético Paranaense . This became the first ever Copa Libertadores finals to feature two teams from the same football association ; The Tricolor won their third crown after thrashing Atlético Paranaense in the final leg . The 2006 final was also an all @-@ Brazilian affair , with defending champions São Paulo lining up against Internacional . Led by team captain <unk> , the Colorados beat São Paulo 2 – 1 at Estádio do Morumbi and held the defending champions at a 2 – 2 draw at home in Porto Alegre as Internacional won their first ever title . Internacional 's arch @-@ rivals , Grêmio , surprised many by reaching the 2007 final with a relatively young squad . However , it was not to be as Boca Juniors , reinforced by aging but still @-@ capable players , came away with the trophy to win their sixth title . 
 In 2008 the tournament severed its relationship with Toyota . Grupo Santander , one of the largest banks in the world , became the sponsor of the Copa Libertadores , and thus the official name changed to Copa Santander Libertadores . In that season , LDU Quito became the first team from Ecuador to win the Copa Libertadores after defeating Fluminense 3 – 1 on penalties . Goalkeeper Jose Francisco <unk> played a key role , saving three penalties in the final shootout in what is considered one of the best ever final series in the competition 's history . It was also the highest @-@ scoring final in the history of the tournament . The biggest resurgence of the decade happened in the 50th edition of the Copa Libertadores and it was won by a former power that has reinvented itself . Estudiantes de La Plata , led by Juan Sebastián Verón , won their fourth title 39 long years after the successful generation of the 1960s ( led by Juan Sebastián 's father , Juan Ramón ) . The <unk> managed to emulate their predecessors by defeating Cruzeiro 2 – 1 on the return leg in Belo Horizonte .

 In 2010 , a spell of the competition only being won by Brazilian clubs for four years began with Internacional defeating Guadalajara . In 2011 , Santos won their third Copa , overcoming Peñarol by 2 – 1 in the final . In 2012 , Corinthians won the tournament undefeated , beating Boca Juniors 2 – 0 in the final . It was Corinthians ' first title . In 2013 , Atlético Mineiro needed to beat Olimpia 2 – 0 in the second leg to take the match to penalties and did so ; Victor , the goalkeeper , performed spectacularly and helped secure the title for the club . It was Atlético Mineiro 's first title .

 The Brazilian spell ended with San Lorenzo 's first title , beating Nacional of Paraguay in the finals . But another trend was born , as once again a new champion was crowned , for the third consecutive year . San Lorenzo 's victory was then followed by another Argentine club 's victory , River Plate , winning its third title on 2015 . 
 = = Format = = 
 = = = Qualification = = = 
 Most teams qualify for the Copa Libertadores by winning half @-@ year tournaments called the Apertura and Clausura tournaments or by finishing among the top teams in their championship . The countries that use this format are Argentina , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , Paraguay and Venezuela . Peru and Ecuador have developed new formats for qualification to the Copa Libertadores involving several stages . Brazil is the only South American league to use a European league format instead of the Apertura and Clausura format . However , one berth for the Copa Libertadores can be won by winning the Copa do Brasil . 
 Peru , Uruguay and Mexico formerly used a second tournament to decide qualification for the Libertadores ( the " Liguilla Pre @-@ Libertadores " between 1992 and 1997 , the " Liguilla Pre @-@ Libertadores de América " since 1974 to 2009 , and the <unk> from 2004 to 2010 , respectively ) . Chile still uses a competition to determine a Copa Libertadores participant , the " Liguilla para Copa Libertadores " . Argentina used an analogous method only once in 1992 . Since 2011 , the winner of the Copa Sudamericana has qualified automatically for the following Copa Libertadores . 
 The first , second and final stages of the competition are currently contested by the following : 
 The winners of the previous season 's Copa Libertadores are given an additional entry if they do not qualify for the tournament through their domestic performance ; however , if the title holders qualify for the tournament through their domestic performance , an additional entry is granted to the next eligible team , " replacing " the title holder . 
 If the winners of the Copa Sudamericana do not qualify for the tournament through their domestic performance , this entry will come at the expense of the last @-@ placed team of their association . 
 = = = Rules = = = 
 Unlike most other competitions around the world , the Copa Libertadores historically did not use extra time , an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw , or away goals , a method of breaking ties in football and other sports when teams play each other twice , once at each team 's home ground , to decide a tie that was level on aggregate . From 1960 to 1987 , two @-@ legged ties were decided on points ( teams would be awarded 2 points for a win , 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss ) , without taking goal difference into consideration . If both teams were level on points after two legs , a third match would be played at a neutral venue . Goal difference would only come into play if the third match was drawn . If the third match did not produce an immediate winner , a penalty shootout was used to determine a winner . 
 From 1988 onwards , two @-@ legged ties were decided on points , followed by goal difference , with an immediate penalty shootout if the tie was level on aggregate after full @-@ time in the second leg . Starting with the 2005 season , CONMEBOL began to use the away goals rule . In 2008 , the finals became an exception to the away goals rule and employed extra time . From 1995 onwards , the " Three points for a win " standard , a system adopted by FIFA in 1995 that places additional value on wins , was adopted in CONMEBOL , with teams now earning 3 points for a win , 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss . 
 = = = Tournament = = = 
 The current tournament features 38 clubs competing over a six- to eight @-@ month period . There are three stages : the first stage , the second stage and the knockout stage . 
 The first stage involves 12 clubs in a series of two @-@ legged knockout ties . The six survivors join 26 clubs in the second stage , in which they are divided into eight groups of four . The teams in each group play in a double round @-@ robin format , with each team playing home and away games against every other team in their group . The top two teams from each group are then drawn into the knockout stage , which consists of two @-@ legged knockout ties . From that point , the competition proceeds with two @-@ legged knockout ties to quarterfinals , semifinals , and the finals . Between 1960 and 1987 the previous winners did not enter the competition until the semifinal stage , making it much easier to retain the cup . 
 Between 1960 and 2004 , the winner of the tournament participated for the now @-@ defunct Intercontinental Cup or ( after 1980 ) Toyota Cup , a football competition endorsed by UEFA and CONMEBOL , contested against the winners of the European Cup ( since renamed the UEFA Champions League ) Since 2004 , the winner has played in the Club World Cup , an international competition contested by the champion clubs from all six continental confederations . It is organized by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body . Because Europe and South America are considered the strongest centers of the sport , the champions of those continents enter the tournament at the semifinal stage . The winning team also qualifies to play in the Recopa Sudamericana , a two @-@ legged final series against the winners of the Copa Sudamericana .

 The tournament shares its name with the trophy , also called the Copa Libertadores or simply la Copa , which is awarded to the Copa Libertadores winner . It was designed by goldsmith Alberto de Gasperi , an Italian @-@ born emigrant to Peru , in <unk> Jewelry in Lima at the behest of CONMEBOL . The top of the laurel is made of sterling silver , with the exception of the football player at the top ( which is made of bronze with a silver coating ) . 
 The pedestal , which contains badges from every winner of the competition , is made of hardwood plywood . The badges show the season , the full name of the winning club , and the city and nation from which the champions hail . To the left of that information is the club logo . Any club which wins three consecutive tournaments has the right to keep the trophy . Today , the current trophy is the third in the history of the competition . 
 Two clubs have kept the actual trophy after three consecutive wins : 
 Estudiantes after their third consecutive win in 1970 . They won a fourth in 2009 . 
 Independiente after their third consecutive win , and fifth overall , in 1974 . They have since won it twice more , in 1975 and 1984 .

 The Copa Libertadores occupies an important space in South American culture . The folklore , fanfare , and organization of many competitions around the world owe its aspects to the Libertadores . 
 = = = The " Sueño Libertador " = = = 
 The Sueño Libertador is a promotional Spanish phrase used in the context of winning or attempting to win the Copa Libertadores . Thus , when a team gets eliminated from the competition , it is said that the team has awakened from the liberator dream . The project normally starts after the club win one 's national league ( which grants them the right to compete in the following year 's Copa Libertadores ) . 
 It is common for clubs to spend large sums of money to win the Copa Libertadores . In 1998 for example , Vasco da Gama spent $ 10 million to win the competition , and in 1998 , Palmeiras , managed by Luiz Felipe Scolari , brought Júnior Baiano among other players , winning the 1999 Copa Libertadores . The tournament is highly regarded among its participants . In 2010 , players from Guadalajara stated that they would rather play in the Copa Libertadores final than appear in a friendly against Spain , then reigning world champions , and dispute their own national league . Similarly , after their triumph in the 2010 Copa do Brasil , several Santos players made it known that they wished to stay at the club and participate in the 2011 Copa Libertadores , despite having multimillion @-@ dollar contracts lined up for them at clubs participating in the UEFA Champions League , such as Chelsea of England and Lyon of France . 
 Former Boca Juniors goalkeeper Óscar Córdoba has stated that the Copa Libertadores was the most prestigious trophy he won in his career ( above the Argentine league , Intercontinental Cup , etc . ) Deco , winner of two UEFA Champions League medals with Porto and Barcelona 2004 and 2006 respectively , stated he would exchange those two victories for a Copa Libertadores triumph . 
 = = = ' La Copa se mira y no se <unk> ' = = = 
 Since its inception in 1960 , the Copa Libertadores had predominantly been won by clubs from nations with an Atlantic coast : Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay . Olimpia of Paraguay became the first team outside of those nations to win the Copa Libertadores when they triumphed in 1979 . 
 The first club from a country with a Pacific coast to reach a final was Universitario of Lima , Peru , who lost in 1972 against Independiente of Argentina . The following year , Independiente defeated Colo @-@ Colo of Chile , another Pacific team , creating the myth that the trophy would never go to the west , giving birth to the saying , " La Copa se mira y no se <unk> " ( Spanish : The Cup is seen but not touched ) . Unión Española became the third Pacific team to reach the final in 1975 , although they also lost to Independiente . Atletico Nacional of Medellín , Colombia , won the Copa Libertadores in 1989 , becoming the first nation with a Pacific coastline to win the tournament , although Medellín is the capital of the Antioquia Department , whose coastline is entirely on the Atlantic via the Caribbean Sea . In 1990 and 1998 Barcelona Sporting Club , of Ecuador also made it to final but lost both finals to Olimpia and Vasco da Gama respectively . 
 Other clubs from nations with Pacific coastlines to have won the competition are Colo @-@ Colo of Chile in 1991 , Once Caldas of Colombia in 2004 , and LDU Quito of Ecuador in 2008 . 
 = = Sponsorship = = 
 Like the FIFA World Cup , nowadays the Copa Libertadores is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations . However , unlike the World Cup , the competition has a single , main sponsor for naming rights ; it is currently primarily sponsored by Bridgestone Corporation . This sponsorship deal for naming rights is for a period of 5 years and began with the 2012 edition . Thus , the competition is known officially as the ' " Copa Bridgestone Libertadores ' " . 
 The first major sponsor was Toyota Motor Corporation , who signed a 10 @-@ year contract with CONMEBOL in 1997 . The second major sponsor was Banco Santander , who signed a 5 @-@ year contract with CONMEBOL in 2008 . 
 Many secondary sponsors have invested in the tournament as well . Nike supplies the official match ball , as they do for all other CONMEBOL competitions . Konami 's Pro Evolution Soccer is also a secondary sponsor as the official Copa Libertadores video game . This was the first video game to feature the competition . Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising , even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Copa Libertadores . 
 The tournament 's current secondary sponsors and brands advertised ( in italic ) are : 
 = = Ambassador = = 
 Pelé , regarded by many football historians , former players and fans to be the best footballer in the game 's history , is the ambassador of the Copa Libertadores , having won the competition with Santos twice . In 1999 , he was voted as the Football Player of the Century by the IFFHS International Federation of Football History and Statistics . In the same year , French weekly magazine France @-@ Football consulted their former " Ballon D 'Or " winners to elect the Football Player of the Century . Pelé came in first place . In 1999 the International Olympic Committee named Pelé the " Athlete of the Century " . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 The tournament attracts television audiences beyond South America and Spain . Matches are broadcast in over 135 countries , with commentary in more than 30 languages , and thus the Copa is often considered as one of the most watched sports events on TV ; Fox Sports en Latinoamérica , for example , reaches more than 25 million households in the American continent alone . The 2009 edition saw over 1 billion television spectators in total tune in for the competition . <unk> y <unk> is a secondary sponsor that sponsors the television broadcasts of the Copa Libertadores . Setanta Sports Australia broadcasts live Copa Libertadores matches in Australia . 
 = = Match ball = = 
 The current match ball for the Copa Libertadores is the Total 90 <unk> Libertadores , manufactured by Nike . It is one of the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL , replacing the Mercurial <unk> Hi @-@ Vis in 2009 . The ball , approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g , has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster , farther , and more accurately . According to Nike , the ball 's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball . The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch , and the 6 @-@ wing carbon @-@ latex air chamber improves acceleration . 
 Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer ; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup . Its support material of cross @-@ linked nitrogen @-@ expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape . Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability . The asymmetrical high @-@ contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal , allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball . 
 = = Official anthem = = 
 The official anthem of the Copa Libertadores is a section of Ludwig van Beethoven 's Symphony No. 9 in D minor , Op. 125 " Choral " . The famous choral finale is Beethoven 's musical representation of Universal Brotherhood . The piece is a non @-@ literal adaptation of An die Freude ( English : Ode to Joy ) by Friedrich Schiller , who Beethoven admired . The anthem 's chorus is played before the beginning and the end of television broadcasts of the matches in the Copa Libertadores . The piece is also played during the draw of teams at the beginning of each edition . It is also played during the awarding ceremony .

It has four hardpoints mounted on stub @-@ wing pylons , typically carrying a mixture of AGM @-@ 114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods . The AH @-@ 64 has a large amount of systems redundancy to improve combat survivability . 
 The Apache originally started as the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army 's Advanced Attack Helicopter program to replace the AH @-@ 1 Cobra . The prototype YAH @-@ 64 was first flown on 30 September 1975 . The U.S. Army selected the YAH @-@ 64 over the Bell YAH @-@ 63 in 1976 , and later approved full production in 1982 . After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984 , McDonnell Douglas continued AH @-@ 64 production and development . The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986 . The first production AH @-@ 64D Apache Longbow , an upgraded Apache variant , was delivered to the Army in March 1997 . Production has been continued by Boeing Defense , Space & Security ; over 2 @,@ 000 AH @-@ 64s have been produced to date . 
 The U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH @-@ 64 ; it has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations , including Greece , Japan , Israel , the Netherlands , Singapore , and the United Arab Emirates ; as well as being produced under license in the United Kingdom as the AgustaWestland Apache .

To this end , the U.S. Army issued a Request For Proposals ( RFP ) for an Advanced Attack Helicopter ( AAH ) on 15 November 1972 .

 Proposals were submitted by Bell , Boeing Vertol / Grumman team , Hughes , Lockheed , and Sikorsky . In July 1973 , the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft 's <unk> Aircraft Division ( later Hughes Helicopters ) . This began the phase 1 of the competition . Each company built prototype helicopters and went through a flight test program . Hughes ' Model 77 / YAH @-@ 64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975 , while Bell 's Model 409 / YAH @-@ 63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975 . After evaluating the test results , the Army selected Hughes ' YAH @-@ 64A over Bell 's YAH @-@ 63A in 1976 . Reasons for selecting the YAH @-@ 64A included its more damage tolerant four @-@ blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH @-@ 63 's tricycle landing gear arrangement . 
 The AH @-@ 64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program under which three pre @-@ production AH @-@ 64s would be built , additionally , the two YAH @-@ 64A flight prototypes and the ground test unit were upgraded to the same standard . Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time , including the laser @-@ guided AGM @-@ 114 Hellfire missile . Development of the Hellfire missile had begun in 1974 , originally known by the name of Helicopter Launched , Fire and Forget Missile ( ' Hellfire ' being a shortened acronym ) , for the purpose of arming helicopter platforms with an effective anti @-@ tank missile .

 In 1981 , three pre @-@ production AH @-@ 64As were handed over to the U.S. Army for Operational Test II . The Army testing was successful , but afterward it was decided to upgrade to the more powerful T700 @-@ GE @-@ 701 version of engine , rated at 1 @,@ 690 shp ( 1 @,@ 260 kW ) . The AH @-@ 64 was named the Apache in late 1981 , keeping with the Army 's traditional use of American Indian tribal names for its helicopters and it was approved for full @-@ scale production in 1982 . In 1983 , the first production helicopter was rolled out at Hughes Helicopter 's facility at Mesa , Arizona . Hughes Helicopters was purchased by McDonnell Douglas for $ 470 million in 1984 . The helicopter unit later became part of The Boeing Company with the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in August 1997 . In 1986 , the incremental or flyaway cost for the AH @-@ 64A was $ 7M and the average unit cost was approximately $ <unk> based on total costs . 
 During the 1980s , McDonnell Douglas studied an AH @-@ 64B , featuring an updated cockpit , new fire control system and other upgrades . In 1988 , funding was approved for a multi @-@ stage upgrade program to improve sensor and weapon systems . Technological advance led to the program 's cancellation in favor of more ambitious changes . In August 1990 , development of the AH @-@ 64D Apache Longbow was approved by the Defense Acquisition Board . The first AH @-@ 64D prototype flew on 15 April 1992 , prototype testing ended in April 1995 . During testing , six AH @-@ 64D helicopters were pitted against a numerically superior group of AH @-@ 64A helicopters ; the results demonstrated the AH @-@ 64D to have a seven times increase in survivability and four times increase in lethality compared to the AH @-@ 64A . On 13 October 1995 , full @-@ scale production was approved ; a $ 1 @.@ 9 @-@ billion five @-@ year contract was signed in August 1996 to rebuild 232 AH @-@ 64As to AH @-@ 64D standard . On 17 March 1997 , the first production AH @-@ 64D first flew , it was delivered on 31 March . 
 Portions of the Apache are produced by various aerospace firms . AgustaWestland has produced number of components for the Apache , both for the international market and for the British Army 's AgustaWestland Apache . Since 2004 , Korea Aerospace Industries has been the sole manufacturer of the Apache 's fuselage . Fuselage production had previously been performed by Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical ; the transfer of fuselage production led to a prolonged legal dispute between Teledyne Ryan and Boeing . 
 The AH @-@ 64D program cost a total of $ <unk> through 2007 . In April 2006 , Boeing was awarded a $ <unk> fixed @-@ price contract for the remanufacture of several existing U.S. AH @-@ 64As to the AH @-@ 64D configuration ; between May 2009 and July 2011 , a further five contracts were issued to remanufacture batches of AH @-@ 64As to the upgraded D variant . Since 2008 , nations operating the older AH @-@ 64A have been urged to undertake modernization programs to become AH @-@ 64Ds , as Boeing and the U.S. Army plans to terminate support for the A @-@ variants in the near future . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The AH @-@ 64 Apache has a four @-@ blade main rotor and a four @-@ blade tail rotor . The crew sits in tandem , with the pilot sitting behind and above the copilot / gunner . Both crew members are capable of flying the aircraft and performing methods of weapon engagements independently . The AH @-@ 64 is powered by two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines with high @-@ mounted exhausts on either side of the fuselage . Various models of engines have been used on the Apache ; those in British service use engines from Rolls @-@ Royce . In 2004 , General Electric Aviation began producing more powerful T700 @-@ GE @-@ <unk> engines , rated at 2 @,@ 000 shp ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) for AH @-@ 64Ds . 
 The crew compartment has shielding between the cockpits , such that at least one crew member can survive hits . The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from 23 mm ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) rounds . The airframe includes some 2 @,@ 500 lb ( 1 @,@ 100 kg ) of protection and has a self @-@ sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles . The aircraft was designed to meet the <unk> requirements of MIL @-@ STD @-@ 1290 , which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities . This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength , <unk> landing gear , seats and fuel system . 
 On a standard day where temperatures are 59 ° F ( 15 ° C ) , the AH @-@ 64 has a vertical rate of climb of 1 @,@ 775 feet per minute , and a service ceiling of 21 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) . However , on a hot day where temperatures are 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) , its vertical rate of climb is reduced to 1 @,@ 595 fpm , and service ceiling is reduced to 19 @,@ 400 feet ( 5 @,@ 900 m ) due to less dense air . 
 = = = Avionics and targeting = = = 
 One of the revolutionary features of the Apache was its helmet mounted display , the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System ( <unk> ) ; among its capabilities , either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter 's 30 mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet , making the gun track head movements to point where they look . The <unk> can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position , or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System ( TADS ) . On more modern AH @-@ 64s , the TADS / <unk> has been replaced by Lockheed Martin 's Arrowhead ( <unk> ) targeting system . 
 U.S. Army engagement training is performed under the Aerial Weapons Scoring System Integration with Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System ( AWSS @-@ LBA <unk> ) , using live 30 mm and rocket ammunition as well as simulated Hellfire missiles . The Smart Onboard Data Interface Module ( <unk> ) transmits Apache data to an AWSS ground station for gunnery evaluation . The AH @-@ 64 's standard of performance for aerial gunnery is to achieve at least 1 hit for every 30 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle at a range of 800 – 1 @,@ 200 m ( 870 – 1 @,@ 310 yd ) . 
 The AH @-@ 64 was designed to perform in front @-@ line environments , and to operate at night or day and during adverse weather conditions . Various sensors and onboard avionics allows the Apache to perform in these conditions ; such systems include the Target Acquisition and Designation System , Pilot Night Vision System ( TADS / <unk> ) , passive infrared countermeasures , GPS , and the <unk> . Longbow @-@ equipped Apaches can locate up to 256 targets simultaneously within 50 km ( 31 mi ) . In August 2012 , 24 U.S. Army AH @-@ 64Ds were equipped with the Ground Fire Acquisition System ( <unk> ) , which detects and targets ground @-@ based weapons fire sources in all @-@ light conditions and with a 120 ° Visual field . The <unk> consists of two sensor pods working with the AH @-@ 64 's other sensors , and a <unk> camera that precisely locates muzzle flashes . 
 In 2014 , it was announced that new targeting and surveillance sensors were under development to provide high @-@ resolution color imagery to crews , replacing older low definition black @-@ and @-@ white imaging systems . Lockheed received the first contract in January 2016 , upgrading the Arrowhead turret to provide higher @-@ resolution color imaging with longer ranges and a wider field of view . In 2014 , the U.S. Army was adapting its Apaches for increased maritime performance as part of the Pentagon 's rebalance to the Pacific . Additional avionics and sensor improvements includes an extended @-@ range radar capable of detecting small ships in littoral environments , software adaptions to handle maritime targets , and adding Link 16 data @-@ links for better communications with friendly assets . 
 = = = Armaments and configurations = = = 
 The AH @-@ 64 is adaptable to numerous different roles within its context as Close Combat Attack ( CCA ) . In addition to the 30 mm <unk> Chain Gun , the Apache carries a range of external stores and weapons on its stub @-@ wing pylons , typically a mixture of AGM @-@ 114 Hellfire anti @-@ tank missiles , and Hydra 70 general @-@ purpose unguided 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 756 in ) rockets . One 18 @-@ aircraft Apache battalion equipped with Hellfire missiles is capable of destroying 288 tanks . Since 2005 , the Hellfire missile is sometimes outfitted with a thermobaric warhead ; designated AGM @-@ <unk> , it is intended for use against ground forces and urban warfare operations . The use of thermobaric " enhanced blast " weapons , such as the AGM @-@ <unk> , has been a point of controversy . In October 2015 , the U.S. Army ordered its first batch of Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System ( APKWS ) guided 70 mm rockets for the Apache . 
 Starting in the 1980s , the Stinger and AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles and the AGM @-@ 122 <unk> anti @-@ radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH @-@ 64 . The Stinger was initially selected ; the U.S. Army was also considering the <unk> air @-@ to @-@ air missile . External fuel tanks can also be carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time . The stub @-@ wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access ; these mountings can be used to secure externally personnel for emergency transportation . Stinger missiles are often used on non @-@ U.S. Apaches , as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies . The AH @-@ 64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self @-@ defense equipment , but the capability was re @-@ added following a South Korean demand . 
 The AH @-@ 64E Apache has the ability to control unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH @-@ 58 Kiowa . Apaches can request to take control of an RQ @-@ 7 Shadow or MQ @-@ 1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications . There are four levels of UAV interoperability ( LOI ) : LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data ; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication ; LOI 3 deploys the UAV 's armaments ; and LOI 4 takes over flight control . UAVs can search for enemies and , if equipped with a laser designator , target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft . 
 Boeing has suggested that the AH @-@ 64 could be fitted with a directed energy weapon . The company has developed a small laser weapon , initially designed to engage small UAVs , that uses a high @-@ resolution telescope to direct a 2 @-@ 10 kW beam with the diameter of a penny out to a range of 5 @.@ 4 nmi ( 10 @.@ 0 km ; 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . On the Apache , the laser could be used to destroy enemy communications or radio equipment . 
 On 14 July 2016 it was reported that the AH @-@ 64 had successfully completed testing of the MBDA Brimstone anti @-@ armor missile .

 The U.S. Army formally accepted its first production AH @-@ 64A in January 1984 and training of the first pilots began later that year . The first operational Apache unit , 7th Battalion , 17th Cavalry Brigade , began training on the AH @-@ 64A in April 1986 at Fort Hood , Texas . Two operational units with 68 AH @-@ 64s first deployed to Europe in September 1987 and took part in large military exercises there . 
 Upon fielding the Apache , capabilities such as using the FLIR for extensive night operations made it clear that it was capable of operating beyond the forward line of own troops ( <unk> ) to which previous attack helicopters were normally restricted . It was discovered that the Apache was coincidentally fitted with the Have Quick UHF radio system used by the U.S. Air Force , allowing inter @-@ service coordination and joint operations such as the joint air attack teams ( <unk> ) . The Apache have operated extensively with close air support ( CAS ) aircraft , such as the USAF 's Fairchild Republic A @-@ 10 Thunderbolt II and the USMC 's McDonnell Douglas AV @-@ 8B Harrier II , often acting as a target designator to conserve the Apache 's own munitions . The Apache was first used in combat in 1989 , during Operation Just Cause , the invasion of Panama . The AH @-@ 64 participated in over 240 hours of combat attacking various targets , mostly at night . General Carl <unk> , the commander of the operation , commented that : " You could fire that Hellfire missile through a window from four miles away at night " . 
 = = = = Gulf War and Balkans = = = = 
 Nearly half of all U.S. Apaches were deployed to Saudi Arabia following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait . During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991 , eight AH @-@ 64As guided by four MH @-@ 53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq 's radar network in the operation 's first attack , allowing aircraft to evade detection . The Apaches each carried an asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets , <unk> , and one auxiliary fuel tank . During the 100 @-@ hour ground war a total of 277 AH @-@ 64s took part , destroying 278 tanks , numerous armored personnel carriers and other Iraqi vehicles . One AH @-@ 64 was lost in the war , to a rocket @-@ propelled grenade ( RPG ) hit at close range , the Apache crashed but the crew survived . 
 While effective in combat , the AH @-@ 64 also presented serious logistical complications . Findings reported in 1990 stated " maintenance units could not keep up with the Apache ’ s unexpectedly high work load ... " To provide spare parts for combat operations , the U.S. Army unofficially grounded all other AH @-@ 64s worldwide ; Apaches in the theater flew only one @-@ fifth of the planned flight @-@ hours . These problems were evident before the Gulf War . 
 The AH @-@ 64 played roles in the Balkans during separate conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s . During Task Force Hawk , 24 Apaches were deployed to a land base in Albania in 1999 for combat in Kosovo . These required 26 @,@ 000 tons of equipment to be transported over 550 C @-@ 17 flights , at a cost of US $ 480 million . During these deployments , the AH @-@ 64 encountered some problems , such as deficiencies in training , night vision equipment , fuel tanks , and survivability . On 27 April 1999 , an Apache crashed during training in Albania due to a failure with the tail rotor , causing the fleet in the Balkans to be grounded in December 2000 . 
 In 2000 , Major General Dick Cody , 101st Airborne 's commanding officer , wrote a strongly worded memo to the Chief of Staff about training and equipment failures . No pilots were qualified to fly with night vision goggles , preventing nighttime operations . The Washington Post printed a front @-@ page article on the failures , commenting : " The vaunted helicopters came to symbolise everything wrong with the Army as it enters the 21st century : Its inability to move quickly , its resistance to change , its obsession with casualties , its post @-@ Cold War identity crisis " . No Apache combat missions took place in Kosovo due to fears of casualties . 
 = = = = Afghanistan and Iraq = = = = 
 U.S. Apaches served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001 . The Apache was the only Army platform capable of providing accurate CAS duties for Operation Anaconda , regularly taking fire during the intense early fighting , they were typically repaired quickly . U.S. AH @-@ 64Ds typically flew in Afghanistan and Iraq without the Longbow Radar in the absence of armored threats . On 21 December 2009 , a pair of U.S. Apaches attacked a British @-@ held base in a friendly fire incident , killing one British soldier . In 2006 , Thomas Adams noted that Apaches often fought in small teams with little autonomy to react to threats and opportunities , requiring lengthy dialogue with command structures in an effort to centrally micromanage each unit . 
 In 2003 , the AH @-@ 64 participated in the invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom . On 24 March 2003 , 31 Apaches were damaged , and one shot down and captured , in an unsuccessful attack on an Iraqi Republican Guard armored brigade near Karbala . Iraqi tank crews had set up a " flak trap " among terrain and effectively employed their guns . Iraqi officials claimed a farmer with a Brno rifle shot down the Apache , but the farmer denied involvement . The helicopter came down intact and both the pilot and co @-@ pilot were captured . The AH @-@ 64D was destroyed via air strike the following day . 
 By the end of U.S. military operations in Iraq in December 2011 , several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire , and others lost in accidents . In 2006 , an Apache was downed by a Soviet @-@ made Strela 2 ( SA @-@ 7 ) in Iraq , despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles . In 2007 , four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web @-@ published <unk> photographs taken by soldiers . Several AH @-@ 64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012 . Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely . 
 = = = = Recent service = = = = 
 As of 2011 , the U.S. Army Apache fleet had accumulated more than 3 million flight hours since the first prototype flew in 1975 . A DOD audit released in May 2011 , found that Boeing had significantly overcharged the U.S. Army on multiple occasions , ranging from 33 @.@ 3 percent to 177 @,@ 475 percent for routine spare parts in helicopters like the Apache . 
 On 21 February 2013 , the 1st Battalion ( Attack ) , 229th Aviation Regiment at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord became the first U.S. Army unit to field the AH @-@ 64E Apache Guardian ; a total of 24 AH @-@ 64E were received by mid @-@ 2013 . On 27 November 2013 , the AH @-@ 64E achieved initial operating capability ( IOC ) . In March 2014 , the 1st @-@ 229th Attack Reconnaissance Battalion deployed 24 AH @-@ 64Es to Afghanistan in the type ' first combat deployment . From April through September 2014 , AH @-@ 64E in combat maintained an 88 percent readiness rate . The unit 's deployment ended in November 2014 , with the AH @-@ 64E accumulating 11 @,@ 000 flight hours , each helicopter averaging 66 hours per month . The AH @-@ 64E flies 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) faster than the AH @-@ 64D , cutting response time by 57 percent , and has better fuel efficiency , increasing time on station from 2 @.@ 5 – 3 hours to 3 @-@ 3 @.@ 5 hours ; Taliban forces , which were familiar with the AH @-@ 64D and based their tactics accordingly , were surprised by the AH @-@ 64E arriving and attacking sooner and for longer periods . AH @-@ 64Es also worked with medium and large unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) to find targets and maintain positive ID , conducting 60 percent of the unit 's direct @-@ fire engagements in conjunction with UAVs ; Guardian pilots often controlled UAVs and accessed their video feeds to use their greater operating altitudes and endurance to see the <unk> from standoff ranges . 
 The Army is implementing a plan to move all Apaches from the Army Reserve and National Guard to the active Army to serve as scout helicopters to replace the OH @-@ 58 Kiowa . Using the AH @-@ 64 to scout would be less expensive than Kiowa upgrades or purchasing a new scout helicopter . AH @-@ 64Es can control UAVs like the MQ @-@ 1C Grey Eagle to perform aerial scouting missions ; a 2010 study found the teaming of Apaches and UAVs was the most cost @-@ effective alternative to a new helicopter and would meet 80 percent of reconnaissance requirements , compared to 20 percent with existing OH @-@ 58s and 50 percent with upgraded OH @-@ 58s . National Guard units , who would lose their attack helicopters , criticized the proposal . In March 2015 , the first heavy attack reconnaissance unit was formed , comprising 24 attack Apaches , 24 reconnaissance Apaches , and 12 Shadow UAVs . 
 In July 2014 , the Pentagon announced that Apaches had been dispatched to Baghdad to protect embassy personnel from Islamic State militant attacks . On 4 October 2014 , Apaches began performing missions in Operation Inherent Resolve against Islamic State ground forces . In October 2014 , U.S. Army AH @-@ 64s and Air Force fighters participated in four air strikes on Islamic State units northeast of Fallujah . In June 2016 , Apaches were used in support of the Iraqi Army 's Mosul offensive . 
 = = = Israel = = = 
 The Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) first received AH @-@ 64As in 1990 , for a total fleet of 42 . There was some controversy over the Air Force 's choice to purchase Apaches over upgrading existing AH @-@ 1 Cobra attack helicopters . In 2000 , Israel was interested in acquiring up to 48 AH @-@ 64Ds , but U.S. reluctance to share the software source code complicated the prospect . In April 2005 , Boeing delivered the first AH @-@ 64D to the IAF . In 2001 , the U.S. government was allegedly investigating misuse of the Apache and other US @-@ supplied military equipment against Palestinian leaders and facilities . In 2009 , an arranged sale of six AH @-@ 64Ds was reportedly blocked by the Obama Administration , pending interagency review , over concerns the helicopters may pose a threat to civilian Palestinians in Gaza . In IAF service , the AH @-@ 64A was named as the Peten ( Hebrew : <unk> , for Cobra ) , while the AH @-@ 64D was named <unk> ( <unk> , also as " Seraph " , Hebrew for venomous / fiery winged serpent ) . 
 During the 1990s , Israeli AH @-@ 64As frequently attacked Hezbollah outposts in Lebanon . On 13 April 1996 , during Operation Grapes of Wrath , an Apache fired two Hellfire missiles at an ambulance in Lebanon , killing six civilians . During the al @-@ Aqsa Intifada in 2000 , AH @-@ 64s were used to kill senior Hamas figures , such as Ahmed Yassin and Adnan al @-@ Ghoul . On 24 May 2001 , a privately owned Lebanese @-@ registered Cessna 152 flew into Israeli airspace , it was intercepted by two AH @-@ 64s and shot down by a Hellfire missile , killing the pilot . On 22 March 2004 , an Israeli AH @-@ 64 used a Hellfire missile to kill Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin , also killing his two bodyguards and nine bystanders . IAF Apaches played a prominent role in the 2006 Lebanon War , launching strikes into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah forces . 
 There have also been accidents involving the Apache helicopter in Israeli service . During the Lebanon War in 2006 , two IAF AH @-@ 64A helicopters collided , killing one pilot and critically wounding three . In another incident in the conflict an IAF AH @-@ 64D crashed due to a malfunction in the main rotor , killing the two crew . In late 2007 , the Israeli Air Force put further purchases and deliveries of AH @-@ 64Ds on hold during an investigation upon the aircraft 's performance envelope . However , Israeli officials have since praised the Apache for its role in Operation Cast Lead in 2008 , against Hamas in Gaza . In recent years , Israeli Apaches have been used to patrol the skies over Gaza ; strike operations against insurgents using these helicopters has become a frequent occurrence . 
 Since recent orders of new AH @-@ 64Ds have been blocked , Israel has pursued upgrades to its AH @-@ 64A fleet . In June 2010 , Israel decided not to upgrade all AH @-@ 64As to D configuration , due to funding constraints and lack of U.S. cooperation . In December 2010 , the IAF was examining the adoption of a new missile system as a cheaper and lightweight complement to the Hellfire missile , either the American Hydra 70 or the Canadian CRV7 . In 2013 , Israeli AH @-@ 64As had been receiving a comprehensive upgrade of their avionics and electrical systems . The AH @-@ 64As are being upgraded to the AH @-@ <unk> configuration , which is near the AH @-@ 64D standard . 
 = = = United Kingdom = = = 
 The UK currently operates a modified version of the Apache Longbow ; initially called the Westland WAH @-@ 64 Apache , it is designated the Apache AH1 by the British Army . Westland built 67 WAH @-@ 64 Apaches under license from Boeing , following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and the Apache for the British Army 's new Attack Helicopter in 1995 . Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. Apache variants include changing to more powerful Rolls @-@ Royce engines , and the addition of a folding blade assembly for use on naval ships . 
 On 11 July 2016 , the UK Ministry of Defence confirmed a $ 2 @.@ 3 billion order for 50 AH @-@ 64Es to be built in Mesa , Arizona . The purchase is via a Foreign Military Sales ( FMS ) agreement with the US government . Leonardo Helicopters in the UK is to maintain the current fleet of Apaches until 2023 – 24 , with a long @-@ term plan for Leonardo and other UK companies to " do most of the work " on the new fleet . The deal includes an initial support contract for maintenance of the new helicopters , along with spare parts and training simulators for UK pilots . The first UK helicopters are due off the US production line in early 2020 and will begin entering service with the British Army in 2022 . " To further guarantee value for money , systems from the current Apache fleet , such as the Modernised Target Acquisition & Designation System , and the Longbow Fire Control Radar , will be reused and incorporated into the new helicopters where possible . " Approval for the re @-@ manufacture of fifty of the UK 's WAH @-@ 64 Mk 1 fleet to AH @-@ 64E Apache Guardian standard had been given by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency in August 2015 . The aircraft will utilise the General Electric T700 engine rather than the Turbomeca RTM322 from the current fleet ; the first off @-@ the @-@ shelf purchase of a GE engine by the UK MOD . 
 = = = Netherlands = = = 
 The Dutch government initially showed an interest in acquiring Apache helicopters in the late 1980s , where it stated that it may purchase as many as 52 . A competition held in 1994 against the Eurocopter Tiger and the Bell AH @-@ 1 <unk> led to the Royal Netherlands Air Force ordering 30 AH @-@ 64D Apaches in 1995 . Deliveries began in 1998 and ended in 2002 . The RNLAF Apaches are equipped with the Apache Modular Aircraft Survivability Equipment ( <unk> ) self @-@ protection system to counter infrared ( IR ) missile threats . 
 The RNLAF Apaches ' first deployment was in 2001 to Djibouti , Africa . They were also deployed alongside U.S. AH @-@ 64s in support of NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina . In 2004 , six Dutch AH @-@ 64s were deployed as part of the Netherlands contribution to Multinational force in Iraq to support the Dutch ground forces . The Apaches performed close combat support and display of force missions , along with providing reconnaissance information to ground forces . In February 2006 , the Netherlands contribution to NATO forces in Afghanistan was increased from 600 to 1 @,@ 400 troops and 6 AH @-@ 64s were sent in support . 
 Shortly after Apaches were deployed to Hamid Karzai International Airport , as part of the Netherlands contribution to ISAF , on 10 April 2004 a pair of Dutch Apaches came under light gunfire close to the Afghan capital . On 17 December 2007 , an RNLAF Apache flew into powerlines during a night flying exercise in the Netherlands , forcing an emergency landing and causing a lengthy blackout in the region . On 17 March 2015 a RNLAF Apache crashed during a training mission in Mali . Both pilots died . The ministry of defence opened an investigation into the cause of the crash . 
 = = = Saudi Arabia = = = 
 Following the 1991 Gulf War , during which many U.S. Apaches operated from bases within Saudi territory , Saudi Arabia purchased twelve AH @-@ 64As for the Royal Saudi Land Force . It has been speculated that the Saudi purchase had motivated Israel to also procure the Apaches . In August 2006 , the Saudi Arabian government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $ <unk> , possibly <unk> their AH @-@ 64As to the AH @-@ 64D Longbow configuration . In September 2008 , the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH @-@ 64Ds requested by Saudi Arabia . In October 2010 , Saudi Arabia requested a further 70 AH @-@ 64Ds as part of a possible , massive arms deal . 
 In November 2009 , the Royal Saudi Land Force , as part of a military effort against insurgent intrusions of the kingdom 's border , started using the Apache in Operation Scorched Earth ; this also involved launching air strikes against <unk> rebels operating inside neighboring Yemen . In January 2010 the rebels claimed to have shot down an Apache ; this was denied by the Saudi military . In late January 2010 , the leader of the Shiite rebels announced their withdrawal from Saudi territory , this announcement followed a key battle on 12 January when Saudi forces reportedly took control of the border village of Al Jabiri . 
 = = = Egypt = = = 
 In 1995 , the Egyptian Air Force placed an order for 36 AH @-@ 64A helicopters . These Apaches were delivered with most of the advanced avionics used on the U.S. fleet at that time , with the exception of localized radio equipment . In 2000 , Boeing announced an order to remanufacture Egypt 's existing Apache fleet to the AH @-@ 64D configuration . Notably , the AH @-@ 64D upgrade did not include the procurement of the Longbow radar , the supply of which had been refused by the U.S. government . Egypt requested a further 12 AH @-@ 64D Block II Apaches through a Foreign Military Sale in 2009 . 
 In August 2012 , the Egyptian Armed Forces undertook a large @-@ scale military operation to regain control of the Sinai Peninsula from armed militants . Air cover throughout the operation was provided by the Egyptian Air Force 's Apache helicopters ; reportedly the Apaches destroyed three vehicles and killed at least 20 militants . Up to five Egyptian Apaches were temporarily stationed in the Sinai following an agreement between Egypt and Israel . In September 2015 , an Egyptian Apache attacked a group of foreign tourists in the Egyptian part of the Libyan Desert , killing 12 people and injuring 10 , they were mistaken for Islamist militants , the Egyptian Interior Ministry stated that the group were in a restricted area .

 The United Arab Emirates purchased 30 AH @-@ 64A helicopters in 1991 and 1994 , which they are now upgrading to AH @-@ 64D specification . In 2005 , Kuwait purchased 16 Longbow helicopters . 
 Greece received 20 AH @-@ 64As by 1995 ; another 12 AH @-@ 64Ds were ordered in September 2003 . 
 Singapore purchased 20 AH @-@ 64Ds aircraft in two batches between 1999 and 2001 ; during October 2010 Apache training was suspended following the forced crash @-@ landing of an Apache . 
 Japan ordered 50 AH @-@ 64Ds , which are being built under license by Fuji Heavy Industries , designated " AH @-@ <unk> " . The first helicopter was delivered to the JGSDF in early 2006 . 
 Taiwan ( Republic of China ) reached an agreement with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH @-@ 64Es with weapons , and associated equipment in June 2011 . On 5 November 2013 , Taiwan received the first 6 AH @-@ 64s . On 25 April 2014 , a Taiwanese AH @-@ 64E crashed into a three @-@ story building during a training flight in bad weather conditions , the first airframe loss of an AH @-@ 64E . An investigation ruled out mechanical failure and concluded human error as responsible , that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height ; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots . In October 2014 , the fifth and final batch of AH @-@ 64Es was delivered to Taiwan , completing the order . 
 In 2009 , South Korea showed interest in acquiring Apaches . This move may be related to U.S. plans to withdraw many of its Apaches from South Korea . On 21 September 2012 , the U.S. Congress was notified of the possible purchase of 36 AH @-@ 64D Block III Apaches , along with associated equipment and armament . The Apache competed against the Bell AH @-@ 1Z Viper and the TAI / AgustaWestland T @-@ 129 ; in April 2013 , South Korea announced that it would purchase 36 AH @-@ 64Es . The first four AH @-@ 64Es were delivered in May 2016 , with all to be delivered by early 2017 .

 In 2008 , the Indian Air Force ( IAF ) released a tender for 22 attack helicopters ; there were six contending submissions — Sikorsky 's UH @-@ 60 Black Hawk , the AH @-@ 64D , Bell 's AH @-@ 1 Super Cobra , Eurocopter 's Tiger , Mil 's Mi @-@ 28 and AgustaWestland 's <unk> Mangusta . In October 2008 , Boeing and Bell withdrew . In 2009 , the competition was restarted . In December 2010 , India requested the possible sale of 22 Apaches and associated equipment . On 5 October 2012 , IAF Chief <unk> Browne confirmed the Apache 's selection . The IAF sought control of the 22 proposed Apaches for air combat missions , while the Army Aviation Corps argued that they would be better used in army operations . In April 2013 , the Indian Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) decided that the IAF would receive the 22 AH @-@ 64s . In May 2013 , the Indian Army requested 11 AH @-@ 64Es ; and has a requirement for 39 Apaches . The Indian Ministry of Defence approved the procurement in August 2014 , as did India 's Cabinet Committee on Security ( CCS ) in September 2015 . On 28 September 2015 , a contract was formally signed ; the first helicopter is expected to be delivered to India in the next three to four years . 
 On 26 August 2013 , the U.S. and Indonesia formalized a $ 500 million deal for 8 AH @-@ 64E Apaches . 
 Iraq requested the sale of 24 AH @-@ 64s in April 2013 ; In January 2014 , a sale , including the helicopters , associated parts , maintenance , and training , was cleared by Congress . However , the proposal was not accepted by the Iraqi government and expired in August 2014 . 
 In July 2012 , Qatar requested the sale of 24 AH @-@ 64D Apache Block III helicopters , with associated equipment , training , and support . The sale was approved on 27 March 2014 . 
 In July 2016 , the UK placed an order for 50 AH @-@ 64Es through the US Foreign Military Sales ( FMS ) programme instead of upgrading their Westland @-@ built WAH @-@ 64s .

 The AH @-@ 64A is the original production attack helicopter . The crew sit in tandem in an armored compartment . It is powered by two GE T700 turboshaft engines . The A @-@ model was equipped with the − 701 engine version until 1990 when the engines were switched to the more powerful − 701C version . 
 U.S. Army AH @-@ 64As are being converted to AH @-@ 64Ds . The service 's last AH @-@ 64A was taken out of service in July 2012 before conversion at Boeing 's facility in Mesa , Arizona . On 25 September 2012 , Boeing received a $ <unk> contract to remanufacture the last 16 AH @-@ 64As into the AH @-@ 64D Block II version and this was forecast to be completed by December 2013 . 
 = = = AH @-@ 64B = = = 
 In 1991 , after Operation Desert Storm , the AH @-@ 64B was a proposed upgrade to 254 AH @-@ 64As . The upgrade would have included new rotor blades , a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , improved navigation systems and new radios . Congress approved $ <unk> to begin the Apache B upgrade . The B program was canceled in 1992 . The radio , navigation , and GPS modifications , were later installed on most A @-@ model Apaches through other upgrades . 
 = = = AH @-@ 64C = = = 
 Additional funding from Congress in late 1991 resulted in a program to upgrade AH @-@ 64As to an AH @-@ 64B + version . More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH @-@ 64C . The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast @-@ mounted radar and newer − <unk> engine versions . However , the C designation was dropped after 1993 . With AH @-@ 64As receiving the newer engine from 1990 , the only difference between the C model and the radar @-@ equipped D model was the radar , which could be moved from one aircraft to another ; thus the decision was made to simply designate both versions " AH @-@ 64D " .

 The AH @-@ 64D Apache Longbow is equipped with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors , the most noticeable of which being the AN / APG @-@ 78 Longbow millimeter @-@ wave fire @-@ control radar ( <unk> ) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer ( RFI ) , housed in a dome located above the main rotor . The radome 's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles ( e.g. terrain , trees or buildings ) . The AN / APG @-@ 78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once , an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds . A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches ; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter . 
 The aircraft is powered by a pair of uprated T700 @-@ GE @-@ 701C engines . The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability , navigation , and ' tactical internet ' communications capabilities . In February 2003 , the first Block II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army , featuring digital communications upgrades . The Japanese Apache AH @-@ <unk> variant is based on the AH @-@ 64D ; it can be equipped with the AIM @-@ 92 Stinger air @-@ to @-@ air missiles for self @-@ defense .

 Formerly known as AH @-@ 64D Block III , in 2012 , it was redesignated as AH @-@ 64E Guardian to represent its increased capabilities . The AH @-@ 64E features improved digital connectivity , the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System , more powerful T700 @-@ GE @-@ <unk> engines with upgraded face gear transmission to accommodate more power , capability to control unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAVs ) , full IFR capability , and improved landing gear . New composite rotor blades , which successfully completed testing in 2004 , increase cruise speed , climb rate , and payload capacity . Deliveries began in November 2011 . Full @-@ rate production was approved on 24 October 2012 , with 634 AH @-@ 64Ds to be upgraded to AH @-@ 64E standard and production of 56 new @-@ build AH @-@ 64Es to start in 2019 / 20 . Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system and new self @-@ diagnostic abilities . The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity , potentially enabling naval strikes ; an AESA radar is under consideration . The E model is to be fit for maritime operations . The Army has expressed a desire to add extended @-@ range fuel tanks to the AH @-@ 64E to further increase range and endurance . AH @-@ 64Es are to have the L @-@ 3 Communications <unk> @-@ TX datalink installed in place of two previous counterparts , communicating on C , D , L , and Ku frequency bands to transmit and receive data and video with all Army UAVs . Lots 5 and 6 will be equipped with Link 16 data @-@ links .

 In 2014 , Boeing conceptualized an Apache upgrade prior to the introduction of the U.S. Army 's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft , forecast to replace the Apache by 2040 . The conceptual AH @-@ <unk> would have greater speed via a new 3 @,@ 000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program , retractable landing gear , stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise , and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust .

 During the 1980s Naval versions of the AH @-@ 64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy were examined . Multiple concepts were studied with altered landing gear arrangements , improved avionics and weapons . The USMC was very interested and conducted a two @-@ week evaluation of the Apache in September 1981 , including shipboard operation tests . 
 Funding for a naval version was not provided ; the Marine Corps continued to use the AH @-@ 1 . The Canadian Forces Maritime Command also examined a naval Apache . In 2004 , British Army AgustaWestland Apaches were deployed upon the Royal Navy 's HMS Ocean , a Landing Platform Helicopter , for suitability testing ; there was U.S. interest in the trials . 
 During the 2011 military intervention in Libya , the British Army extensively used Apaches from HMS Ocean . In 2013 , U.S. 36th Combat Aviation Brigade AH @-@ 64Ds were tested on a variety of U.S. Navy ships .

 Several models have been derived from both AH @-@ 64A and AH @-@ 64D for export . The British @-@ built AgustaWestland Apache ( assembled from kits purchased from Boeing ) is based on the AH @-@ 64D Block I with several different systems , including more powerful engines , folding rotor blades , and other modifications for operation from Royal Navy vessels .

 While a major change in design or role will cause the type designator suffix to change , for example from AH @-@ 64D to AH @-@ 64E , the helicopters are also subject to Block modification .

 = Walter W. Law = 
 Walter William Law ( November 13 , 1837 – January 17 , 1924 ) was a businessman and the founder of the 8 @,@ 000 @-@ person village of Briarcliff Manor , New York . He was a vice president of furniture and carpet retailer W. & J. Sloane , and later founded the Briarcliff Lodge , the Briarcliff Table Water Company , Briarcliff Farms , and the Briarcliff Greenhouses . He founded or assisted in establishing several schools , churches , and parks in the village , and rebuilt its train station in 1906 . In the early 1900s , Walter Law was the largest individual landholder in Westchester County . 
 Walter Law was born in Kidderminster , England , and was one of ten children of a carpet dealer . He relocated to the United States in 1859 , where he lived until his death . Throughout his life , he was employed at various places , including at W. & J. Sloane , where he worked for 24 years . After retiring to a house on Scarborough Road in the small community of Whitson 's Corners , New York , he developed the surrounding farmland into a suburban village . Law died in 1924 in Summerville , South Carolina , during rest cure treatment . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Walter Law was born on November 13 , 1837 in the English town of Kidderminster . He was one of ten children born to John and Elizabeth Bird Law , who were strict Nonconformists . His father sold carpets and dry goods ; at the time , Kidderminster was a center of carpet manufacturing in Britain . Law was educated in private schools in Kidderminster ; however , he left school and began working as a draper at the age of fourteen . In 1859 , he moved to the United States , having gained an interest in the US after reading about it . He left England with letters of introduction written by his father , which were addressed to friends in the American carpet business ; he also had enough money to last for about two weeks . He arrived in New York City on January 22 , 1860 . 
 = = Career = = 
 Law originally found a job as a traveling carpet salesman . He continued until he discovered that his employer was misrepresenting domestic rugs as being imported and was also charging premium prices . His next employer , an outfitter of steamships and hotels , went out of business in the 1860s , when the American Civil War affected the business . Law struggled through unemployment , and even while working , pay was low . At one point , Law was employed at a store and was making eight dollars a week . 
 Later on , Law contacted William Sloane , head of W. & J. Sloane . Sloane hired him more out of kindness than need for employees . In 1866 , at the age of 29 , Law began work under Sloane . After four years of employment , Walter Law became a partner in the company . Walter Law increased the business of Sloane 's wholesale department by securing the account of the Alexander Smith & Sons Carpet Company in Yonkers for the manufacture of <unk> carpets . Law and his wife moved to 354 Palisade Avenue in Yonkers , making it easier for him to service the Smith account . He later became a vice president of W. & J. Sloane , and also joined its Board of Directors . 
 = = = Briarcliff Manor developments = = = 
 In 1890 , Walter Law began purchasing property in the present @-@ day village of Briarcliff Manor . That year , Law paid James Stillman $ 35 @,@ 000 ( $ 921 @,@ 800 in 2015 ) for 236 acres ( 0 @.@ 4 sq mi ) of land in the area ; he named the land Briarcliff Farm . In 1898 , Law retired from W. & J. Sloane and began devoting his time to his farming . He built an estate , the Manor House , on Scarborough Road in Briarcliff Manor . He later purchased more land , acquiring 5 @,@ 000 acres by 1900 , including land in Yorktown , Millwood , Pound Ridge , and Glenville , Connecticut . Law 's farm began with rough farmland , a few cattle , and little knowledge of farming , but it eventually grew . At the farm 's peak , Law had 500 workers caring for more than 1 @,@ 000 cattle , 500 pigs , 4 @,@ 000 chickens , Thoroughbred horses , pheasants , peacocks and sheep . Law believed that farming can pay off if it utilized scientific principles , and that the farm should find the best markets and hold them by producing the best products . 
 Around the same time , he established the Briarcliff Table Water Company and the Briarcliff Greenhouses . The water company sold its products in five cities , and owned 250 @-@ foot ( 76 m ) wells . Briarcliff Farms was one of the first producers of certified milk in the U.S. , and the farm produced about 4 @,@ 500 US quarts ( 4 @,@ 300 litres ) of milk daily . Every night , his milk , cream , butter and kumyss was sent to New York City on the New York and Putnam Railroad . Law 's greenhouse space grew to 75 @,@ 000 square feet ( 7 @,@ 000 m2 ) , and his roses earned up to $ 100 @,@ 000 each year . As many as 8 @,@ 000 roses were shipped from Briarcliff Greenhouses daily , most of them to New York City . In 1902 , Law built the Briarcliff Lodge on the highest point of his estate ; it was the first hotel in Westchester County . 
 Law also developed the village , establishing schools , churches , and parks . He donated land for the Briarcliff Congregational Church ( built in 1896 ) and for Liberty Park ( later dedicated as the Walter W. Law Memorial Park ) ; in 1900 , he established the School of Practical Agriculture on Pleasantville Road on 66 acres ( 27 ha ) of land . He also built Dysart House as a guest house in 1897 , named after Dysart House in Scotland . By 1902 , Law had invested $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( $ 68 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) in the village . In 1906 , he replaced Briarcliff Manor 's railroad station with the present @-@ day public library . His employees at Briarcliff Farms moved into the village in its early years , and Law held some of their mortgages . At the time , New York State required a population density of at least 300 per square mile for incorporation as a village . A proposition was presented to the supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8 , 1902 ; it requested that the area , which had 640 acres with a population of 381 , be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor . The village was incorporated on November 21 , 1902 . At the time , Law owned all but two small parcels of the village , and he employed 100 of its residents . Law largely developed his Briarcliff Manor property as a business corporation until 1907 , when he purchased 3 @,@ 249 acres ( 1 @,@ 315 ha ) for Briarcliff Farms in Pine Plains , New York ; he then began developing his properties for houses , churches , and schools instead . In 1909 , Law formed the Briarcliff Lodge Association to run the hotel , and the Briarcliff Realty Company to sell the original Briarcliff Farms property . His son , Henry , presided over the realty company until 1936 . In 1908 , during the Briarcliff Manor @-@ sponsored First American International Road Race , Law donated and presented the Briarcliff Trophy , valued at over $ 10 @,@ 000 ( $ 263 @,@ 400 in 2015 ) . In 1918 , Walter Law sold his Briarcliff Farms land in Pine Plains .

 Walter Law died in Summerville , South Carolina , on January 17 , 1924 . He had gone alone to Summerville for rest cure treatment . After the news of his death spread , Law 's son , Henry , left for Summerville . Law 's funeral was held at the Briarcliff Congregational Church three days later . He was buried with his wife and two of his children in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City . 
 On February 1 , 1924 , Law 's will was filed with county surrogate George A. Slater in White Plains . His estate was approximately $ 5 million , the majority of which was divided equally between his children . They also each received 25 shares of the Alexander Smith and Sons Carpet company 's stock and scrip and 250 shares of the Nairn <unk> Company . Law 's friends , servants , and employees received from $ 500 to $ 5 @,@ 000 . He also bequeathed $ 13 @,@ 500 to his longtime nurse and secretary Ida Z. Thompson .

 During their life at Briarcliff Manor , Law owned the Manor House on Scarborough Road . Law later built houses for Henry , Walter Jr . , and Edith on the Briarcliff Lodge property on Scarborough Road . The three houses were named Hillcrest , Six Gables , and Mt . Vernon , and all three still stand . 
 Walter Law was a friend of Andrew Carnegie , who described Law as always having an interest in reading and writing . When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing , Law would document it for further use . Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends , and had an attractive personality . Law 's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7 @,@ 000 volumes , which he collected for more than forty years . His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history ; on a vacation to Europe , Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites . He was also a member of New York 's Century Association , the Alpine Club , the Players , the American Fine Arts Society , Ardsley Casino ( now Ardsley Country Club ) , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Astronomical Society of the Pacific , and Sleepy Hollow Country Club . Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens ' Committee , a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892 , Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University . 
 = Fairfax Harrison = 
 Fairfax Harrison ( full name Reginald Fairfax Harrison : March 13 , 1869 – February 2 , 1938 ) was an American lawyer , businessman , and writer . The son of the secretary to Confederate President Jefferson Davis , Harrison studied law at Yale University and Columbia University before becoming a lawyer for the Southern Railway Company in 1896 . By 1906 he was Southern 's vice @-@ president of finance , and in 1907 he helped secure funding to keep the company solvent . In 1913 he was elected president of Southern , where he instituted a number of reforms in the way the company operated . 
 By 1916 , under Harrison 's leadership , the Southern had expanded to an 8 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 13 @,@ 000 km ) network across 13 states , its greatest extent until the 1950s . Following the United States ' entry into World War I , the federal government took control of the railroads in December 1917 , running them through the United States Railroad Administration , on which Harrison served . An economic boom after the war helped the company to expand its operations ; Harrison worked to improve the railroad 's public relations and to upgrade the locomotive stock by introducing more powerful engines . Another of his concerns was to increase the amount of railroad track and to extend the area serviced by the railway . Harrison struggled to keep the railroad afloat during the Great Depression , and by 1936 Southern was once again showing a profit . Harrison retired in 1937 , intending to focus on his hobby of writing about historical subjects including the roots of the American Thoroughbred horse , but he died three months later in February 1938 .

 Harrison was born in New York City on March 13 , 1869 , to Burton Harrison and Constance Cary Harrison . Burton had served as private secretary to Jefferson Davis , the President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War , and Constance was a novelist . Harrison 's brother , Francis Burton Harrison , was Governor @-@ General of the Philippines from 1913 to 1921 . Another brother was Archibald , and all three brothers attended Yale University . Fairfax Harrison graduated from Yale in 1890 ; he was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society . He went on to attend Columbia University , earning a Masters in Arts .

 Harrison was admitted to the New York State bar in 1892 and worked for the law firm Bangs , Stetson , Tracy & MacVeagh from 1892 to 1896 . He then joined the Southern Railway Company in May 1896 as a lawyer , becoming an assistant to the company 's president in 1903 . He served as vice @-@ president in charge of finance and accounting from 1906 . During the Panic of 1907 , Harrison successfully persuaded J. P. Morgan to purchase bonds in the Southern to keep the company solvent . After the panic had subsided , Harrison was named president of the Chicago , Indianapolis and Louisville Railway , later the Monon Railroad ( succeeded Ira G. Rawn after Rawn 's death ) , which was jointly owned by Southern and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad . William Finley , president of the Southern Railway , died on November 23 , 1913 , and Harrison was elected as his successor eight days later . Besides the chairmanship of the Southern Railway , he was also elected to succeed Finley on three subsidiary railroads . His election was considered to be a sign of change in the Southern United States , especially in its railroads , both because he was a southerner and for his activism on behalf of the south . 
 = = = First years as president = = = 
 One of Harrison 's first acts as president was to implement a new training program for college graduates hired by the company . Rather than being placed in supervisory roles , they were given regular entry @-@ level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track , to give them an understanding of the basics of the railroad business . He also instituted a remedial education program for the regular workforce ; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level , as well as in engine and machine @-@ shop basics . The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers . 
 Another of Harrison 's goals was to raise the morale of the workforce and locomotive engineers ; crews were assigned to the same locomotives , and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines . When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20 percent , but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff , with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales . Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety , including stricter investigation of accidents . 
 Harrison oversaw changes in the railway 's Board of Directors . Until 1915 most of the members of the board were from the northern United States but , after 1915 , a majority of the board members were southerners . In 1914 there were two unusual appointments to the board : Edwin Alderman and John Kilgo . Alderman was the president of the University of Virginia and Kilgo was a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church . 
 Harrison established a foreign trade department for the railroad , hoping to take advantage of the railway 's ability to connect to the Mississippi Valley and Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports . In 1915 , when the railway lost 12 percent of its revenue owing to disruptions in trade caused by the start of World War I , Harrison was concerned about longer @-@ term changes underway . In the annual report that year he warned stockholders that automobile ownership could severely impact railroad passenger revenues . His words proved to be prophetic , as automobiles eventually resulted in the disappearance of most passenger train traffic . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 From 1913 to 1919 , Harrison oversaw the extension of double @-@ track on the railway 's mainline between Washington , D.C. and Atlanta , Georgia . The project was hampered by the war effort , but eventually covered the complete 638 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 027 km ) distance between the two cities . In 1916 , Harrison acquired a railroad line that ran from Meridian , Mississippi to New Orleans , Louisiana . This brought Southern Railway 's track total to more than 8 @,@ 000 miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ) , covering 13 states . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , some military training camps were located in the south and much of the construction material used to build them was hauled over the Southern Railway . Harrison was elected chairman of a coordinating committee of railroad presidents , known as the War Board . Its five members were tasked with eliminating bottlenecks , and fostering cooperation between the various railroads . 
 The board 's efforts failed to meet the government 's expectations ; in December 1917 , Woodrow Wilson , the President of the United States , ordered the federal government to take control of the railroads , setting up a United States Railroad Administration ( USRA ) to run them . Harrison worked for the USRA during the war and , under its regulations , was required to step down as chairman of the Southern Railway . By the time the USRA returned control of Southern in March 1920 its treasury was bare . A few years of operation returned a surplus to the company , which led to the stockholders requesting in 1923 that the railroad pay a dividend to the holders of the common stock , something Southern had never done . Harrison managed to block the request , but in March 1924 a subsequent demand was successful , and a dividend of $ 5 ( approximately $ 69 as of 2016 ) per share was declared . That was increased to $ 7 ( approximately $ 94 as of 2016 ) per share in 1926 and $ 8 ( approximately $ 110 as of 2016 ) in 1928 . 
 = = = 1920s = = = 
 An economic boom in the south following the end of World War I greatly increased Southern 's revenues . Harrison spent a good deal of time traveling around the southern United States , endeavoring to increase southern industry . When he traveled , he used two private railroad cars , named the Carolina and the Virginia . Other railroad presidents used only one , which made Harrison 's practice unique . The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors , with a kitchen , dining room , and observation area . 
 Harrison attempted to increase the power of Southern 's locomotives . In 1923 , engineers under his direction created the plans for the P @-@ 4 class of Pacific type locomotives , which became famous and a symbol of the Southern Railway . On a visit to England , Harrison had seen the paint scheme used by the London and North Eastern Railway , which used apple green @-@ painted engines . Returning home in 1925 , he ordered the newly delivered Pacifics painted a forest green , which he called Virginia , with gold lettering and silver trim . The roof of each engine was painted brick red . These engines pulled the newly refurbished passenger trains that Harrison had begun work on before the war . He also instituted new passenger lines . In 1921 the Suwannee River Special began to run between Chicago , Detroit , and Cleveland down to Tampa and St. Petersburg in Florida . The Crescent Limited began service in 1925 between New Orleans and New York , with a scheduled time for the one @-@ way trip of 37 hours and 50 minutes . 
 Harrison continued the public relations and advertising efforts of his predecessors ; in 1924 an advertising campaign was launched with the slogan " The Southern <unk> the South " , which soon became well known . Harrison also spent long hours in negotiations to secure the legal foundations of the railway , consolidating the railroad 's debt and acquiring majority control of some of the smaller lines that made up the railway . 
 In 1926 the United States government forced the railroad to move out of its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , D.C. Although Harrison threatened to take the company headquarters to Atlanta , in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square . Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors . The railroad took occupancy of the building in the middle of 1929 . 
 During these years , Harrison exhibited a number of personality quirks that became legendary . One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine with him in the executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal 's conversational topic written on it . Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad . Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass , which entitled him to free travel . Instead , he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad 's offices .

 Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , Southern 's stock sold for around $ 146 ( approximately $ 2 @,@ 010 as of 2016 ) , with an all @-@ time high of just over $ 151 ( approximately $ 2 @,@ 080 as of 2016 ) . In 1932 the stock hit a low of $ 2 @.@ 50 ( approximately $ 43 as of 2016 ) . In 1929 Southern 's freight traffic had been 8 @.@ 4 billion ton @-@ miles ; it fell to 4 @.@ 4 billion ton @-@ miles in 1932 . Southern 's debt rose , and the company almost entered bankruptcy in 1932 . Harrison ordered the payment of dividends to be halted in 1932 , and many employees took pay cuts . Further efforts included a thorough check of expenses , with every item subjected to scrutiny to see what could be eliminated . By 1936 the railroad again showed a profit ; this marked the turning point for the company in dealing with the Great Depression . 
 Harrison chose not to be reappointed as president in 1937 , and nominated Ernest Norris as his successor . Harrison , who was 68 at the time , planned to concentrate on his hobby of writing historical works , but he died three months after his retirement . 
 = = Writing career = = 
 Harrison was an author as well as an industrialist , writing on Virginia history and genealogy . Among his works were a translation of the agricultural works of ancient Roman writer Marcus Porcius Cato and several books on the local history of Virginia , including The Landmarks of Old Prince William , Devon Carys , Proprietors of the Northern Neck and Virginia Carys . He also wrote on the early history of the American Thoroughbred racehorse ; his work includes The Belair Stud , The Roanoke Stud , The Background of the American Stud Book , The Equine <unk> 's , The John 's Island Stud , and Early American Turf Stock . The last came out in two volumes , the first on mares in 1934 , and the second on stallions in 1935 . Peter Willet , a later writer on Thoroughbreds , described him as an " indefatigable researcher in American pedigrees " . Harrison also served on the Executive Committee of the Virginia Historical Society , and was instrumental in the preparation of the 120 @-@ volume Virginia Historical Index . 
 = = Family , death , and legacy = = 
 Harrison married Hetty Cary in 1894 . They had four children : three daughters , Ursula , Constance , and Sally , and a son , Richard . He was a member of the Episcopal Church . Harrison was described as " physically imposing " , and gray @-@ haired in his middle age . Harry <unk> , an employee and protégé , described him as " a little cold when you first met him , but underneath he was a very warm , admirable , capable and wise man " . He died on February 2 , 1938 , of heart disease , and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Alexandria , Virginia . On the day after Harrison 's death , the New York Times carried his obituary , but instead of a photograph of Harrison , the picture that ran with the obituary was of John Jeremiah Pelley , the president of the Association of American Railroads , who was still alive . 
 The College of William and Mary in Virginia holds some of his papers . A selection of his letters was published in 1944 under the title A Selection of the Letters of Fairfax Harrison . The University of Virginia library has on loan another collection of Harrison 's papers . Correspondence and business files from his time as president of the Southern Railway are held by the Southern Railway Historical Society in their collection of president 's files . They were loaned to the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in 2003 and were still there in 2008 . 
 = James Naismith = 
 Dr. James Naismith ( November 6 , 1861 – November 28 , 1939 ) was a Canadian physical educator , physician , chaplain , sports coach and innovator . He invented the sport of basketball in 1891 . He wrote the original basketball rulebook and founded the University of Kansas basketball program . Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin , as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament ( 1938 ) and the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship ( 1939 ) . 
 Born in Canada to Scottish immigrants , Naismith studied physical education at McGill University in Montreal before moving to the United States , where he developed basketball in late 1891 while teaching at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield , Massachusetts . After receiving his MD in Denver in 1898 , Naismith moved to the University of Kansas , later becoming the Kansas Jayhawks ' athletic director . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Naismith was born in 1861 in Almonte ( now part of Mississippi Mills ) , Ontario , Canada to parents who had immigrated from Scotland . He never had a middle name and never signed his name with the " A " initial . The " A " was added by someone in the administration at the University of Kansas . In 1982 Dr. Naismith 's only living child stated that his father never had the middle initial " A " . The Basketball Hall of Fame also clarifies this as do other members of his family and personal friends of his . Noted historian Curtis J. Phillips has done extensive research on the subject . 
 Struggling in school but gifted in farm labor , Naismith spent his days outside playing catch , hide @-@ and @-@ seek , or duck on a rock , a medieval game in which a person guards a large drake stone from opposing players , who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it . To play duck on a rock most effectively , Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw , a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball . Orphaned early in his life , Naismith lived with his aunt and uncle for many years and attended grade school at <unk> Corners near Almonte . Then he enrolled in Almonte High School , in Almonte , Ontario , from which he graduated in 1883 . 
 In the same year , Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal . Although described as a slight figure , standing 5 foot 10 ½ and listed at 168 pounds , he was a talented and versatile athlete , representing McGill in Canadian football , lacrosse , rugby , soccer and gymnastics . He played center on the football team , and made himself some padding to protect his ears . It was for personal use , not team use . He won multiple Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances . Naismith earned a BA in Physical Education ( 1888 ) and a Diploma at the Presbyterian College in Montreal ( 1890 ) . From 1891 on , Naismith taught physical education and became the first McGill director of athletics , but then left Montreal to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield , Massachusetts . 
 = = = Springfield College : Invention of " Basket Ball " = = = 
 At Springfield YMCA , Naismith struggled with a rowdy class that was confined to indoor games throughout the harsh New England winter and thus was perpetually short @-@ tempered . Under orders from Dr. Luther Gulick , head of Springfield YMCA Physical Education , Naismith was given 14 days to create an indoor game that would provide an " athletic distraction " : Gulick demanded that it would not take up much room , could help its track athletes to keep in shape and explicitly emphasized to " make it fair for all players and not too rough . " 
 In his attempt to think up a new game , Naismith was guided by three main thoughts . Firstly , he analyzed the most popular games of those times ( rugby , lacrosse , soccer , football , hockey , and baseball ) ; Naismith noticed the hazards of a ball and concluded that the big soft soccer ball was safest . Secondly , he saw that most physical contact occurred while running with the ball , dribbling or hitting it , so he decided that passing was the only legal option . Finally , Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal <unk> , namely placing it high above the player 's heads . To score goals , he forced the players to throw a soft lobbing shot that had proven effective in his old favorite game duck on a rock . Naismith christened this new game " Basket Ball " and put his thoughts together in 13 basic rules . 
 The first game of " Basket Ball " was played in December 1891 . In a handwritten report , Naismith described the circumstances of the inaugural match ; in contrast to modern basketball , the players played nine versus nine , handled a soccer ball , not a basketball , and instead of shooting at two hoops , the goals were a pair of peach baskets : " When Mr. Stubbins <unk> [ sic ] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery . This was about 10 feet from the floor , one at each end of the gymnasium . I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor 's platform , secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class ... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead ... I then explained what they had to do to make goals , tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules . Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball , though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon . " In contrast to modern basketball , the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble . Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court . Also following each " goal " a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court . Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball . 
 In a radio interview in January 1939 , Naismith gave more details of the first game and the initial rules that were used : 
 “ I showed them two peach baskets I ’ d nailed up at each end of the gym , and I told them the idea was to throw the ball into the opposing team ’ s peach basket . I blew a whistle , and the first game of basketball began . … The boys began tackling , kicking and punching in the <unk> . They ended up in a free @-@ for @-@ all in the middle of the gym floor . [ The injury toll : several black eyes , one separated shoulder and one player knocked unconscious . ] “ It certainly was murder . ” [ Naismith changed some of the rules as part of his quest to develop a clean sport . ] The most important one was that there should be no running with the ball . That stopped tackling and slugging . We tried out the game with those [ new ] rules ( fouls ) , and we didn ’ t have one casualty . ” 
 By 1892 , basketball had grown so popular on campus that Dennis <unk> ( editor @-@ in @-@ chief of The Triangle , the Springfield college newspaper ) featured it in an article called " A New Game " , and there were calls to call this new game " Naismith Ball " , but Naismith refused . By 1893 , basketball was introduced internationally by the YMCA movement . From Springfield , Naismith went to Denver where he acquired a medical degree and in 1898 he joined the University of Kansas faculty at Lawrence , Kansas after coaching at Baker University . 
 The family of Lambert G. Will has claimed that Dr. Naismith borrowed components for the game of basketball from Will to dispute Naismith 's sole creation of the game , citing alleged photos and letters . 
 = = = University of Kansas = = = 
 The University of Kansas men 's basketball program officially began in 1898 , following Naismith 's arrival , just six years after Naismith drafted the sport 's first official rules . Naismith was not initially hired to coach basketball , but rather as a chapel director and physical education instructor . In these early days , the majority of the basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams , with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball . Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College . Under Naismith , the team played only one current Big 12 school : Kansas State ( once ) . Naismith was , ironically , the only coach in the program 's history to have a losing record ( 55 – 60 ) . However , Naismith coached Forrest " Phog " Allen , his eventual successor at Kansas , who went on to join his mentor in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame . When Allen became a coach himself and told him that he was going to coach basketball at Baker University in 1904 , Naismith discouraged him : " You can 't coach basketball ; you just play it . " Instead , Allen embarked on a coaching career that would lead him to be known as " the Father of Basketball Coaching . " During his time at Kansas , Allen coached Dean Smith ( 1952 National Championship team ) and Adolph Rupp ( 1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team ) . Allen , Smith and Rupp have joined Naismith as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame . 
 By the turn of the century , there were enough college teams in the East of the U.S. that the first intercollegiate competitions could be played out . Although his sport continuously grew , Naismith long regarded his game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical education . However , basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis . As the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame reports , Naismith was also neither interested in self @-@ promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports . Instead , he was more interested in his physical education career , receiving an honorary PE Masters degree in 1910 , patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916 , traveled to France , published two books ( A Modern College in 1911 and Essence of a Healthy Life in 1918 ) . He took American citizenship in 1925 . 
 In 1935 , the National Association of Basketball Coaches ( created by Naismith 's pupil Phog Allen ) collected money so that the 74 @-@ year @-@ old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games . There , Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams : United States , for the gold medal , Canada , for the silver medal , and Mexico , for their bronze medal win . During the Olympics , he was named the honorary president of the International Basketball Federation . When Naismith returned he commented that seeing the game played by many nations was the greatest compensation he could have received for his invention . In 1937 , Naismith played a role in the formation of the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball , which later became the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) . 
 Naismith became Professor Emeritus in Kansas when he retired in 1937 at the age of 76 . Including his years as coach , Naismith served as athletic director and faculty at the school for a total of almost 40 years . Naismith died in 1939 after he suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage . He was buried in Lawrence , Kansas . His masterwork " Basketball — its Origins and Development " was published posthumously in 1941 . In Lawrence , Kansas , James Naismith has a road named in his honor , Naismith Drive , which runs in front of Allen Fieldhouse ( the official address of Allen Fieldhouse is 1651 Naismith Drive ) , the university 's basketball facility . The university also named the court in Allen Fieldhouse James Naismith Court in his honor , despite Naismith having the worst record in school history . Naismith Hall , a college residential dormitory , is located on the northeastern edge of 19th Street and Naismith Drive .

 In 1898 , Naismith became the first college basketball coach of the University of Kansas basketball team . He compiled a record of 55 – 60 , and is , ironically , the only losing coach in Kansas history . Naismith is at the top of massive and prestigious coaching tree , as he coached Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen , who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith , Adolph Rupp , and Ralph Miller who all coached future coaches as well .

 Naismith was the inventor of basketball and wrote the original 13 rules of this sport . The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield , Massachusetts , is named in his honor , and he was an inaugural inductee in 1959 . The National Collegiate Athletic Association rewards its best players and coaches annually with the Naismith Awards , among them the Naismith College Player of the Year , the Naismith College Coach of the Year and the Naismith Prep Player of the Year . After the Olympic introduction to male athletes in 1936 , women 's basketball became an Olympic event in Montreal during the 1976 Summer Olympics . Naismith was also inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame , the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame , the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame , the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame , the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame , the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame , the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame , FIBA Hall of Fame , and The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame , which was named in his honor . The FIBA Basketball World Cup trophy is named the " James Naismith Trophy " in his honour . On June 21 , 2013 , Dr. Naismith was inducted into the Kansas Hall of Fame during ceremonies in Topeka . 
 Naismith 's home town of Almonte , Ontario , hosts an annual 3 @-@ on @-@ 3 tournament for all ages and skill levels in his honor . Every year this event attracts hundreds of participants and involves over 20 half court games along the main street of the town . All proceeds of the event go to youth basketball programs in the area . 
 Basketball is today played by more than 300 million people worldwide , making it one of the most popular team sports . In North America , basketball has produced some of the most @-@ admired athletes of the 20th century . Polls conducted by ESPN and the Associated Press named basketball player Michael Jordan respectively first and second greatest North American athlete of the 20th century , and both polls featured fellow basketball players Wilt Chamberlain ( of KU , like Naismith ) and Bill Russell in the Top 20 . 
 In December , 2010 , the original rules of basketball written by James Naismith in 1891 , considered to be basketball 's founding document , was auctioned at Sotheby 's in New York . Josh Swade , a University of Kansas alumnus and basketball enthusiast , went on a crusade in 2010 to persuade moneyed alumni to considering bidding on and hopefully winning the document at auction to gift it to the University of Kansas . Swade eventually persuaded David G. Booth , a billionaire investment banker and KU alumnus , and his wife Suzanne Booth to commit to bidding at the auction . The Booths won the bidding and purchased the document for a record $ 4 @,@ 338 @,@ 500 USD , the most ever paid for a sports memorabilia item , and gifted the document to the University of Kansas . Swade 's project and eventual success are chronicled in a 2012 ESPN 30 for 30 documentary " There 's No Place Like Home " and in a corresponding book , " The Holy Grail of Hoops : One Fan 's Quest to Buy the Original Rules of Basketball " . The University of Kansas constructed an $ 18 million building named the <unk> Center , which houses the rules and opened in March 2016 .

 Naismith was the eldest child of Margaret and John Naismith , two Scottish immigrants . His mother , Margaret Young , was born in 1833 and immigrated as the fourth of 11 children to Lanark County , Canada in 1852 . His father , John Naismith , was born in 1833 , left Europe when he was 18 , and also settled down in Lanark County . On June 20 , 1894 , Naismith married Maude Evelyn Sherman ( September 6 , 1870 – March 4 , 1937 ) in Springfield , MA , USA . The couple had five children : Margaret Mason ( Stanley ) ( July 2 , 1895 – October 1976 ) , Helen Carolyn ( Dodd ) ( December 21 , 1897 – August 21 , 1980 ) , John Edwin ( November 3 , 1900 – December 18 , 1986 ) , Maude Ann ( Dawe ) ( October 22 , 1904 – April 1972 ) and James Sherman ( May 7 , 1913 – May 6 , 1980 ) . He was a member of the Pi Gamma Mu and Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternities . Naismith was a Presbyterian minister , and was also remembered as a Freemason . Maude Naismith died in 1937 , and on June 11 , 1939 , he married his second wife Florence B. Kincaid . Naismith suffered a major brain hemorrhage on November 19 the same year and died nine days later in his home located in Lawrence , Kansas . Naismith was 78 years old . Naismith is buried with his first wife in Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence , KS . Florence Kincaid died in 1977 at the age of 98 and is buried with her first husband Dr. Frank B. Kincaid in Elmwood Cemetery in Beloit , KS . 
 During his lifetime , Naismith 's education and academic positions held were as follows : 
 = Sagara Sanosuke = 
 Sagara Sanosuke ( <unk> <unk> ) is a fictional character from the Rurouni Kenshin manga and anime series created by Nobuhiro Watsuki . In the English anime adaptations he is known as Sanosuke Sagara and nicknamed Sano . Watsuki , being a fan of the Shinsengumi , created Sanosuke by basing his name and characteristics on that of a real Shinsengumi member named Harada Sanosuke . 
 Set during a fictional version of Japan in the pre @-@ Meiji period , Sanosuke is a former member of the Sekihō Army . When the group is destroyed by the Meiji Government , he becomes a fighter @-@ for @-@ hire to calm his anger by fighting . During his introduction in the series , he encounters the wanderer Himura Kenshin , who easily defeats him and is able to convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people . After that encounter , Sanosuke becomes Kenshin 's best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights . 
 Sanosuke appears in the featured films of the series and in other media relating to the Rurouni Kenshin franchise , including a plethora of electronic games and original video animations ( OVAs ) . Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Sanosuke 's character . Mania Entertainment praised his character development , noting that he becomes more trustworthy and reliable as the series progresses . SciFi.com referred to him as a " video @-@ game icon " , and noted how he is portrayed as a " tragic figure " . Sanosuke has been popular with the Rurouni Kenshin reader base , placing second in every popularity poll . Merchandise based on Sanosuke has also been released , including key chains , and plush dolls . 
 = = Creation and conception = = 
 Sanosuke was one of the last major figures of the series to be created . Watsuki created him to be Kenshin 's best friend , who is willing to punch him when he is sad to make him " wake up " from his sadness . Although Sanosuke is a main character in the series , Watsuki felt that he could not write everything he wanted about him , and thought that making him the title character of a series would prove interesting . 
 The character is based on Shinsengumi member Harada Sanosuke . Watsuki describes Sanosuke 's visual motif by referring to his design model , Lamp , the main character of Susumu Sendo and Takeshi Obata 's <unk> Bōken Tan Lamp @-@ Lamp . Watsuki , working as an assistant on Obata 's manga , formed the character by doodling in sketchbooks , adding and subtracting elements from the proposed character " with blessings from the original artist , of course . " 
 In July 2006 , the Japanese publishers of Rurouni Kenshin released the kanzenban edition . In the fifth kanzenban , Watsuki redesigned the character of Sanosuke in a draft version . To emphasize his hate of the Meiji Government , Watsuki drew the Japanese kanji for " evil " ( <unk> , aku ) on the back of Sanosuke 's jacket in the original series , but on the kanzenban redesign , the tattoo is located inside his clothes . Unlike in the manga where Sanosuke uses an oversized zanbatō as a weapon , Watsuki gave him a more historically authentic zanbatō ; a sword notably thinner and longer in design . He also gave him an armor @-@ like cloth to make him look more as a warrior . 
 In the anime adaptation of Rurouni Kenshin , Watsuki 's designs were combined with the voice talents of Yūji Ueda , a voice actor . In producing the English dub version of the series , Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke 's voice actor . When writing Sanosuke 's dialogue , Clark Cheng , the writer of the English dub script , noted that the character was smarter than he would have liked in the first few episodes , so Cheng tried slowly to change the character 's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series .

 Born February 1860 in Nagano , Sanosuke is a former member of the Sekihō Army . Having admired his captain Sagara Sōzō , he takes the family name Sagara from him . But when the revolutionary government encounters financial problems , it labels the Sekihō Army as frauds in order to " bury their promises " . Sōzō is executed , leaving Sanosuke as one of the few survivors . Consumed with hatred for the Ishin Shishi , and guilt at not being able to protect his hero , Sanosuke becomes a fight merchant in Tokyo . Over the next ten years , he gains a reputation as one of the strongest hired fighters of the city . The destruction of the Sekihō Army and the loss of all his friends has caused Sanosuke to hate the Meiji Government and he wears the Japanese kanji for " evil " on the back of his jacket . He bears this symbol as a mark of his loyalty towards his past in the Sekihō Army . Sanosuke uses an enormous zanbatō in battle , giving him the moniker Zanza ( <unk> ) . The blade has no edge and Sanosuke only uses it to smash and crush his opponents . 
 In his introduction in the manga , Sanosuke is hired to fight Kenshin , but after the former assassin defeats him , he learns of the truth of Kenshin 's no @-@ kill approach and becomes one of his allies . After Kenshin defeats him and breaks his zanbatō , Sanosuke decides to focus on unarmed combat . When the criminal Shishio Makoto tries to conquer Japan , Sanosuke helps Kenshin in the fight against him . While on his trip to Kyoto to aid him , Sanosuke was trained in kenpo from a warrior monk named <unk> Anji . Anji taught Sanosuke a secret technique called Futae no <unk> ( <unk> , lit . " Mastery of the Two Layers " ) . Futae no <unk> is a special art in which the user performs two hits in quick succession with any part of his body . The first hit with the proximal interphalangeal joint neutralizes the hardness of the target , then the second blow , struck with the proximal phalanx , breaks the target before it recovers from the force of the first blow . Using his mastery from this art with the his right hand allows him to defeat the third most powerful opponent in Shishio 's army : Anji . 
 Months later , in an act of revenge on Kenshin , Yukishiro Enishi fakes Kamiya Kaoru 's death . Kenshin loses the will to live and when Sanosuke is unable to reach him , he wanders away from Tokyo . In his wandering , he is reunited with his family in the Shinano Province ( Shinshū ) . Years prior to the start of the series , Sanosuke left the family at the age of 9 to join the Sekihō Army . Although he does not reveal his identity to his family , upon learning of their poor situation Sanosuke attacks a former Ishin Shishi who was mistreating them and the town . During these fights , Sanosuke 's right hand is permanently damaged from the overuse Futae no <unk> and overcomes this disability when he discovers using both hands in succession which lessens the impact to his damaged hand . After protecting his family , he returns to Tokyo to rescue Kaoru with his friends . After a successful rescue , Sanosuke leaves Japan and travels the world to avoid being arrested for attacking the Ishin Shishi . The manga ends with a letter from Sanosuke to his friends that he is returning to Japan to be reunited with them .

 In the Samurai X The Motion Picture , Sanosuke helps to stop the samurai Takimi Shigure from overthrowing the Meiji Government as an act of revenge . In the original video animations of the series , he is given a more humanized design and a more emotional personality . In the non @-@ canon Samurai X : Reflection , an older Sanosuke discovers Kenshin gravely injured when he is traveling in Asia and sends Kenshin back to Tokyo by himself , contradicting his character development by his creator , Watsuki . Sanosuke is also a playable character in almost all the Rurouni Kenshin video games except Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars , in which he isn 't playable but is available as a Battle koma . 
 In Rurouni Kenshin : Restoration , Sanosuke is hired by Takeda Kanryu to kill Kenshin but he only wishes to fight Kenshin . After losing to Kenshin , Sanosuke agrees to help him with taking care of Kaoru 's dojo . 
 In the live @-@ action film series adapting Rurouni Kenshin , Sanosuke is portrayed by <unk> Aoki . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Among the Rurouni Kenshin reader base Sanosuke has been popular , having ranked second in every Shonen Jump popularity poll of the series and has also ranked fifth in the " Favorite Kenshin 's arch @-@ enemies " polls featuring all Kenshin 's opponents . Merchandise based on Sanosuke has been released , including sweat bands , keychains , and plush dolls . 
 The fact that the CD book voice actors , especially Tomokazu Seki and Megumi Ogata , who portrayed Sanosuke and Kenshin in the CD books , respectively , did not get their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki . Ueda , Sanosuke 's voice actor in the Japanese anime , commented that voicing Sanosuke in the original video animations was very complicated because his character was notably older and he has not acted in the role for a long period . He also said that he would have liked to see more fights involving Sanosuke in the original video animations , but was happy to see that Sanosuke had matured as a character . Lex Lang , the voice actor of Sanosuke in the English adaptation of the anime , commented that his first impression of Sanosuke was as a fight @-@ driven character motivated by anger , but as the story continued Sanosuke became friendly and more likable . Because his voice is noticeably different from Ueda 's , Lang tries to create his own interpretation of Sanosuke 's character . Lang has noted that the scene of the episode 22 of the anime , in which Sanosuke is afraid of a train because he believes it is a demon , was the most enjoyable scene for him to record ; he added " I recently saw it and had some big laughs . " 
 Several anime and manga publications have provided both praise and criticism of Sanosuke 's character . Anime News Network said that Sanosuke 's first fight in the series against Kenshin was stereotypical for an action series due to the differences between Sanosuke 's and Kenshin 's personalities , and to the music used in the anime that gives the impression that Kenshin would win . SciFi.com commended him for being a good source of comic relief and described his appearance as a video @-@ game icon . However , they commented he was a " tragic figure whose goofy <unk> have solid reasons behind them " due to being unable to avoid the destruction of the <unk> army and feeling guilty due to it . Mania Entertainment praised Sanosuke 's character development and transformation from an enemy of Kenshin into one of his most stalwart friends . In the Samurai X : Reflection original video animation , Mike Crandol of Anime News Network referred to Sanosuke 's revised design as " pretty awkward " since Crandol felt Sanosuke 's original character design was " perhaps being too cartoonish to translate well into this new style , " with the " new style " being the " decidedly more realistic look " exhibited in all of the Samurai X original video animations .

 = List of battleships of Greece = 
 In the early 20th century , the Greek Navy embarked on an expansion program to counter a strengthening of Greece 's traditional rival , the Ottoman Empire . The Ottomans ordered a new dreadnought battleship , Reşadiye ; in response , Greece ordered the dreadnought Salamis from a German shipyard . The Ottomans acquired the ex @-@ Brazilian Rio de Janeiro and renamed her Sultân Osmân @-@ ı Evvel . Greece responded with a second battleship ordered in France , Vasilefs Konstantinos , built to the same design as the French Bretagne class . As the Ottomans had a significant head start in battleship construction , the Greek Navy purchased two obsolete American pre @-@ dreadnoughts — USS Mississippi and Idaho — as a stop @-@ gap measure in June 1914 . The ships were renamed Kilkis and Lemnos , respectively . 
 Greek naval plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , however . Work halted on Vasilefs Konstantinos in August and on Salamis in December 1914 . As a result , Kilkis and Lemnos were the only battleships delivered to Greece . Greece remained neutral for the first three years of World War I , though in October 1916 , France seized the Greek Navy and disarmed both of the battleships . They remained inactive for the rest of the war . Both ships saw service in 1919 – 1922 during the Greco – Turkish War . They continued to serve with the fleet until the early 1930s , when they were reduced to secondary roles . Lemnos became a barracks ship while Kilkis became a training ship . During the German invasion of Greece in April 1940 , both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis by Ju 87 Stuka dive @-@ bombers . The two old battleships were scrapped after the end of the war .

 Starting in 1911 , the Ottoman Empire — Greece 's traditional naval rival — set about modernizing its fleet . That year , the Ottomans ordered the dreadnought Reşadiye . The expansion of Ottoman naval power threatened Greek control of the Aegean ; to counter the Ottoman dreadnought , Greece decided to order a dreadnought of its own , Salamis , from a German shipyard . The keel was laid down on 23 July 1913 ; the hull was complete and ready for launching by 11 November 1914 . However , the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 interrupted her completion ; work stopped on 31 December 1914 . The guns that had been ordered for the ship in the United States were instead sold by the manufacturer , Bethlehem Steel , to the Royal Navy to arm the British Abercrombie @-@ class monitors . After the end of the war , the Greek Navy refused to accept the incomplete hull . She was eventually scrapped in 1932 following a lengthy arbitration between the Greek Navy and the German shipyard .

The new battleship was to be named Vasilefs Konstantinos and was to be built to the same design as the French Bretagne class from AC de St Nazaire <unk> . Work began in June 1914 but ceased on the outbreak of war in August and never resumed .

 Kilkis and Lemnos were built by the US Navy between 1904 and 1908 , originally named Mississippi and Idaho .

They were needed to counter Ottoman naval expansion while the Greeks waited on their newly ordered dreadnoughts to be completed abroad . The two ships reached Greece in July 1914 , just before the outbreak of World War I at the end of the month . As Greece remained neutral during the first three years of the war , the two ships saw little service . In October 1916 , the French seized the Greek fleet and disarmed Kilkis and Lemnos ; they were put back into service at the end of the war . Both ships saw service during the Greco – Turkish War in 1919 – 1922 , with Lemnos also participating in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War . 
 Both ships continued to see service in the Greek fleet until the early 1930s , with Kilkis serving as the flagship of the fleet . In 1932 , Lemnos was disarmed and used as a barracks ship , and Kilkis was reduced to a training ship . Lemnos was used as a barracks ship after 1937 , and Kilkis became a floating battery at Salamis Naval Base in 1940 . During the German invasion of Greece in April 1941 , both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis . German Ju @-@ 87 Stuka dive @-@ bombers bombed both ships in the harbor ; Kilkis was sunk outright while Lemnos was beached to avoid sinking . Both ships were broken up after the end of the war . 
 = Russian language in Israel = 
 The Russian language in Israel is spoken natively by a large proportion of the population , reaching about 20 percent of the total population by 1989 , mostly by immigrants who came from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s and later years . It is a major foreign language in the country and is used in many aspects of life . Russian is by far the most used non @-@ official native language in Israel . The government and businesses often provide information in Russian , and it is semi @-@ official in some areas with high concentration of Russian Jewish immigrants . The Russian @-@ speaking population of Israel is the world 's third @-@ largest population of Russian native @-@ speakers living outside the former Soviet Union territories after Germany and the United States , and the highest as a proportion of the population . As of 2013 , 1 @,@ 231 @,@ 003 residents of the Post @-@ Soviet states have immigrated to Israel . 
 = = History = = 
 The first large scale immigration of Russian @-@ speaking Soviet Jews to post @-@ 1948 Israel occurred during the 1970s , but the " great migration " did not start until the late 1980s , during the last years of the Soviet Union . 
 About 100 @,@ 000 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel from 1971 to 1974 . Most of them were from Georgia ; the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania ; and areas annexed by the Red Army in 1939 – 1940 , mostly Poland . Soviet authorities allowed this emigration by calling it " family reunification , " to avoid the appearance that anyone was unhappy living in the Soviet state . These emigrants held strongly Zionist views and took the opportunity to settle in their historic homeland . Less than half of those who emigrated in the 1970s wave came from Slavic countries , i.e. , Russia , Ukraine , Belarus , even though about 80 % of Soviet Jews lived there at the time . 
 The Soviet Union was generally anti @-@ Semitic ; Zionist activities inside its borders were considered treason that could lead to execution , and , after 1967 , Israel was considered an enemy state . It was not until Perestroika that Jewish activists were given freedom to operate . The emigration that took place from 1989 to 1993 is described as a " panic migration " , due to the socio @-@ economic crisis in the Soviet states , rather than a migration of " born @-@ again " Jews . Many of them did not have any relation to Judaism or Zionism in their former place of residence . Most immigrants of this period came from Russia and Ukraine , and to a lesser extent from Belarus and Central Asia . 
 The " old immigrants " of the 1970s , who mainly came to Israel for Zionist feelings , viewed people who came during the wave of the 1980s and 1990s as people escaping a harsh economic situation who did not have much appreciation for their new homeland . The last Soviet census of 1989 indicated 1 @,@ 449 @,@ 000 Jews living in the country , of which about 877 @,@ 000 had moved to Israel by October 2000 . The wave of immigration in this short period of time was the greatest influx of people to Israel since the date of its creation . Immigrants from the former Soviet Union composed 50 % – 70 % of the newcomers . The number of people who came to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s outnumbered the number of people who came during the 1970s by four times , which made it harder for them to be integrated into the mainstream society of such a small country . 
 An estimated 250 @,@ 000 of immigrants are not <unk> Jewish ( which only recognises maternal descent ) , but rather considered Jewish under the law of return due to having at least one Jewish grandparent , or being the spouse of Jewish immigrants who received Israeli citizenship according to the Law of Return . 
 = = Today = = 
 = = = Integration into Israeli society = = = 
 Although Hebrew courses are offered to every immigrant , some Russians have declined . About 26 percent of Russian immigrants do not speak fluent Hebrew . Russians often settle close to each other , forming Russian @-@ speaking neighborhoods with store window advertisements in Russian and banks with at least a few Russian @-@ speaking workers . Ashdod , the fifth largest city in Israel , absorbed a particularly large number of immigrants , accepting over 100 @,@ 000 Soviet Jews from 1990 to 2001 . The <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> neighborhoods in southern Ashdod , where immigrants account for 75 percent of the population of 26 @,@ 000 , were dubbed " Israel 's Russian ghetto " . 
 The process of integration into mainstream Israeli society is slow , because many Russian @-@ speaking adults prefer to not learn Hebrew and are reluctant to give up their Russian cultural background . Language professors Elana <unk> and Bernard <unk> attributed this to a " strong loyalty to their ethnic language " . 
 Hayim Gordon describes the situation in his 2007 book Israel today : 
 Today , Russian is in a much better position than Arabic , which is an official language in the country . The Russian @-@ speaking adult population , which is less competitive in Hebrew than the youth , mostly tries to preserve the common Russian cultural background , teaching it to their children born in Israel . However , according to <unk> and <unk> , second generation Israelis of Russian origin " do not receive a formal education in Russian " and , as a result , " language attrition is rapid " . Political scientist Ze 'ev <unk> opined , " The Russian @-@ speaking community is identifiable , but it is part of the Israeli collective . The second generation is much more influenced by its Israeli experience than its Soviet past . " In 2001 , camp counselors in Ashdod volunteered to help youths accommodate to Israeli lifestyle , and those that participated in the program said that " they feel Israeli in every respect " . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 Roughly 20 percent of Israel 's population was born in Russia , and , as of 2013 , the Russian @-@ speaking community accounts for 15 percent of Israel 's eligible voters . Ze 'ev <unk> surmised that Russian Jews in Israel tend to be politically conservative , estimating that 50 to 60 percent support the Likud <unk> party . 
 Israeli journalist Lily <unk> attributed this to being in part due to an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli @-@ Palestinian peace process . She explained , " They come from this huge empire to this tiny Israel and they say : ' Is that all , is that the country ? And what , you want to give back the territories ? Who gives up territory in the first place ! And in this small country . You must be kidding ! ' " Russian @-@ speaking Israeli analyst Igor <unk> stated that this also resulted from the Russian @-@ speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil , saying , " Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time . And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue , they just want to solve the problems swiftly . " 
 = = Status and usage = = 
 Hebrew and Arabic are the only official languages of the State of Israel . 
 Russian and a number of other immigrant languages are widely used in Israel , because ethnic Jews from dozens of countries from all around the world have settled in the area . Russian is the major immigrant language of Jews living in Israel . Since 1967 , millions of Russian Jews have settled in the country , and a great influx of Jews from the post @-@ Soviet states took place in the 1990s . Today , Russian is used in cultural events , the educational system and other public domains . 
 By 1999 , about 5 to 10 percent of all jobs in Israel were held by Russian speakers . The Ministry of Transport published booklets and manuals in Russian . It is very likely to find Russian @-@ speaking doctors at hospitals . 
 = = Education = = 
 Most Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union were highly educated with almost 45 percent of them having some kind of higher education . 
 Despite the fact that the native language of a significant part of the country 's population is Russian , the language occupies a modest role in Israel 's education system . Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962 . In public schools , the first Russian @-@ language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities . The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down . In the 1990s , a Russian @-@ language program carried out by local governments called Na <unk> 16 included some 1 @,@ 500 students . In 1997 , about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another . 
 = = Media = = 
 Traditionally , Russian speakers read newspapers and listen to radio more often than Hebrew speakers . 
 Nasha <unk> was the major Russian @-@ newspaper in Israel during the 1970s , when it competed with Tribuna for the immigrant reader . In 1989 , there was only one daily in Russian , and 6 in 1996 . Since the 2000s , the number of Russian @-@ language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media . Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew , Arabic , and Russian . In 2002 , the Israeli Russian @-@ speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched . It is also known as Israel Plus . In November 2007 , a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages , with 5 in Russian . Today , there are four dailies , 11 weeklies , five <unk> and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel , with a total circulation of about 250 @,@ 000 during weekends . Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel . 
 = Richmond Bridge , London = 
 Richmond Bridge is an 18th @-@ century stone arch bridge that crosses the River Thames at Richmond , connecting the two halves of the present @-@ day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames . It was designed by James Paine and Kenton Couse . 
 The bridge , which is a Grade I listed , was built between 1774 and 1777 , as a replacement for a ferry crossing which connected Richmond town centre on the east bank with its neighbouring district of East Twickenham to the west . Its construction was privately funded by a tontine scheme , for which tolls were charged until 1859 . Because the river meanders from its general west to east direction , flowing from southeast to northwest in this part of London , what would otherwise be known as the north and south banks are often referred to as the " Middlesex " ( Twickenham ) and " Surrey " ( Richmond ) banks respectively , named after the historic counties to which each side once belonged . 
 The bridge was widened and slightly flattened in 1937 – 40 , but otherwise still conforms to its original design . The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London , it is today the oldest surviving Thames bridge in London . 
 = = Background = = 
 The small town of Sheen on the Surrey bank of the Thames , 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of the City of London or 16 miles ( 26 km ) by river , had been the site of a royal palace since 1299 . After it was destroyed by fire in 1497 , Henry VII built a new palace on the site , naming it Richmond Palace after his historic title of Earl of Richmond , and the central part of Sheen became known as Richmond . 
 Although a ferry had almost certainly existed at the site of the present @-@ day bridge since Norman times , the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439 . The service was owned by the Crown , and operated by two boats , a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts ; the Twickenham Ferry , slightly upstream , was also in service from at least 1652 . However , due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore @-@ line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts , forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge . 
 In the 18th century Richmond and neighbouring Twickenham on the opposite bank of the Thames , both of which were distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river , became extremely fashionable , and their populations began to grow rapidly . As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions , the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck . 
 Local resident William Windham had been sub @-@ tutor to Prince William , Duke of Cumberland , and was the former husband of Mary , Lady Deloraine , mistress to George II . As a reward for his services , George II leased Windham the right to operate the ferry until 1798 . Windham sub @-@ let the right to operate the ferry to local resident Henry Holland . With the ferry unable to serve the demands of the area , in 1772 Windham sought Parliamentary approval to replace the ferry with a wooden bridge , to be paid for by tolls . 
 = = Design = = 
 The plans for a wooden bridge proved unpopular , and in 1772 the Richmond Bridge Act was passed by Parliament , selecting 90 commissioners , including landscape architect Lancelot " Capability " Brown , historian and politician Horace Walpole and playwright and actor David Garrick , to oversee the construction of a stone bridge on the site of the ferry . The Act stipulated that no tax of any sort could be used to finance the bridge , and fixed a scale of tolls , ranging from ½ d for a pedestrian to 2s 6d for a coach drawn by six horses ( about 50p and £ 14 respectively in 2016 ) . Henry Holland was granted £ 5 @,@ 350 ( about £ 613 @,@ 100 in 2016 ) compensation for the loss of the ferry service . The commission appointed James Paine and Kenton Couse to design and build the new bridge . 
 The Act specified that the bridge was to be built on the site of the existing ferry " or as much lower down the river as the Commission can settle " . Local residents lobbied for it to be built at Water Lane , a short distance downstream from the ferry site . The approach to the river was relatively flat , avoiding the steep slope to the existing ferry pier on the Surrey bank . However , the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle refused to allow the approach road on the Middlesex bank to pass through her land at Twickenham Park , and the commission was forced to build on the site of the ferry , despite a steep 1 in 16 ( 6 @.@ 25 % ) incline . 
 The bridge was designed as a stone arch bridge of 300 feet ( 91 m ) in length and 24 feet 9 inches ( 7 @.@ 54 m ) in width , supported by five elliptical arches of varying heights . The tall 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) wide central span was designed to allow shipping to pass , giving Richmond Bridge a distinctive humpbacked appearance . It was built in Portland stone , and ran between Ferry Hill ( Bridge Street today ) on the Surrey side and Richmond Road on the Middlesex side ; sharp curves in the approach roads on the Middlesex side ( still in existence today ) were needed to avoid the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle 's land at Twickenham Park . Palladian toll houses were built in alcoves at each end . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The building was put out to tender , and on 16 May 1774 Thomas Kerr was awarded the contract to build the bridge for the sum of £ 10 @,@ 900 ( about £ 1 @.@ 24 million in 2016 ) . With additional costs , such as compensating landowners and building new approach roads , total costs came to approximately £ 26 @,@ 000 ( about £ 2 @.@ 98 million in 2016 ) . 
 Most of the money needed was raised from the sale of shares at £ 100 each ( approximately £ 11 @,@ 500 in 2016 ) in two tontine schemes , the first for £ 20 @,@ 000 and the second for £ 5 @,@ 000 . The first was appropriately called the Richmond @-@ Bridge Tontine , but when it became clear that the initial £ 20 @,@ 000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second tontine was set up . Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4 % per annum , so £ 1 @,@ 000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two <unk> . On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders . To avoid fraud , each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend . Any revenue over the £ 1 @,@ 000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge . 
 Construction began on 23 August 1774 . The Prince of Wales was invited to lay the first stone but declined , and so the stone was laid by commission member Henry Hobart . The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777 , at which time the ferry service was closed , although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777 . A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end , giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns . 
 = = Operation = = 
 There was no formal opening ceremony , and little initial recorded public reaction . However , the bridge soon became much admired for its design ; an article in The London Magazine in 1779 said that the bridge was " a simple , yet elegant structure , and , from its happy situation , is ... one of the most beautiful ornaments of the river ... from whatever point of view the bridge is beheld , it presents the spectator with one of the richest landscapes nature and art ever produced by their joint efforts , and connoisseurs in painting will instantly be reminded of some of the best performances of Claude Lorraine " . James Paine proudly illustrated it among the designs in the second volume of his Plans , Elevations , and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen 's Houses , 1783 . Richmond Bridge was the subject of paintings by many leading artists , including Thomas Rowlandson , John Constable and local resident J. M. W. Turner . 
 Severe penalties were imposed for vandalising the bridge . The Richmond Bridge Act 1772 specified that the punishment for " willful or malicious damage " to the bridge should be " transportation to one of His Majesty 's Colonies in America for the space of seven years " . A warning against damage can still be seen on the milestone at the Surrey end of the bridge . 
 Richmond Bridge was a commercial success , generating £ 1 @,@ 300 per annum in tolls ( about £ 83 @,@ 190 in 2016 ) in 1810 . By 1822 , the company had accumulated a sufficient surplus that all vehicle tolls were reduced to one penny . 
 On 10 March 1859 the last subscriber to the main tontine died , having for over five years received the full £ 800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine , and with the death of its last member the scheme expired . On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll @-@ free . A large procession made its way to the bridge , where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges . The toll houses were demolished , replaced by seating in 1868 ; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83 years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge 's maintenance . 
 In 1846 the first railway line reached Richmond . Richmond <unk> opened in 1848 , and Richmond began to develop into a significant town . The District Railway ( later the District line ) reached Richmond in 1877 , connecting it to the London Underground . Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable , leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas . 
 = = 20th @-@ century remodelling = = 
 By the early 20th century the bridge was proving inadequate for the increasing traffic , particularly with the introduction of motorised transport , and a 10 miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) speed limit was enforced . With the remaining investment income from tolls insufficient to pay for major reconstruction , on 31 March 1931 the bridge was taken into the joint public ownership of Surrey and Middlesex councils , and proposals were made to widen it . The plans were strongly opposed on aesthetic grounds , and the decision was taken to build instead a new bridge a short distance downstream to relieve traffic pressure . 
 The new Twickenham Bridge opened in 1933 , but Richmond Bridge was still unable to handle the volume of traffic , so in 1933 Sir Harley Dalrymple @-@ Hay proposed possible methods for widening the bridge without significantly affecting its appearance . The cheapest of Dalrymple @-@ Hay 's proposals , to transfer the footpaths onto stone corbels projecting from the sides of the bridge thus freeing the entire width for vehicle traffic , was rejected on aesthetic grounds , and a proposal to widen the bridge on both sides was rejected as impractical . A proposal to widen the bridge on the upstream side was settled on as causing the least disruption to nearby buildings , and in 1934 it was decided to widen the bridge by 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) , at a cost of £ 73 @,@ 000 ( about £ 4 @.@ 67 million in 2016 ) . 
 The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was appointed to carry out the rebuilding . In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened ; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940 . Throughout the redevelopment , a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times . It was found that the 18th @-@ century foundations , consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed , had largely rotted away , and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations . During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps , reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge 's central section .

 James Paine went on to design three other Thames bridges after Richmond , at Chertsey ( 1783 ) , Kew ( 1783 ) , and Walton ( 1788 ) . Paine and Couse renewed their working relationship on the design of Chertsey Bridge , the only one of the three still in existence . Paine became High Sheriff of Surrey in 1783 . 
 In 1962 , Richmond Council announced the replacement of the <unk> on the bridge with electric lighting . The Richmond Society , a local pressure group , protested at the change to the character of the bridge , and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp @-@ posts , converted to electric light , which remain in place today . 
 In the history of Richmond Bridge there have only been two reported serious collisions between boats and the bridge . On 20 March 1964 , three boats tied together at Eel Pie Island , 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) upstream , broke from their moorings in a storm and were swept downstream , colliding with the bridge . Although no serious damage was caused to the bridge , the Princess Beatrice , an 1896 steamer once used by Gilbert and Sullivan , was damaged beyond repair . On 30 January 1987 , the Brave Goose , the £ 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 yacht of National Car Parks founder Sir Donald Gosling , became wedged under the central arch of the bridge , eventually being freed at low tide the next day . 
 The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London , Richmond Bridge is currently the oldest surviving bridge over the Thames in Greater London , and the oldest Thames bridge between the sea and Abingdon Bridge in Oxfordshire . Richmond Bridge was Grade I listed in 1952 and it is the only Georgian bridge over the Thames in London . Its bicentenary was celebrated on 7 May 1977 ; the commemoration was held four months after the actual anniversary of 12 January , to avoid poor weather conditions . 
 Just to the south of the bridge , in a park at the Richmond end , is a bust of the first president of Chile , Bernardo O 'Higgins . He studied in Richmond from 1795 until 1798 , and in 1998 , 200 years after he left Richmond , the bust , whose sculptor is unknown , was unveiled . The patch of ground which the statue overlooks is called " O 'Higgins Square " . The Mayor of Richmond lays a wreath at the bust every year in the presence of staff from the Chilean Embassy in London . 
 = New York State Route 990V = 
 New York State Route 990V ( NY 990V ) is an east – west reference route in Schoharie County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 6 @.@ 15 miles ( 9 @.@ 90 km ) from an intersection with NY 30 in the town of Gilboa to a junction with County Route 18 ( CR 18 ) in the town of Conesville , where the road continues east as CR 3 . Reference routes in New York are typically unsigned ; however , NY 990V is fully signed with touring route markers . The road is a remnant of New York State Route 342 , a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The NY 342 designation was removed in the late 1940s ; however , its former routing from Gilboa to Conesville remained a state highway and became NY 990V when the modern reference route system in New York was created . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 990V begins northwest of the Schoharie Reservoir at an intersection with NY 30 in the town of Gilboa . The route heads northeast around the reservoir as a two @-@ lane highway , intersecting CR 13 ( Stryker Road ) in an area of open fields before crossing Schoharie Creek a short distance downstream from the Gilboa Dam . On the opposite bank of the creek , the highway quickly passes through the small hamlet of Gilboa , located at a junction with CR 17 ( Flat Creek Road ) . Outside of Gilboa , NY 990V turns to the southeast , paralleling the eastern edge of the reservoir as it runs through a stretch of forests and passes directly south of Gilboa @-@ Conesville Central School . The wooded areas give way to slightly more open terrain in the adjacent town of Conesville , where the route meets CR 39 ( Prattsville Road ) just east of the town line . CR 39 heads south from this point , taking over as the primary waterside roadway while NY 990V heads east into a valley surrounding Manor Kill . 
 Not far from CR 39 , the route enters the hamlet of West Conesville , another small community built up around NY 990V 's junction with CR 59 ( Bull Hill Road ) . The road continues northeastward from West Conesville , serving a handful of scattered homes separated by stretches of woodland and open fields . This sparsely developed section along the northern bank of Manor Kill ultimately leads to the hamlet of Conesville , located at an intersection with CR 18 ( Bear Kill Road ) . NY 990V ends at the junction , and its right @-@ of @-@ way continues east toward NY 145 in Durham as CR 3 ( Potter Mountain Road ) . Reference routes in New York are typically not signed with touring route markers , as most are short connector roads or are known by other , more prominent names . NY 990V , however , is fully signed as a touring route . 
 = = History = = 
 Modern NY 990V was gradually taken over by the state of New York over the course of the early 20th century . The portion east of Schoharie Creek became state @-@ maintained on August 28 , 1917 , following a $ 46 @,@ 774 project ( equivalent to $ 863 @,@ 922 in 2016 ) to improve the existing road to state highway standards . The rest of the highway was added as a state road in the late 1920s . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the Gilboa – Conesville state highway was designated as part of NY 342 , a new route extending from NY 30 west of the hamlet of Gilboa to the Conesville hamlet of <unk> . 
 By the following year , NY 342 was truncated westward to the hamlet of Conesville while a highway between NY 23 near South Gilboa and NY 30 southwest of Gilboa was designated as NY 297 . The NY 297 designation was short @-@ lived as it was removed c . 1936 . NY 342 was extended westward over the former routing of NY 297 in the mid @-@ 1940s ; however , the designation was eliminated in the late 1940s . While the portion west of NY 30 became CR 14 , the section east of NY 30 was retained as a state highway . When the modern reference route system was created , the Gilboa – Conesville state highway was designated as NY 990V .

 = Decompression sickness = 
 Decompression sickness ( DCS ; also known as divers ' disease , the bends or caisson disease ) describes a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation . DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression ( i.e. , during ascent ) , but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as working in a caisson , flying in unpressurised aircraft , and extravehicular activity from spacecraft . 
 Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body , DCS can produce many symptoms , and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death . Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day , and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all . The classification of types of DCS by its symptoms has evolved since its original description over a hundred years ago . 
 Exposure to DCS on diving can be managed through proper decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon . Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers universally use dive tables or dive computers to limit their exposure and to control their ascent speed . If DCS is contracted , it is treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber . If treated early , there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery . 
 DCS is a subset of Decompression illness ( DCI ) which includes both DCS and Arterial gas embolism ( AGE ) . 
 = = Classification = = 
 DCS is classified by symptoms . The earliest descriptions of DCS used the terms : " bends " for joint or skeletal pain ; " chokes " for breathing problems ; and " staggers " for neurological problems . In 1960 , Golding et al. introduced a simpler classification using the term " Type I ( ' simple ' ) " for symptoms involving only the skin , musculoskeletal system , or lymphatic system , and " Type II ( ' serious ' ) " for symptoms where other organs ( such as the central nervous system ) are involved . Type II DCS is considered more serious and usually has worse outcomes . This system , with minor modifications , may still be used today . Following changes to treatment methods , this classification is now much less useful in diagnosis , since neurological symptoms may develop after the initial presentation , and both Type I and Type II DCS have the same initial management . 
 = = = Decompression illness and <unk> = = = 
 The term <unk> encompasses decompression sickness , arterial gas embolism , and barotrauma , whereas decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism are commonly classified together as decompression illness when a precise diagnosis cannot be made . DCS and arterial gas embolism are treated very similarly because they are both the result of gas bubbles in the body . The U.S. Navy prescribes identical treatment for Type II DCS and arterial gas embolism . Their spectra of symptoms also overlap , although those from arterial gas embolism are generally more severe because they often arise from an infarction ( blockage of blood supply and tissue death ) . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 While bubbles can form anywhere in the body , DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders , elbows , knees , and ankles . Joint pain ( " the bends " ) accounts for about 60 % to 70 % of all altitude DCS cases , with the shoulder being the most common site . Neurological symptoms are present in 10 % to 15 % of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom . Skin manifestations are present in about 10 % to 15 % of cases . Pulmonary DCS ( " the chokes " ) is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre @-@ breathing protocols . The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types . 
 = = = Frequency = = = 
 The distribution of symptoms of DCS observed by the U.S. Navy are as follows : 
 = = = Onset = = = 
 Although onset of DCS can occur rapidly after a dive , in more than half of all cases symptoms do not begin to appear for at least an hour . In extreme cases , symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed . The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International , a leading technical diver training organization , have published a table that indicates onset of first symptoms . The table does not differentiate between types of DCS , or types of symptom . 
 = = Causes = = 
 DCS is caused by a reduction in ambient pressure that results in the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body . It may happen when leaving a high @-@ pressure environment , ascending from depth , or ascending to altitude . 
 = = = Ascent from depth = = = 
 DCS is best known as a diving disorder that affects divers having breathed gas that is at a higher pressure than the surface pressure , owing to the pressure of the surrounding water . The risk of DCS increases when diving for extended periods or at greater depth , without ascending gradually and making the decompression stops needed to slowly reduce the excess pressure of inert gases dissolved in the body . The specific risk factors are not well understood and some divers may be more susceptible than others under identical conditions . DCS has been confirmed in rare cases of breath @-@ holding divers who have made a sequence of many deep dives with short surface intervals ; and it may be the cause of the disease called <unk> by South Pacific island natives who for centuries have dived by breath @-@ holding for food and pearls . 
 Two principal factors control the risk of a diver suffering DCS : 
 the rate and duration of gas absorption under pressure – the deeper or longer the dive the more gas is absorbed into body tissue in higher concentrations than normal ( Henry 's Law ) ; 
 the rate and duration of outgassing on depressurization – the faster the ascent and the shorter the interval between dives the less time there is for absorbed gas to be offloaded safely through the lungs , causing these gases to come out of solution and form " micro bubbles " in the blood . 
 Even when the change in pressure causes no immediate symptoms , rapid pressure change can cause permanent bone injury called <unk> osteonecrosis ( DON ) . DON can develop from a single exposure to rapid decompression . 
 = = = Leaving a high @-@ pressure environment = = = 
 When workers leave a pressurized caisson or a mine that has been pressurized to keep water out , they will experience a significant reduction in ambient pressure . A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space @-@ walk or extra @-@ vehicular activity , where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle . 
 The original name for DCS was " caisson disease " . This term was introduced in the 19th century , when caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding large engineering excavations below the water table , such as bridge supports and tunnels . Workers spending time in high ambient pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson if the pressure is not reduced slowly . DCS was a major factor during construction of Eads Bridge , when 15 workers died from what was then a mysterious illness , and later during construction of the Brooklyn Bridge , where it incapacitated the project leader Washington Roebling . 
 = = = Ascent to altitude = = = 
 Passengers may be at risk of DCS when an unpressurized aircraft ascends to high altitude . Likewise , there is increased risk for divers flying in any aircraft shortly after diving , since even in a pressurized aircraft the cabin pressure is not maintained at sea @-@ level pressure but may drop to as low as 73 % of sea level pressure . 
 Altitude DCS became a common problem in the 1930s with the development of high @-@ altitude balloon and aircraft flights . Today , cabin pressurization systems maintain commercial aircraft cabin pressure at the equivalent altitude of 2 @,@ 400 m ( 7 @,@ 900 ft ) or less , allowing safe flights at 12 @,@ 000 m ( 39 @,@ 000 ft ) or more . DCS is very rare in healthy individuals who experience pressures equivalent to this altitude . However , since the pressure in the cabin is not actually maintained at sea @-@ level pressure , there is still a risk of DCS in individuals having dived recently . Also , cabin pressurization systems fail occasionally , and some people may be vulnerable to the drop in pressure that occurs even in pressurized aircraft . 
 There is no specific altitude threshold that can be considered safe for everyone and below which no one will develop altitude DCS . Nevertheless , there is very little evidence of altitude DCS occurring among healthy individuals ( who have not been underwater diving ) at pressure altitudes below 5 @,@ 500 m ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) . The higher the altitude of exposure the greater is the risk of developing altitude DCS . Although exposures to incremental altitudes above 5 @,@ 500 m ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) show an incremental risk of altitude DCS , they do not show a direct relationship with the severity of the various types of DCS . Individual exposures to pressure altitudes between 5 @,@ 500 m ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) and 7 @,@ 500 m ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) have shown a low occurrence of altitude DCS . A US Air Force study of altitude DCS cases reported that 87 % of incidents occurred at 7 @,@ 500 m ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) or higher . High altitude parachutists performing a HALO jump may develop altitude DCS if they do not flush nitrogen from the body by pre @-@ breathing pure oxygen . 
 = = <unk> factors = = 
 Although the occurrence of DCS is not easily predictable , many predisposing factors are known . They may be considered as either environmental or individual . Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving are associated with certain demographic , environmental , and dive style factors . A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors : age , gender , body mass index , smoking , asthma , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , previous decompression illness , years since certification , dives in the last year , number of diving days , number of dives in a repetitive series , last dive depth , nitrox use , and drysuit use . No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , smoking , or body mass index . Increased depth , previous DCI , larger number of consecutive days diving , and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism . Nitrox and drysuit use , greater frequency of diving in the past year , increasing age , and years since certification were associated with lower risk , possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience . 
 = = = Environmental = = = 
 The following environmental factors have been shown to increase the risk of DCS : 
 the magnitude of the pressure reduction ratio – a large pressure reduction ratio is more likely to cause DCS than a small one . 
 repetitive exposures – repetitive dives within a short period of time ( a few hours ) increase the risk of developing DCS . Repetitive ascents to altitudes above 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) within similar short periods increase the risk of developing altitude DCS . 
 the rate of ascent – the faster the ascent the greater the risk of developing DCS . The US Navy Dive Manual indicates that ascent rates greater than about 20 m / min ( 66 ft / min ) when diving increase the chance of DCS , while recreational dive tables such as the Bühlmann tables require an ascent rate of 10 m / min ( 33 ft / min ) with the last 6 m ( 20 ft ) taking at least one minute . An individual exposed to a rapid decompression ( high rate of ascent ) above 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) has a greater risk of altitude DCS than being exposed to the same altitude but at a lower rate of ascent . 
 the duration of exposure – the longer the duration of the dive , the greater is the risk of DCS . Longer flights , especially to altitudes of 5 @,@ 500 m ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) and above , carry a greater risk of altitude DCS . 
 underwater diving before flying – divers who ascend to altitude soon after a dive increase their risk of developing DCS even if the dive itself was within the dive table safe limits . Dive tables make provisions for post @-@ dive time at surface level before flying to allow any residual excess nitrogen to outgas . However , the pressure maintained inside even a pressurized aircraft may be as low as the pressure equivalent to an altitude of 2 @,@ 400 m ( 7 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level . Therefore , the assumption that the dive table surface interval occurs at normal atmospheric pressure is invalidated by flying during that surface interval , and an otherwise @-@ safe dive may then exceed the dive table limits . 
 diving before travelling to altitude – DCS can occur without flying if the person moves to a high @-@ altitude location on land immediately after diving , for example , scuba divers in Eritrea who drive from the coast to the Asmara plateau at 2 @,@ 400 m ( 7 @,@ 900 ft ) increase their risk of DCS . 
 diving at altitude – diving in water whose surface altitude is above 300 m ( 980 ft ) — for example , Lake Titicaca is at 3 @,@ 800 m ( 12 @,@ 500 ft ) — without using versions of decompression tables or dive computers that are modified for high @-@ altitude . 
 = = = Individual = = = 
 The following individual factors have been identified as possibly contributing to increased risk of DCS : 
 dehydration – Studies by Walder concluded that decompression sickness could be reduced in aviators when the serum surface tension was raised by drinking isotonic saline , and the high surface tension of water is generally regarded as helpful in controlling bubble size . Maintaining proper hydration is recommended . 
 patent foramen ovale – a hole between the atrial chambers of the heart in the fetus is normally closed by a flap with the first breaths at birth . In about 20 % of adults the flap does not completely seal , however , allowing blood through the hole when coughing or during activities that raise chest pressure . In diving , this can allow venous blood with microbubbles of inert gas to bypass the lungs , where the bubbles would otherwise be filtered out by the lung capillary system , and return directly to the arterial system ( including arteries to the brain , spinal cord and heart ) . In the arterial system , bubbles ( arterial gas embolism ) are far more dangerous because they block circulation and cause infarction ( tissue death , due to local loss of blood flow ) . In the brain , infarction results in stroke , and in the spinal cord it may result in paralysis . 
 a person 's age – there are some reports indicating a higher risk of altitude DCS with increasing age . 
 previous injury – there is some indication that recent joint or limb injuries may predispose individuals to developing decompression @-@ related bubbles . 
 ambient temperature – there is some evidence suggesting that individual exposure to very cold ambient temperatures may increase the risk of altitude DCS . Decompression sickness risk can be reduced by increased ambient temperature during decompression following dives in cold water . 
 body type – typically , a person who has a high body fat content is at greater risk of DCS . This is due to nitrogen 's five times greater solubility in fat than in water , leading to greater amounts of total body dissolved nitrogen during time at pressure . Fat represents about 15 – 25 percent of a healthy adult 's body , but stores about half of the total amount of nitrogen ( about 1 litre ) at normal pressures . 
 alcohol consumption – although alcohol consumption increases dehydration and therefore may increase susceptibility to DCS , a 2005 study found no evidence that alcohol consumption increases the incidence of DCS . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 <unk> causes inert gases , which were dissolved under higher pressure , to come out of physical solution and form gas bubbles within the body . These bubbles produce the symptoms of decompression sickness . Bubbles may form whenever the body experiences a reduction in pressure , but not all bubbles result in DCS . The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by Henry 's Law , which indicates that , when the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased , the amount of that gas dissolved in the liquid will also decrease proportionately . 
 On ascent from a dive , inert gas comes out of solution in a process called " outgassing " or " offgassing " . Under normal conditions , most offgassing occurs by gas exchange in the lungs . If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body . The formation of bubbles in the skin or joints results in milder symptoms , while large numbers of bubbles in the venous blood can cause lung damage . The most severe types of DCS interrupt — and ultimately damage — spinal cord function , leading to paralysis , sensory dysfunction , or death . In the presence of a right @-@ to @-@ left shunt of the heart , such as a patent foramen ovale , venous bubbles may enter the arterial system , resulting in an arterial gas embolism . A similar effect , known as ebullism , may occur during explosive decompression , when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure . 
 = = = Inert gases = = = 
 The main inert gas in air is nitrogen , but nitrogen is not the only gas that can cause DCS . Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium , which can also cause decompression sickness . Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen , so different decompression schedules are required , but , since helium does not cause narcosis , it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving . There is some debate as to the decompression requirements for helium during short @-@ duration dives . Most divers do longer decompressions ; however , some groups like the <unk> have been pioneering the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops . 
 Any inert gas that is breathed under pressure can form bubbles when the ambient pressure decreases . Very deep dives have been made using hydrogen @-@ oxygen mixtures ( <unk> ) , but controlled decompression is still required to avoid DCS . 
 = = = Isobaric counterdiffusion = = = 
 DCS can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas . This is known as isobaric counterdiffusion , and presents a problem for very deep dives . For example , after using a very helium @-@ rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive , a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent . Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2 @.@ 65 times slower than helium , but is about 4 @.@ 5 times more soluble . Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in " fast " tissues ( those tissues that have a good blood supply ) actually increasing their total inert gas loading . This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness , as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect . 
 = = = Bubble formation = = = 
 The location of <unk> or where bubbles initially form is not known . The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are <unk> , when two surfaces make and break contact ( such as in joints ) , and heterogeneous nucleation , where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface in contact with the liquid . Homogeneous nucleation , where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression . The spontaneous formation of <unk> on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of <unk> , but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable . 
 Once microbubbles have formed , they can grow by either a reduction in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings . In the body , bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream . The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel and the rate of delivery of blood to capillaries ( perfusion ) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Decompression sickness should be suspected if any of the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure , in particular , within 24 hours of diving . In 1995 , 95 % of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours . An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing . The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression . Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS , they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 = = = Underwater diving = = = 
 To prevent the excess formation of bubbles that can lead to decompression sickness , divers limit their ascent rate — the recommended ascent rate used by popular decompression models is about 10 metres ( 33 ft ) per minute — and carry out a decompression schedule as necessary . This schedule requires the diver to ascend to a particular depth , and remain at that depth until sufficient gas has been eliminated from the body to allow further ascent . Each of these is termed a " decompression stop " , and a schedule for a given bottom time and depth may contain one or more stops , or none at all . Dives that contain no decompression stops are called " no @-@ stop dives " , but divers usually schedule a short " safety stop " at 3 metres ( 10 ft ) , 4 @.@ 6 metres ( 15 ft ) , or 6 metres ( 20 ft ) , depending on the training agency . 
 The decompression schedule may be derived from decompression tables , decompression software , or from dive computers , and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of the body 's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes . These models , such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm , are designed to fit empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth and dive duration . 
 Since divers on the surface after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies , any subsequent dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule to take account of the residual gas load from the previous dive . This will result in a shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive . The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours , and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required , which may be up to 18 hours . 
 Decompression time can be significantly shortened by breathing mixtures containing much less inert gas during the decompression phase of the dive ( or pure oxygen at stops in 6 metres ( 20 ft ) of water or less ) . The reason is that the inert gas <unk> at a rate proportional to the difference between the partial pressure of inert gas in the diver 's body and its partial pressure in the breathing gas ; whereas the likelihood of bubble formation depends on the difference between the inert gas partial pressure in the diver 's body and the ambient pressure . Reduction in decompression requirements can also be gained by breathing a nitrox mix during the dive , since less nitrogen will be taken into the body than during the same dive done on air . 
 Following a decompression schedule does not completely protect against DCS . The algorithms used are designed to reduce the probability of DCS to a very low level , but do not reduce it to zero . 
 = = = Exposure to altitude = = = 
 One of the most significant breakthroughs in the prevention of altitude DCS is oxygen pre @-@ breathing . Breathing pure oxygen significantly reduces the nitrogen loads in body tissues by reducing the partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs , which induces diffusion of nitrogen from the blood into the breathing gas , and this effect eventually lowers the concentration of nitrogen in the other tissues of the body . If continued for long enough , and without interruption , this provides effective protection upon exposure to low @-@ barometric pressure environments . However , breathing pure oxygen during flight alone ( ascent , en route , descent ) does not decrease the risk of altitude DCS as the time required for ascent is generally not sufficient to significantly desaturate the slower tissues . 
 Although pure oxygen pre @-@ breathing is an effective method to protect against altitude DCS , it is logistically complicated and expensive for the protection of civil aviation flyers , either commercial or private . Therefore , it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high @-@ altitude and space operations . It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft , and may also be used for high altitude parachute jumps . 
 Astronauts aboard the International Space Station preparing for extra @-@ vehicular activity ( EVA ) " camp out " at low atmospheric pressure , 10 @.@ 2 psi ( 0 @.@ 70 bar ) , spending eight sleeping hours in the Quest airlock chamber before their spacewalk . During the EVA they breathe 100 % oxygen in their spacesuits , which operate at 4 @.@ 3 psi ( 0 @.@ 30 bar ) , although research has examined the possibility of using 100 % O2 at 9 @.@ 5 psi ( 0 @.@ 66 bar ) in the suits to lessen the pressure reduction , and hence the risk of DCS . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 All cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with 100 % oxygen until hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( 100 % oxygen delivered in a high @-@ pressure chamber ) can be provided . Mild cases of the " bends " and some skin symptoms may disappear during descent from high altitude ; however , it is recommended that these cases still be evaluated . Neurological symptoms , pulmonary symptoms , and mottled or marbled skin lesions should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy if seen within 10 to 14 days of development . 
 Recompression on air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909 . Evidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke , and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS . Recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber . At a dive site , a riskier alternative is in @-@ water recompression . 
 Oxygen first aid has been used as an emergency treatment for diving injuries for years . If given within the first four hours of surfacing , it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as a decrease the number of recompression treatments required . Most fully closed @-@ circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen @-@ rich breathing gas and could be used as a means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available . 
 It is beneficial to give fluids , as this helps reduce dehydration . It is no longer recommended to administer aspirin , unless advised to do so by medical personnel , as analgesics may mask symptoms . People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position ( horizontal ) , or the recovery position if vomiting occurs . In the past , both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral <unk> position ( Durant 's maneuver ) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected , but are no longer recommended for extended periods , owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema . 
 The duration of recompression treatment depends on the severity of symptoms , the dive history , the type of recompression therapy used and the patient 's response to the treatment . One of the more frequently used treatment schedules is the US Navy Table 6 , which provides hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a maximum pressure equivalent to 60 feet ( 18 m ) of seawater for a total time under pressure of 288 minutes , of which 240 minutes are on oxygen and the balance are air breaks to minimise the possibility of oxygen toxicity . 
 A <unk> chamber is the preferred facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to the patient by medical personnel , but monoplace chambers are more widely available and should be used for treatment if a <unk> chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment , as the interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to the quality of recovery . It may be necessary to modify the optimum treatment schedule to allow use of a monoplace chamber , but this is usually better than delaying treatment . A US Navy treatment table 5 can be safely performed without air breaks if a built @-@ in breathing system is not available . In most cases the patient can be adequately treated in a monoplace chamber at the receiving hospital . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Immediate treatment with 100 % oxygen , followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber , will in most cases result in no long @-@ term effects . However , permanent long @-@ term injury from DCS is possible . Three @-@ month follow @-@ ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14 @.@ 3 % of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS , and 7 % from Type I DCS . Long @-@ term follow @-@ ups showed similar results , with 16 % having permanent neurological sequelae . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The incidence of decompression sickness is rare , estimated at 2 @.@ 8 cases per 10 @,@ 000 dives , with the risk 2 @.@ 6 times greater for males than females . DCS affects approximately 1 @,@ 000 U.S. scuba divers per year . In 1999 , the Divers Alert Network ( DAN ) created " Project Dive Exploration " to collect data on dive profiles and incidents . From 1998 to 2002 , they recorded 50 @,@ 150 dives , from which 28 <unk> were required — although these will almost certainly contain incidents of arterial gas embolism ( AGE ) — a rate of about 0 @.@ 05 % . 
 = = History = = 
 1670 : Robert Boyle demonstrated that a reduction in ambient pressure could lead to bubble formation in living tissue . This description of a viper in a vacuum was the first recorded description of decompression sickness . 
 1769 : Giovanni Morgagni described the post mortem findings of air in cerebral circulation and surmised that this was the cause of death . 
 1840 : Charles Pasley , who was involved in the recovery of the sunken warship HMS Royal George , commented that , of those having made frequent dives , " not a man escaped the repeated attacks of rheumatism and cold " . 
 1841 : First documented case of decompression sickness , reported by a mining engineer who observed pain and muscle cramps among coal miners working in mine shafts air @-@ pressurized to keep water out . 
 1870 : Bauer published outcomes of 25 paralyzed caisson workers . 
 From 1870 to 1910 , all prominent features were established . Explanations at the time included : cold or exhaustion causing reflex spinal cord damage ; electricity cause by friction on compression ; or organ congestion ; and vascular stasis caused by decompression . 
 1871 : The Eads Bridge in St Louis employed 352 compressed air workers including Alphonse <unk> as the physician in charge . There were 30 seriously injured and 12 fatalities . <unk> developed decompression sickness and his personal description was the first such recorded . 
 1872 : The similarity between decompression sickness and iatrogenic air embolism as well as the relationship between inadequate decompression and decompression sickness was noted by <unk> . He suggested that intravascular gas was released by rapid decompression and recommended : slow compression and decompression ; four @-@ hour working shifts ; limit to maximum depth 44 @.@ 1 <unk> ( 4 ATA ) ; using only healthy workers ; and recompression treatment for severe cases . 
 1873 : Andrew Smith first utilized the term " caisson disease " describing 110 cases of decompression sickness as the physician in charge during construction of the Brooklyn Bridge . The project employed 600 compressed air workers . Recompression treatment was not used . The project chief engineer Washington Roebling suffered from caisson disease , and endured the after @-@ effects of the disease for the rest of his life . During this project , decompression sickness became known as " The Grecian Bends " or simply " the bends " because afflicted individuals characteristically bent forward at the hips : this is possibly reminiscent of a then popular women 's fashion and dance maneuver known as the Grecian Bend . 
 1900 : Leonard Hill used a frog model to prove that decompression causes bubbles and that recompression resolves them . Hill advocated linear or uniform decompression profiles . This type of decompression is used today by saturation divers . His work was financed by Augustus Siebe and the Siebe Gorman Company . 
 1904 : Tunnel building to and from Manhattan Island caused over 3 @,@ 000 injuries and over 30 deaths which led to laws requiring PSI limits and decompression rules for " <unk> " in the United States 
 1904 : <unk> and Gorman in conjunction with Leonard Hill developed and produced a closed bell in which a diver can be decompressed at the surface . 
 1908 : " The Prevention of Compressed Air Illness " was published by JS Haldane , Boycott and <unk> recommending staged decompression . These tables were accepted for use by the Royal Navy . 
 1914 – 16 : Experimental decompression chambers were in use on land and aboard ship . 
 1924 : The US Navy published the first standardized recompression procedure . 
 1930s : Albert R Behnke separated the symptoms of Arterial Gas <unk> ( AGE ) from those of DCS . 
 1935 : Behnke et al. experimented with oxygen for recompression therapy . 
 1937 : Behnke introduced the " no @-@ stop " decompression tables . 
 1941 : Altitude DCS is treated with hyperbaric oxygen for the first time .
