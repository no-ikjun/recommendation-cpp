 Working with the Newman 's Own Foundation and the Center for Plant Conservation , the Plantations are trying to restore the regional population of the American <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . The Plantations are trying to use predatory beetles ( <unk> <unk> ) to control the spread of the hemlock wooly adelgid ( HWA ) .

 The Plantations are open daily without charge from dawn to dusk . From the campus , one walks out Forest Home Drive past the College of Agriculture quadrangle ; the nearest highway is New York State Route 366 . Walk @-@ up tours are offered twice a week . Adult volunteers also serve as stewards , tour guides and special event staff . Such docents are challenged by the large variety of plants ; one joked in 2010 that , " The ones I don ’ t know the name of , I call Species <unk> . " 
 The New York Times has recommended Cornell Plantations as a place to visit several times , calling it " a satisfying experience " in 1965 , one of the sights of Cornell in 1979 , a destination along a bicycling tour in 1985 , " another free diversion " in 1989 , and " one last outing before leaving [ Ithaca ] " in 2002 . The Boston Globe recommended the Plantations in 2000 as a " free to the public museum of living plants " . In 2007 , The Ithaca Journal referred to it as " one of the area 's gems " and three years later said it " combines the best of walking with the eye appeal of well tended gardens " . The Buffalo News portrayed the Plantations in 2010 as one of the places that made Cornell worth a vacation for non @-@ students . 
 National Geographic 's 1998 guide to the 300 best public gardens in North America has an entry for the Plantations . The American Automobile Association 's New York <unk> lists the Plantations as one of five arboreta and sixty gardens in the state ; it does not get the " GEM " rating that one of the arboreta and ten of the gardens receive . Fodor 's travel book for New York State lists the Plantations as an ordinary entry and says the gardens have " interesting cold @-@ weather colors and textures " . The Moon Handbooks volume for the state also lists it as a regular entry , without much commentary , as does the Great Destinations series The Finger Lakes Book . The Fun with the Family Upstate New York volume groups it with several other sights as " a real bargain " to explore for free . Most enthusiastic is the Frommer 's travel guide for New York State , which rates the Plantations as a one @-@ star ( " highly recommended " ) sight , saying the Plantations is " a real find and well worth a visit for garden lovers or anyone seeking a bit of solace . " The herb garden and knoll of rhododendrons come in for particular praise . 
 The Plantations provide a venue for a number of annual activities , including a " Fall In " festival , a celebration of Arbor Day and the Cornell Reunion 5 Mile Run . The Plantations is one of eight cultural and educational sites on the Ithaca Discovery Trail network . The Friends of the Gorges is a Cornell student organization , supported by Cornell Plantations , that performs trail repair and maintenance and clean @-@ ups . 
 = Tropical Depression Two @-@ E ( 2006 ) = 
 Tropical Depression Two @-@ E was a short @-@ lived tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico . It was the only cyclone during the month in the eastern North Pacific Ocean , forming on June 3 from a tropical wave . The depression initially moved northeastward , threatening the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero with a potential of it attaining tropical storm status . It remained a tropical depression , weakening due to land interaction and wind shear , and on June 5 it dissipated just off the coast . Rainfall from the depression peaked at 19 @.@ 1 inches ( 486 mm ) in Acapulco , which resulted in mudslides and flooding . A total of 42 houses were flooded , and 72 people were forced to leave their homes due to the storm ; no deaths were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The tropical depression originated from a tropical wave off the southern coast of Mexico in late May 2006 . An area of convection was associated with the wave , and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual development . The system , which was enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) , drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west . On June 1 , the convection became more concentrated , and by early the next day it developed a low pressure area ; by that time , it began a steady northwestward track . 
 An upper @-@ level anticyclone north of the system provided a more favorable environment for organization , allowing the convection to organize into banding features . The system also developed good outflow , though initially the surface circulation was too elongated for it to be considered a tropical cyclone . Early on June 3 , the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward , which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less @-@ organized . However , convection increased over the center , and at 1500 UTC on June 3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two @-@ E about 140 mi ( 240 km ) southwest of Zihuatanejo , Guerrero ; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection , as well as a closed surface circulation . 
 Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone , the depression was in an area not favorable for significant strengthening , due to land interaction and wind shear . It was tracking steadily northeastward , and as it moved closer to the coastline , the center of the depression was difficult to locate . However , the overall organization briefly improved , and in one forecast the depression was predicted to attain tropical storm status . Early on June 4 , convection weakened significantly , leaving the center partially exposed . Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center of the depression remained just offshore . Late on June 4 , the circulation accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco . Early on June 5 , the circulation dissipated , and later that night the remnants moved inland . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Due to uncertainty in whether the depression would attain tropical storm status or not , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Punta San Telmo , Michoacán to Acapulco , Guerrero . Prior to affecting the coastline , the Mexican meteorological agency issued a heavy rainfall advisory , also mentioning the potential for flooding and mudslides , for the states of Jalisco , Colima , Michoacán , Guerrero , and Oaxaca . Officials prepared 21 shelters in the region . 
 The depression produced heavy rainfall along the coastline , including a total of 19 @.@ 1 inches ( 486 mm ) measured in a 48 ‑ hour period in Acapulco . Totals of over 2 inches ( 50 mm ) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca , causing flash flooding and mudslides . The storm partially flooded about 40 houses , and a total of 72 people were forced to leave their homes . In Acapulco , floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches . Elsewhere in Guerrero , the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways , which stranded dozens of vehicles . The wall of a prison collapsed due to the rainfall . Also in Acapulco , the rainfall downed trees and power lines , causing power outages and sparking a fire when a transformer exploded . No deaths were reported . 
 = IPad ( 3rd generation ) = 
 The third @-@ generation iPad ( marketed as The new iPad , colloquially referred to as the iPad 3 ) is a tablet computer , developed and marketed by Apple Inc . The third device in the iPad line of tablets , it added a Retina display , the new Apple A5X chip with a quad @-@ core graphics processor , a 5 megapixel camera , HD 1080p video recording , voice dictation , and support for LTE networks in North America . It shipped with iOS 5 @.@ 1 , which also provides a platform for audio @-@ visual media , including electronic books , periodicals , films , music , computer games , presentations and web content . 
 In the US and Canada , nine variations of the third @-@ generation iPad were offered , compared to six in the rest of the world , although some countries had only the Wi @-@ Fi only model . Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels , with options for 16 , 32 , or 64 GB of storage . In North America , connectivity options were Wi @-@ Fi only , Wi @-@ Fi + 4G ( LTE ) on Verizon , AT & T , Telus , Rogers , or Bell . For the rest of the world outside North America , connectivity options are Wi @-@ Fi only ( on the Wi @-@ Fi model ) or Wi @-@ Fi + 3G ( on the Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular model ) , with the latter unavailable in some countries , as 4G ( LTE ) connectivity for the device is not available outside North America . The Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability . 
 Initially , the cellular version was titled and marketed worldwide as the " Wi @-@ Fi + 4G " model , but due to regional differences in classification of 4G ( LTE ) connectivity outside of North America , Apple later rebranded and altered their marketing to call this the " Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular " model . 
 The tablet was released in ten countries on March 16 , 2012 . It gained mostly positive reviews , earning praise for its Retina display , processor and 4G ( LTE ) capabilities . However , controversy arose when the LTE incompatibilities became known . Three million units were sold in the first three days . 
 After only seven months ( 221 days ) of official availability , the third @-@ generation iPad was discontinued on October 23 , 2012 , following the announcement of the fourth generation iPad . The third @-@ generation iPad had the shortest lifespan of any iOS product . 
 = = History = = 
 Speculation about the product began shortly after Apple released the iPad 2 , which featured front and back cameras as well as a dual @-@ core Apple A5 processor . Speculation increased after news of a 2 @,@ 048 by 1 @,@ 536 pixel screen leaked . During this time , the tablet was called the " iPad 3 " , a colloquial name sometimes still used after the release . On February 9 , 2012 , John <unk> of All Things Digital stated that " Apple ’ s not holding an event in February – strange , unusual or otherwise . But it is holding one in March – to launch its next iPad . " Another common rumor at the time was that the tablet would have an Apple A6 processor . 
 On February 29 , 2012 , Apple announced a media event scheduled for March 7 , 2012 , at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts . The company did not <unk> the subject of the event , but analysts widely expected the event to announce a new version of the iPad . The announcement affected the tablet resale market positively . 
 At the event , Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced iOS 5 @.@ 1 , a Japanese version of Siri , and the third generation Apple TV before the third @-@ generation iPad . Cook claimed that the new product would be one of the main contributors to the emerging " post @-@ PC world " – a world in which digital life would not be tied to the PC . 
 The March 16 , 2012 , release included eight countries including Australia , Canada , Japan , Singapore , the United Kingdom and the United States . The March 23 , 2012 , release included many European countries , Mexico and Macau . The April 20 , 2012 , release added a dozen countries including South Korea and Malaysia . The April 27 , 2012 , release added nine more countries , including India and South Africa . May 2012 releases added 31 countries , including Brazil and Turkey . 
 On October 23 , 2012 , upon the announcement of the fourth @-@ generation iPad , the third @-@ generation iPad was discontinued . In response to criticism from its owners , the return policy of select Apple Stores was briefly extended to thirty days to allow customers to exchange the third generation model for the fourth generation model .

 The third @-@ generation iPad shipped with iOS 5 @.@ 1 , which was released on March 7 , 2012 . It can act as a hotspot with some carriers , sharing its internet connection over Wi @-@ Fi , Bluetooth , or USB , providing that it is a Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular model . It can also access the App Store , a digital application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple . The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple . From the App Store , GarageBand , iMovie , iPhoto , and the iWork apps ( Pages , Keynote , and Numbers ) are available . 
 The iPad comes with several pre @-@ installed applications , including Safari , Mail , Photos , Videos , YouTube , Music , iTunes , App Store , Maps , Notes , Calendar , Game Center , Photo Booth , and Contacts . Like all iOS devices , the iPad can sync content and other data with a Mac or PC using iTunes , although iOS 5 and later can be managed and backed up without a computer . Although the tablet is not designed to make phone calls over a cellular network , users can use a headset or the built @-@ in speaker and microphone and place phone calls over Wi @-@ Fi or cellular using a VoIP application , such as Skype . The device has dictation , using the same voice recognition technology as the iPhone 4S . The user speaks and the iPad types what they say on the screen provided that the iPad is connected to a Wi @-@ Fi or cellular network . 
 The third @-@ generation device has an optional iBooks application , which displays books and other ePub @-@ format content downloaded from the iBookstore . Several major book publishers including Penguin Books , HarperCollins , Simon & Schuster and Macmillan have committed to publishing books for the device . Despite being a direct competitor to both the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook , both Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble offer e @-@ reader apps for the iPad . 
 On September 19 , 2012 , iOS 6 , which contains 200 new features , was released . The iOS 6 update includes new features such as Apple Maps , which replaced a mapping application operated by Google , Facebook integration and the ability to operate Siri on the third @-@ generation iPad . 
 The third @-@ generation iPad is compatible with iOS 7 , which was released in 2013 . Although complete support , some newer features such as AirDrop that were released to newer models were not supported . This is the similar support that was also given on the iPhone 4S . 
 iOS 8 is also supported by the iPad 3rd Generation . However , some features have been stripped down . 
 iOS 9 supports the third @-@ generation iPad as well . It is the fifth major iOS release that this model supports . The iOS 9 public beta was also compatible with it . This model has been supported for more than 3 years . 
 iOS 9 @.@ 3 @.@ 3 is the latest version to support the iPad 3rd Generation . Unlike the iPad 4th Generation , the iPad 3rd Generation will not support iOS 10 due to hardware limitations . 
 = = = Jailbreaking = = = 
 Researchers demonstrated within hours of the product release that the third @-@ generation iPad can be " jailbroken " to use applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple . The third @-@ generation iPad can be jailbroken with <unk> 0 @.@ 9 @.@ 12 or Absinthe 2 @.@ 0 . Jailbreaking violates the factory warranty . One of the main reasons for jailbreaking is to expand the feature set limited by Apple and its App Store . Most jailbreaking tools automatically install Cydia , a native iOS APT client used for finding and installing software for jailbroken iOS devices . Many apps unapproved by Apple are extensions and customizations for iOS and other apps . Users install these programs to personalize and customize the interface , adding desired features and fixing annoyances , and simplify app development by providing access to the filesystem and command @-@ line tools . However , Apple often patches the exploits used by jailbreaking teams with iOS updates . This is why the iPad 3rd Generation is not always <unk> . 
 = = = Hardware = = = 
 The device has an Apple A5X SoC with a 1 GHz dual @-@ core 32 @-@ bit Cortex @-@ A9 CPU and a quad @-@ core PowerVR <unk> GPU ; 1 GB of RAM ; a 5 @-@ megapixel , rear @-@ facing camera capable of 1080p video recording ; and a VGA front @-@ facing videophone camera designed for FaceTime . The display resolution is 2 @,@ 048 by 1 @,@ 536 ( <unk> ) with 3 @.@ 1 million pixels – four times more than the iPad 2 – providing even scaling from the prior model . The new iPad is thicker than its predecessor by 0 @.@ 6 mm and is heavier by 51 grams for the Wi @-@ Fi model ( 652 grams ) . The Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular models ( both at 662 grams ) are 49 grams heavier for the AT & T model and 55 grams heavier for the Verizon model compared to the respective iPad 2 3G models ( AT & T 3G iPad 2 is 613 grams , and Verizon 3G iPad 2 is 607 grams ) . 
 There are four physical switches on the third @-@ generation iPad , including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen , and three plastic switches on the sides : wake / sleep and volume up / down , plus a software @-@ controlled switch whose function varies with software update . The display responds to other sensors : an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3 @-@ axis accelerometer to sense orientation and to switch between portrait and landscape modes . Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch 's built @-@ in applications , which work in three orientations ( portrait , landscape @-@ left and landscape @-@ right ) , the iPad 's built @-@ in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations , including upside @-@ down . Consequently , the device has no intrinsic " native " orientation ; only the relative position of the home button changes . 
 The tablet is manufactured either with or without the capability to communicate over a cellular network ; all models can connect to a wireless LAN . The third @-@ generation iPad optionally has 16 , 32 , or 64 GB of internal flash memory , with no expansion option . Apple sells a " camera connection kit " with an SD card reader , but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos . 
 The audio playback of the third @-@ generation iPad has a frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 @,@ 000 Hz . Without third @-@ party software it can play the following audio formats : HE @-@ AAC , AAC , Protected AAC , MP3 , MP3 VBR , Audible formats ( 2 , 3 , 4 , AEA , AAX , and AAX + ) , ALAC , AIFF , and WAV . A preliminary tear @-@ down of the third @-@ generation iPad by IHS <unk> showed the likely costs for a 16 GB Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular model at $ 358 @.@ 30 , 32 GB at $ 375 @.@ 10 , and 64 GB at $ 408 @.@ 70 respectively . 
 This iPad uses an internal rechargeable lithium @-@ ion polymer ( LiPo ) battery . The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology ( 60 % ) and Dynapack International Technology . The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of 2 amps using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30 @-@ pin dock connector at the other end . While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer , these are limited to 500 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 5 amps ) . As a result , if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer , it may charge very slowly , or not at all . High @-@ power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities . 
 Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10 hours of video , 140 hours of audio playback , or one month on standby ; people say the battery lasts about 8 hours doing normal tasks . Like any rechargeable battery , the iPad 's battery loses capacity over time . However , the iPad 's battery is not user @-@ replaceable . In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery @-@ replacement programs , Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US $ 99 plus $ 6 @.@ 95 shipping . User data is not preserved / transferred . The refurbished unit comes with a new case . The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions .

 The Smart Cover , introduced with the iPad 2 , is a screen protector that magnetically attaches to the face of the iPad . The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand , which is also held together by magnets . The Smart Cover can also assume other positions by folding it . While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover , the Smart Cover is simpler , easily detachable , and protects only the screen . Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad , and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed . It comes in five colors of both polyurethane and the more expensive leather . 
 Apple offers several other accessories , most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30 @-@ pin dock connector , the only port besides the headphone jack . A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle , and has a dock connector and audio line @-@ out port . The iPad can use Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs . The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ( " wall charger " ) compatible with iPods and iPhones , and a 10 Watt charger is included .

 The third @-@ generation iPad received many positive reviews , receiving praise for its Retina display , camera , processor and LTE capabilities . According to Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital , the new model " has the most spectacular display ... seen in a mobile device " and holds the crown as " the best tablet on the planet . " Jonathan Spira , writing in Frequent Business Traveler , claimed that it " seems to make everything sharper and clearer . "

 Criticism followed the news that in markets outside the US , the tablet cannot communicate with LTE due to its use of 700 MHz and 700 / 2 @,@ 100 MHz frequencies , respectively , versus 800 MHz , 1 @.@ 8 GHz and 2 @.@ 6 GHz used elsewhere . Soon after the launch , the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) took Apple to court for breaking four provisions of Australian consumer law . They alleged that Apple 's promotion of the tablet in Australia as the ' iPad Wi @-@ Fi + 4G ' misled customers , as the name indicates that it would work on Australia 's then @-@ current 4G network . Apple responded to this by offering a full refund to all customers in Australia who purchased the Wi @-@ Fi + Cellular model ( when it was previously named " Wi @-@ Fi + 4G " ) of the iPad . 
 On April 20 , 2012 , Apple stated that HSPA + networks in Australia are 4G , even though the speeds are slower than that of LTE . A month later , on June 21 , 2012 , Apple was sued for A $ 2 @.@ 25 million for false advertising in Australia . In its advertisements Apple claimed that the new iPad was 4G LTE compatible . However , it didn 't work with the Telstra LTE mobile data network in Australia . Apple was fined A $ 2 @.@ 25 million and was ordered to pay A $ 300 @,@ 000 in costs . 
 Apple agreed to remove all references to 4G ( LTE ) capability in its UK advertising but as of August had not done so . There was no widespread 4G ( LTE ) network in the UK at the time , and the third @-@ generation iPad would also be incompatible with future 4G ( LTE ) networks when they did roll @-@ out there . The Advertising Standards Authority received consumer complaints on the matter . Apple offered to refund customers who bought the device after being misled by the advertising . The result of numerous complaints and lawsuits against Apple regarding the use of the term 4G in their advertisements prompted Apple to rename its " 4G " service to " Cellular " , with this change appearing on Apple 's website on May 13 , 2012 .

 Consumer Reports gave the third @-@ generation iPad a top rating and recommendation , claiming that the tablet was " superb " , " very good " , and " very fast " , and that the 4G network , the Retina display , and overall performance were positive attributes . They elaborated on the display quality , stating that the third @-@ generation iPad was " the best we ’ ve seen . " The iPad 's new display was a large enough improvement to prompt Consumer Reports to rate it " excellent , " and consequently downgraded the display of other tablets ( including the iPad 2 ) from " excellent " to " very good . " As with the preceding models ( see the parent article on the iPad ) , iOS ' closed and proprietary nature garnered criticism , particularly by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation , computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle , Internet @-@ law specialist Jonathan Zittrain , and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad 's introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their " Defective by Design " campaign . 
 Upon the release of iOS 6 , Swiss Federal Railway accused Apple of copying a trademarked " iconic railway " clock in the " Clock " app that is available on all iPad models that support iOS 6 . On October 15 , 2012 , the Swiss Railway company released a statement saying Apple agreed to pay a licensing fee to use its clock design .

 Pre @-@ orders were so high for the third @-@ generation iPad that later orders were quoted shipping times of " two to three weeks " after the order was placed . Apple said that " customer response to the new iPad has been off the charts and the quantity available for pre @-@ order has been purchased . " Despite the delayed shipping , many users chose to purchase the iPad online instead of waiting in line at the Apple Store . Approximately 750 people waited outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City for the product 's release . According to an Apple press release , three million units were sold in the first three days . The iPad was purchased mainly by a younger , male demographic . Most of the buyers were either " die @-@ hard Apple fans " or had previously purchased an iPad . An Apple retailer in Dayton , Ohio , claimed that the demand for the tablet was " chaotic " and claimed that its launch was " drastically more significant than the iPad 2 launch . " By Q2 of 2012 , Apple would hit an all @-@ time high , claiming 69 @.@ 6 percent of the global tablet market .

 = Jack Kemp = 
 Jack French Kemp ( July 13 , 1935 – May 2 , 2009 ) was an American politician and a professional gridiron football player . A Republican , he served as Housing Secretary in the administration of President George H. W. Bush from 1989 to 1993 , having previously served nine terms as a congressman for Western New York 's 31st congressional district from 1971 to 1989 . He was the Republican Party 's nominee for Vice President in the 1996 election , where he was the running mate of presidential nominee Bob Dole . Kemp had previously contended for the presidential nomination in the 1988 Republican primaries . 
 Before entering politics , Kemp was a professional quarterback for 13 years . He played briefly in the National Football League ( NFL ) and the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) , but became a star in the American Football League ( AFL ) . He served as captain of both the San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills and earned the AFL Most Valuable Player award in 1965 after leading the Bills to a second consecutive championship . He played in the AFL for all 10 years of its existence , appeared in its All @-@ Star game seven times , played in its championship game five times , and set many of the league 's career passing records . Kemp also co @-@ founded the AFL Players Association , for which he served five terms as president . During the early part of his football career , he served in the United States Army Reserve . 
 As an economic conservative , Kemp advocated low taxes and supply @-@ side policies during his political career . His positions spanned the social spectrum , ranging from his conservative opposition to abortion to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform . As a proponent of both Chicago school and supply @-@ side economics , he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and the architect of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 , which is known as the Kemp – Roth tax cut . 
 After his days in political office , Kemp remained active as a political advocate and commentator , and served on corporate and nonprofit organization boards . He also authored , co @-@ authored , and edited several books . He promoted American football and advocated for retired professional football players . Kemp was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 by President Barack Obama .

 Born , raised , and educated in Los Angeles , Kemp was the third of four sons of Frances Elizabeth ( née Pope ) and Paul Robert Kemp Sr. Paul turned his motorcycle messenger service into a trucking company that grew from one to 14 trucks . Frances was a well @-@ educated social worker and Spanish teacher . Kemp grew up in the heavily Jewish Wilshire district of West Los Angeles , but his tight @-@ knit middle @-@ class family attended the Church of Christ , Scientist . In his youth , sports consumed Kemp , who once chose the forward pass as the subject of a school essay on important inventions , although his mother attempted to broaden his horizons with piano lessons and trips to the Hollywood Bowl . 
 Kemp attended Melrose Avenue 's Fairfax High School , which was , at the time , known both for its high concentration of Jewish students and concentration of celebrities ' children . Over 95 % of Kemp 's classmates were Jewish , and he later became a supporter of Jewish causes . His classmates included Herb Alpert , Larry Sherry , and Judith A. Reisman . During his years in high school , Kemp worked with his brothers at his father 's trucking company in downtown Los Angeles . In his spare time , he became a rigorous reader , preferring history and philosophy books . 
 = = = College = = = 
 After graduating from high school in 1953 , he attended Occidental College , a founding member of the NCAA Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference . Kemp selected Occidental because its football team used professional formations and plays , which he hoped would help him to become a professional quarterback . At 5 feet 10 inches ( 178 cm ) and 175 pounds ( 79 kg ) , he considered himself too small to play for the USC Trojans or UCLA Bruins , the major Southern California college football programs . 
 At Occidental , Kemp was a record @-@ setting javelin <unk> and played several positions on the football team : quarterback , defensive back , place kicker , and punter . Although he was near @-@ sighted , Kemp was tenacious on the field . During his years as starting quarterback the team posted 6 – 2 and 3 – 6 records . Kemp was named a Little All @-@ America player one year in which he threw for over 1 @,@ 100 yards . That year , he led the nation 's small colleges in passing . He and close friend Jim Mora , who later became an NFL head coach , were members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity . Another teammate in college was Ron <unk> , who was an NFL umpire for years ( record five Super Bowls ) . Kemp declined to become involved in student government . After graduating from Occidental with a degree in physical education , he pursued postgraduate studies in economics at Long Beach State University and California Western University , and served in the military from 1958 to 1962 . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 Kemp graduated from Occidental in 1957 and married Joanne Main , his college sweetheart , after she graduated from Occidental in 1958 . Main had grown up in Fillmore , California , and attended Fillmore High School in Ventura County . Her father was a teacher and football coach in the Fillmore Unified School District before becoming vice principal and eventually superintendent of the district . Kemp 's Biblical Literature professor , Keith Beebe , presided over the wedding , after which Kemp converted to his wife 's Presbyterian faith . Jack Kemp was a 33rd degree Freemason in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction . 
 They had two sons , who were both professional football quarterbacks : Jeff Kemp ( born in 1959 ) played in the NFL from 1981 to 1991 , and Jimmy Kemp ( born in 1971 ) played in the CFL from 1994 to 2002 . Significantly for a man with his demanding schedule , Jack never missed one of their games as children or in college . They also had two daughters : Jennifer Kemp Andrews ( born in 1961 ) and Judith Kemp ( born in 1963 ) . 
 In 1976 , C. Everett Koop wrote The Right to Live , The Right to Die , setting down his own concerns about abortion , infanticide , and euthanasia . Koop also took some time off from his surgical practice to make a series of films with Christian apologists Frank Schaeffer and his father Francis Schaeffer in 1978 , entitled Whatever Happened to the Human Race ? based on the book of the same title that had been previously written by the elder Schaeffer . Frank Schaeffer and his associate , Jim <unk> provided a private , five @-@ hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race ? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that , according to Frank Schaeffer 's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God , led to both the <unk> and Koop obtaining " ... access to everyone in the Republican Party " . Joanne Kemp once suffered a miscarriage , which Kemp later said made him re @-@ evaluate the sanctity of human life and affirmed his opposition to abortion . 
 Kemp is survived by his wife of fifty years , his four children and 17 grandchildren .

 After being selected by the Detroit Lions in the 17th round of the 1957 NFL draft , Kemp was cut from the team before the 1957 NFL season began . He spent 1957 with the Pittsburgh Steelers and 1958 on the taxi squads of the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants . The Giants hosted the NFL championship game , known as the " Greatest Game Ever Played " and the first overtime NFL playoff game , but , as a third @-@ string quarterback member of the taxi squad , Kemp did not take the field . 
 After his time in the NFL , Kemp served a year as a private in the United States Army Reserve . During his service , he played one game for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League , which made him ineligible for the NFL in 1959 . According to his older brother Tom , his parents drove him from California to Calgary , Alberta only to see him cut . By this time Kemp had been cut from five professional teams ( Lions , Steelers , Giants , 49ers , and Stampeders ) and his family encouraged him to get on with his life . 
 On February 9 and 11 , 1960 , the newly formed AFL agreed to " no tampering " policies with the NFL and CFL respectively , protecting each league 's players . Players like Kemp , with modest NFL experience , were often signed by the AFL at the time . Kemp signed as a free agent with the AFL 's Los Angeles Chargers . 
 = = = Sid Gillman era ( 1960 – 1962 ) = = = 
 In 1960 , Kemp led the Chargers to a Western Division Championship with a 10 – 4 record . He finished second in the league to Frank Tripucka in passing attempts , completions , and yards ( making him and Tripucka the league 's first 3 @,@ 000 @-@ yard passers ) , led the AFL in yards per completion and times sacked , and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead . Under Kemp , the Chargers ' offense averaged 46 points over its last four games and scored more than 41 points in five of its last nine games . In the AFL championship game , he led the team to field goals on its first two possessions , but after the Houston Oilers posted a touchdown in the second quarter for a 7 – 6 lead , the Chargers never recovered . 
 In 1961 , San Diego Union editor Jack Murphy convinced Barron Hilton to move the Chargers from Los Angeles to San Diego . Kemp led the relocated team to a 12 – 2 record and a repeat Western Division Championship . He again finished second in passing yards ( this time to George Blanda ) . The Chargers earned an AFL championship game rematch against the Oilers . However , this time the Chargers were unable to score until a fourth @-@ quarter field goal in a 10 – 3 loss . 
 The Berlin Wall was erected in August 1961 . On October 15 , 1961 , President John F. Kennedy activated Kemp 's San Diego @-@ based <unk> Transportation Company reserves unit for duty in response . In September , the right @-@ handed Kemp had injured his left shoulder while playing football . Medical examiners found swelling and muscle spasms and described his voluntary range of motion at 80 % . In a decision that was reviewed and upheld by the Surgeon General of the United States Army , Army doctors found him as unfit for active duty . That year , he led the Chargers to a division title , passing for 2 @,@ 686 yards and 15 touchdowns . Years later , Kemp 's 1961 Chargers roommate , Ron Mix , recalled that Kemp needed " ten or so " shots of painkillers before each game and commented that " it sounds weird , but he could play football and not be fit to serve in the Army . " 
 In 1962 , Kemp broke his middle finger two games into the season and was unable to play . He persuaded his doctors to set his broken finger around a football , so that his grip would not be affected once the finger healed . Chargers coach Sid Gillman put Kemp on waivers to try to " hide " him . Buffalo Bills coach Lou Saban noticed that Kemp was available and claimed him for a $ 100 waiver fee on September 25 , 1962 , in what sportswriter Randy Schultz has called one of the biggest bargains in professional football history . The Dallas Texans and Denver Broncos also attempted to claim Kemp , but he was awarded to Buffalo by AFL commissioner Joe Foss . 
 = = = Lou Saban era ( 1962 – 1965 ) = = = 
 According to Billy Shaw , Kemp 's acquisition solved the Bills ' quarterback problem , but Kemp was not excited about coming to Buffalo . According to Van Miller , " Jack 's a skier , and he wanted to go to Denver and play for the Broncos . He hated the thought of coming to Buffalo . " In Buffalo , he would become known for his love of reading a broad range of books including those by Henry Thoreau , which led to <unk> from Saban . 
 Injuries , including the broken finger , kept Kemp from playing for most of 1962 . That season , Kemp received a military draft notice for service in the Vietnam War but was granted a draft waiver because of a knee problem . The injuries healed , and Kemp debuted for Buffalo on November 18 , 1962 , by directing the only touchdown drive in a 10 – 6 win over the Oakland Raiders . He played only four games for Buffalo in 1962 , but made the AFL All @-@ Star team . The Bills won three of their last four games to finish 7 – 6 – 1 . 
 On December 14 , 1962 , the Bills outbid the Green Bay Packers for Notre Dame quarterback Daryle Lamonica . In 1963 , a four @-@ season starting quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica left for the Raiders . Lamonica felt he " ... learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking . And I truly believe that we were a great one @-@ two punch at the position for the Bills . " In 1963 , Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7 – 6 – 1 record . Kemp again placed second in passing attempts , completions , and yards , and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns . The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo , New York , in 10 ° F ( − 12 ° C ) weather . During the game , Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16 – 0 , but still lost 26 – 8 . 
 Kemp was said to be the " clubhouse lawyer " for the Bills because of his role in mediating conflicts . In 1964 , he managed personalities such as Gilchrist , who walked off the field when plays were not being called for him , and Saban , whom he kept from cutting Gilchrist the following week . He also managed the politics of his quarterback battle with Lamonica , who engineered four winning touchdown drives in the Bills ' first seven games . Kemp was the first and only Professional Football player to pass for three touchdowns in the first quarter of a season @-@ opening game , against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1964 , until the record was tied but not broken , 47 years later in 2011 by Aaron Rodgers . The 1964 team won its first nine games and went 12 – 2 for the regular season , winning the Eastern Division with a final game victory over the Patriots at Fenway Park . Kemp led the league in yards per attempt and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead , which was shared by Gilchrist and Sid Blanks . In the AFL championship game , he scored the final touchdown with just over nine minutes left in a 20 – 7 victory . 
 According to Lamonica , the 1965 team had a new emphasis : " In ' 64 we had depended a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us . . <unk> that all changed in ' 65 . The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos . So we went to a pass @-@ oriented game more that season than we ever had before . We not only went to our receivers , but we threw a lot to our running backs . And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year . " In 1965 , the Bills finished with a 10 – 3 – 1 record . Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions . In the 1965 AFL Championship Game , Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23 – 0 ; for Kemp , the victory was special because it came against his former team . Kemp 's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert <unk> playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate , Paul Lowe . Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award . 
 = = = Joe Collier and John Rauch eras ( 1966 – 1969 ) = = = 
 Following the championship game , Saban resigned to coach the University of Maryland and defensive coordinator Joe Collier was promoted to head coach for the 1966 season . Kemp led the Bills to their third consecutive division title with a 9 – 4 – 1 record . However , in the AFL championship game , which was played for the right to represent the AFL in Super Bowl I , the Bills lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 31 – 7 . Kemp was named an AFL All @-@ Star for the sixth consecutive year . The 1967 Bills endured a 4 – 10 1967 AFL season , in which Kemp was not named to the All @-@ Star game for the first time in his AFL career . 
 On August 23 , 1968 , the Bills suffered a blowout preseason loss to the Houston Oilers . On August 26 , Collier put the Bills through a 40 @-@ play scrimmage . During the scrimmage , Ron <unk> fell on Kemp 's right knee and injured it , forcing Kemp to sit out the entire 1968 season . The Bills went 1 – 12 – 1 without Kemp . 
 Despite Kemp 's return from injury and the arrival of running back O. J. Simpson , the Bills only compiled a 4 – 10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch . Kemp was named an AFL All @-@ Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league 's 10 years . He advocated recognition of the league , and in its last year , 1969 , lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it . In 1969 , the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress . After the January 17 , 1970 , AFL All @-@ Star game , Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics . Kemp said , " I had a four @-@ year no @-@ cut contract with the Bills at the time . ... I figured that if I lost I could always come back and play . But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress . " 
 = = = Career summary = = = 
 Kemp led Buffalo to four straight years in the AFL playoffs , three consecutive Eastern Division titles and two straight AFL Championships . He led the league in career passes attempted , completions , and yards gained passing . He played in five of the AFL 's 10 Championship Games , and holds the same career records ( passing attempts , completions , and yardage ) for championships . He is second in many other championship game categories , including career and single @-@ game passer rating . He ranks third in rushing touchdowns by an NFL or AFL quarterback with 40 , behind Steve Young 's 52 and Otto Graham 's 44 . A Sporting News All @-@ League selection at quarterback in 1960 and 1965 , and the AFL MVP in 1965 . He was the only AFL quarterback to be listed as a starter all 10 years of the league 's existence and one of only 20 players to serve all 10 of those years . His number 15 was retired by the Bills in 1984 . 
 However , despite his success and important AFL records , he is most prominently listed in the NFL record book for less flattering accomplishments , including his place as a former record holder for most quarterback sacks in a game . Despite Kemp 's many records , Joe Namath and Len Dawson were selected as the quarterbacks for the All @-@ time AFL team . Kemp is a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bills ' Wall of Fame . 
 Kemp co @-@ founded the AFL Players Association with Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots , and was elected its president five times . His founding of and involvement in the players ' union contributed to his frequent siding with the Democrats on labor issues later in his career . 
 The NCAA 's highest honor , the Theodore Roosevelt Award , was presented to Kemp in 1992 , and he was named one of the Association 's 100 most influential student @-@ athletes in 2006 . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Kemp 's political career began long before his 1970 campaign . In 1960 and 1961 , Kemp was an editorial assistant to San Diego Union editor and future Richard Nixon aide Herb Klein . Subsequently , Kemp became a volunteer in both Barry Goldwater 's 1964 presidential campaign and Ronald Reagan 's successful 1966 California gubernatorial campaign . In the 1967 football off @-@ season , Kemp worked on Reagan 's staff in Sacramento . In 1969 he was special assistant to the Republican National Committee chairman . 
 Kemp was a voracious reader , and his political beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater 's The Conscience of a Conservative , Ayn Rand 's libertarian novels , such as The Fountainhead , and Friedrich von Hayek 's The Constitution of Liberty . He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality , which came from playing football with black teammates : Kemp said , " I wasn 't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis . But I am here now , and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do . " Kemp 's football colleagues confirmed this influence : John Mackey explained that " the huddle is colorblind . " 
 = = = Congress ( 1971 – 1989 ) = = = 
 As a self @-@ described " bleeding @-@ heart conservative " , Kemp represented a part of the suburban Buffalo region known as the <unk> ( that traditionally voted Democratic ) in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1989 . He is as fondly remembered for his good hair and handsome looks as for his athletic prowess and political savvy , and was described as having the charisma of the earlier J.F.K. ( John F. Kennedy ) . David Rosenbaum described Kemp as an independent politician who often legislated outside his committees ' jurisdictions and often spoke in favor of ideals and principles rather than his party 's political platforms . As a supply @-@ <unk> , he was not a proponent of balanced budgeting and trivialized it while speaking of growth as an economic goal . 
 The Erie County , New York Republicans had drafted Kemp after incumbent congressman Richard D. McCarthy decided to run for the United States Senate . During his inaugural campaign , his district was in economic malaise , and The New York Times described him as a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values , patriotism , sports , and defense . Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty @-@ two freshmen , he was one of six newcomers — along with Ronald Dellums , Bella Abzug , Louise Day Hicks , Robert <unk> , and Pete du Pont — discussed in Time . The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein , Nixon 's director of communications . The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon 's war policies in order to firm up Kemp 's support from military hawks . 
 Kemp championed several Chicago school and supply @-@ side economics issues : economic growth , free markets , free trade , tax simplification and lower tax rates on both employment and investment income . He was a long @-@ time proponent of the flat tax . He also defended the use of anti @-@ Communist contra forces in Central America , supported the gold standard , spoke for civil rights legislation , opposed abortion , and was the first lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones , which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants . During his career , he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat : he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants . The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert Kennedy . He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive @-@ based systems instead of traditional social programs . For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party , David Gergen heralded him as a " courageous voice in the wilderness . " Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals , he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools . Kemp at times felt his role was that of " freewheeling , entrepreneurial , <unk> backbencher . " 
 Time magazine identified 38 @-@ year @-@ old second @-@ term congressman Kemp as a future leader in its 1974 " Faces for the Future " feature . Another early @-@ career notable magazine appearance was in a 1978 issue of Esquire . The article explained allegations of homosexual activity among staffers in Ronald Reagan 's Sacramento office in 1967 ; Kemp was not implicated . Kemp considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1980 and Hugh Sidey mentioned him as a contender to unseat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election and was a front runner for the vice presidency at the 1980 Republican National Convention , where he received 43 votes from conservative detractors of George H. W. Bush . After he was reelected for a sixth term in 1980 , his Republican peers elected him to a party leadership position , and he served seven years as chairman of the House Republican Conference . This promotion occurred immediately after Kemp and David Stockman urged Reagan by memorandum to dedicate his first 100 days to working on an economic package with Congress . Kemp considered running for Governor of New York in 1982 but ultimately decided to stay in the House . By 1984 , many viewed Kemp as Reagan 's heir apparent . 
 Kemp had his first encounter with supply @-@ side economics in 1976 , when The Wall Street Journal 's Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his Congressional office . Kemp questioned Wanniski all day ( until midnight , at Kemp 's Bethesda , Maryland home ) and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer 's supply @-@ side discipline . Thereafter , Kemp espoused supply @-@ side economics freely , and in 1978 he and Sen. Bill Roth of Delaware proposed tax @-@ cutting legislation . Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply @-@ side economics ' inclusion in President Reagan 's economic plan , although at the time of Robert Mundell 's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell , Laffer , Robert Bartley , and Wanniski . In 1979 , Kemp wrote An American Renaissance ( ISBN 0 @-@ 06 @-@ <unk> @-@ 8 ) , to deliver his message that " A rising tide lifts all boats . " Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan , they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp – Roth Tax Cut legislation . Reagan 's budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of United States House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dan <unk> . 
 During the Reagan years , Kemp and his followers ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth . These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990 , which by 1996 had become one of the longest expansions in American history . Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker 's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors . Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming , prisons , medical treatment , and credit card use . 
 An early Kemp tax reform attempt was an unsuccessful 1979 proposal to index tax brackets for cost of living fluctuations , which was incorporated in Reagan 's 1980 package . Kemp co @-@ sponsored a legislative attempt at enterprise zones in 1980 . One of Kemp 's more trying times as a congressman came in 1982 when Reagan decided to reverse the tax cuts and promote tax increases . The reversal was controversial and stimulated opposition by Kemp . Nonetheless , the revised taxes passed . In 1983 , Kemp opposed the policies of chairman Volcker on multiple occasions . The debates included domestic monetary involvement and roles in funding the International Monetary Fund . 
 Kemp delivered speeches at several Republican National Conventions . He addressed the convention on July 15 at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit , Michigan and on August 21 at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas , Texas . During the 1984 Convention , with Trent Lott as Republican Party Platform Committee chairman , Congressmen Kemp and Newt Gingrich claimed control of the party platform to the consternation of G.O.P. senators Bob Dole and Howard Baker . Kemp 's official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy . However , the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes , the gold standard and the role of the Federal Reserve . Despite Kemp 's official role , his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes . By 1985 , Kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 Presidential nomination . He also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston , Texas . Despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain , Kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban Western New York district until well into his eighth term in Congress . 
 Kemp was a critic of association football , known as soccer in the United States . In 1986 , during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup , Kemp proclaimed : " I think it is important for all those young out there — who someday hope to play real football , where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands — [ that ] a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism , whereas soccer is a European socialist sport . " Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin 's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his " tongue was firmly planted in cheek " when making the speech . Despite the levity of the speech , it garnered significant backlash . However , he continued to insist that soccer 's main problem is " it doesn 't have a quarterback " . Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have " changed " his position on soccer . He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger , although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a " boring game " . 
 = = = Presidential bid ( 1988 ) = = = 
 In 1988 , if Kemp had won his campaign for the United States Presidency , it would have made him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield . When he formed his exploratory committee , he signed Ed Rollins , Reagan 's 1984 re @-@ election political director , as an advisor . From the outset , Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush . Except for a select few cognoscenti , the general public did not recognize Kemp 's leadership ability , although he was a successful man of ideas . In fact , most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in his campaign . Political pundits recognized him , however , as a visionary idea man . In addition , he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience . Although Kemp tried to appeal to the conservatives , his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities , women , blue @-@ collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters ' social and religious values . To Democrats , Kemp 's free @-@ market philosophies were a form of laissez @-@ faire anarchy . However , as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government 's role , he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez @-@ faire system should be well @-@ thought out . 
 After the May 1987 Gary Hart – Donna Rice scandal , a questionnaire by The New York Times requested things such as psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates . Candidates from each party expressed opinions on both sides of the personal privacy issue , and Kemp rejected the Times inquiry as " beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate " . His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire , but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York . Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters , Kemp 's campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red , which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques . To offset his socially moderate stances , Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion , his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State George Shultz . To position himself as Reagan 's successor , Kemp called for Shultz 's resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighters in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on SDI . In an attempt to highlight his stands on key Reagan Era foreign policy initiatives , Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica , Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan — a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists . He was accompanied on the trip by 50 @-@ plus US conservative leaders . 
 Despite a platform covering the full range of political subjects , Kemp 's primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts . As part of his fiscal policy , he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending . Some viewed Kemp 's supply @-@ side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit . In late 1987 , political pundits saw that Kemp needed to gain support from the far right on non @-@ social issues . Kemp was among the majority of Republican candidates in opposition to Reagan 's INF Treaty agreement with the Soviet Union 's Mikhail Gorbachev despite general Republican voter approval of the treaty . With aspirations of support from right @-@ wing voters , all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same " sabre @-@ rattling " stand . By early 1988 , the moderates ( Bush and Dole ) were clearly the front @-@ runners and Kemp was battling with Pat Robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates . 
 He used a somewhat negative advertising campaign that seemed to have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention . His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply @-@ side economics and inner @-@ city enterprise zones . In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms : My Life in American Politics , campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles . Kemp 's campaign managers say he was unmanageable : he ignored timers on his speeches , refused to call contributors , and refused to practice for debates . A humbling Super Tuesday , in which his 39 delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson , ended his campaign . After withdrawing from the race , he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination . In 1989 , the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg , New York to Bethesda , Maryland , their residence at the time of his death . In 1994 , Kemp 's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $ 120 @,@ 000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for , among other things , excessive contributions , improper direct corporate donations , press <unk> , exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire , and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation .

 As a so @-@ called " bleeding @-@ heart conservative " , Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , whose job would be to foster public sector and private sector methods to meet the demands of public housing . However , the scandals of Reagan 's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start , and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives : enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership . The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant @-@ owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives . Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUD 's director , he cleaned up HUD 's reputation , and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration . He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive , which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett . He supported " Operation Clean Sweep " and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing . 
 Although Kemp coaxed Bush to support a $ 4 billion housing program that encouraged public housing tenants to buy their own apartments , the Democratic Congress allocated only $ 361 million to the plan . In addition to opposition in Congress , Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman , who opposed Kemp 's pet project HOPE ( Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere ) . The project involved selling public housing to its tenants . Darman also opposed Kemp 's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets . HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones , increase subsidies for low @-@ income renters , expand social services for the homeless and elderly , and enact tax changes to help first @-@ time home buyers . Sununu opposed it at first as did most of the Cabinet , but in August 1990 Sununu , at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh , encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp 's Economic Empowerment Task Force . However , the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp 's new project . Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich , James Pinkerton , and Vin Weber . The budget left him with $ 256 million for his plan , which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles . Soon after Clayton <unk> was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor , Kemp 's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished . 
 President Bush avoided federal <unk> issues , and instead used Kemp as a mouthpiece to speak on the administration 's low priority conservative activist agenda . Bush 's contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his " Points of Light " theme , and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from Presidential candidate Bill Clinton . By the time of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones , tenant ownership and welfare reform : Mort Zuckerman compared Bush 's vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car . Nonetheless , the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration , even though at first , Kemp had been overlooked . However , Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemp 's success in advance best when he said in 1989 , " Good ideas with money can do a whole lot . Good ideas without money aren 't probably going to do a whole lot , " and the issue here was the decision not to fund Kemp 's ideas . Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions , he was among the administration 's leading users of first class corporate jets . He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary . 
 Generally , his time as housing secretary was considered unsuccessful . However , although he could not get federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure , by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones , and in 1994 $ 3 @.@ 5 billion was approved for them under President Clinton . A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration , however . In 1992 , with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign , Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate . 
 Kemp was partly at fault for not achieving either of his primary goals because he did not get along with the rest of the Cabinet . At one point , Kemp told James Baker , White House Chief of Staff , that Bush 's best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion . Before the 1992 Republican National Convention , Kemp and six prominent Republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging Bush to revise his economic policy . Contemporaneously , conservative Republicans in office and in the media such as William F. Buckley Jr. and George Will felt Dan Quayle should be ousted in favor of Kemp . This followed Kemp 's reference to parts of the President 's economic policy as " gimmicks " after the 1992 State of the Union Address . Kemp was respected within the party for opposing Bush , and towards the end of Bush 's administration insiders recognized his value . In late 1991 , 81 of the 166 Republican Congressmen signed a letter co @-@ authored by Curt Weldon and Dan Burton requesting that Bush cede some domestic authority to Kemp as a " domestic policy czar . " The letter , highlighting Kemp 's " energy , enthusiasm and national clout " , insulted Bush . Kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the Bush Cabinet for the duration of his presidency , and he was described as one of the few Bush Administration members who would take tough stands . Kemp did not expect to be retained if the Republicans were reelected in 1992 , and some pundits agreed with him .

By 1994 , Kemp had embarked on 241 fund @-@ raising dinners to raise $ 35 million for a 1996 Presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts . After stepping down from his $ 189 @,@ 000 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development job , Kemp personally earned $ 6 @.@ 9 million in the next three years , primarily for speaking on behalf of local Republican candidates . During the Super Bowl XXVIII festivities , Kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series . 
 Kemp was considered the star of the 1992 Republican National Convention . In 1992 and 1993 , Kemp was considered the favorite or co @-@ favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination . At the time of the 1994 mid @-@ term elections , Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996 , and his supporters wanted a formal announcement by the end of the year . In January 1995 , Kemp 's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape : Kemp opposed term limits , he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and , unlike most Republicans , favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty . In 1995 , Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America . Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign . Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive , mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running . In 1995 , while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell , Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign . 
 Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich appointed Kemp to head a tax reform commission , ( the Kemp Commission ) , in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated . Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax , which he formally proposed after he was appointed . The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions , such as mortgage interest , but it remained fairly general . Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates , both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax . 
 During the campaign , Kemp 's endorsement was highly coveted . Forbes had tried to get Kemp to run in the 1996 campaign , but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination , and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar . Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply @-@ side views alive . Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement , and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole 's campaign offices . After it became clear Dole would be the nominee , Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties . 
 Kemp was also outspoken on immigration on around this time : according to Kemp 's interpretation of a scientific index that he and Bennett support , " immigrants are a blessing , not a curse . " In 1994 , Kemp and Bennett opposed California ballot Proposition 187 , a measure to bar illegal immigrants from obtaining public services , in direct opposition to first @-@ term Republican California Governor Pete Wilson , one of its endorsers who was running for re @-@ election . Republican Senate candidate Michael Huffington had also endorsed the proposition . Kemp supported rights for illegal immigrants , but opposed Lamar Smith and Alan Simpson 's proposed restrictions on legal immigration . 
 = = = Vice Presidential nomination ( 1996 ) = = = 
 Kemp had a reputation as the highest @-@ profile progressive Republican . When Dole declined an invitation to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , he suggested Kemp as a substitute even before Kemp had become the Vice Presidential nominee . On August 5 , 1996 , Dole announced a 15 % across @-@ the @-@ board tax cut in response to both the Forbes campaign and Kemp 's tax reform commission . Several of Dole 's other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennett 's Empower America , which had Jeane Kirkpatrick , Weber , Forbes and Alexander as principals . For example , Dole borrowed Kirkpatrick 's tough foreign policy , Bennett 's " right conduct " and even Alexander 's school choice interest . 
 Bennett declined the offer to be Dole 's running mate but suggested Kemp , a man described as Dole 's antagonist . On August 16 , 1996 , the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential nominee , running alongside former Senator Dole . Kemp was seen as a means to attract conservative and libertarian @-@ minded voters like those of tough nomination @-@ challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan . Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack , John McCain , and Carroll Campbell , and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole 's senior advisors . Dole had had a long history of representing the budget @-@ balancing faction of the Party , while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax @-@ cutting advocates , and Kemp 's tax @-@ cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket . When Kemp became Dole 's running mate in 1996 , they appeared on the cover of the August 19 , 1996 issue of Time magazine , but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars , which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was . 
 The two politicians had a storied history stemming from alternative perspectives and objectives . Dole was a longstanding conservative deficit hawk who had even voted against John F. Kennedy 's tax cuts , while Kemp was an outspoken supply @-@ <unk> . In the early 1980s , according to David Stockman , Kemp persuaded Reagan to make a 30 % across @-@ the @-@ board tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature . Once Reagan was elected , Dole was the Senate Finance Committee chairman who Kemp claims resisted the plan every step of the way . Dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan . The big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms . Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op @-@ ed piece in The New York Times , which enraged Dole . Reagan supported the reforms at Dole 's request , causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act , which eventually passed in 1982 . At the 1984 Republican National Convention , Kemp , along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott , added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases . Gingrich called this action " Dole proofing " the platform , and the plank passed over Dole 's opposition . Then , in 1985 , Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote . In meetings with the president that excluded Dole , Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks . This is said to have been Dole 's most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the Republican loss of control of the Senate . During the 1988 presidential election , the two antagonized each other . After Bush won and Kemp left Congress for the Cabinet , the two did not really cross paths again until 1996 , when Kemp endorsed Dole 's opponent Forbes on the eve of the New York Primary in March . 
 Dole despised Kemp 's economic theories , but he felt Kemp @-@ like tax cuts offered his best chance at electoral success . For his part , Kemp had to make concessions as well : he had to back expelling the children of illegal immigrants from public schools despite his longstanding opposition to Proposition 187 and mute his opposition to abolishing affirmative @-@ action programs in California . Some derided Kemp for his compromise and referred to him as a " con artist " . From the outset of their campaign , Dole @-@ Kemp trailed , and they faced skeptics even from within the party . However , Kemp was able to use the nomination to promote his opposition to Clinton 's partial birth abortion ban veto . During the campaign , Kemp and Forbes advocated for a stronger stand on tax cutting than Dole used . However , in general , the opinion was that Kemp was helpful to the ticket 's chances of catching Bill Clinton , and Kemp 's advocacy gave a clear picture of the tax reforms that would likely occur on the condition of a successful campaign . Kemp was seen as likely to influence several types of swing voters , especially those of his native state of California , and even the Democrats feared Kemp might lure voters . 
 After receiving the nomination , Kemp became the ticket 's spokesman for minorities and the inner @-@ city . Due to agreement on the self @-@ help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March , Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan . However , Farrakhan was perceived as being anti @-@ Semitic , and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews . This issue necessitated some political sidestepping . As the nominee , Kemp at times overshadowed Dole . In fact , more than once , Kemp was described as if he was the Presidential nominee . In addition to having overshadowed Dole , despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used , Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football @-@ related metaphors and hyperbole . Although some enjoyed Kemp 's style , referring to him as the Good Shepherd , his detractors , such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts , criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills . During the campaign , Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly . Despite Kemp 's voice on minority issues , Colin Powell 's support and polls that showed about 30 % of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer , school vouchers and criminal justice , the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African @-@ American voters . 
 Both Al Gore and Kemp had Presidential aspirations , which induced pursuit of debate on a higher plane . In addition , Gore and Kemp were long @-@ time friends , unlike Gore and his previous vice presidential opponent Dan Quayle . Thus , as debaters they avoided personal attacks . However , some felt Kemp failed to counter substantive attacks . In the final October 9 , 1996 Vice Presidential Debate against Al Gore ( held as the Dole – Kemp ticket trailed badly in the national polls ) , Kemp was soundly beaten , and Al Gore 's performance is considered one of the best modern debate performances . The debate topics ranged broadly from the usual such as abortion and foreign policy to the unusual such as an incident preceding the then @-@ current baseball playoffs , in which Roberto Alomar , the Baltimore Orioles ' second baseman , cursed and spat on an umpire . The Mexico policy debate was one of the more interesting topics for critical review . The Gore victory was not a surprise since Kemp had been outmatched by Gore in previous encounters , and Gore had a reputation as an experienced and vaunted debater . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 His legacy includes the Kemp – Roth Tax Cut of the 1980s , also known as the first of two " Reagan tax cuts . " These served as the foundation of supply @-@ side economics , known as Reaganomics . Many Republicans have endorsed this Laffer Curve view that tax cuts spur economic growth and reduce deficits . Although George H. W. Bush called this philosophy voodoo economics , George W. Bush and his Treasury Secretary , John W. Snow , were believers . Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats . 
 In the early 21st century , Kemp continued to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible for the implementation of supply @-@ side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas . He has been described as a beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda . Today , he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies . Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues , but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy . 
 In addition to Roth , he has had numerous political allies . At times , he collaborated with Gingrich and Lott on deregulation and tax cuts , collaborated with McCain and Phil Gramm on tax cuts and spending restraints , legislated with and campaigned for Joseph Lieberman , and fought poverty with James Pinkerton . Pete du Pont was a progressive conservative ally . After retiring from Congress and serving in the Cabinet , Kemp remained close to Gingrich , Lott , Weber , and Mack . Kemp was a member of the federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Jr . Day as a national holiday . As a progressive voter , he <unk> rights leaders such as Benjamin Hooks , Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and conservative black intellectuals like Glenn C. <unk> and Robert L. Woodson as supporters and friends . He boasted of having Democratic friends such as William H. Gray III , Charles B. Rangel and Robert Garcia . Ken Blackwell was a Deputy Secretary under Kemp . During the Reagan presidency , when Kemp was able to effect tax cutting , a leading United States Senate tax @-@ cutting proponent was Democrat Bill Bradley , a former basketball star . Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress : Steve Largent , J. C. Watts , and Heath Shuler . 
 Congressman Paul Ryan cites Kemp as a mentor , and mentioned him in his acceptance speech as the Republican Vice @-@ Presidential nominee in 2012 . 
 Senator Arlen Specter in a severe rebuke of federal governmental policy , stated just one day after Kemp died of cancer , that Kemp would still be alive if the federal government had done a better job funding cancer research . 
 = = Late career = = 
 In 1993 , Kemp , Bennett , Kirkpatrick and financial backer Theodore Forstmann co @-@ founded the free market advocacy group Empower America , which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works . Empower America represented the populist wing of the party : while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights , it promoted free markets and growth over balancing the budget and cutting the deficit . He resigned as Co @-@ Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) questioned his ties to Samir Vincent , a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil @-@ for @-@ food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges , including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein . Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial . Also , FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election . 
 By 1996 , Kemp had been named a director of six corporate boards . He was a director for Hawk Corporation , IDT Corporation , <unk> Hotels and Resorts , <unk> , <unk> Corporation and American Bankers Insurance Group . Kemp briefly served on the board of Oracle Corporation , whose CEO was his friend Larry Ellison , in 1996 , but resigned when he ran for Vice President ; he was named to the board of Six Flags , Inc. in December 2005 . Kemp opted not to stand for re @-@ election to IDT 's board in 2006 . He also served on the Habitat for Humanity board of directors , and served on the board of Atlanta @-@ based software maker <unk> Inc . Kemp also served on the board of directors of <unk> , which was the private company that ran the world 's first election on the internet ( won by Al Gore ) , the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary . Kemp was also a business partner with <unk> and Tim Blixseth promoting membership in the elite private ski and golf Yellowstone Club . Kemp also partnered with the Blixseths in a failed anti @-@ terrorism software venture called <unk> which was investigated for " conning " the federal government out of $ 20 million in contracts for software which fraudulently claimed to detect secret messages from <unk> in television broadcast signals . Kemp was the founder and chairman of Kemp Partners , a strategic consulting firm that helps clients achieve both business and public policy goals . 
 In addition to corporate boards of directors , Kemp served on several advisory boards such as the UCLA School of Public Policy Advisory Board , and the Toyota Diversity Advisory Board as well as the Howard University Board of Trustees , on which he served since 1993 . On March 25 , 2003 , Kemp was selected as chairman of the board of Directors of USA Football , a national advocacy group for amateur football created by the National Football League ( NFL ) and the NFL Players Association . The organization supports Pop Warner , American Youth Football , Boys and Girls Clubs of America , National Recreation and Park Association , Police Athletic League , YMCA , and the Amateur Athletic Union . He was also vice president of NFL Charities . 
 In the late 1990s , Kemp remained outspoken on political issues : he was critical of Clinton 's International Monetary Fund lax policies toward South Korea . In early 1998 , he was a serious contender for the 2000 United States presidential election , but his campaign possibilities faltered , and he instead endorsed eventual winner George W. Bush . Kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation , Social Security and education . When a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked for debt repayment , Kemp opposed the plan in favor of tax cuts . Along with John Ashcroft and Alan Krueger , he endorsed reform of payroll taxes to eliminate double taxation . In addition to his fiscal and economic policies , Kemp advocated against abortion when Congress was considering a bill banning intact dilation and extractions . He also advocated for retired NFL veterans on issues such as cardiovascular screening , assisted living , disability benefits , and the 2007 joint replacement program . He argued in support of reforming immigration laws . In the late 1990s , Kemp also was a vocal advocate for free market reform in Africa , arguing that the continent had great economic growth potential if it could shed autocratic and statist governmental policies . 
 In 1997 , when Gingrich was embroiled in a House ethics controversy , Kemp served as an intermediary between Dole and Gingrich to save the Republican Party leader . Later , in 2002 , when Lott made caustic remarks about Strom Thurmond , Kemp was upset , and he supported Lott 's apology , saying he had encouraged him to " repudiate segregation in every manifestation . " Kemp was among the prominent leaders who pledged to raise money in 2005 for Scooter Libby 's defense when he was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in a case regarding the release of Central Intelligence Agency information . 
 In 2006 Kemp , along with 2004 vice @-@ presidential nominee John Edwards , co @-@ chaired the Council on Foreign Relations task force on Russia , producing a document called " Russia 's Wrong Direction : What the United States Can and Should Do " . After their task force roles ended , the pair advocated solutions to poverty in America at various fora . 
 On January 6 , 2008 , Kemp endorsed McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries shortly before the New Hampshire primary , which surprised conservative Republican tax cutters . However , as McCain neared the official nomination , the press associated McCain with Kemp more and more . Kemp prepared an open letter to Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Laura Ingraham and other conservative talk show hosts on McCain 's behalf to quell their <unk> . In addition , Kemp and Phil Gramm advised McCain on economic policy . 
 In February 2008 , Kemp was associated with a group called " Defense of Democracies " that was advocating an electronic surveillance bill that failed in the House of Representatives . The group 's television ad caused such controversy that some of its advisors , including Schumer and Donna Brazile , resigned . 
 He was a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and served as Co @-@ Chair of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Cabinet . 
 He was a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy , which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott , and is awarded annually to college football 's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 On January 7 , 2009 , Kemp 's office issued a statement announcing that he had cancer ; the type of cancer and the anticipated treatment were not announced . His diagnosis and prognosis were never publicly disclosed . However , he continued to serve as chairman of his Washington @-@ based Kemp Partners consulting firm and continued his involvement in charitable and political work until his death . 
 On May 2 , 2009 , Kemp died at his home in Bethesda , Maryland , from cancer of unknown primary origin ; he was 73 . President Barack Obama praised Kemp 's work on race , adding that Kemp understood that divisions involving race and class stood in the way of the country 's common goals . Former President George W. Bush said that Kemp " will be remembered for his significant contributions to the Reagan Revolution and his steadfast dedication to conservative principles during his long and distinguished career in public service . " 
 In April 2008 , Kemp had announced plans to establish the Jack F. Kemp Institute of Political Economy at Pepperdine University 's School of Public Policy . The plans were later scrapped and Kemp died the next year . Following his death , Jack 's son , James " Jimmy " Kemp , created the Jack Kemp Foundation in late 2009 to continue his father 's legacy . A 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) charitable organization , the foundation 's mission statement is to " develop , engage and recognize exceptional leaders who champion the American Idea " . The foundation is located in Washington , D.C , and is committed to advancing the universal values of the American Idea : growth , freedom , democracy and hope .

 Doom 3 ( stylized as <unk> ) is a science fiction survival horror first @-@ person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Activision . Doom 3 was first released for Microsoft Windows on August 3 , 2004 . The game was later adapted for Linux , as well as being ported by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X. Developer Vicarious Visions ported the game to the Xbox console ( now backwards compatible to the Xbox 360 ) , releasing it on April 3 , 2005 . British developers Splash Damage also assisted in design for the multiplayer elements of the game . 
 The game is a prequel of id Software 's Doom franchise . Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars , where a military @-@ industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to research into fields such as teleportation , biological research and advanced weapons design . However , the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell , resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons . The player , an anonymous space marine , must fight through the base and find a way to stop the demons attacking Earth . Doom 3 features an award @-@ winning game engine , id Tech 4 , which has since been licensed out to other developers , and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011 . 
 The game was a critical and commercial success for id Software ; with more than 3 @.@ 5 million copies of the game sold , it is the most successful game by the developer to date . Critics praised the game 's graphics and presentation , although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original Doom , focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters . The game was followed by Resurrection of Evil , an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software in April 2005 , while a Doom film loosely based on the series was released in October 2005 . A series of novelizations of Doom 3 , written by Matthew J. Costello , debuted in February 2008 . An expanded and improved BFG Edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2012 .

 Doom 3 is a story @-@ driven action game played from a first @-@ person perspective . As with previous Doom games , the main objective is to successfully pass through its levels , defeating a variety of enemy characters intent on killing the player 's character . Doom 3 's more story @-@ centered approach , however , means that the player often encounters friendly non @-@ player characters , who provide key plot information , objectives and inventory items . The game incorporates ten weapons for the player 's use to survive , including conventional firearms and explosives such as a submachine gun , shotgun and grenades , experimental plasma weaponry , and the traditional BFG 9000 and chainsaw weapons of the Doom franchise . Enemies come in multiple forms and with different abilities and tactics , but fall into two broad categories of either zombies or demons . Zombies are humans possessed by demonic forces , who attack the player 's character using their hands and melee weapons or a variety of firearms , while demons are creatures from Hell , most of which attack using claws and spines , or by summoning plasma @-@ based fireballs . The corpses of demons are reduced to ashes after death , leaving no trace of their body behind . 
 The game 's levels are fairly linear in nature and incorporate several horror elements , the most prominent of which is darkness . This design choice is not only intended to foster feelings of apprehension and fear within the player , but also to create a more threatening game environment in which the player is less likely to see attacking enemies . This aspect is further enhanced by the fact that the player must choose between holding a weapon and holding the flashlight ( until the BFG editions released in 2012 made the " duct tape mod " a standard feature ) , forcing the player to choose between being able to see and having a readied weapon upon entering a room , which consequently leads to a more deliberate pace for the player . In addition , the levels are regularly strewn with corpses , dismembered body parts and blood , sometimes used in conjunction with the game 's lighting to disorient the player . 
 Frequent radio transmissions through the player 's communications device also add to the atmosphere , by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non @-@ player characters meant to unsettle the player . Early in the game , during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos , the player often hears the sounds of fighting , screaming and dying through their radio transmitter . The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes , footsteps , and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources . Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing , unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game 's antagonists . 
 Early in the game , the player is provided with a personal data assistant ( PDA ) . PDAs contain security clearance levels , allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off @-@ limits . Additionally , the PDA can be used to read e @-@ mails and play videos that the player 's character acquires during the game . Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game , its contents are automatically downloaded to the player 's own device . Other PDAs often contain e @-@ mails and audio logs for other characters , which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes , as well as significant plot details . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Doom 3 was released with a four @-@ player multiplayer element , featuring four game modes . However , the game 's community created a modification to boost this to eight or sixteen players . The Resurrection of Evil expansion would later officially increase the player limit to eight . The four game modes are all deathmatches . The standard deathmatch game mode involves each player moving around a level , collecting weaponry and killing the other players , with the player with the highest kills when the time runs out winning . A team variation of this involves the same principle . The third game mode is " last man standing " , in which each player has a limited amount of respawns , with players losing a life when they are killed . Eventually , all but one player will be eliminated from the game , leaving the survivor as the winner . The final game mode is " tournament " , in which two players fight each other while the other players watch as spectators . The victor of the battle remains in the arena , facing each other player one at a time until the winner of previous rounds is defeated . The loser then moves to the spectators and the new winner remains to fight the next player . The Xbox version of Doom 3 also incorporates an additional two @-@ player co @-@ operative mode for the main single @-@ player game . 
 As of April 15 , 2010 , The Xbox Live service was shut down , thus online multiplayer for original Xbox games through the service is no longer available .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Doom 3 is set in the year 2145 . Much of the game 's story and dialogue was created by author Matthew J. Costello . According to the game 's backstory , the Union Aerospace Corporation ( UAC ) has grown to become the largest corporate entity in existence , and has set up a research facility on Mars . At this base , the UAC are able to conduct research into several scientific areas , including advanced weapons development , biological research , space exploration and teleportation . On Mars , the UAC can perform its operations outside of legal and moral boundaries . As the player progresses through the game , they learn that the employees on the base are unsettled due to a large number of incidents involving hearing voices , unexplained sightings and increasing cases of paranoia and insanity , often leading to fatal accidents with the facility 's machinery . Rumors regarding the nature of experiments in the UAC 's Delta Labs division are especially prevalent among the base 's employees . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 There are five main characters in Doom 3 . The player assumes the role of an anonymous space marine corporal who has just arrived on the UAC 's Mars base . The player 's non @-@ commissioned officer in @-@ charge is Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly , voiced by Neil Ross , who gives the player objectives and advice over the player 's radio for the first half of the game . The antagonist in the story is Dr. Malcolm Betruger , head scientist of the UAC 's enigmatic Delta Labs division , who is revealed to be working in collaboration with the forces of Hell to cause the subjugation of humanity . Betruger 's demonic voice , provided by Philip L. Clarke , frequently taunts the player as the game progresses . The final two principal characters are Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell . Swann , voiced by Charles Dennis , is a representative of the UAC 's board of directors , sent to check up on Betruger 's research as well as investigate the rising number of accidents on the Mars base after a request for assistance from a whistleblower . He is almost always accompanied by Campbell , another space marine who acts as Swann 's bodyguard and is armed with a BFG 9000 . Campbell is voiced by Andy <unk> . Swann and Campbell are often shown in the game to be a few steps ahead of the player , but cannot be reached and directly communicated with until late in the game . The game also incorporates a large host of minor characters who add details to the story or assist the player in certain segments . The player encounters multiple scientists involved in the various research and development programs and archaeological digs through the UAC base , as well as fellow marines and security guards . Civilian employees engaged in bureaucratic work and maintenance workers are also seen . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The story of Doom 3 is conveyed through in @-@ game dialogue and cut scenes , as well as e @-@ mails , audio logs and video files found throughout the game . The game opens with UAC board member Elliott Swann and his bodyguard Jack Campbell arriving at Mars City , the main access to the UAC 's Mars base , disembarking from an Earth transport , with the player 's anonymous marine just behind them . Swann and Campbell , here to investigate multiple incidents , have a heated conference meeting with the man in charge of the Mars laboratories , Dr. Malcolm Betruger while the marine heads to Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly for orders . Kelly gives the marine instructions to find a scientist from the Delta Labs who has gone missing . The marine finds the scientist in a nearby decommissioned communications facility , where he is frantically trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger 's teleportation experiments . However , as he tries to explain the situation to the marine , another teleportation test takes place and loses containment , at which point the entire Mars base is swept with an unnatural shockwave . This transforms most of the base 's personnel into zombies as the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter 's portal . 
 Now forced to fend off attacks from zombified base personnel and the demons from Hell , the marine returns to Mars City , where Kelly remotely gives the marine orders to link up with another squad of marines ( Bravo Team ) and get a transmission card containing a distress call to the main communications facility to call for reinforcements . As the marine progresses through the base , he learns that Swann and Campbell have survived , and are also en route to the communications facility to prevent any messages being sent in hope of containing the situation on Mars . The marine squad is ambushed by demons and slaughtered in the <unk> Plant , and although the marine recovers the transmission card , he is too late to prevent the bulk of equipment at the communications facility being destroyed by Campbell . Kelly , however , directs the marine to a backup system , where the marine is given the choice of whether to obey Kelly 's orders to send for reinforcements , or accept Swann 's argument to keep Mars isolated until the exact nature of the invasion is understood , so as not to endanger Earth . The marine is told to go to the Delta Labs by Kelly or Swann , depending on whether the transmission is sent or not . 
 On the way to the Delta Labs , the marine is contacted by Betruger , who is now clearly shown to be working in cooperation with Hell in order to invade Earth . If the marine did not send the distress call to Earth , Betruger does so himself , hoping to use the ships bringing reinforcements to transport the demons to Earth . Betruger then unsuccessfully attempts to kill the marine using the toxic gases in the base 's recycling facilities . Upon arriving at the Delta Labs , the marine learns of the details behind the teleportation experiments , expeditions into Hell to retrieve specimens and Betruger 's increasing obsession with the tests , as well as of an archaeological dig under the surface of Mars . The dig is excavating the ruins of an ancient civilization discovered on Mars , and has produced a relic known as the Soul Cube . According to a scientist the marine finds alive in the labs , the Soul Cube is a weapon created by the ancient civilization to defend against the forces of Hell . The scientist also reveals that the invasion began when Betruger took the Soul Cube into the portal at the beginning of the game , depositing it in Hell . The marine pursues Betruger through the labs , but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after being lured into a trap by Betruger . 
 The portal takes the marine directly into Hell , where he proceeds to fight his way through the large number of demons to the Soul Cube , defeating its demonic guardian . The marine is then able to <unk> the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs . Betruger , however , tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed , Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars , capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars . Further in the Delta Labs , the marine encounters the injured Swann . Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time , and has been transformed by the demons . Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly , Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make his way out of the base alone . 
 However , when the marine catches up with Campbell in the central computer processing sector of the base , Campbell is mortally wounded and only has enough strength to say that Kelly has taken Campbell 's BFG 9000 weapon before expiring . Kelly then begins to taunt the marine in a demonic voice . The marine eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core , revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank @-@ like base . The marine is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under the Martian surface to Site 3 , the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed . At the primary excavation site , the marine discovers the Hellmouth , defended by Hell 's mightiest warrior , the <unk> . Using the Soul Cube , the marine defeats the <unk> in combat , and the Soul Cube then seals the Hellmouth . The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover the carnage . They find the marine alive , but discover that Swann has died . They are , however , unable to locate Betruger , who in the final scene is shown in Hell , reincarnated as a dragon @-@ like demon .

 In June 2000 , id Software 's game engine designer John Carmack posted an internal company plan announcing a remake of Doom using next generation technology . This plan revealed controversy had been growing within id Software over remaking Doom . Kevin Cloud and Adrian Carmack , two of id Software 's owners , were always strongly opposed to remaking Doom , believing that id was going back to the same formulas and properties too often . However , after the positive reception to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the latest improvements in rendering technology , most of the employees agreed that a remake was the right idea and presented the two owners with an ultimatum : allow them to remake Doom or fire them . After the reasonably amicable confrontation ( although artist Paul Steed , one of the instigators , was fired in retaliation ) , the agreement to work on Doom 3 was <unk> id Software began development on Doom 3 in late 2000 , immediately after finishing Quake III : Team Arena . In 2001 , it was first shown to the public at Macworld Conference & Expo in Tokyo and was later demonstrated at E3 2002 , where a fifteen @-@ minute gameplay demo was shown . It won five awards at E3 that year . 
 Early in Doom 3 's development , Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails , a fan of the Doom games , was set to compose the music and sound effects to Doom 3 . However , due to " time , money and bad management " , none of Trent Reznor 's sound effects or music made the final product . Eventually , Nine Inch Nails ' former drummer , Chris Vrenna , composed and performed the game 's theme song . 
 We never really did come to an actual agreement with Trent . The original idea was just for him to do all of the sound design for the game . I don 't think Trent anticipated how long and how involved that process was and what is involved in game design versus what he does in the music and production side . It just wasn 't a good mix with how much time it was going to take him , the value it was going to provide to the game , and what we could afford to pay . Trent 's a popular guy . He 's a rock star , and his time is valued in rock star dollars . 
 Doom 3 was also intended to be more storyline focused than previous id titles , as was demonstrated by the developers ' conscious effort to have more professional voice acting . Late in 2002 , two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet . One year later , a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software 's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project , although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not be ready for the 2003 holiday season . According to John Carmack , the development took longer than expected .

 According to John Carmack , the lead graphics engine developer at id Software , the technology of Doom 3 was supported by three primary features : unified lighting and shadowing , complex animations and scripting that showed real @-@ time with fully dynamic per @-@ pixel lighting and stencil shadowing , and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game . The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing . Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data , most light sources are computed in real @-@ time . This allows lights to cast shadows even on non @-@ static objects such as monsters and machinery , which was impossible with static non @-@ directional lightmaps . A shortcoming of this approach is the engine 's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination . 
 To increase the interactivity with the game @-@ world , id Software designed hundreds of high @-@ resolution animated screens for in @-@ game computers . Rather than using a simple " use key " to operate these computers , the crosshair acts as a mouse cursor over the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world . This allows for in @-@ game computer terminal to perform more than one function , from operating security door codes , activating machinery , toggling lights or unlocking weapons lockers . According to the Doom 3 manual , GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500 @,@ 000 lines of script code , and generated more than 25 @,@ 000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces , computer screens , and displays throughout Doom 3 . Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures , realistic handling of object physics , dynamic , ambient soundtrack , and multi @-@ channel sound . Doom 3 on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5 @.@ 1 surround sound .

 Doom 3 achieved gold status on July 14 , 2004 and a Mac OS X release was confirmed the next day . Doom 3 was released in the United States on August 3 , 2004 and to the rest of the world on August 13 . Due to high demand , the game was made available at select outlets at midnight on the date of release . Additionally , a Linux version was released on October 4 , 2004 by Timothee <unk> . The Mac OS X version was released on March 14 , 2005 and on February 20 , 2006 the patch 1 @.@ 3 Rev A included a universal binary , adding support for Mac OS X on the x86 architecture . Finally , the modified Xbox conversion was released on April 3 , 2005 , featuring a limited steel book edition which included Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 . 
 A week before the game 's release , it became known that an agreement to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company . The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack 's Reverse , which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative <unk> id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique in the finished game , so to defuse the issue , id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits . 
 During the keynote address at QuakeCon 2011 , John Carmack announced that the source code for the Doom 3 engine would be released . The source code was open @-@ sourced under the GPL on November 22 , 2011 . It contains minor tweaks to the shadow rendering code to avoid potential patent infringement with a patent held by Creative Labs . Art assets such as 3D models , music , sound effects etc. remain subject to the EULA .

 On April 3 , 2005 , eight months after the release of Doom 3 , id Software released an expansion pack for Doom 3 on Windows . The expansion , entitled Resurrection of Evil , was developed by Nerve Software , a company that had partnered with id Software on several other projects , including Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the Xbox conversion of Doom . Once again published by Activision , a Linux version was released on May 24 , 2005 , and an Xbox version followed on October 5 , 2005 . The expansion featured a new twelve @-@ level single player campaign , set two years after the original storyline , as well as three new weapons , one of which is geared towards manipulating the physics in the game . Several new enemy characters were also introduced . Multiplayer gameplay was enhanced , officially increasing the player limit to eight and adding new game modes such as capture the flag . Resurrection of Evil 's reception was not as positive as it had been for Doom 3 , but still received generally favorable reviews from the industry 's critics .

 A re @-@ release of Doom 3 called Doom 3 : BFG Edition , which was published by Bethesda Softworks , was released on October 15 , 2012 , in Australia , October 16 , 2012 in North America , October 19 , 2012 in Europe and November 22 , 2012 in Japan for PC , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . The BFG Edition features enhanced graphics , better sound with more horror effects , a checkpoint save system , and support for 3D displays and <unk> . The game also includes the previous expansion Resurrection of Evil and a new single @-@ player expansion pack called The Lost Mission . Additionally , it includes copies of the original Doom ( the Ultimate Doom edition with the add @-@ on fourth episode , " Thy Flesh Consumed " ) , and Doom II with the expansion No Rest for the Living , previously available for the Xbox 360 . The BFG Edition also features the ability to use the flashlight while holding a weapon , in the form of the so @-@ called armor @-@ mounted flashlight . The PC version of Doom 3 : BFG Edition requires the Steam client and a valid Steam account for installation , play and achievements . The versions of Doom I and II released with BFG have been censored in some ways . And in doom 3 with the noticeable removal of the co @-@ op campaign for single player campaign . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Doom 3 was a critical and commercial success for id Software ; by the beginning of 2007 , over 3 @.@ 5 million copies of Doom 3 had been sold , making it the most successful project by id Software to date . The game engine for Doom 3 , id Tech 4 , has been licensed out for the use of other developers , such as in Human Head Studios ' Prey , Raven Software 's Quake 4 , Splash Damage 's Enemy Territory : Quake Wars , Raven Software 's Wolfenstein and Splash Damage 's Brink ; however id Tech 4 has not been widely licensed compared to Epic Games ' Unreal Engine . 
 Doom 3 received a favorable reception from critics , with the PC version of the game holding an 87 percent score and an 88 percent score at the review compilation sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively . Much praise was given to the quality of Doom 3 's graphics and presentation ; GameSpot described the game 's environments as " convincingly lifelike , densely atmospheric , and surprisingly expansive " , while PC Gamer UK described the graphics and non @-@ player character modeling and animation as simply " flawless " , stating that Doom 3 signalled the return of the Doom franchise to the forefront of the computer and video game industry , eleven years after the release of the original Doom . IGN 's Dan Adams noted that the game 's presentation comprised a remarkably high proportion of the game , stating that " without the atmosphere , Doom 3 is a plain shooter that hearkens back to those of the ' 90s . " In addition , several reviewers praised id Software for making the game still look surprisingly good even on lower graphics levels . 
 A number of reviewers also praised the attention paid to the game 's premise and setting ; GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin described getting " the impression that Doom 3 takes place in a fully realized world " while IGN noted that " the UAC base also has a very worn and lived @-@ in feel that adds to the realism . " Eurogamer in particular pointed out that the game 's opening sequence " feels like a fitting tribute to the excellent ideas " of Valve Software 's genre @-@ defining Half @-@ Life . 
 Many reviewers noted that Doom 3 stuck with a similar " run and gun " gameplay style that was successful with its predecessors , and the game was alternately praised and criticized for this element . Several reviews were critical of a perceived repetitiveness in gameplay after a while . In addition , the game 's artificial intelligence was not regarded as particularly challenging , with GameSpot noting that " enemies follow the same sorts of predictable patterns that [ players ] may remember from previous Doom games " while GameSpy stated the way enemies would spawn to attack the player was " gimmicky " ; the reviewer noted that players would realize that picking up a lone armor vest would cause a variety of zombies to emerge from hidden compartments in the dark . In addition , several reviewers noted that the game 's methods of conveying the story were " ineffectual " , compounded by the lack of an identity for the player character . Finally , the game 's multiplayer was seen as lacking in innovation , with its low player limits and small number of game modes , particularly in contrast to id Software 's influential Quake III Arena . 
 The Xbox version of Doom 3 received a similar level of critical support , holding a score of 88 percent on Metacritic and an 87 @.@ 7 percent score on GameRankings . The game was praised and faulted on many of the same issues as the PC version , although the game was praised for maintaining smooth and user @-@ friendly controls on a gamepad , as well as for including a two player co @-@ operative multiplayer mode , which IGN described as " worth the price of admission alone . " However , some criticism was directed towards slow @-@ downs in play due to the game engine , despite being scaled down for the Xbox , still being demanding on the Xbox hardware .

 In early 2008 , a new series of Doom novels by Matthew J. Costello were published , an author who had worked on the story and scripts for Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil ; previous Doom novels had expanded the storyline of the original two Doom games . The series of books aim to novelize the story of Doom 3 , with the first installment , Worlds on Fire , published on February 26 , 2008 . The second book in the series , Maelstrom , was released in March 2009 . 
 On November 22 , 2011 , the source code of the Doom 3 engine was released under the GPL , but the game 's artwork content still remains under the EULA . A later source code drop also included the changes made for the BFG Edition , allowing the re @-@ release to potentially be ported to other previously unsupported platforms such as Linux and OS X , and such a port was eventually released .

 = Æthelstan = 
 Æthelstan or Athelstan ( Old English : <unk> , <unk> , meaning " noble stone " ; c . 894 – 27 October 939 ) was King of the Anglo @-@ Saxons from 924 to 927 and King of the English from 927 to 939 . He was the son of King Edward the Elder and his first wife , Ecgwynn . Modern historians regard him as the first King of England and one of the greatest Anglo @-@ Saxon kings . He never married , and was succeeded by his half @-@ brother , Edmund . 
 When Edward died in July 924 , Æthelstan was accepted by the Mercians as king . His half @-@ brother Ælfweard may have been recognised as king in Wessex , but died within weeks of their father 's death . Æthelstan still encountered resistance in Wessex for several months , and was not crowned until September 925 . In 927 he conquered the last remaining Viking kingdom , York , making him the first Anglo @-@ Saxon ruler of the whole of England . In 934 he invaded Scotland and forced Constantine II to submit to him , but Æthelstan 's rule was resented by the Scots and Vikings , and in 937 they invaded England . Æthelstan defeated them at the Battle of Brunanburh , a victory which gave him great prestige both in the British Isles and on the Continent . After his death in 939 the Vikings seized back control of York , and it was not finally reconquered until 954 . 
 Æthelstan centralised government ; he increased control over the production of charters and summoned leading figures from distant areas to his councils . These meetings were also attended by rulers from outside his territory , especially Welsh kings , who thus acknowledged his overlordship . More legal texts survive from his reign than from any other tenth @-@ century English king . They show his concern about widespread robberies , and the threat they posed to social order . His legal reforms built on those of his grandfather , Alfred the Great . Æthelstan was one of the most pious West Saxon kings , and was known for collecting relics and founding churches . His household was the centre of English learning during his reign , and it laid the foundation for the Benedictine monastic reform later in the century . No other West Saxon king played as important a role in European politics as Æthelstan , and he arranged the marriages of several of his sisters to continental rulers . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the ninth century the many kingdoms of the early Anglo @-@ Saxon period had been consolidated into four : Wessex , Mercia , Northumbria and East Anglia . In the eighth century , Mercia had been the most powerful kingdom in southern England , but in the early ninth , Wessex became dominant under Æthelstan 's great @-@ great @-@ grandfather , Egbert . In the middle of the century , England came under increasing attack from Viking raids , culminating in invasion by the Great Heathen Army in 865 . By 878 , the Vikings had overrun East Anglia , Northumbria , and Mercia , and nearly conquered Wessex . The West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great , and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington . Alfred and the Viking leader Guthrum agreed on a division that gave Alfred western Mercia , while eastern Mercia was incorporated into Viking East Anglia . In the 890s , renewed Viking attacks were successfully fought off by Alfred , assisted by his son ( and Æthelstan 's father ) Edward and Æthelred , Lord of the Mercians . Æthelred ruled English Mercia under Alfred and was married to his daughter Æthelflæd . Alfred died in 899 and was succeeded by Edward . Æthelwold , the son of Æthelred , King Alfred 's older brother and predecessor as king , made a bid for power , but was killed at the Battle of the Holme in 902 . 
 Little is known of warfare between the English and the Danes over the next few years , but in 909 , Edward sent a West Saxon and Mercian army to ravage Northumbria . The following year the Northumbrian Danes attacked Mercia , but suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Tettenhall . Æthelred died in 911 and was succeeded as ruler of Mercia by his widow Æthelflæd . Over the next decade Edward and Æthelflæd conquered Viking Mercia and East Anglia . Æthelflæd died in 918 and was briefly succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn , but in the same year Edward deposed her and took direct control of Mercia . 
 When Edward died in 924 , he controlled all of England south of the Humber . The Viking king Sihtric ruled the Kingdom of York in southern Northumbria , but Ealdred maintained Anglo @-@ Saxon rule in at least part of the former kingdom of Bernicia from his base in Bamburgh in northern Northumbria . Constantine II ruled Scotland , apart from the southwest , which was the British Kingdom of Strathclyde . Wales was divided into a number of small kingdoms , including Deheubarth in the southwest , Gwent in the southeast , Brycheiniog immediately north of Gwent , and Gwynedd in the north . 
 = = Early life = = 
 According to William of Malmesbury , Æthelstan was thirty years old when he came to the throne in 924 , which would mean that he was born in about 894 . He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest . He was Edward 's only son by his first consort , Ecgwynn . Very little is known about Ecgwynn , and she is not named in any pre @-@ Conquest source . Medieval chroniclers gave varying descriptions of her rank : one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth , while others described her birth as noble . Modern historians also disagree about her status . Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder 's concubine . However , Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession , and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward 's legitimate wife . She may have been related to St Dunstan . 
 William of Malmesbury wrote that Alfred the Great honoured his young grandson with a ceremony in which he gave him a scarlet cloak , a belt set with gems , and a sword with a gilded scabbard . Medieval Latin scholar Michael Lapidge and historian Michael Wood see this as designating Æthelstan as a potential heir at a time when the claim of Alfred 's nephew , Æthelwold , to the throne represented a threat to the succession of Alfred 's direct line , but historian Janet Nelson suggests that it should be seen in the context of conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s , and might reflect an intention to divide the realm between his son and his grandson after his death . Historian Martin Ryan goes further , suggesting that at the end of his life Alfred may have favoured Æthelstan rather than Edward as his successor . An acrostic poem praising prince " <unk> " , and prophesying a great future for him , has been interpreted by Lapidge as referring to the young Æthelstan , punning on the old English meaning of his name , " noble stone " . Lapidge and Wood see the poem as a commemoration of Alfred 's ceremony by one of his leading scholars , John the Old Saxon . In Michael Wood 's view , the poem confirms the truth of William of Malmesbury 's account of the ceremony . Wood also suggests that Æthelstan may have been the first English king to be groomed from childhood as an intellectual , and that John was probably his tutor . However , Sarah Foot argues that the acrostic poem makes better sense if it is dated to the beginning of Æthelstan 's reign . 
 Edward married his second wife , Ælfflæd , at about the time of his father 's death , probably because Ecgwynn had died , although she may have been put aside . The new marriage weakened Æthelstan 's position , as his step @-@ mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons , Ælfweard and Edwin . By 920 Edward had taken a third wife , Eadgifu , probably after putting Ælfflæd aside . Eadgifu also had two sons , the future kings Edmund and Eadred . Edward had several daughters , perhaps as many as nine . 
 Æthelstan 's later education was probably at the Mercian court of his aunt and uncle , Æthelflæd and Æthelred , and it is likely that the young prince gained his military training in the Mercian campaigns to conquer the Danelaw . According to a transcript dating from 1304 , in 925 Æthelstan gave a charter of privileges to St Oswald 's Priory , Gloucester , where his aunt and uncle were buried , " according to a pact of paternal piety which he formerly pledged with Æthelred , ealdorman of the people of the Mercians " . When Edward took direct control of Mercia after Æthelflæd 's death in 918 , Æthelstan may have represented his father 's interests there . 
 = = Reign = = 
 = = = The struggle for power = = = 
 Edward died at Farndon in northern Mercia on 17 July 924 , and the ensuing events are unclear . Ælfweard , Edward 's eldest son by Ælfflæd , had ranked above Æthelstan in attesting a charter in 901 , and Edward may have intended Ælfweard to be his successor as king , either of Wessex only or of the whole kingdom . If Edward had intended his realms to be divided after his death , his deposition of Ælfwynn in Mercia in 918 may have been intended to prepare the way for Æthelstan 's succession as king of Mercia . When Edward died , Æthelstan was apparently with him in Mercia , while Ælfweard was in Wessex . Mercia acknowledged Æthelstan as king , and Wessex may have chosen Ælfweard . However , Ælfweard outlived his father by only sixteen days , disrupting any succession plan . 
 Even after Ælfweard 's death there seems to have been opposition to Æthelstan in Wessex , particularly in Winchester , where Ælfweard was buried . At first Æthelstan behaved as a Mercian king . A charter relating to land in Derbyshire , which appears to have been issued at a time in 925 when his authority had not yet been recognised outside Mercia , was witnessed only by Mercian bishops . In the view of historians David Dumville and Janet Nelson he may have agreed not to marry or have heirs in order to gain acceptance . However , Sarah Foot ascribes his decision to remain unmarried to " a religiously motivated determination on chastity as a way of life " . 
 The coronation of Æthelstan took place on 4 September 925 at Kingston upon Thames , perhaps due to its symbolic location on the border between Wessex and Mercia . He was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Athelm , who probably designed or organised a new ordo ( religious order of service ) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet . The new ordo was influenced by West Frankish liturgy and in turn became one of the sources of the medieval French ordo . 
 Opposition seems to have continued even after the coronation . According to William of Malmesbury , an otherwise unknown nobleman called Alfred plotted to blind Æthelstan on account of his supposed illegitimacy , although it is unknown whether he aimed to make himself king or was acting on behalf of Edwin , Ælfweard 's younger brother . Blinding would have been a sufficient disability to render Æthelstan ineligible for kingship without incurring the odium attached to murder . Tensions between Æthelstan and Winchester seem to have continued for some years . The Bishop of Winchester , Frithestan , did not attend the coronation or witness any of Æthelstan 's known charters until 928 . After that he witnessed fairly regularly until his resignation in 931 , but was listed in a lower position than entitled by his seniority . 
 In 933 Edwin was drowned in a shipwreck in the North Sea . His cousin , Adelolf , Count of Boulogne , took his body for burial at St Bertin Abbey in Saint @-@ Omer . According to the abbey 's annalist , Folcuin , who wrongly believed that Edwin had been king , he had fled England " driven by some disturbance in his kingdom " . Folcuin stated that Æthelstan sent alms to the abbey for his dead brother and received monks from the abbey graciously when they came to England , although Folcuin did not realise that Æthelstan died before the monks made the journey in 944 . The twelfth @-@ century chronicler Symeon of Durham said that Æthelstan ordered Edwin to be drowned , but this is generally dismissed by historians . Edwin might have fled England after an unsuccessful rebellion against his brother 's rule , and his death probably helped put an end to Winchester 's opposition .

 Edward the Elder had conquered the Danish territories in Mercia and East Anglia with the assistance of Æthelflæd and her husband , but when Edward died the Danish king Sihtric still ruled the Viking Kingdom of York ( formerly the southern Northumbrian kingdom of Deira ) . In January 926 , Æthelstan arranged for one of his sisters to marry Sihtric . The two kings agreed not to invade each other 's territories or to support each other 's enemies . The following year Sihtric died , and Æthelstan seized the chance to invade . Guthfrith , a cousin of Sihtric , led a fleet from Dublin to try to take the throne , but Æthelstan easily prevailed . He captured York and received the submission of the Danish people . According to a southern chronicler , he " succeeded to the kingdom of the Northumbrians " , and it is uncertain whether he had to fight Guthfrith . Southern kings had never ruled the north , and his usurpation was met with outrage by the Northumbrians , who had always resisted southern control . However , at Eamont , near Penrith , on 12 July 927 , King Constantine of Scotland , King Hywel Dda of Deheubarth , Ealdred of Bamburgh , and King Owain of Strathclyde ( or Morgan ap Owain of Gwent ) accepted Æthelstan 's overlordship . His triumph led to seven years of peace in the north . 
 Whereas Æthelstan was the first English king to achieve lordship over northern Britain , he inherited his authority over the Welsh kings from his father and aunt . In the <unk> Gwent acknowledged the lordship of Wessex , and Deheubarth and Gwynedd accepted that of Æthelflæd of Mercia ; following Edward 's takeover of Mercia , they transferred their allegiance to him . According to William of Malmesbury , after the meeting at Eamont Æthelstan summoned the Welsh kings to Hereford , where he imposed a heavy annual tribute and fixed the border between England and Wales in the Hereford area at the River Wye . The dominant figure in Wales was Hywel Dda of Deheubarth , described by the historian of early medieval Wales Thomas Charles @-@ Edwards as " the <unk> ally of the ' emperors of Britain ' among all the kings of his day " . Welsh kings attended Æthelstan 's court between 928 and 935 and witnessed charters at the head of the list of laity ( apart from the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde ) , showing that their position was regarded as superior to that of the other great men present . The alliance produced peace between Wales and England , and within Wales , lasting throughout Æthelstan 's reign , though some Welsh resented the status of their rulers as under @-@ kings , as well as the high level of tribute imposed upon them . In Armes <unk> <unk> ( The Great Prophecy of Britain ) , a Welsh poet foresaw the day when the British would rise up against their Saxon oppressors and drive them into the sea . 
 According to William of Malmesbury , after the Hereford meeting Æthelstan went on to expel the Cornish from Exeter , fortify its walls , and fix the Cornish boundary at the River Tamar . This account is regarded sceptically by historians , however , as Cornwall had been under English rule since the mid @-@ ninth century . Thomas Charles @-@ Edwards describes it as " an improbable story " , while historian John Reuben Davies sees it as the suppression of a British revolt and the confinement of the Cornish beyond the Tamar . Æthelstan emphasised his control by establishing a new Cornish see and appointing its first bishop , but Cornwall kept its own culture and language . 
 Æthelstan became the first king of all the Anglo @-@ Saxon peoples , and in effect overlord of Britain . His successes inaugurated what John Maddicott , in his history of the origins of the English Parliament , calls the imperial phase of English kingship between about 925 and 975 , when rulers from Wales and Scotland attended the assemblies of English kings and witnessed their charters . Æthelstan tried to reconcile the aristocracy in his new territory of Northumbria to his rule . He lavished gifts on the minsters of Beverley , Chester @-@ le @-@ Street , and York , emphasising his Christianity . He also purchased the vast territory of Amounderness in Lancashire , and gave it to the Archbishop of York , his most important lieutenant in the region . But he remained a resented outsider , and the northern British kingdoms preferred to ally with the pagan Norse of Dublin . In contrast to his strong control over southern Britain , his position in the north was far more tenuous . 
 = = = The invasion of Scotland in 934 = = = 
 In 934 Æthelstan invaded Scotland . His reasons are unclear , and historians give alternative explanations . The death of his half @-@ brother Edwin in 933 might have finally removed factions in Wessex opposed to his rule . Guthfrith , the Norse king of Dublin who had briefly ruled Northumbria , died in 934 ; any resulting insecurity among the Danes would have given Æthelstan an opportunity to stamp his authority on the north . An entry in the Annals of Clonmacnoise , recording the death in 934 of a ruler who was possibly Ealdred of Bamburgh , suggests another possible explanation . This points to a dispute between Æthelstan and Constantine over control of his territory . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle briefly recorded the expedition without explanation , but the twelfth @-@ century chronicler John of Worcester stated that Constantine had broken his treaty with Æthelstan . 
 Æthelstan set out on his campaign in May 934 , accompanied by four Welsh kings : Hywel Dda of Deheubarth , Idwal Foel of Gwynedd , Morgan ap Owain of Gwent , and Tewdwr ap <unk> of Brycheiniog . His retinue also included eighteen bishops and thirteen earls , six of whom were Danes from eastern England . By late June or early July he had reached Chester @-@ le @-@ Street , where he made generous gifts to the tomb of St Cuthbert , including a stole and maniple ( ecclesiastical garments ) originally commissioned by his step @-@ mother Ælfflæd as a gift to Bishop Frithestan of Winchester . The invasion was launched by land and sea . According to the twelfth @-@ century chronicler Simeon of Durham , his land forces ravaged as far as Dunnottar in north @-@ east Scotland , while the fleet raided Caithness , then probably part of the Norse kingdom of Orkney . 
 No battles are recorded during the campaign , and chronicles do not record its outcome . By September , however , he was back in the south of England at Buckingham , where Constantine witnessed a charter as subregulus , that is a king acknowledging Æthelstan 's overlordship . In 935 a charter was attested by Constantine , Owain of Strathclyde , Hywel Dda , Idwal Foel , and Morgan ap Owain . At Christmas of the same year Owain of Strathclyde was once more at Æthelstan 's court along with the Welsh kings , but Constantine was not . His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances . 
 = = = The Battle of Brunanburh = = = 
 In 934 Olaf Guthfrithson succeeded his father Guthfrith as the Norse King of Dublin . The alliance between the Norse and the Scots was cemented by the marriage of Olaf to Constantine 's daughter . By August 937 Olaf had defeated his rivals for control of the Viking part of Ireland , and he promptly launched a bid for the former Norse kingdom of York . Individually Olaf and Constantine were too weak to oppose Æthelstan , but together they could hope to challenge the dominance of Wessex . In the autumn they joined with the Strathclyde Britons under Owain to invade England . Medieval campaigning was normally conducted in the summer , and Æthelstan could hardly have expected an invasion on such a large scale so late in the year . He seems to have been slow to react , and an old Latin poem preserved by William of Malmesbury accused him of having " languished in sluggish leisure " . The allies plundered English territory while Æthelstan took his time gathering a West Saxon and Mercian army . However , Michael Wood praises his caution , arguing that unlike Harold in 1066 , he did not allow himself to be provoked into precipitate action . When he marched north , the Welsh did not join him , and they did not fight on either side . 
 The two sides met at the Battle of Brunanburh , resulting in an overwhelming victory for Æthelstan , supported by his young half @-@ brother , the future King Edmund I. Olaf escaped back to Dublin with the remnant of his forces , while Constantine lost a son . The English also suffered heavy losses , including two of Æthelstan 's cousins , sons of Edward the Elder 's younger brother , Æthelweard . 
 The battle was reported in the Annals of Ulster : 
 A great , lamentable and horrible battle was cruelly fought between the Saxons and the Northmen , in which several thousands of Northmen , who are uncounted , fell , but their king <unk> [ Olaf ] , escaped with a few followers . A large number of Saxons fell on the other side , but Æthelstan , king of the Saxons , enjoyed a great victory . 
 A generation later , the chronicler Æthelweard reported that it was popularly remembered as " the great battle " , and it sealed Æthelstan 's posthumous reputation as " victorious because of God " ( in the words of the homilist Ælfric of Eynsham ) . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle abandoned its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory , employing imperial language to present Æthelstan as ruler of an empire of Britain . The site of the battle is uncertain , however , and over thirty sites have been suggested , with Bromborough on the Wirral the most favoured among historians . 
 Historians disagree over the significance of the battle . Alex Woolf describes it as a " pyrrhic victory " for Æthelstan : the campaign seems to have ended in a stalemate , his power appears to have declined , and after he died Olaf acceded to the kingdom of Northumbria without resistance . Alfred Smyth describes it as " the greatest battle in Anglo @-@ Saxon history " , but he also states that its consequences beyond Æthelstan 's reign have been overstated . In the view of Sarah Foot , on the other hand , it would be difficult to exaggerate the battle 's importance : if the Anglo @-@ Saxons had been defeated , their hegemony over the whole mainland of Britain would have disintegrated . According to historian Michael Livingston : 
 ... it would be no small stretch to consider the battle the moment when Englishness came of age . The men who fought and died on that field forged a political map of the future that remains with us today , arguably making the Battle at Brunanburh one of the most significant battles in the long history not just of England but of the whole of the British Isles . 
 = = Kingship = = 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 Anglo @-@ Saxon kings ruled through ealdormen , who had the highest lay status under the king . In ninth @-@ century Wessex they each ruled a single shire , but by the middle of the tenth they had authority over a much wider area , a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to deal with the problems of governing his extended realm . One of the ealdormen , who was also called Æthelstan , governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia , the largest and wealthiest province of England . After the king 's death , he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half @-@ King . Several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had Scandinavian names , and while the localities they came from cannot be identified , they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder , and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government . 
 Beneath the ealdormen , reeves — royal officials who were noble local landowners — were in charge of a town or royal estate . The authority of church and state was not separated in early medieval societies , and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots , who also attended the king 's royal councils . 
 As the first king of all the Anglo @-@ Saxon peoples , Æthelstan needed effective means to govern his extended realm . Building on the foundations of his predecessors , he created the most centralised government that England had yet seen . Previously , some charters had been produced by royal priests and others by members of religious houses , but between 928 and 935 they were produced exclusively by a scribe known to historians as " Æthelstan A " , showing an unprecedented degree of royal control over an important activity . Unlike earlier and later charters , " Æthelstan A " provides full details of the date and place of adoption and an unusually long witness list , providing crucial information for historians . After " Æthelstan A " retired or died , charters reverted to a simpler form , suggesting that they had been the work of an individual , rather than the development of a formal writing office . 
 A key mechanism of government was the Royal Council ( or witan ) . Anglo @-@ Saxon kings did not have a fixed capital city . Their courts were peripatetic , and their councils were held at varying locations around their realms . Æthelstan stayed mainly in Wessex , however , and controlled outlying areas by summoning leading figures to his councils . The small and intimate meetings that had been adequate until the enlargement of the kingdom under Edward the Elder gave way to large bodies attended by bishops , ealdormen , thegns , magnates from distant areas , and independent rulers who had submitted to his authority . Frank Stenton sees Æthelstan 's councils as " national assemblies " , which did much to break down the provincialism that was a barrier to the unification of England . John Maddicott goes further , seeing them as the start of centralised assemblies that had a defined role in English government , and Æthelstan as " the true if unwitting founder of the English parliament " . 
 = = = Law = = = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxons were the first people in northern Europe to write administrative documents in the vernacular , and law codes in Old English go back to Æthelberht of Kent at the beginning of the seventh century . The law code of Alfred the Great , from the end of the ninth century , was also written in the vernacular , and he expected his ealdormen to learn it . His code was strongly influenced by Carolingian law going back to Charlemagne in such areas as treason , peace @-@ keeping , organisation of the hundreds and judicial ordeal . It remained in force throughout the tenth century , and Æthelstan 's codes were built on this foundation . Legal codes required the approval of the king , but they were treated as guidelines which could be adapted and added to at local level , rather than a fixed canon of regulations , and customary oral law was also important in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . 
 More legal texts survive from Æthelstan 's reign than from any other tenth @-@ century English king . The earliest appear to be his tithe edict and the " Ordinance on Charities " . Four legal codes were adopted at Royal Councils in the early 930s at Grately in Hampshire , Exeter , Faversham in Kent , and Thunderfield in Surrey . Local legal texts survive from London and Kent , and one concerning the ' <unk> ' on the Welsh border probably also dates to Æthelstan 's reign . In the view of the historian of English law , Patrick Wormald , the laws must have been written by Wulfhelm , who succeeded Athelm as Archbishop of Canterbury in 926 . Other historians see Wulfhelm 's role as less important , giving the main credit to Æthelstan himself , although the significance placed on the ordeal as an ecclesiastical ritual shows the increased influence of the church . Nicholas Brooks sees the role of the bishops as marking an important stage in the increasing involvement of the church in the making and enforcement of law . 
 The two earliest codes were concerned with clerical matters , and Æthelstan stated that he acted on the advice of Wulfhelm and his bishops . The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church . The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan 's reeves , specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually . His religious outlook is shown in a wider <unk> of the law in his reign . 
 The later codes show his concern with threats to social order , especially robbery , which he regarded as the most important manifestation of social breakdown . The first of these later codes , issued at Grately , prescribed harsh penalties , including the death penalty for anyone over twelve years old caught in the act of stealing goods worth more than eight pence . This apparently had little effect , as Æthelstan admitted in the Exeter code : 
 I King Æthelstan , declare that I have learned that the public peace has not been kept to the extent , either of my wishes , or of the provisions laid down at Grately , and my councillors say that I have suffered this too long . 
 In desperation the Council tried a different strategy , offering an amnesty to thieves if they paid compensation to their victims . The problem of powerful families protecting criminal relatives was to be solved by expelling them to other parts of the realm . This strategy did not last long , and at Thunderfield Æthelstan returned to the hard line , softened by raising the minimum age for the death penalty to fifteen " because he thought it too cruel to kill so many young people and for such small crimes as he understood to be the case everywhere " . His reign saw the first introduction of the system of tithing , sworn groups of ten or more men who were jointly responsible for peace @-@ keeping ( later known as <unk> ) . Sarah Foot commented that tithing and oath @-@ taking to deal with the problem of theft had its origin in Frankia : 
 But the equation of theft with disloyalty to Æthelstan 's person appears peculiar to him . His preoccupation with theft — tough on theft , tough on the causes of theft — finds no direct parallel in other kings ' codes . 
 Historians differ widely regarding Æthelstan 's legislation . Patrick Wormald 's verdict was harsh : " The hallmark of Æthelstan 's law @-@ making is the gulf dividing its exalted aspirations from his spasmodic impact . " In his view , " The legislative activity of Æthelstan 's reign has rightly been dubbed ' feverish ' ... But the extant results are , frankly , a mess . " In the view of Simon Keynes , however , " Without any doubt the most impressive aspect of King Æthelstan 's government is the vitality of his law @-@ making " , which shows him driving his officials to do their duties and insisting on respect for the law , but also demonstrates the difficulty he had in controlling a troublesome people . Keynes sees the Grately code as " an impressive piece of legislation " showing the king 's determination to maintain social order . David Pratt describes his legislation as " a deep and far @-@ reaching reform of legal structures , no less important than developments under King Alfred two generations earlier " . 
 = = = Coinage = = = 
 In the 970s , Æthelstan 's nephew , King Edgar , reformed the monetary system to give Anglo @-@ Saxon England the most advanced currency in Europe , with a good quality silver coinage , which was uniform and abundant . In Æthelstan 's time , however , it was far less developed , and minting was still organised regionally long after Æthelstan unified the country . The Grately code included a provision that there was to be only one coinage across the king 's dominion . However , this is in a section that appears to be copied from a code of his father , and the list of towns with mints is confined to the south , including London and Kent , but not northern Wessex or other regions . Early in Æthelstan 's reign , different styles of coin were issued in each region , but after he conquered York and received the submission of the other British kings , he issued a new coinage , known as the " circumscription cross " type . This advertised his newly exalted status with the inscription , " Rex <unk> Britanniae " . Examples were minted in Wessex , York , and English Mercia ( in Mercia bearing the title " Rex <unk> " ) , but not in East Anglia or the Danelaw . 
 In the early 930s a new coinage was issued , the " crowned bust " type , with the king shown for the first time wearing a crown with three stalks . This was eventually issued in all regions apart from Mercia , which issued coins without a ruler portrait , suggesting , in Sarah Foot 's view , that any Mercian affection for a West Saxon king brought up among them quickly declined . 
 = = = Church = = = 
 Church and state maintained close relations in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , both socially and politically . Churchmen attended royal feasts as well as meetings of the Royal Council . During Æthelstan 's reign these relations became even closer , especially as the archbishopric of Canterbury had come under West Saxon jurisdiction since Edward the Elder annexed Mercia , and Æthelstan 's conquests brought the northern church under the control of a southern king for the first time . 
 Æthelstan appointed members of his own circle to bishoprics in Wessex , possibly to counter the influence of the Bishop of Winchester , Frithestan . One of the king 's mass @-@ priests ( priests employed to say Mass in his household ) , Ælfheah , became Bishop of Wells , while another , <unk> , succeeded Frithestan as Bishop of Winchester . <unk> was succeeded by another member of the royal household , also called Ælfheah . Two of the leading figures in the later tenth @-@ century Benedictine revival of Edgar 's reign , Dunstan and Æthelwold , served in early life at Æthelstan 's court and were ordained as priests by Ælfheah of Winchester at the king 's request . According to Æthelwold 's biographer , Wulfstan , " Æthelwold spent a long period in the royal palace in the king 's inseparable companionship and learned much from the king 's wise men that was useful and profitable to him " . Oda , a future Archbishop of Canterbury , was also close to Æthelstan , who appointed him Bishop of Ramsbury . Oda may have been present at the battle of Brunanburh . 
 Æthelstan was a noted collector of relics , and while this was a common practice at the time , he was marked out by the scale of his collection and the refinement of its contents . The abbot of Saint Samson in Dol sent him some as a gift , and in his covering letter he wrote : " we know you value relics more than earthly treasure " . Æthelstan was also a generous donor of manuscripts and relics to churches and monasteries . Indeed , his reputation was so great that some monastic scribes later falsely claimed that their institutions had been beneficiaries of his largesse . He was especially devoted to the cult of St. Cuthbert in Chester @-@ le @-@ Street , and his gifts to the community there included Bede 's Lives of Cuthbert . He commissioned it especially to present to Chester @-@ le Street , and out of all manuscripts he gave to a religious foundation which survive , it is the only one which was wholly written in England during his reign . This has a portrait of Æthelstan presenting the book to Cuthbert , the earliest surviving manuscript portrait of an English king . In the view of Janet Nelson , his " rituals of largesse and devotion at sites of supernatural power ... enhanced royal authority and underpinned a newly united imperial realm " . 
 Æthelstan had a reputation for founding churches , although it is unclear how justified this is . According to late and dubious sources , these churches included minsters at Milton Abbas in Dorset and Muchelney in Somerset . In the view of historian John Blair , the reputation is probably well @-@ founded , but " These waters are muddied by Æthelstan 's almost folkloric reputation as a founder , which made him a favourite hero of later origin @-@ myths . " However , while he was a generous donor to monasteries , he did not give land for new ones or attempt to revive the ones in the north and east destroyed by Viking attacks . 
 He also sought to build ties with continental churches . Cenwald was a royal priest before his appointment as Bishop of Worcester , and in 929 he accompanied two of Æthelstan 's half @-@ sisters to the Saxon court so that the future Holy Roman Emperor , Otto , could choose one of them as his wife . Cenwald went on to make a tour of German monasteries , giving lavish gifts on Æthelstan 's behalf and receiving in return promises that the monks would pray for the king and others close to him in perpetuity . England and Saxony became closer after the marriage alliance , and German names start to appear in English documents , while Cenwald kept up the contacts he had made by subsequent correspondence , helping the transmission of continental ideas about reformed monasticism to England . 
 = = = Learning = = = 
 Æthelstan built on his grandfather 's efforts to revive ecclesiastical scholarship , which had fallen to a low state in the second half of the ninth century . John Blair described Æthelstan 's achievement as " a determined reconstruction , visible to us especially through the circulation and production of books , of the shattered ecclesiastical culture " . He was renowned in his own day for his piety and promotion of sacred learning . His interest in education , and his reputation as a collector of books and relics , attracted a cosmopolitan group of ecclesiastical scholars to his court , particularly Bretons and Irish . Æthelstan gave extensive aid to Breton clergy who had fled Brittany following its conquest by the Vikings in 919 . He made a confraternity agreement with the clergy of Dol Cathedral in Brittany , who were then in exile in central France , and they sent him the relics of Breton saints , apparently hoping for his patronage . The contacts resulted in a surge in interest in England for commemorating Breton saints . One of the most notable scholars at Æthelstan 's court was Israel the Grammarian , who may have been a Breton . Israel and " a certain Frank " drew a board game called " Gospel Dice " for an Irish bishop , Dub Innse , who took it home to Bangor . Æthelstan 's court played a crucial role in the origins of the English monastic reform movement . 
 Few prose narrative sources survive from Æthelstan 's reign , but it produced an abundance of poetry , much of it Norse @-@ influenced praise of the King in grandiose terms , such as the Brunanburh poem . Sarah Foot even made a case that Beowulf may have been composed in Æthelstan 's circle . 
 Æthelstan 's court was the centre of a revival of the elaborate hermeneutic style of later Latin writers , influenced by the West Saxon scholar Aldhelm ( <unk> – 709 ) , and by early tenth @-@ century French monasticism . Foreign scholars at Æthelstan 's court such as Israel the Grammarian were practitioners . The style was characterised by long , convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms . The " Æthelstan A " charters were written in hermeneutic Latin . In the view of Simon Keynes it is no coincidence that they first appear immediately after the king had for the first time united England under his rule , and they show a high level of intellectual attainment and a monarchy invigorated by success and adopting the trappings of a new political order . The style influenced architects of the late tenth @-@ century monastic reformers educated at Æthelstan 's court such as Æthelwold and Dunstan , and became a hallmark of the movement . After " Æthelstan A " , charters became more simple , but the hermeneutic style returned in the charters of Eadwig and Edgar . 
 The historian W. H. Stevenson commented in 1898 : 
 The object of the compilers of these charters was to express their meaning by the use of the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent , bombastic words they could find . Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight . The invocation with its appended clauses , opening with pompous and partly alliterative words , will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type , and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter , leaving the reader , dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke , in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences . 
 However , Michael Lapidge argues that however unpalatable the hermeneutic style seems to modern taste , it was an important part of late Anglo @-@ Saxon culture , and deserves more sympathetic attention than it has received from modern historians . In the view of historian David Woodman , " Æthelstan A " should " be accorded recognition as an individual author of no little genius , a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also had the ability to write Latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex ... In many ways the diplomas of " Æthelstan A " represent the stylistic peak of the Anglo @-@ Saxon diplomatic tradition , a fitting complement to Æthelstan 's own momentous political feats and to the forging of what would become England . " 
 = = = British monarch = = = 
 Historians frequently comment on Æthelstan 's grand and extravagant titles . On his coins and charters he is described as Rex totius Britanniae , or " King of the whole of Britain " . A gospel book he donated to Christ Church , Canterbury is inscribed " Æthelstan , king of the English and ruler of the whole of Britain with a devout mind gave this book to the primatial see of Canterbury , to the church dedicated to Christ " . In charters from 931 he is " king of the English , elevated by the right hand of the almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain " , and in one manuscript dedication he is even styled " basileus et <unk> " , the titles of Byzantine emperors . Some historians are not impressed . " Clearly " , comments Alex Woolf , " King Æthelstan was a man who had pretensions , " while in the view of Simon Keynes , " Æthelstan A " proclaimed his master king of Britain " by wishful extension " . But according to George Molyneaux " this is to apply an anachronistic standard : tenth @-@ century kings had a loose but real hegemony throughout the island , and their titles only appear inflated if one assumes that kingship ought to involve domination of an intensity like that seen within the English kingdom of the eleventh and later centuries . " 
 Foreign contemporaries described him in panegyric terms . The French chronicler Flodoard described him as " the king from overseas " , and the Annals of Ulster as the " pillar of the dignity of the western world " . Some historians take a similar view . Michael Wood titled an essay , " The Making of King <unk> 's Empire : an English Charlemagne ? " , and described him as " the most powerful ruler that Britain had seen since the Romans " . In the view of Veronica Ortenberg , he was " the most powerful ruler in Europe " with an army that had repeatedly defeated the Vikings ; continental rulers saw him as a Carolingian emperor , who " was clearly treated as the new Charlemagne " . She wrote : 
 Wessex kings carried an aura of power and success , which made them increasingly powerful in the 920s , while most Continental houses were in military trouble and engaged in internecine warfare . While the civil wars and the Viking attacks on the Continent had spelled the end of unity of the Carolingian empire , which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms , military success had enabled Æthelstan to triumph at home and to attempt to go beyond the reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings , in order to develop a Carolingian ideology of kingship . 
 = = = European relations = = = 
 The West Saxon court had connections with the Carolingians going back to the marriage between Æthelstan 's great @-@ grandfather Æthelwulf and Judith , daughter of the king of West Francia ( and future Holy Roman Emperor ) , Charles the Bald , as well as the marriage of Alfred the Great 's daughter , Ælfthryth to Judith 's son by a later marriage , Baldwin II , Count of Flanders . One of Æthelstan 's half @-@ sisters , Eadgifu , married Charles the Simple , king of the West Franks , in the late <unk> . He was deposed in 922 , and Eadgifu sent their son , Louis to safety in England . By Æthelstan 's time the connection was well established , and his coronation was performed with the Carolingian ceremony of anointment , probably to draw a deliberate parallel between his rule and Carolingian tradition . His " crowned bust " coinage of 933 – 938 was the first Anglo @-@ Saxon coinage to show the king crowned , following Carolingian iconography . 
 Like his father , Æthelstan was unwilling to marry his female relatives to his own subjects , so his sisters either entered nunneries or married foreign husbands . This was one reason for his close relations with European courts , and he married several of his half @-@ sisters to European nobles in what historian Sheila Sharp called " a flurry of dynastic bridal activity unequalled again until Queen Victoria 's time " . Another reason lay in the common interest on both sides of the Channel in resisting the threat from the Vikings , while the rise in the power and reputation of the royal house of Wessex made marriage with an English princess more prestigious to European rulers . In 926 Hugh , Duke of the Franks , sent Æthelstan 's cousin , Adelolf , Count of Boulogne , on an embassy to ask for the hand of one of Æthelstan 's sisters . According to William of Malmesbury , the gifts Adelolf brought included spices , jewels , many swift horses , a crown of solid gold , the sword of Constantine the Great , Charlemagne 's lance , and a piece of the Crown of Thorns . Æthelstan sent his half @-@ sister <unk> to be Hugh 's wife . 
 Æthelstan 's most important European alliance was with the new <unk> dynasty in East Francia . The Carolingian dynasty of East Francia had died out in the early tenth century , and its new <unk> king , Henry the Fowler , was seen by many as an arriviste . He needed a royal marriage for his son to establish his legitimacy , but no suitable Carolingian princesses were available . The ancient royal line of the West Saxons provided an acceptable alternative , especially as they ( wrongly ) claimed descent from the seventh @-@ century king and saint , Oswald , who was venerated in Germany . In 929 or 930 Henry sent ambassadors to Æthelstan 's court seeking a wife for his son , Otto , who later became Holy Roman Emperor . Æthelstan sent two of his half @-@ sisters , and Otto chose Eadgyth . Fifty years later , Æthelweard , a descendant of Alfred the Great 's older brother , addressed his Latin version of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle to Mathilde , Abbess of Essen , who was Eadgyth 's granddaughter , and had apparently requested it . The other sister , whose name is uncertain , was married to a prince from near the Alps who has not definitely been identified . 
 In early medieval Europe , it was common for kings to act as foster @-@ fathers for the sons of other kings . Æthelstan was known for the support he gave to dispossessed young royalty . In 936 he sent an English fleet to help his foster @-@ son , Alan II , Duke of Brittany , to regain his ancestral lands , which had been conquered by the Vikings . In the same year he assisted the son of his half @-@ sister Eadgifu , Louis , to take the throne of West Francia , and in 939 he sent another fleet that unsuccessfully attempted to help Louis in a struggle with rebellious magnates . According to later Scandinavian sources , he helped another possible foster @-@ son , Hakon , son of Harald Fairhair , king of Norway , to reclaim his throne , and he was known among Norwegians as " Æthelstan the Good " . 
 Æthelstan 's court was perhaps the most cosmopolitan of the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . The close contacts between the English and European courts ended soon after his death , but descent from the English royal house long remained a source of prestige for continental ruling families . According to Frank Stenton in his history of the period , Anglo @-@ Saxon England , " Between Offa and Cnut there is no English king who played so prominent or so sustained a part in the general affairs of Europe . " 
 = = Death = = 
 Æthelstan died at Gloucester on 27 October 939 . His grandfather Alfred , his father Edward , and his half @-@ brother Ælfweard had been buried at Winchester , but Æthelstan chose not to honour the city associated with opposition to his rule . By his own wish he was buried at Malmesbury Abbey , where he had buried his cousins who died at Brunanburh . No other member of the West Saxon royal family was buried there , and according to William of Malmesbury , Æthelstan 's choice reflected his devotion to the abbey and to the memory of its seventh @-@ century abbot , Saint Aldhelm . William described Æthelstan as fair @-@ haired " as I have seen for myself in his remains , beautifully intertwined with gold threads " . His bones were lost during the Reformation , but he is commemorated by an empty fifteenth @-@ century tomb . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After Æthelstan 's death , the men of York immediately chose the Viking king of Dublin , Olaf Guthfrithson ( or his cousin , Anlaf Cuaran ) , as their king , and Anglo @-@ Saxon control of the north , seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh , collapsed . The reigns of Æthelstan 's half @-@ brothers Edmund ( 939 – 946 ) and Eadred ( 946 – 955 ) were largely devoted to regaining control . Olaf seized the east midlands , leading to the establishment of a frontier at Watling Street . In 941 Olaf died , and Edmund took back control of the east midlands , and then York in 944 . Following Edmund 's death York again switched back to Viking control , and it was only when the Northumbrians finally drove out their Norwegian Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and submitted to Eadred that Anglo @-@ Saxon control of the whole of England was finally restored . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The reign of Æthelstan has been overshadowed by the achievements of his grandfather , Alfred the Great , but he is now considered one of the greatest kings of the West Saxon dynasty . Modern historians endorse the view of twelfth century chronicler William of Malmesbury that " no one more just or more learned ever governed the kingdom " . Frank Stenton and Simon Keynes both describe him as the one Anglo @-@ Saxon king who will bear comparison with Alfred . In Keynes 's view he " has long been regarded , with good reason , as a towering figure in the landscape of the tenth century ... he has also been hailed as the first king of England , as a statesman of international standing " . David Dumville describes Æthelstan as " the father of mediaeval and modern England " , while Michael Wood regards Offa , Alfred , and Æthelstan as the three greatest Anglo @-@ Saxon kings , and Æthelstan as " one of the more important lay intellectuals in Anglo @-@ Saxon history " . 
 Æthelstan is regarded as the first King of England by modern historians . Although it was Eadred who would achieve the final unification of England by the permanent conquest of Viking York , Æthelstan 's campaigns made this success possible . His nephew Edgar called himself King of the English and revived the claim to rule over all the peoples of Britain . Simon Keynes argued that " the consistent usages of Edgar 's reign represent nothing less than a determined reaffirmation of the polity created by Æthelstan in the 930s " . Historian Charles <unk> , however , sees Æthelstan 's hegemony as fragile : " The level of overlordship wielded by Æthelstan during the 930s over the rest of Britain was perhaps not attained again by an English king until Edward I. " George Molyneaux argues that : 
 The tendency of some modern historians to celebrate Æthelstan as " the first king of England " is , however , problematic , since there is little sign that that in his day the title rex Anglorum was closely or consistently tied to an area similar to that which we consider England . Indeed , when Æthelstan 's rule was associated with any definite geographical expanse , the territory in question was usually the whole island of Britain . 
 Simon Keynes saw Æthelstan 's law @-@ making as his greatest achievement . His reign predates the sophisticated state of the later Anglo @-@ Saxon period , but his creation of the most centralised government England had yet seen , with the king and his council working strategically to ensure acceptance of his authority and laws , laid the foundations on which his brothers and nephews would create one of the wealthiest and most advanced systems of government in Europe . Æthelstan 's reign built upon his grandfather 's ecclesiastical programme , consolidating the local ecclesiastical revival and laying the foundation for the monastic reform movement later in the century . 
 Æthelstan 's reputation was at its height when he died . According to Sarah Foot , " He found acclaim in his own day not only as a successful military leader and effective monarch but also as a man of devotion , committed to the promotion of religion and the patronage of learning . " Later in the century , Æthelweard praised him as a very mighty king worthy of honour , and Æthelred the Unready , who named his eight sons after his predecessors , put Æthelstan first as the name of his eldest son . Memory of Æthelstan then declined until it was revived by William of Malmesbury , who took a special interest in him as the one king who had chosen to be buried in his own house . William 's account kept his memory alive , and he was praised by other medieval chroniclers . In the early sixteenth century William Tyndale justified his English translation of the Bible by stating that he had read that King Æthelstan had caused the Holy Scriptures to be translated into Anglo @-@ Saxon . 
 From the sixteenth century onwards Alfred 's reputation became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness . Sharon Turner 's History of the Anglo @-@ Saxons , first published between 1799 and 1805 , played a crucial role in promoting Anglo @-@ Saxon studies , and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history , but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred . Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child 's History of England , and although Anglo @-@ Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth @-@ century artists , and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904 , there was not one picture of Æthelstan . 
 According to Michael Wood : " Among all the great rulers of British history , Æthelstan today is the forgotten man " , and in medieval historian Ann Williams 's view : " If Æthelstan has not had the reputation which accrued to his grandfather , the fault lies in the surviving sources ; Æthelstan had no biographer , and the Chronicle for his reign is scanty . In his own day he was ' the roof @-@ tree of the honour of the western world ' " . 
 = Japanese cruiser Ibuki ( 1943 ) = 
 The Japanese cruiser Ibuki ( <unk> ) was a heavy cruiser built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War II . The lead ship of her class , she was converted into a light aircraft carrier before completion . The conversion was delayed and finally stopped in March 1945 in order to concentrate on building small submarines . Ibuki was scrapped in the Sasebo Naval Arsenal beginning in 1946 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 As originally designed the ship had a length of 200 @.@ 6 meters ( 658 ft 2 in ) overall , a beam of 20 @.@ 2 meters ( 66 ft 3 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 04 meters ( 19 ft 10 in ) . Ibuki displaced 12 @,@ 220 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 030 long tons ) at standard load and 14 @,@ 828 metric tons ( 14 @,@ 594 long tons ) at ( full load ) . 
 She was fitted with four Kampon geared steam turbine sets with a total of 152 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 113 @,@ 000 kW ) , each driving a 3 @.@ 9 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) propeller . Steam was provided by eight Kampon Ro Gō @-@ type three @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers intended to give the ship a maximum speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . Ibuki carried 2 @,@ 163 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 129 long tons ) of fuel oil which gave her an estimated range of 6 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 700 km ; 7 @,@ 200 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament of the Ibuki class was intended to be ten 50 @-@ caliber 20 cm 3rd Year Type No. 2 guns mounted in twin turrets , three forward and two aft of the superstructure . The first two forward turrets were on the same level , but the third turret could <unk> over the first two . The guns could depress to − 5 ° and had a maximum elevation of + 55 ° and a maximum range of 29 @,@ 400 yd ( 26 @,@ 900 m ) . The secondary armament was to consist of eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm Type 89 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in twin mounts . They had a maximum range of 14 @,@ 800 meters ( 16 @,@ 200 yd ) , and a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 400 meters ( 30 @,@ 800 ft ) . The ships were also intended to be equipped with four twin 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns abreast the funnel . They had a maximum range of 7 @,@ 500 meters ( 8 @,@ 202 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 meters ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . Two twin 13 @.@ 2 mm Type 93 machine gun mounts were supposed to be mounted on the bridge with 2 @,@ 000 rounds per gun . 
 The Ibuki @-@ class ships were intended to be armed with four rotating quadruple 61 cm ( 24 in ) Type 92 torpedo tube mounts , two on each broadside . The ship carried 24 Type 93 torpedoes , commonly referred to in post @-@ war literature as the " Long Lance " , 16 in the tubes and eight in reserve . Quick @-@ reloading gear was installed for every mount that allowed the reserve torpedoes to be loaded in three to five minutes in ideal conditions . 
 Early warning would have been provided by a Type 2 , Mark 2 , Model 1 air search radar mounted at the top of the foremast . A Type 93 passive hydrophone system would have been fitted in the bow . The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast . These would have consisted of one three @-@ seat Aichi E13A and two two @-@ seat Yokosuka <unk> floatplanes . They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults , one on each side of the aircraft platform . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The ship 's waterline armoured belt ran all the way down to the double bottom . It extended from the forward to the rear magazines below the fore and aft turrets . Over the machinery spaces , it was 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick and 140 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) thick on the sides of the magazines . The outer ends of the fore and aft machinery compartments was protected by a 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) transverse bulkhead . The magazines were protected by fore and aft transverse bulkheads 95 – 140 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) thick . 
 The thickness of the armored deck ranged from 35 – 40 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) on the flat and 60 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) on the slope . The sides of the conning tower were 100 millimeters thick while its roof was 50 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The main gun turrets had 25 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) of armor on all sides and on the roof . The barbette armor ranged from 25 to 100 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 9 in ) in thickness . 
 = = = Conversion = = = 
 Ibuki 's two aft turbine sets , the four aft boilers and the two innermost propeller shafts were removed with their propellers ; the exhaust uptakes for the remaining boilers were trunked together into a downward @-@ curving funnel on the starboard side of the hull . The space made available was used for avgas tanks ( 133 metric tons ( 131 long tons ) in capacity ) , additional fuel oil tanks , as well as bomb and torpedo magazines that had a capacity of 24 bombs and two torpedoes . The ship now could carry 3 @,@ 060 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 010 long tons ) of oil , enough for 7 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 900 km ; 8 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The reduced power meant that Ibuki 's top speed was only 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) . 
 As part of the conversion , the existing superstructure was razed , a new hangar deck was built above the existing upper deck and a full @-@ length 205 @-@ meter ( 672 ft 7 in ) flight deck was added . It had a maximum width of 23 meters ( 75 ft 6 in ) , two 13 @-@ by @-@ 11 @.@ 6 @-@ meter ( 42 @.@ 7 by 38 @.@ 1 ft ) aircraft elevators that serviced the single hangar and a small starboard island structure . The ship was bulged to improve her stability , which increased her beam to a maximum of 21 @.@ 2 meters ( 69 ft 7 in ) below the waterline . Ibuki 's trials displacement increased to 14 @,@ 800 metric tons ( 14 @,@ 600 long tons ) and the additional weight increased her draft to 6 @.@ 31 meters ( 20 ft 8 in ) . 
 Initially , the ship was to have a very light armament of only 22 triple 25 @-@ millimeter gun mounts , controlled by eight Type 95 fire @-@ control directors , but this was modified in 1944 to substitute four 60 @-@ caliber 8 cm Type 98 dual @-@ purpose guns , mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , and four 28 @-@ tube launchers for 12 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) anti @-@ aircraft rockets for six of the triple 25 @-@ millimeter gun mounts and two directors ( now Type 4s ) . This gave the ship a total of forty @-@ eight 25 mm guns in 16 triple mounts . The Type 98 gun fired a 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) , 5 @.@ 99 @-@ kilogram ( 13 @.@ 2 lb ) projectile . It had a muzzle velocity of 900 – 920 m / s ( 3 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) that gave it a maximum range of 13 @,@ 600 meters ( 14 @,@ 900 yd ) , and a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 100 meters ( 29 @,@ 900 ft ) . The entire turret weighed 12 @,@ 500 kilograms ( 27 @,@ 600 lb ) and the guns could fire at a rate of 25 rounds per minute . 
 At the top of the island , Ibuki was planned to have a 2 @-@ meter ( 6 ft 7 in ) rangefinder and a Type 21 radar . In 1944 , the Type 21 radar was moved to a retractable mount in the flight deck near the bow and a Type 22 surface search and a Type 13 air @-@ search radar were going to be installed on the island . The ship retained the Type 93 hydrophone system . 
 The ship 's air group was designed to consist of 27 aircraft , 15 Mitsubishi A7M <unk> ( Allied codename : " Sam " ) fighters and a dozen Aichi <unk> <unk> ( " Grace " ) dive / torpedo bombers . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Ibuki was ordered under the 1941 Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme , and she was laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal , Kure , on 24 April 1942 ; however , her construction was suspended on 30 June . Construction resumed a month later to allow the ship to be launched and clear her slipway for carrier construction . She was named after Mount Ibuki on 5 April 1943 as per the IJN 's naming convention for first @-@ class cruisers . The ship was launched on 21 May and construction was suspended in July while the IJN decided what to do with her . The navy considered completing Ibuki as a high @-@ speed replenishment oiler , but decided to convert her into a light aircraft carrier on 25 August . While plans were prepared for the conversion , she was towed to the Sasebo Naval Arsenal , Sasebo , by the submarine tender <unk> 19 – 21 December . 
 Completion of the ship was originally scheduled for March 1945 , but it was rescheduled for August because of delays . Work continued until 16 March 1945 , but it was ordered to halt when she was 80 % complete to concentrate on the construction of small submarines needed to defend Japan against an American invasion . She was anchored in Ebisu Bay , near Sasebo , and surrendered there on 2 September along with the rest of the Japanese military . Ibuki was scrapped in Sasebo Naval Arsenal Drydock No. 7 , 22 November 1946 – 1 August 1947 . 
 = Anne , Queen of Great Britain = 
 Anne ( 6 February 1665 – 1 August 1714 ) became Queen of England , Scotland and Ireland on 8 March 1702 . On 1 May 1707 , under the Acts of Union , two of her realms , the kingdoms of England and Scotland , united as a single sovereign state known as Great Britain . She continued to reign as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death . 
 Anne was born in the reign of her uncle Charles II , who had no legitimate children . Her father , James , was first in line to the throne . His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England , and on Charles 's instructions Anne was raised as an Anglican . Three years after he succeeded Charles , James was deposed in the " Glorious Revolution " of 1688 . Anne 's Dutch Protestant brother @-@ in @-@ law and cousin William III became joint monarch with his wife , Anne 's elder sister Mary II . Although the sisters had been close , disagreements over Anne 's finances , status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary 's accession and they became estranged . William and Mary had no children . After Mary 's death in 1694 , William continued as sole monarch until he was succeeded by Anne upon his death in 1702 . 
 As queen , Anne favoured moderate Tory politicians , who were more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents , the Whigs . The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the War of the Spanish Succession , until in 1710 Anne dismissed many of them from office . Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill , Duchess of Marlborough , turned sour as the result of political differences . 
 Anne was plagued by ill health throughout her life . From her thirties onwards , she grew increasingly lame and obese . Despite seventeen pregnancies by her husband , Prince George of Denmark , she died without any surviving children and was the last monarch of the House of Stuart . Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 , she was succeeded by her second cousin George I of the House of Hanover , who was a descendant of the Stuarts through his maternal grandmother , Elizabeth , a daughter of James VI and I. 
 = = Early life = = 
 Anne was born at 11 : 39 p.m. on 6 February 1665 at St James 's Palace , London , the fourth child and second daughter of James , Duke of York ( afterwards James II and VII ) , and his first wife , Anne Hyde . Her father was the younger brother of King Charles II , who ruled the three kingdoms of England , Scotland and Ireland , and her mother was the daughter of Lord Chancellor Edward Hyde , 1st Earl of Clarendon . At her Anglican baptism in the Chapel Royal at St James 's , her older sister , Mary , was one of her godparents , along with the Duchess of Monmouth and the Archbishop of Canterbury , Gilbert Sheldon . The Duke and Duchess of York had eight children , but Anne and Mary were the only ones to survive into adulthood . 
 As a child , Anne suffered from an eye condition , which manifested as excessive watering known as " <unk> " . For medical treatment , she was sent to France , where she lived with her paternal grandmother , Queen Henrietta Maria , at the Château de Colombes near Paris . Following her grandmother 's death in 1669 , Anne lived with an aunt , Henrietta Anne , Duchess of Orléans . On the sudden death of her aunt in 1670 , Anne returned to England . Her mother died the following year . 
 As was traditional in the royal family , Anne and her sister were brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at Richmond , London . On the instructions of Charles II , they were raised as Protestants . Placed in the care of Colonel Edward and Lady Frances Villiers , their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church . Henry Compton , Bishop of London , was appointed as Anne 's preceptor . 
 Around 1671 , Anne first made the acquaintance of Sarah Jennings , who later became her close friend and one of her most influential advisors . Jennings married John Churchill ( the future Duke of Marlborough ) in about 1678 . His sister , Arabella Churchill , was the Duke of York 's mistress , and he was to be Anne 's most important general . 
 In 1673 , the Duke of York 's conversion to Roman Catholicism became public , and he married a Catholic princess , Mary of Modena , who was only six and a half years older than Anne . Charles II had no legitimate children , and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession , followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage , Mary and Anne . Over the next ten years , the new Duchess of York had ten children , but all were either stillborn or died in infancy , leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father . There is every indication that , throughout Anne 's early life , she and her stepmother got on well together , and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 In November 1677 , Anne 's elder sister , Mary , married their Dutch first cousin , William of Orange , at St James 's Palace , but Anne could not attend the wedding because she was confined to her room with smallpox . By the time she recovered , Mary had already left for her new life in the Netherlands . Lady Frances Villiers contracted the disease , and died . Anne 's aunt Lady Henrietta Hyde ( the wife of Laurence Hyde ) was appointed as her new governess . A year later , Anne and her stepmother visited Mary in Holland for two weeks . 
 Anne 's father and stepmother retired to Brussels in March 1679 in the wake of anti @-@ Catholic hysteria fed by the Popish Plot , and Anne visited them from the end of August . In October , they returned to Britain , the Duke and Duchess to Scotland and Anne to England . She joined her father and stepmother at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh from July 1681 until May 1682 . It was her last journey outside England . 
 Anne 's second cousin George of Hanover ( her eventual successor ) visited London for three months from December 1680 , sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them . Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded , as her father was essentially exiled from court , and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle as part of a scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance . Other rumours claimed she was courted by Lord Mulgrave ( later made Duke of Buckingham ) , although he denied it . Nevertheless , as a result of the gossip , he was temporarily dismissed from court . 
 With George of Hanover out of contention as a potential suitor for Anne , King Charles looked elsewhere for an eligible prince who would be welcomed as a groom by his Protestant subjects but also acceptable to his Catholic ally , Louis XIV of France . The Danes were Protestant allies of the French , and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo @-@ Danish alliance to contain the power of the Dutch . A marriage treaty between Anne and Prince George of Denmark , younger brother of King Christian V , was negotiated by Anne 's uncle Laurence Hyde , who had been made Earl of Rochester , and the English Secretary of State for the Northern Department , Robert Spencer , 2nd Earl of Sunderland . Anne 's father consented to the marriage eagerly because it diminished the influence of his other son @-@ in @-@ law , William of Orange , who was naturally unhappy at the match . 
 Bishop Compton officiated at the wedding of Anne and George of Denmark on 28 July 1683 in the Chapel Royal . Though it was an arranged marriage , they were faithful and devoted partners . They were given a set of buildings in the Palace of Whitehall known as the Cockpit as their London residence , and Sarah Churchill was appointed one of Anne 's ladies of the bedchamber . Within months of the marriage , Anne was pregnant , but the baby was stillborn in May . Anne recovered at the spa town of Tunbridge Wells , and over the next two years , gave birth to two daughters in quick succession : Mary and Anne Sophia . 
 = = Accession of James II and VII = = 
 When Charles II died in 1685 , Anne 's father became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland . To the consternation of the English people , James began to give Catholics military and administrative offices , in contravention of the Test Acts that were designed to prevent such appointments . Anne shared the general concern , and continued to attend Anglican services . As her sister Mary lived in the Netherlands , Anne and her family were the only members of the royal family attending Protestant religious services in England . When her father tried to get Anne to baptise her youngest daughter into the Catholic faith , Anne burst into tears . " The Church of Rome is wicked and dangerous " , she wrote to her sister , " their ceremonies – most of them – plain downright idolatry . " Anne became estranged from her father and stepmother as James moved to weaken the Church of England 's power . 
 In early 1687 , within a matter of days , Anne miscarried , her husband caught smallpox , and their two young daughters died of the same infection . Lady Rachel Russell wrote that George and Anne had " taken [ the deaths ] very heavily ... Sometimes they wept , sometimes they mourned in words ; then sat silent , hand in hand ; he sick in bed , and she the <unk> nurse to him that can be imagined . " Later that year , she suffered another stillbirth . 
 Public alarm at James 's Catholicism increased when his wife , Mary of Modena , became pregnant for the first time since James 's accession . In letters to her sister Mary , Anne raised suspicions that the Queen was faking her pregnancy in an attempt to introduce a false heir . She wrote , " they will stick at nothing , be it never so wicked , if it will promote their interest ... there may be foul play intended . " Anne suffered another miscarriage in April 1688 , and left London to recuperate in the spa town of Bath . 
 Anne 's stepmother gave birth to a son , James Francis Edward , on 10 June 1688 , and a Catholic succession became more likely . Anne was still at Bath , so she did not witness the birth , which fed the belief that the child was spurious . Anne may have left the capital deliberately to avoid being present , or because she was genuinely ill , but it is also possible that James desired the exclusion of all Protestants , including his daughter , from affairs of state . " I shall never now be satisfied " , Anne wrote to her sister Mary , " whether the child be true or false . It may be it is our brother , but God only knows ... one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts , but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm to my religion and faithfully yours . " 
 To dispel rumours of a supposititious child , James had 40 witnesses to the birth attend a Privy Council meeting , but Anne claimed she could not attend because she was pregnant herself ( which she was not ) and then declined to read the depositions because it was " not necessary " . 
 = = " Glorious Revolution " = = 
 In what became known as the " Glorious Revolution " , William of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action that ultimately deposed King James . Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit in the spring of 1687 , Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade . On the advice of the Churchills , she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action . Churchill abandoned the unpopular king on the 24th . Prince George followed suit that night , and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James 's Palace . Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase , putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton . They spent one night in his house , and subsequently arrived at Nottingham on 1 December . Two weeks later and escorted by a large company , Anne arrived at Oxford , where she met Prince George in triumph . " God help me ! " , lamented James on discovering the desertion of his daughter on 26 November , " Even my children have forsaken me . " On 19 December , Anne returned to London , where she was at once visited by William . James fled to France on the 23rd . Anne showed no concern at the news of her father 's flight , and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards . She justified herself by saying that she " was used to play and never loved to do anything that looked like an affected constraint " . 
 In January 1689 , a Convention Parliament assembled in England and declared that James had effectively abdicated when he fled , and that the thrones of England and Ireland were therefore vacant . The Parliament or Estates of Scotland took similar action , and William and Mary were declared monarchs of all three realms . The Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 settled the succession . Anne and her descendants were to be in the line of succession after William and Mary , and they were to be followed by any descendants of William by a future marriage . On 24 July 1689 , Anne gave birth to a son , Prince William , Duke of Gloucester , who , though ill , survived infancy . As King William and Queen Mary had no children , it looked as though Anne 's son would eventually inherit the Crown . 
 = = William and Mary = = 
 Soon after their accession , William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by granting him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland . Anne requested the use of Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance . William and Mary refused the first , and unsuccessfully opposed the latter , both of which caused tension between the two sisters . Anne 's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity . The new king and queen feared that Anne 's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to set up a rival political faction . From around this time , at Anne 's request she and Sarah Churchill , Lady Marlborough , began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively , to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone . In January 1692 , suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James 's followers , the Jacobites , William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices . In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs , Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace , and refused her sister 's request to dismiss Sarah from her household . Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain , and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House , the home of the Duke of Somerset . Anne was stripped of her guard of honour ; courtiers were forbidden to visit her , and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her . In April , Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes . Mary visited her , but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah . The sisters never saw each other again . Later that year , Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly , London , where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693 . 
 When Mary died of smallpox in 1694 , William continued to reign alone . Anne became his heir apparent , since any children he might have by another wife were assigned to a lower place in the line of succession , and the two reconciled publicly . He restored her previous honours , allowed her to reside in St James 's Palace , and gave her Mary 's jewels , but excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad . Three months later , William restored Marlborough to his offices . With Anne 's restoration at court , Berkeley House became a social centre for courtiers who had previously avoided contact with Anne and her husband . 
 According to James , Anne wrote to him in 1696 requesting his permission to succeed William , and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James 's line at a convenient opportunity ; he declined to give his consent . She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James . 
 = = = Act of Settlement = = = 
 Anne 's final pregnancy ended on 25 January 1700 , when she miscarried a stillborn son . She had been pregnant at least seventeen times over as many years , and had miscarried or given birth to stillborn children at least twelve times . Of her five <unk> children , four died before reaching the age of two . Anne suffered from bouts of " gout " , pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head , from at least 1698 . Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms , she may have had disseminated lupus erythematosus , or Hughes syndrome . Alternatively , pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy . Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis , diabetes , intrauterine growth retardation , and rhesus incompatibility . Rhesus incompatibility , however , generally worsens with successive pregnancies , and so does not fit with the pattern of Anne 's pregnancies , as her only son to survive infancy , Prince William , Duke of Gloucester , was born after a series of stillbirths . Experts also rule out syphilis , porphyria and pelvic deformation as incompatible with her medical history . 
 Anne 's gout rendered her lame for much of her later life . Around the court , she was carried in a sedan chair , or used a wheelchair . Around her estates , she used a one @-@ horse chaise , which she drove herself " furiously like Jehu and a mighty hunter like Nimrod " . She gained weight as a result of her sedentary lifestyle ; in Sarah 's words , " she grew exceeding gross and corpulent . There was something of majesty in her look , but mixed with a gloominess of soul " . Sir John Clerk , 1st Baronet , described her in 1706 
 " under a fit of the gout and in extreme pain and agony , and on this occasion everything about her was much in the same disorder as about the meanest of her subjects . Her face , which was red and spotted , was rendered something frightful by her negligent dress , and the foot affected was tied up with a poultice and some nasty bandages . I was much affected by this sight ... " . 
 Anne 's sole surviving child , the Duke of Gloucester , died at the age of eleven on 30 July 1700 . She and her husband were " overwhelmed with grief " . Anne ordered her household to observe a day of mourning every year on the anniversary of his death . With William childless and Gloucester dead , Anne was the only individual remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689 . To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration , the Parliament of England enacted the Act of Settlement 1701 , which provided that , failing the issue of Anne and of William III by any future marriage , the Crown of England and Ireland would go to Sophia , Electress of Hanover , and her Protestant descendants . Sophia was the granddaughter of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth , who was the sister of Anne 's grandfather Charles I. Over fifty Catholic claimants more closely related to Anne were excluded from the line of succession . Anne 's father died in September 1701 . His widow , Anne 's stepmother , the former queen , wrote to Anne to inform her that her father forgave her and to remind her of her promise to seek the restoration of his line . Anne , however , had already acquiesced to the new line of succession created by the Act of Settlement .

 Anne became Queen upon the death of William III on 8 March 1702 , and was immediately popular . In her first speech to the English Parliament , on 11 March , she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother @-@ in @-@ law and said , " As I know my heart to be entirely English , I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready to do for the happiness and prosperity of England . " 
 Soon after her accession , Anne appointed her husband Lord High Admiral , giving him nominal control of the Royal Navy . Anne gave control of the army to Lord Marlborough , whom she appointed Captain @-@ General . Marlborough also received numerous honours from the Queen ; he was created a Knight of the Garter and was elevated to the rank of duke . The Duchess of Marlborough was appointed Groom of the Stole , Mistress of the Robes , and Keeper of the Privy Purse . 
 Anne was crowned on St George 's Day , 23 April 1702 . Afflicted with gout , she was carried to Westminster Abbey in an open sedan chair , with a low back to permit her train to flow out behind her . On 4 May , England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession , in which England , Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain . Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700 , and the succession was disputed by two claimants : the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and the Bourbon Philip , Duke of Anjou . 
 = = = Act of Union = = = 
 While Ireland was subordinate to the English Crown and Wales formed part of the kingdom of England , Scotland remained an independent sovereign state with its own parliament and laws . The Act of Settlement 1701 , passed by the English Parliament , applied in the kingdoms of England and Ireland but not Scotland , where a strong minority wished to preserve the Stuart dynasty and its right of inheritance to the throne . Anne had declared it " very necessary " to conclude a union of England and Scotland in her first speech to the English Parliament , and a joint Anglo @-@ Scots commission met at her former residence the Cockpit to discuss terms in October 1702 . The negotiations broke up in early February 1703 having failed to reach an agreement . The Estates of Scotland responded to the Act of Settlement by passing the Act of Security , which gave the Estates the power , if the Queen had no further children , to choose the next Scottish monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the royal line of Scotland . The individual chosen by the Estates could not be the same person who came to the English throne , unless England granted full freedom of trade to Scottish merchants . At first , Anne withheld royal assent to the act , but granted it the following year when the Estates threatened to withhold supply , endangering Scottish support for England 's wars . 
 In its turn , the English Parliament responded with the Alien Act 1705 , which threatened to impose economic sanctions and declare Scottish subjects aliens in England , unless Scotland either repealed the Act of Security or moved to unite with England . The Estates chose the latter option ; the English Parliament agreed to repeal the Alien Act , and new commissioners were appointed by Queen Anne in early 1706 to negotiate the terms of a union . The articles of union approved by the commissioners were presented to Anne on 23 July 1706 , and ratified by the Scottish and English Parliaments on 16 January and 6 March 1707 respectively . Under the Acts of Union , England and Scotland were united into a single kingdom called Great Britain , with one parliament , on 1 May 1707 . Anne , a consistent and ardent supporter of union despite opposition on both sides of the border , attended a thanksgiving service in St Paul 's Cathedral . The Scot Sir John Clerk , 1st Baronet , who also attended , wrote , " nobody on this occasion appeared more sincerely devout and thankful than the Queen herself " . 
 = = = Two @-@ party politics = = = 
 Anne 's reign was marked by the further development of a two @-@ party system . In general , the Tories were supportive of the Anglican church and favoured the " landed interest " of the country gentry , while the Whigs were aligned with commercial interests and Protestant Dissenters . As a committed Anglican , Anne was inclined to favour the Tories . Her first ministry was predominantly Tory , and contained such High Tories as Daniel Finch , 2nd Earl of Nottingham , and her uncle Laurence Hyde , 1st Earl of Rochester . It was headed by Lord Treasurer Lord Godolphin and Anne 's favourite the Duke of Marlborough , who were considered moderate Tories , along with the Speaker of the House of Commons , Robert Harley . 
 Anne supported the Occasional Conformity Bill of 1702 , which was promoted by the Tories and opposed by the Whigs . The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the Test Acts , legislation that restricted public office to Anglican conformists . The existing law permitted nonconformists to take office if they took Anglican communion once a year . Anne 's husband was placed in an unfortunate position when Anne forced him to vote for the bill , even though , being a Lutheran , he was an occasional conformist himself . The Whigs successfully blocked the bill for the duration of the parliamentary session . Anne reinstituted the traditional religious practice of touching for the king 's evil that had been eschewed by William as papist superstition . After the Great Storm of 1703 , Anne declared a general fast to implore God " to pardon the crying sins of this nation which had drawn down this sad judgement " . The Occasional Conformity Bill was revived in the wake of the storm , but Anne withheld support , fearing its reintroduction was a ruse to cause a political quarrel . Once again it failed . A third attempt to introduce the bill as an amendment to a money bill in November 1704 was also thwarted . 
 The Whigs vigorously supported the War of the Spanish Succession and became even more influential after the Duke of Marlborough won a great victory at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 . Many of the High Tories , who opposed British involvement in the land war against France , were removed from office . Godolphin , Marlborough , and Harley , who had replaced Nottingham as Secretary of State for the Northern Department , formed a ruling " triumvirate " . They were forced to rely more and more on support from the Whigs , and particularly from the Whig Junto — Lords Somers , Halifax , Orford , Wharton and Sunderland — whom Anne disliked . Sarah , the Duchess of Marlborough , incessantly badgered the Queen to appoint more Whigs and reduce the power of the Tories , whom she considered little better than Jacobites , and the Queen became increasingly discontented with her . 
 In 1706 , Godolphin and the Marlboroughs forced Anne to accept Lord Sunderland , a Junto Whig and the Marlboroughs ' son @-@ in @-@ law , as Harley 's colleague as Secretary of State for the Southern Department . Although this strengthened the ministry 's position in Parliament , it weakened the ministry 's position with the Queen , as Anne became increasingly irritated with Godolphin and with her former favourite , the Duchess of Marlborough , for supporting Sunderland and other Whig candidates for vacant government and church positions . The Queen turned for private advice to Harley , who was uncomfortable with Marlborough and Godolphin 's turn towards the Whigs . She also turned to Abigail Hill , a woman of the bedchamber whose influence grew as Anne 's relationship with Sarah deteriorated . Abigail was related to both Harley and the Duchess , but was politically closer to Harley , and acted as an intermediary between him and the Queen . 
 The division within the ministry came to a head on 8 February 1708 , when Godolphin and the Marlboroughs insisted that the Queen had to either dismiss Harley or do without their services . When the Queen seemed to hesitate , Marlborough and Godolphin refused to attend a cabinet meeting . Harley attempted to lead business without his former colleagues , and several of those present including the Duke of Somerset refused to participate until they returned . Her hand forced , the Queen dismissed Harley . 
 The following month , Anne 's Catholic half @-@ brother , James Francis Edward Stuart , attempted to land in Scotland with French assistance in an attempt to establish himself as king . Anne withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill 1708 in case the militia raised in Scotland was disloyal and sided with the Jacobites . She was the last British sovereign to veto a parliamentary bill , although her action was barely commented upon at the time . The invasion fleet never landed and was chased away by British ships commanded by Sir George Byng . As a result of the Jacobite invasion scare , support for the Tories fell and the Whigs were able to secure a majority in the British general election , 1708 . 
 The Duchess of Marlborough was angered when Abigail moved into rooms at Kensington Palace that Sarah considered her own , though she rarely if ever used them . In July 1708 , she came to court with a bawdy poem written by a Whig propagandist , probably Arthur <unk> , that implied a lesbian relationship between Anne and Abigail . The Duchess wrote to Anne telling her she had damaged her reputation by conceiving " a great passion for such a woman ... strange and unaccountable " . Sarah thought Abigail had risen above her station , writing " I never thought her education was such as to make her fit company for a great queen . Many people have liked the humour of their <unk> and have been very kind to them , but ' tis very uncommon to hold a private correspondence with them and put them upon the foot of a friend . " While some modern commentators have concluded Anne was a lesbian , most have rejected this analysis . In the opinion of Anne 's biographers , she considered Abigail nothing more than a trusted servant , and was a woman of strong traditional beliefs , who was devoted to her husband . 
 At a thanksgiving service for a victory at the Battle of Oudenarde , Anne did not wear the jewels that Sarah had selected for her . At the door of St Paul 's Cathedral , they had an argument that culminated in Sarah offending the Queen by telling her to be quiet . Anne was dismayed . When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne , with a covering note continuing the argument , Anne wrote back pointedly , " After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you , I should not have troubled you with these lines , but to return the Duke of Marlborough 's letter safe into your hands , and for the same reason do not say anything to that , nor to yours which enclosed it . " 
 = = = Death of her husband = = = 
 Anne was devastated by her husband 's death in October 1708 , and the event proved a turning point in her relationship with the Duchess of Marlborough . The Duchess arrived at Kensington Palace shortly before George died , and after his death insisted that Anne leave Kensington for St James 's Palace against her wishes . Anne resented the Duchess 's intrusive actions , which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen 's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural " to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead " . 
 The Whigs used George 's death to their own advantage . The leadership of the Admiralty was unpopular among the Whig leaders , who had blamed Prince George and his deputy George Churchill ( who was Marlborough 's brother ) for mismanagement of the navy . With Whigs now dominant in Parliament , and Anne distraught at the loss of her husband , they forced her to accept the Junto leaders Lords Somers and Wharton into the cabinet . Anne , however , insisted on carrying out the duties of Lord High Admiral herself , without appointing a member of the government to take George 's place . Undeterred , the Junto demanded the appointment of the Earl of Orford , another member of the Junto and one of Prince George 's leading critics , as First Lord of the Admiralty . Anne appointed the moderate Earl of Pembroke , on 29 November 1708 . Pressure mounted on Pembroke , Godolphin and the Queen from the dissatisfied Junto Whigs , and Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office . Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709 . 
 Sarah continued to berate Anne for her friendship with Abigail , and in October 1709 , Anne wrote to the Duke of Marlborough asking that his wife " leave off teasing & tormenting me & behave herself with the decency she ought both to her friend and Queen " . On Maundy Thursday 6 April 1710 , Anne and Sarah saw each other for the last time . According to Sarah , the Queen was taciturn and formal , repeating the same phrases — " Whatever you have to say you may put in writing " and " You said you desired no answer , and I shall give you none " — over and over . 
 = = = War of the Spanish Succession = = = 
 As the expensive War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular , so did the Whig administration . The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell , a High Church Tory Anglican who had preached anti @-@ Whig sermons , led to further public discontent . Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the " Glorious Revolution " , but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion . In London , riots broke out in support of Sacheverell , but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne 's guards , and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected . Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops . In line with Anne 's views , Sacheverell was convicted , but his sentence — suspension of preaching for three years — was so light as to render the trial a mockery . 
 The Queen , increasingly disdainful of the Marlboroughs and her ministry , finally took the opportunity to dismiss Sunderland in June 1710 . Godolphin followed in August . The Junto Whigs were removed from office , although Marlborough , for the moment , remained as commander of the army . In their place , she appointed a new ministry , headed by Harley , which began to seek peace with France . Unlike the Whigs , Harley and his ministry were ready to compromise by giving Spain to the Bourbon claimant , Philip of Anjou , in return for commercial concessions . In the parliamentary elections that soon followed his appointment , Harley , aided by government patronage , secured a large Tory majority . In January 1711 , Anne forced Sarah to resign her court offices , and Abigail took over as Keeper of the Privy Purse . Harley was stabbed by a disgruntled French refugee , the Marquis de Guiscard , in March , and Anne wept at the thought he would die . He recovered slowly . Godolphin 's death from natural causes in September 1712 reduced Anne to tears ; she blamed their estrangement on the Marlboroughs . 
 The elder brother of Archduke Charles , Emperor Joseph I , died in April 1711 and Charles succeeded him in Austria , Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire . To give him also the Spanish throne was no longer in Britain 's interests , but the proposed Peace of Utrecht submitted to Parliament for ratification did not go as far as the Whigs wanted to curb Bourbon ambitions . In the House of Commons , the Tory majority was unassailable , but the same was not true in the House of Lords . The Whigs secured the support of the Earl of Nottingham against the treaty by promising to support his Occasional Conformity bill . Seeing a need for decisive action to erase the anti @-@ peace majority in the House of Lords , and seeing no alternative , Anne reluctantly created twelve new peers . Abigail 's husband , Samuel Masham , was made a baron , although Anne protested to Harley that she " never had any design to make a great lady of [ Abigail ] , and should lose a useful servant " . Such a mass creation of peers was unprecedented . On the same day , Marlborough was dismissed as commander of the army . The peace treaty was ratified and Britain 's military involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession ended . 
 By signing the Treaty of Utrecht , King Louis XIV of France recognised the Hanoverian succession in Britain . Nevertheless , gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured the succession of her half @-@ brother rather than the Hanoverians continued , despite Anne 's denials in public and in private . The rumours were fed by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England , and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State Lord Bolingbroke , who were in separate and secret discussions with her half @-@ brother about a possible Stuart restoration until early 1714 . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Anne was unable to walk between January and July 1713 . At Christmas , she was feverish , and lay unconscious for hours , which led to rumours of her impending death . She recovered , but was seriously ill again in March . By July , Anne had lost confidence in Harley ; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet " that he neglected all business ; that he was seldom to be understood ; that when he did explain himself , she could not depend upon the truth of what he said ; that he never came to her at the time she appointed ; that he often came drunk ; [ and ] last , to crown all , he behaved himself towards her with ill manner , indecency and disrespect . " On 27 July 1714 , during Parliament 's summer recess , she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer . Despite failing health , which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state , she attended two late @-@ night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley 's successor . A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend . She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714 , the anniversary of Gloucester 's death , and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer 's staff of office to Whig <unk> Charles Talbot , 1st Duke of Shrewsbury . She died at around 7 : 30 a.m. on 1 August 1714 . John Arbuthnot , one of her doctors , thought her death was a release from a life of ill @-@ health and tragedy ; he wrote to Jonathan Swift , " I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her . " 
 Anne was buried beside her husband and children in the Henry VII chapel on the South Aisle of Westminster Abbey on 24 August . The Electress Sophia had died on 28 May , two months before Anne , so the Electress 's son , George , Elector of Hanover , inherited the British Crown pursuant to the Act of Settlement 1701 . The possible Catholic claimants , including Anne 's half @-@ brother , James Francis Edward Stuart , were ignored . The Elector 's accession was relatively stable : a Jacobite rising in 1715 failed . Marlborough was re @-@ instated , and the Tory ministers were replaced by Whigs . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Duchess of Marlborough " unduly disparaged " Anne in her memoirs , and her prejudiced recollections persuaded many biographers that Anne was " a weak , <unk> woman beset by bedchamber quarrels and deciding high policy on the basis of personalities " . The Duchess wrote of Anne : 
 She certainly meant well and was not a fool , but nobody can maintain that she was wise , nor entertaining in conversation . She was ignorant in everything but what the parsons had taught her when a child ... Being very ignorant , very fearful , with very little judgement , it is easy to be seen she might mean well , being surrounded with so many artful people , who at last compassed their designs to her dishonour . 
 In the opinion of historians , traditional assessments of Anne as fat , constantly pregnant , under the influence of favourites , and lacking political astuteness or interest may derive from male chauvinist prejudices against women . Author David Green noted , " Hers was not , as used to be supposed , petticoat government . She had considerable power ; yet time and time again she had to capitulate . " Professor Edward Gregg concluded that Anne was often able to impose her will , even though , as a woman in an age of male dominance and preoccupied by her health , her reign was marked by an increase in the influence of ministers and a decrease in the influence of the Crown . She attended more cabinet meetings than any of her predecessors or successors , and presided over an age of artistic , literary , economic and political advancement that was made possible by the stability and prosperity of her reign . In architecture , Sir John Vanbrugh constructed Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard . Writers such as Daniel Defoe , Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift flourished . Henry Wise laid out new gardens at Blenheim , Kensington , Windsor and St James 's . The union of England and Scotland , which Anne had fervently supported , created Europe 's largest free trade area . The political and diplomatic achievements of Anne 's governments , and the absence of constitutional conflict between monarch and parliament during her reign , indicate that she chose ministers and exercised her prerogatives wisely .

Imhotep 's priests are all mummified alive , while Imhotep himself is sentenced to suffer the Hom Dai , the worst of Egyptian curses , buried alive with flesh eating scarab beetles . Imhotep is sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance by the Medjai , since if Imhotep were ever to return , the world would be doomed . 
 In 1925 , Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn , a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist , an intricate box and map . After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra , Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer , Rick O 'Connell , who encountered the city while in the French Foreign Legion . Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison . 
 Rick leads Evelyn and her party to the city , where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters guided by Rick 's cowardly colleague Beni Gabor . Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra , the expeditions are then attacked by the Medjai , led by the warrior Ardeth Bay . Despite Ardeth 's warning of the city 's evil , the two expeditions continue to excavate . Evelyn searches for the famous Book of the Living , a book made of pure gold . Instead of finding the book , she , Rick , and Jonathan stumble upon the statue of Anubis and the remains of Imhotep buried underneath .

 At night , Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud , accidentally awakening Imhotep . The expeditions return to Cairo , but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni . Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one , and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt . Seeking a way to stop Imhotep , Rick , Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum . Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck @-@ su @-@ Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn .

 Brendan Fraser as Richard " Rick " O 'Connell 
 An American adventurer who served in the French Foreign Legion . Producer James Jacks offered the role of Rick O 'Connell to Tom Cruise , Brad Pitt , Matt Damon and Ben Affleck but the actors were not interested or could not fit the role into their respective schedules . Jacks and director Stephen Sommers were impressed with the money that George of the Jungle was making at the box office and cast Brendan Fraser as a result ; Sommers also commented that he felt Fraser fit the Errol Flynn swashbuckling character he had envisioned perfectly . The actor understood that his character " doesn 't take himself too seriously , otherwise the audience can 't go on that journey with him " . 
 Rachel Weisz as Evelyn " Evie " Carnahan 
 A clumsy yet intelligent Egyptologist . Evelyn undertakes the expedition to Hamunaptra to discover an ancient book , proving herself to her peers .

South African stage actor Vosloo understood the approach that Sommers was going for in his screenplay , but only agreed to take on the role of Imhotep " if I could do it absolutely straight . From Imhotep 's point of view , this is a skewed version of ' Romeo and Juliet ' . " 
 John Hannah as Jonathan Carnahan 
 Evelyn 's bumbling older brother , whose primary goal is to get rich ; he signs on for the trip to Hamunaptra after learning from Evelyn that the city is supposed to be where the ancient pharaohs hid " the wealth of Egypt .

 In 1992 , producers James Jacks and Sean Daniel decided to update the original Mummy film for the 1990s . Universal Studios gave them the go @-@ ahead , but only if they kept the budget around $ 10 million . Jacks remembers that the studio " essentially wanted a low @-@ budget horror franchise " ; in response , Jacks and Daniel recruited horror filmmaker / writer Clive Barker on board to direct . Barker 's vision for the film was violent , with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies . Jacks recalls that Barker 's take was " dark , sexual and filled with mysticism " , and that , " it would have been a great low @-@ budget movie " . After several meetings , Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company . 
 Filmmaker George A. Romero was brought in with a vision of a zombie @-@ style horror movie similar to Night of the Living Dead , but which also relied heavily upon elements of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity . Romero completed a draft in October 1994 , cowritten with Alan Ormsby and John Sayles , that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep , an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II . Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times , events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high @-@ tech forensic archaeology lab . The script then progresses to a fish @-@ out @-@ of @-@ water story when Imhotep , having regained his youthful appearance , recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from . Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities , Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis . Summoning mystical powers through incantation , Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis , a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master 's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum . After escaping into the city sewer system , Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb . Romero 's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio , who wanted a more accessible picture . Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM , and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers . 
 Joe Dante was the next choice , increasing the budget for his idea of Daniel Day @-@ Lewis as a brooding Mummy . This version ( co @-@ written by John Sayles ) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story . It came close to being made with some elements , like the flesh @-@ eating scarabs , making it to the final product . However , at that point , the studio wanted a film with a budget of $ 15 million and rejected Dante 's version . Soon after , Mick Garris was attached to direct but eventually left the project , and Wes Craven was offered the film but turned it down . Then , Stephen Sommers called Jacks and Daniel in 1997 with his vision of The Mummy " as a kind of Indiana Jones or Jason and the Argonauts with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time " . Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight , and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale . He had wanted to make a Mummy film since 1993 , but other writers or directors were always attached . Finally , Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18 @-@ page treatment . At the time , Universal 's management had changed in response to the box office failure of Babe : Pig in the City , and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s . Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $ 15 million to $ 80 million .

 Filming began in Marrakech , Morocco on May 4 , 1998 and lasted 17 weeks . Photography then moved to the Sahara desert outside the small town of Erfoud , and then to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on August 29 , 1998 . The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions . To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara , the production 's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours . <unk> were daily inconveniences . Snakes , spiders and scorpions were a major problem , with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten . 
 Brendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged . Weisz remembered , " He [ Fraser ] stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated . " The production had the official support of the Moroccan army , and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them , a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished . 
 Production Designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed . Sommers liked the location because , " A city hidden in the crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense . Out in the middle of the desert you would never see it . You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano . " A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios , where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot . These sets took 16 weeks to build , and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie 's final scenes . Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile . This set was 600 feet ( 183 m ) in length and featured " a steam train , an Ajax traction engine , three cranes , an open two @-@ horse carriage , four horse @-@ drawn carts , five dressing horses and grooms , nine pack donkeys and mules , as well as market stalls , Arab @-@ clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras " . 
 = = = Special effects = = = 
 The filmmakers reportedly spent $ 15 million of the $ 80 million budget on special effects , provided by Industrial Light & Magic ; the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies . John Andrew Berton , Jr . , Industrial Light & Magic 's Visual Effects Supervisor on The Mummy , started developing the look three months before filming started . He said that he wanted the Mummy " to be mean , tough , nasty , something that had never been seen by audiences before " . Berton used motion capture in order to achieve " a menacing and very realistic Mummy " . Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it . 
 To create the Mummy , Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics . Then , he matched the digital prosthetic make @-@ up pieces on Vosloo 's face during filming . Berton said , " When you see his film image , that 's him . When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth , that 's really his face . And that 's why it was so hard to do . " Vosloo described the filming as a " whole new thing " for him ; " They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects . A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree . " Make @-@ Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film , including three @-@ dimensional make @-@ up and prosthetics . He also designed all of the animatronic effects . While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery , many scenes , including ones where Rachel Weisz 's character is covered with rats and locusts , were real , using live animals . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The Mummy : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith , with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage . The soundtrack was released by Decca Records on May 4 , 1999 . Like many Goldsmith scores , the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements ; Goldsmith also used sparing amounts of vocals , highly unusual for most of his work . 
 Overall , Goldsmith 's score was well received . AllMusic described it as a " grand , melodramatic score " which delivered the expected highlights . Other reviews positively noted the dark , percussive sound meshed well with the plot , as well as the raw power of the music . The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded , and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall . On the other hand , some critics found the score lacked cohesion , and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition . Roderick Scott off <unk> summed up the score as " representative of both Goldsmith 's absolute best and his most mediocre . Thankfully [ ... ] his favourable work on this release wins out . "

 The Mummy received mixed reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 55 % rating , based on 83 reviews , with an average rating of 5 @.@ 7 / 10 .

" On Metacritic the film has a score of 48 out of 100 , based on 34 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Roger Ebert , of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , gave the film 3 out of 4 stars , writing " There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor , except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it . I cannot argue for the script , the direction , the acting or even the mummy , but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased . " Likewise , Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a " B − " grade and said , " The Mummy would like to make you shudder , but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality . " Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects . 
 Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote , " This version of The Mummy has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen . Think Raiders of the Lost Ark with cartoon characters , no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects .

" Publications like The Austin Chronicle and Dallas Observer came to the conclusion that despite good acting and special effects , the movie lacked cohesion ; talking about the special effects , the Observer lamented " If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy . " Other publications such as Jump Cut felt that Industrial Light and Magic 's lock on special effects proved detrimental to The Mummy ; " The mummy " , Ernest Larson wrote for the Jump Cut , " is standard @-@ issue <unk> & M.

Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original , as all the time was spent on special effects , instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic . USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was " not free of stereotypes " , a sentiment with which the BFI concurred . " If someone complains of a foul odor , you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene . Fraser , equally quick with weapon , fist or quip , may save the day , but even he can 't save the picture " , USA Today wrote .

 The Mummy 's box office performance led to numerous sequels and spinoffs . In 2001 , the sequel The Mummy Returns was released ; the film features most of the surviving principal characters , as a married Rick and Evelyn confront Imhotep and the Scorpion King . The film also introduced the heroes ' son , Alex . The two films inspired both an animated series which lasted two seasons , and a spin @-@ off prequel , The Scorpion King ( 2002 ) , telling the story of the Akkadian warrior as he was crowned king . 
 A second sequel , called The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor , was released on August 1 , 2008 . The story takes place in China with the Terracotta Emperor inspiring the villain , while Rachel Weisz was replaced with Maria Bello . A prequel to The Scorpion King , The Scorpion King 2 : Rise of a Warrior , was released direct @-@ to @-@ DVD . Both films were poorly received by critics . 
 Two video game adaptations of The Mummy were published by Konami and Universal Interactive in 2000 : an Action Adventure for the PlayStation and PC developed by Rebellion Developments , as well as a Game Boy Color puzzle game developed by Konami Nagoya . The film also inspired a roller coaster , Revenge of the Mummy in three Universal Studios Theme Parks : Hollywood , California ; Orlando , Florida ; and Sentosa , Singapore . On April 4 , 2012 , Universal announced their plans to reboot the franchise .

 Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ; Polish : <unk> w <unk> <unk> ; Russian : <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ; Turkish : <unk> <unk> ) is a former Ruthenian @-@ Lithuanian castle and a later three @-@ part Polish fortress located in the historic city of Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi , Ukraine , in the historic region of Podolia in the western part of the country . Its name is attributed to the root word <unk> ' , from the Slavic word for stone . 
 Historical accounts date Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle to the early 14th century , although recent archaeological evidence has proved human existence in the area back to the 12th or 13th century . Initially built to protect the bridge connecting the city with the mainland , the castle sits on top of a peninsula carved out by the winding Smotrych River , forming a natural defense system for Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi 's historic Old Town neighborhood . 
 Its location on a strategic transport crossroad in Podolia made the castle a prime target for foreign invaders , who rebuilt the castle to suit their own needs , adding to its multicultural architectural diversity . Specifically , the complex consists of the Old Town fortified by King Casimir IV , the Old Castle rebuilt by Kings Sigismund I and Stephen Báthory , and the New Castle founded by Kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV . However , in spite of the many architectural and engineering changes to the original structure , the castle still forms a coherent architectural design , being one of the few medieval constructions in Ukraine that is relatively well preserved . 
 Along with the Old Town neighborhood , the castle is listed as part of the National Historical @-@ Architectural Sanctuary " Kam <unk> " and the National Environmental Park " <unk> <unk> " . The complex is a candidate UNESCO World Heritage Site , nominated in 1989 by the Ukrainian representatives , and also one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine . Today , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle is the most recognized landmark of the city , serving as an important regional and national tourist attraction .

 Traditionally , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle was thought to have been founded during the second half of the 14th century , as the first accurate historical accounts of the castle date back to the mid @-@ 14th century , when most of the territories of western Rus ' were under control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . A written document by Prince Yuriy <unk> in 1374 , for example , mentions that the Magdeburg rights would be presented to Kamianets inside the castle . Archaeological excavations during the 1960s , however , provided contrasting evidence suggesting that the castle might date back even earlier to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th centuries . It is also clear from historical and archaeological evidence that an earthen fortress existed in the area during the time of the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus ' , but not on the same site as the current castle . 
 The castle was outdated but remained vital to the defense of Kamianets and nearby trade routes ; as a result , the voivode of Kraków , <unk> of <unk> , began modernizing the complex at the turn of the 15th century . During the reconstruction , the old towers were renovated and ten new towers were added . A century and a half later , the castle was updated again , this time by military engineer and architect Hiob <unk> , who built the New Western and Eastern Towers , the castle 's eastern wall and an underground gallery , as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town 's starosta community . 
 = = = Continuous attacks by invaders = = = 
 During the mid @-@ 14th to mid @-@ 15th centuries , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle was located on one of the main frontiers of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth . From 1434 until its annexation by the Russian Empire in 1793 , the castle played a major role in the defense against the oncoming Cossack , Ottoman and Tatar invasions ; from the 15th through 17th centuries , the castle was attacked by Tatar hordes a total of 51 times . The Tatar invasions of 1448 , 1451 , 1509 and 1528 , as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533 , caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions were successfully repelled . 
 Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle played an important role during the Khmelnytsky Uprising between 1648 – 54 , when the Zaporozhian Cossacks led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky , allied themselves with the Crimean Tatars and the local Ukrainian peasantry against the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth 's army and militia . During the uprising , the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by local Cossacks and insurgents led by Commander Maksym <unk> . In 1651 , the castle was then subject to another Cossack siege led by Hetman Ivan Bohun , before an unexpected counterattack by Polish insurgents under commanders <unk> and <unk> re @-@ established the Polish presence in the area and relieved the siege . A 60 @,@ 000 force army led by Khmelnytsky himself reasserted Cossack control over the castle in 1652 . Just one year later , the castle was attacked yet again , this time by a 40 @,@ 000 strong Crimean Tatar horde . 
 In the beginning of August 1672 , a 300 @,@ 000 Ottoman force led by Sultan Mehmed IV and a 40 @,@ 000 combined force of Tatars and Cossacks led by Hetman Petro Doroshenko laid siege to the castle . After conducting negotiations with their attackers , the city 's leaders surrendered control of the fortress to the Ottomans on August 18 . In a sign of protest , the fortress 's Commandant Michał Wołodyjowski and Major <unk> blew up the castle 's remaining gunpowder , killing themselves along with 800 defenders . For 27 years after the attack , the fortress served as the base of Ottoman rule in Podolia . The 1699 <unk> Peace Treaty saw the return of Polish control over the area after the Ottoman Empire ceded its control in the area . 
 = = = From a castle to a prison = = = 
 From the beginning of the 18th century , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle had lost its defensive role , and was used more as a military prison than a military fortification . Numerous people were executed or held captive in the prison , including Cossack <unk> ( officers ) , <unk> , and even the three @-@ year @-@ old pretender to the Polish throne , Stanisław August Poniatowski . 
 Even though it had lost its defensive role , it was one of the strongest fortresses in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland up until the Second Partition of Poland of April 21 , 1793 @.@ when both Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle and the city were transferred to the sovereignty of the Russian Empire . On the same day , the castle 's commandant gave up the key to the castle and swore allegiance to the empire in the city 's cathedral . One hundred and one artillery cannons later saluted the commandant 's decision inside the castle . During the French invasion of Russia of 1812 , the Russian Imperial Army was stationed in the castle . In 1815 , Konstantin <unk> , who later became a well @-@ known poet and writer , was stationed as an officer in the castle . In 1846 , poet Vladimir Raevsky was stationed in the castle , during which time he established a pro @-@ Decembrist organization of progressively @-@ minded army officers . 
 From 1816 until 1914 , the fortress was converted from a military prison into a jail for debtors , criminals and political prisoners . In 1831 , Russian <unk> Vladimir Dal worked in the castle , at the time writing a dictionary of the Russian language . The castle was the center of the anti @-@ feudalism movement in the Podolia during the 19th century led by the Patriotic War of 1812 cavalry veteran <unk> Karmaliuk ( 1787 @-@ 1835 ) , who is now regarded by Ukrainians as a national folk hero . 
 = = = Museum and conservation = = = 
 After a series of political changes following the 1905 revolution , political parties and organizations were allowed by the law throughout the Russian Empire . In 1906 , a total of 67 political organizations were based in the castle . Among them was the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party 's newspaper " Iskra " ( Spark ) . A decree issued by the Sovnarkom of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1928 declared Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle complex a historical @-@ cultural preserve . During the late 1930s , plans were made to turn the castle into a museum , and reconstruction work on the buildings was started in 1937 . Among the museum attractions added was a scene depicting Karmaliuk in the castle 's prison cell in the Pope 's Tower , where he was kept during his imprisonment in the castle . Visitor numbers for the castle during the 1930s reached 300 @,@ 000 a year . 
 In 1947 , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle was placed on the all @-@ Union list of historic preserves . A memorial plaque and a bas @-@ relief resembling Karmaliuk was erected near the Karmaliuk exposition on April 18 , 1958 . <unk> and archaeological works have been conducted in the castle since 1962 under the supervision of architects Y. <unk> and A. <unk> . On May 18 , 1977 , the National Historic @-@ Architectural Reserve " Kamianets " was established . On September 13 , 1989 , the Ukrainian SSR Government placed " Kamianets " reserve on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites . 
 In 2004 , the " Kamianets " reserve was upgraded to that of a national preservation district . In August 21 , 2007 , the complex was declared one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine when it came in 3rd place in a nationwide competition . A severe storm on August 1 , 2011 partially destroyed the New Western Tower ; the city mayor 's office didn 't deny that the tower 's structural integrity was weakened during its last reconstruction in 2007 , paving the way for its collapse just four years later .

 Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle rests on a limestone formation surrounded by the Smotrych River canyon . Consequently , its foundations were built using limestone , as well as local and imported brick and stone . Indeed , the castle 's name is attributed to the root <unk> ' , from the Slavic word for stone . The two main parts of the castle , the Old Castle ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> ) and the New Castle ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> ) , were built during different periods . The Old Castle defended the approach from Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi 's Old Town , and was constructed to protect against direct assaults from enemy soldiers . The New Castle was formed during the numerous later modernizations of the castle ; its purpose was to provide protection from enemy field armies and was designed to support newer military inventions such as long range artillery cannons . 
 = = = The twelve towers = = = 
 An important and large fortification complex , Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle had as many as 12 towers , some of which were added during later modernizations to the castle . Some of the towers were located on the peninsula on which the main castle sits ; some of the other towers were located on the steep slopes across the Smotrych River . There also were other towers such as the Petty Southern Tower , a Dacia @-@ Roman Tower , while another Dacia @-@ Roman Tower stood just outside the eastern walls and a half tower is located at the western end of the Castle bridge . Of these towers , however , only a few remain unscathed today . Specifically , the 12 towers were the : 
 Pope 's Tower ( also known as <unk> 's Tower , Julian Tower ) was built sometime in the 15th and 16th centuries ; an artillery arsenal , powder warehouse , treasury , and a mill were housed within the tower , interconnected with the extensive southern bastion ; 
 Kovpak Tower ( also called the Szlachta Tower ) an earlier tower originating between the 14th and 16th centuries , where the town 's szlachta nobility were quartered ; 
 Tenchynska Tower , from the 14th to 16th centuries , commemorated to the Tęczyński family ; 
 White Tower ( also known as <unk> Tower ) , constructed in the 15th century , which housed an additional artillery arsenal ; 
 Daily Tower ( also called the <unk> Tower ) , a large tower with a second @-@ floor artillery intersection to move guns into firing position as well as onto the New Western Tower . It also housed a small Lutheran chapel and a smaller " <unk> " ( eaglet ) , or observation tower , at the top ; 
 New Western Tower ( or the Great Tower ) , built in 1544 and which served as a bastion . The tower contained one of the castle 's printing presses , and also provided an artillery platform to cover the vast fields surrounding it . It was damaged in a severe storm in 2011 . 
 <unk> Tower ( also known as the <unk> or <unk> Tower ) , which was constructed between the 14th and 16th centuries , housed a prison in the tower 's basement . It is one of three towers ( Tenchynska and Lanckorońska ) that were finished with specially designed conical vault to draw away the gases from the gunpowder stored there ; 
 Water Tower ( also known as the <unk> Tower ) , one of the castle 's later constructions dating to the 15th to 18th centuries used to be connected to the castle by the Field Gate , located some distance away from the main compound on the northern side . It contained a well which drew water from the adjacent Smotrych River , and a secret tunnel , whose existence was only known to the local starosta and scribes ; 
 Commandant 's Tower , built in the 15th century ; 
 Lanckorońska Tower ( or the second <unk> Tower ) , built between the 14th and 16th centuries , commemorated to the Lanckoroński family ; 
 Black Tower . Only the remains of this tower exist , dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries . It served as a magazine and was blown up in a protest ( see earlier history section ) ; 
 New Eastern Tower , built in 1544 . 
 = = = Fortification walls = = = 
 The walls of Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle are divided into three sections or terraces ; the northern , southern , and eastern . 
 The walls of the northern terrace ( about 336 metres or 1 @,@ 102 feet in length ) defend the whole inner courtyard . The courtyard 's northwestern walls form the Old Castle , ending between the Day and <unk> Towers . They are made up of two parallel walls , which include the Petty Western Tower , the remnants of the Black Tower , and a two @-@ level casemate , or fortified gun emplacement . The older of the two walls dates back to the beginning of the 12th century and is built with crenelations . Another casemate was located at the eastern walls . An entrance to the castle in the eastern walls is known as the New Castle Gate , and there were two more gates , one , in the northern walls , called the Old Castle Gate , and another , the Field Gate , connecting the Water Tower with the rest of the castle . The northern walls are reinforced with the Northern Bastion along their whole length . The bastion was built in 1790 , just before the second partition of Poland . There is also the New Castle that was designed as a hornwork and located west from the main castle complex . 
 At the eastern side of the castle 's courtyard were the remnants of the St. Stanislaus Church , next to which was located a tomb of M. Potocki . Next to the Kovpak Tower stood an Eastern Orthodox church where Prince <unk> was buried . In the courtyard along the southern walls between Kovpak and Tenchynska Towers were a granary and cart shed . Across from these , near the northern walls and Lanckorońska Tower , was the residence of the starosta . Next to the Tenchynska Tower stood the " <unk> " which served as a water storage tank for the castle . At the southern walls closer to the White Tower ( between Tenchynska and White Towers ) were a kitchen and a bakery . Adjacent to the White Tower at the southern walls between White and Day Towers stood the starosta 's headquarters . Located against the western walls were the <unk> , or serfs ' quarters , which housed up to 70 serfs who served the castle . Located outside of the northern walls were the castle stables , which could house up to 30 horses . In the 16th century the castle had a garrison of around 300 soldiers , who lived in the town . 
 The Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Industrial Vocational School has investigated the castle walls . They discovered an area of quick sand at the roadside next to the " <unk> " , or sub @-@ castle , neighborhood of the city , which in the previous year had partially undermined the castle 's supporting walls . The effects of the quick sand had uncovered the fortress 's foundation walls , a little over 5 m ( 16 ft ) deep . The foundation walls were built on the limestone that creates a canyon along the river valley . Further excavation work showed that the walls stretched to the west , as well from the Old Castle to the bastions of the new one . The support footings for the old castle bridge were also found in the ditch . From the south in the wall there is a 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) wide and 5 m ( 16 ft ) tall opening , through which the Vocational School assumed water flowed . 
 The preserved northwestern walls are now 13 @.@ 7 m ( 45 ft ) high measured from the outside of the castle and 5 @.@ 7 m ( 19 ft ) high from the courtyard . As a result of the numerous reconstructions , the walls ' depth changed throughout the centuries , being 1 @.@ 45 m ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) deep in the Medieval period , 2 @.@ 2 m ( 7 @.@ 2 ft ) during the 14th and 15th centuries , and an average of 4 m ( 13 ft ) after the reconstruction of the 16th and 17th centuries . Conservation works have recently been conducted on the walls to preserve the old Rus ' fragments . 
 = = = Castle bridge = = = 
 As a result of the castle 's unique location on a peninsula , the castle bridge ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> ) serves as the only transport link to the city 's Old Town neighborhood . It is considered to represent a considerable feat of medieval engineering . The bridge has a length of 88 m ( 289 ft ) . At the entrance to the bridge , its width is around 8 @.@ 5 m ( 28 ft ) , while at the end , it narrows to 6 @.@ 5 m ( 21 ft ) . The bridge 's height is 27 m ( 89 ft ) at the entrance , dropping to 17 m ( 56 ft ) on the far side . 
 At the beginning of the 15th century , a large round gate tower was constructed at the castle end of the bridge ; the bridge 's height , including the tower , was equivalent to that of eight modern stories . During the unsuccessful Polish siege of the city in 1687 , the castle bridge was rebuilt and fortified by the Turks , acquiring the name " Turkish bridge " ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> ) , which many locals still call it today . The bridge 's stone façade was in poor repair from 1841 until the end of the 19th century . A subsequent lack of preservation work , together with earthquake damage in 1986 , contributed to its poor condition . In 2000 , the World Monuments Fund included Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle bridge in the 2000 World Monuments Watch . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle was the most recognized attraction in the city in 2005 . The castle also sees a large number of tourists from across Ukraine and abroad , attracting thousands of tourists annually . Its legacy has left behind several local legends . According to one legend , when Ottoman Sultan Osman II came to Kamianets in 1621 to capture the city , he was allegedly impressed by its strength and fortifications and asked " Who built this great city ? " . Someone then replied to him , " God himself . " When Osman could not capture the castle , he then replied " Then let God himself take the city . " Another local legend has it that Turkish gold is buried in the Smotrych River and that a 20 km ( 12 mi ) tunnel leads to the Khotyn Fortress from Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi Castle . 
 The events of the 1672 Ottoman siege were depicted in the 1888 historical novel Fire in the Steppe , written by Polish Nobel Prize laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz . The castle has appeared on a commemorative coin of the " Ancient fortresses on the river Dniester " series issued by the <unk> Republican Bank of Transnistria , a breakaway , internationally unrecognised republic within Moldova .

 The 1987 Gulf Coast tropical storm caused flooding along the Gulf Coast of the United States . The second tropical cyclone and first tropical storm of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season , it originated from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico , southeast of Texas , on August 9 . Initially a tropical depression , the cyclone moved north @-@ northwestward and slightly intensified into a tropical storm later that day . By August 10 , it made landfall between Galveston and Beaumont . The system weakened after moving inland and turned towards the east and later southeast . Briefly reemerging over the Gulf on August 15 , the depression moved onshore a second time in Florida , before dissipating over eastern Georgia on August 17 . 
 Due to the relatively weak nature of the system , it caused relatively little damage . However , the system dropped heavy rainfall , peaking at 21 @.@ 05 inches ( 535 mm ) in southern Mississippi . This resulted in flooding , which forced more than 400 people to evacuate their homes , some of which had 2 to 4 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) of water . Flash flooding was reported in a few others states , including Alabama , Florida , and Louisiana . In all , losses from the unnamed storm reached $ 7 @.@ 4 million ( 1987 USD ) and one person was reported missing after being thrown overboard a boat in rough seas .

Tracking westward along the southern edge of the Saharan Air Layer , a feature associated with large masses of dry air , little convective development took place over the following several days . Once near the Lesser Antilles in early August , atmospheric conditions became more favorable for development . Traveling across the Caribbean Sea , the system became increasingly organized and a mid @-@ level circulation formed shortly before the wave moved inland over Central America on August 7 . The following day , the northern portion of the wave interacted with a cold @-@ core low over the Gulf of Mexico , resulting in the formation of a low @-@ level circulation , exhibiting tropical characteristics , on August 9 . Over the following two days , the system tracked in a general north @-@ northwest direction towards the Texas coastline . Aided by an anticyclone aloft , outflow became pronounced and convection increased in coverage and intensity . Around 1200 UTC , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 145 miles ( 235 km ) south @-@ southeast of Galveston , Texas . 
 Hours after being classified a tropical depression , the convective structure of the system deteriorated , a sign of a weakening storm ; however , nearby oil rigs indicated a gradual increase in winds . Later on August 9 , several rigs reported tropical storm @-@ force winds – winds greater than 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) – and the NHC estimated that the depression strengthened into a tropical storm . Operationally , however , these winds were considered to be related to local convective activity rather than the storm itself and it was not considered to be a tropical storm until post @-@ storm analysis . As such , it was not named and is officially classified as " Unnamed Tropical Storm . " Additionally , the strongest winds were located well away from the center of circulation , a signature of subtropical cyclones . 
 Remaining relatively weak , the unnamed system attained peak winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) before making landfall along the Texas coastline between Galveston and Beaumont at 0600 UTC on August 10 . Once over land , the storm weakened to a tropical depression as it neared the Texas @-@ Louisiana border and began a gradual turn towards the east @-@ southeast . On August 12 , while over central Mississippi , the cyclone attained its lowest barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 007 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . On August 15 , the low emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico after crossing the Florida Panhandle . No redevelopment took place during its brief time back over water before making its final landfall near St. Marks , Florida the following day . The depression gradually diminished before losing its identity over eastern Georgia on August 17 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Due to the system 's proximity to land upon being declared a tropical depression and subsequent intensity uncertainties , the unnamed storm posed several challenges to forecasters that " vividly illustrated limitations that are of major concern at the National Hurricane Center . " With operational forecasters noting the possibility of intensification , the first @-@ ever tropical storm warning was issued along the northern Gulf Coast between Matagorda , Texas and Morgan City , Louisiana on August 9 . Prior to 1987 , gale warnings were issued in areas where winds above 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) were anticipated . This warning was later discontinued on August 10 once the system moved inland and weakened . The United States Coast Guard advised ships to seek harbor to avoid large swells associated with the cyclone . Additionally , some non @-@ essential workers were evacuated from offshore rigs . By August 13 , several flash flood watches were in place over portions of Mississippi , Alabama and Florida as remnants of the unnamed system slowly moved through the region . 
 Throughout the United States , damage from the tropical storm amounted to $ 7 @.@ 4 million , the majority of which resulted from flooding . Offshore , a woman was reported missing after she was thrown off her boat amidst rough seas produced by the storm . The system produced rainfall across a large swath of the southern states , with many areas recording more than 5 in ( 130 mm ) . Though it made landfall in Texas , the system 's asymmetric structure led to relatively little rain falling in the state , peaking at 4 @.@ 25 in ( 108 mm ) in <unk> . In parts of Louisiana , many streets were left impassable by high waters , creating widespread traffic delays . The most significant impact took place in southern Mississippi where rainfall in excess of 12 in ( 300 mm ) , peaking at 21 @.@ 06 in ( 535 mm ) in <unk> , caused significant flash flooding , especially along the Biloxi and <unk> Rivers . The former of these experienced a record crest of 16 @.@ 8 ft ( 5 @.@ 1 m ) . More than 400 people were forced to evacuate due to rising water across the region as several homes were inundated with 2 to 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) of water . In Columbia , 12 @.@ 2 in ( 310 mm ) of rain fell in just eight hours , triggering flash floods that washed away a portion of a small dam . Further east in Baldwin County , Alabama and Pensacola , Florida , many roads ere closed or left impassable due to high water . Additionally , the system spawned a brief tornado in Mobile County but no damage resulted from it . 
 = Battle of Lanzerath Ridge = 
 The Battle of Lanzerath Ridge was fought on December 16 , 1944 , the first day of the Battle of the Bulge during World War II , near the village of Lanzerath , Belgium , along the key route for the German advance on the northern shoulder of the operation . It was fought between two squads totalling 18 men belonging to an American reconnaissance platoon , four U.S. Forward Artillery Observers , and a battalion of about 500 German paratroopers . During a day @-@ long confrontation , the American reconnaissance troops inflicted dozens of casualties on the Germans and delayed by almost 20 hours the advance of the entire 1st SS Panzer Division , the spearhead of the German 6th Panzer Army . 
 The Germans finally flanked the American forces at dusk , capturing them . Only one American , a forward artillery observer , was killed , while 14 were wounded : German casualties totaled 92 . The Germans paused , believing the woods were filled with more Americans and tanks . Only when SS @-@ Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight , twelve hours behind schedule , did the Germans learn the nearby woods were empty . 
 Due to lost communications with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters , and the unit 's subsequent capture , its disposition and success at delaying the advance of the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders . Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure . When the war ended five months later , the platoon 's men , who were split between two prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps , just wanted to get home . It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units ' advance . On October 26 , 1981 , after considerable lobbying , a Congressional hearing , and letter @-@ writing by Bouck , every member of the unit were finally recognized for their valor that day , making the platoon the most decorated American unit of World War II .

 Prior to the Battle of the Bulge , the U.S. Army was engaged in a campaign to attack the Roer River dams before invading the rest of Germany . The 99th Infantry Division was supporting the 2nd Infantry Division in their attack on the German West Wall at <unk> . During two days of hard fighting , the U.S. Army had finally managed to slip through the heavily fortified lines and penetrate the German defenses . The Americans were expecting a counterattack in the area , but their intelligence completely failed to detect the German 's movement of hundreds of armored vehicles and tens of thousands of infantry into the region . Much of the region was relatively quiet , lending the area the title of " Ghost Front . " 
 During early December 1944 , the American 's defensive line in the Ardennes had a gap south of Losheimergraben . General Leonard T. Gerow , in command of V Corps , recognized this area as a possible avenue of attack by the Germans . This area , which lay between V Corps and Troy H. Middleton 's VIII Corps , was undefended ; just patrolled by jeep . The patrols in the northern part of the area were conducted by the 99th Infantry Division 's 394th Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon , whereas those in the south were conducted by the 18th Cavalry Squadron , 14th Cavalry Group , which was attached to the 106th Infantry Division . 
 In the border area between Germany and Belgium , there was only one road network that could support a military advance : It was through the area known as the Losheim Gap , a 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) long , narrow valley at the western foot of the Schnee Eifel . This was the key route through which the German Sixth and Fifth Panzer Armies planned to advance . 
 On December 11 , General Walter M. Robertson , commander of the battle @-@ hardened 2nd Infantry Division , was ordered to attack and seize the Roer River dams . In case he had to pull back , he chose Elsenborn Ridge as his defensive line . General Walter E. Lauer , commanding the 99th Infantry Division , was charged with building up the defenses around Elsenborn Ridge . Lauer knew his front was extremely long and very thinly manned ; he gave instructions to his division 's soldiers to dig in and build cover for their foxholes .

 The troops of the 99th Infantry Division , who lacked battle experience , were deployed to the Ardennes in November 1944 , with the 394th Regiment relieving 9th Infantry Division 's 60th Regiment . Among the units was the 394th I & R platoon consisting of well @-@ trained soldiers , who had been selected because they were expert marksmen and in peak physical condition . Some of the men were college @-@ educated and were former members of the U.S. Army 's abruptly terminated ASTP program . This platoon was led by 20 @-@ year @-@ old Lt. Lyle Bouck , one of the youngest officers in the Army , and the second youngest man in the unit . For the next few weeks his platoon established and maintained regimental listening and observation posts , conducted patrols behind enemy lines , and gathered information . They lived in a brick building in Hünningen , taking advantage of a basement full of potatoes and a home @-@ made stove to supplement the military C @-@ rations . 
 The platoon consisted of two nine @-@ man reconnaissance squads and a seven @-@ man headquarters section , which was attached to the 394th regimental S2 section . As the platoon was not intended , nor trained , for combat , they were told to avoid direct engagement with the Germans . Nonetheless , they took part in several missions behind enemy lines , even as far as Losheim 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) behind the front line , to capture enemy soldiers for intelligence . Bouck and several of his men were among the first group in their regiment to be recognized with the Combat Infantry Badge . Most often their patrols consisted of creeping through snow @-@ clogged defiles obscured by fog in an attempt to fix enemy positions . 
 On December 10 , the reconnaissance platoon was ordered by Major Robert Kriz , commanding officer of the 394th Infantry Regiment , to a new position , about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) south east of Hünningen , near Lanzerath , Belgium , a village of about 15 homes . The village lay at a critical road junction in the northern part of the Losheim Gap . The 25 men were charged by Kriz with plugging a 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) gap in the front line between the 106th Division to the south and the 99th Division to the north . The only reserve was the 394th Infantry Regiment 's 3rd Battalion , which was at Bucholz Station . Behind them lay roads that would give the enemy rapid access to the Army 's rear and allow them to easily flank the thinly placed 99th Division . 
 = = = American defensive preparations = = = 
 The I & R platoon took over positions on a ridge top immediately northwest of Lanzerath that were formerly occupied by part of the 2nd Infantry Division . They were ordered to improve their foxhole positions and maintain contact with Task Force X , made up of 55 troops manning four towed three @-@ inch guns from the 2nd Platoon , Company A , 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion . The 820th was attached to the 14th Cavalry Group , 106th Infantry Division of VIII Corps . The I & R platoon and the 820th TD were reinforced by the 22 men of the 820th 's 2nd Recon Platoon , commanded by Lieutenant John <unk> , who were mounted on an armored half @-@ track and two jeeps . Members of the Second Platoon took up positions within two homes inside the village of Lanzerath about 200 yards ( 180 m ) to the southeast . Together , the two units comprised the foremost units in their sector of the American forces facing the Siegfried Line . 
 The Americans were attacking through the Siegfried Line at <unk> about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) to the north , and a localized counter @-@ attack was expected . Lt. Bouck followed procedure and ordered his men to build fortifications with interlocking fields of fire . Taking advantage of the foxholes left by the previous unit , they dug them deeper so that two or three men could stand in them and fire from the concealed edges . They covered each hole with 8 inches ( 20 cm ) to 12 inches ( 30 cm ) pine logs . Their hilltop location was just inside the edge of a forest and overlooked a pasture bisected by a 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high barbed wire fence parallel to their location . Their position covered about 300 yards ( 270 m ) along a shallow ridge line , about 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) above the road and 200 yards ( 180 m ) northwest of the village . Their foxholes were situated in a shallow curve along the ridge line in a northeast direction , almost to a fork in the road at their left flank . Snow fell , covering their dug @-@ in fortifications inside the woods , leaving them virtually invisible from the road below . 
 They took advantage of a small log hut behind their position , which they used as a warming hut . Bouck had augmented the unit 's weaponry with four extra carbines , two Browning automatic rifles , and one light .30 caliber machine gun . Avoiding official channels , he had also traded his unit 's collection of German memorabilia with an ordnance supply officer for an armored Jeep with a mounted .50 caliber machine gun . His men dug an emplacement for the armored jeep and its .50 caliber gun , placing it in enfilade down the road along the German 's possible axis of advance . 
 Once an hour , in an attempt to fill the gap in their sector , they ran a jeep patrol up and down the line to stay in contact with units on their right and left flank and to detect any enemy movement . They hoped they would be relieved soon : " We weren 't trained to occupy a defensive position in the front lines . We were trained to patrol and get information about the enemy , " Bouck said in an interview 60 years later . On the night of December 16 , they heard the clanking of armor and the sound of vehicles in the distance ; Bouck ordered his men to remain awake . The temperature ranged from 20 ° F ( − 7 ° C ) to the low 30 ° F ( − 1 ° C ) during the day . 
 = = = German plans = = = 
 Many of the German units were recent conscripts with very little experience . Sergeant <unk> Kuhlbach 's platoon was typical . Most of his soldiers had little combat experience and even less training . The German units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50 , men previously rejected as physically unfit for service , wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals , and men transferred from the " jobless " personnel of the shrinking Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe . The German 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division , which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation , had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket . It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd , 51st , and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments . The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans . Although they carried the new Schmeisser machine pistol and were equipped with rifle grenades , few had ever fired them in combat . The German recruits were told the American soldiers they faced would not have the nerve to stand and fight . Their officers said the Americans were " a gum @-@ chewing , undisciplined half @-@ breed with no stomach for real war . " 
 To preserve the available armor , the infantry of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment , 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division , had been ordered to lead the attack through Lanzerath and clear the village before advancing towards <unk> and then Büllingen . The German commanders estimated they would face a full division of U.S. troops at Büllingen . 
 Kampfgruppe Peiper 's initial position was in the forest around <unk> , Germany east of the German @-@ Belgium border and the Siegfried Line . Once the infantry captured Lanzerath , Sepp Dietrich ’ s Sixth Panzer Army led by Kampfgruppe SS Standartenführer Joachim Peiper 's 1st SS Panzer Division would proceed without delay . The infantry would then secure the right flank of the attack route near Losheimergraben . Despite the losses that had brought the Allies to the border of their homeland , German morale was surprisingly strong . The men knew the Allies were demanding an unconditional surrender . They were now fighting for the fatherland , defending the soil of their beloved country , not just fighting for Hitler . 
 Dietrich knew the plan had flaws . The Germans had captured the same terrain during the summer of 1940 in three days . Now they were being asked to do it in winter in five days . The plan counted on bad weather to keep the Allied planes grounded . Dietrich only had one @-@ quarter the fuel they needed ; their plan counted on capturing Allied fuel depots and keeping to an ambitious timetable . Dietrich 's assigned route ( or <unk> ) included narrow roads – in many places single @-@ tracks – which would force units of the Kampfgruppe to tail each other , creating a column of infantry and armor up to 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) long . The roads would prevent the attackers from concentrating their forces in the blitzkrieg fashion which had served them so well in the past . The main roads designated for their use had many hairpin turns and traversed steep hillsides that would delay his already slow @-@ moving towed artillery and bridging trains . Dietrich knew that a determined fight at one of these critical choke points by even a token U.S. force could seriously impede his schedule . When Hitler 's operations officer Generaloberst Alfred Jodl gave him his orders , Dietrich yelled , " I 'm a general , not a bloody undertaker ! "

 = = = German barrage = = = 
 On December 16 , 1944 , at 05 : 30 , the Germans launched a 90 @-@ minute artillery barrage using 1 @,@ 600 artillery pieces across an 80 @-@ mile ( 130 km ) front , although the American platoon was only aware of what was happening in their sector . Their first impression was that this was the anticipated counterattack resulting from the Allies ' recent attack in the <unk> crossroads to the north where the 2nd Division had knocked a sizable dent into the Siegfried Line . Bouck later said : 
 Suddenly , without warning , a barrage of artillery registered at about 0530 hours and continued until about 0700 hours . The artillery was relentless and frightening , but not devastating . Much landed short , wide and long of our position , and mostly tree bursts . At any rate , our well @-@ protected cover prevented casualties . The telephone lines were knocked out , but our one radio allowed us to report to regiment . I called regiment and told them , ‘ the TDs are pulling out , what should we do ? ’ The answer was loud and clear : ‘ Hold at all costs ! ’ 
 Many shells exploded in the trees , sending shards of steel and wood into the ground , but the men were protected by their reinforced foxholes . The German guns cut deep holes the size of trucks in the pasture . 
 = = = German advance = = = 
 German infantry began to advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted , preparing to cross the front line as soon as it ended . They marched under the glow of massive searchlights , bouncing light off the clouds . The armor was located farther back , near <unk> , Germany . At 8 : 00 , as the sun rose , the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben to the east and north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located . The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon , Company A , 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion , 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect <unk> , but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station . They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I & R platoon . This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support . 
 Bouck sent James , Slape and Creger to set up an observation post in a house on the eastern side of the village that had been abandoned by Task Force X. Accompanying them , he spotted in the dawn light a long column of what appeared to be about 500 German troops headed toward them from the east . Their distinctive helmet style told Bouck they were paratroopers , among the best soldiers Germany could field . None of his training or experience prepared him for this situation , outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1 . Bouck and James scrambled back to the ridge top and the rest of their unit . The platoon 's telephone land line to 1st Battalion headquarters in Losheimergraben was knocked out , but their SCR @-@ 300 radio still worked . Bouck reached Regimental headquarters at Hünningen on the radio and requested permission to withdraw and engage in a delaying action . He was told to " remain in position and reinforcements from the 3rd Battalion will come to support you . " 
 In town , Creger watched as a forward element of the German infantry advanced , with weapons slung , into Lanzerath . They obviously did not expect to encounter any Americans . Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck 's position . Bouck sent Robinson , McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger , who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath . Before the three men reached Creger , he left the village using a more direct route . As he returned to the American lines , he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon . 
 On the eastern side of the road , Robinson , McGeehee and Silvola attempted to rejoin their platoon , but found the way blocked by German soldiers who threatened to flank them . They decided to head for Losheimergraben and seek reinforcements . They crossed a 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) deep railroad cut and once on the far side encountered soldiers from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division . Trying to outflank the 1st Battalion , 394th Infantry Regiment in Losheimergraben , they spotted the three men . After a brief firefight , Robinson and McGeehee were wounded and all three were captured . 
 Germans entered the home that Creger and Slape were using as an observation post . Slape climbed into the attic , while Creger only had time to hide behind a door . He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob jammed into his ribs . Bullets from the I & R platoon struck the building , and the Germans suddenly left . Creger and Slape exited by the back door and ducked into a nearby cowshed . They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield . Picking their way forward , they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans . Opening fire , they killed them . Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and <unk> across the road and sprinted towards them , drawing German fire . They made it back to their ridge @-@ top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters . He requested artillery support , but when he reported the German column advancing on his position , the voice on the other end of the radio told him " he must be seeing things " . Bouck told them he had 20 @-@ 20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit . 
 = = = U.S. artillery unavailable = = = 
 But the platoon 's position at the southern end of the 99th Division 's sector was not only outside their own regimental boundary , it was outside their Division 's boundary and V Corps boundary . The division prioritized artillery fire for targets within its boundary . Bouck waited in vain for the sound of incoming artillery . He called Regimental Headquarters again , asking for directions . He was told to " hold at all costs , " which essentially meant until dead or captured . Bouck knew that if his platoon gave way , the 99th Division 's right flank , already thin and undermanned , could be in grave danger . 
 Radio operator James Fort attempted to contact headquarters on the SCR @-@ 284 radio mounted on a jeep by the command post and found that German martial music jammed the channel . He then used a side @-@ channel and Morse code , hoping the Germans weren 't listening , to send a status report to regimental headquarters . 
 = = = Platoon 's defensive action = = = 
 As the German forces moved through Lanzerath and in front of their positions , Bouck and his men allowed lead members of the unit to pass , hoping to surprise the Germans . They were preparing to fire on three men who they believed were the Regiment 's officers when a girl from the village emerged from one of the homes . Talking to the officers , she pointed in their general direction . An officer yelled a command , and the paratroopers jumped for ditches on either side of the road . The Americans thought she had given their position away and fired on the Germans , wounding several . ( In October 2006 , more than 50 years later , a writer found the now adult woman , still living in the village . She told him she did not know the Americans were still in the area , and was pointing out the direction the Tank Destroyer unit had departed , towards Bucholz Station . ) 
 Four members of a Forward Observation Team from Battery C , 371st Field Artillery had been in the village when the Tank Destroyer unit withdrew . Lieutenant Warren Springer and the other three men , Sergeant Peter <unk> , T / 4 Willard <unk> , and T / 5 Billy Queen joined Bouck 's unit on the ridge where they could continue to observe the enemy movement . Bouck distributed them among the foxholes to help reload magazines and reinforce their position . 
 The German infantry deployed and about two platoons of the 2nd Company , 1st Battalion , then attacked the Americans head @-@ on , bunched together in the open and charging straight up the hill , directly at the platoon 's hidden and fortified positions . The Americans were surprised at the inexperienced tactics . For the Americans , it was like " shooting clay ducks in California at an amusement park . " Several attackers were killed trying to climb over the 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) -high barbed wire fence that bisected the field , often shot at close range with a single shot to the heart or head . Lt. Springer used his jeep @-@ mounted SCR @-@ 610 radio to call in coordinates for artillery fire . A few shells landed near the road outside Lanzerath , but they did not hinder the German attack . His jeep was then struck by machine gun fire or mortar shrapnel and his radio was destroyed . 
 Slape and Milosevich fired continually , as fast as they could reload . Slape thought the Germans were mad to attack in such a suicidal manner , straight across the open field . He later recalled that it was one of the " most beautiful fields of fire " he had ever seen . After only about 30 seconds , the firing stopped . Nearly all of the attacking Germans had been killed or wounded . McConnell , shot in the shoulder , was the only American casualty . 
 During a second attack made around 11 : 00 am , Milosevich fired the .50 caliber jeep @-@ mounted machine gun until enemy fire drove him back into his foxhole . In both the first and second attack that morning no German soldier got past the fence in the middle of the field . Bodies were piled around it . German medics waved a white flag late in the morning and indicated they wanted to remove the wounded , which the American defenders allowed . The Americans again suffered only one wounded on the second attack , when Pvt. Kalil was struck in the face by a rifle grenade that failed to explode . 
 The Germans mounted a third attack late in the afternoon , around 3 : 00 . Several times German soldiers attempted to penetrate the American lines . The Americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on the attackers to push them back down the hill . At one point PFC <unk> spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he felt certain was already dead . As mortar fire on his position got more accurate , <unk> noticed a pistol on the supposed medic 's belt , and decided he must be calling in fire on their position . He shot and killed him . Bouck contacted Regimental Headquarters once more , seeking reinforcements . At 3 : 50 , Fort sent the unit 's last update to Regimental headquarters in Hünningen . He reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75 , who were attempting to advance from Lanzerath towards the railroad to the northwest . 
 As dusk approached and their ammunition ran dangerously low , Bouck feared they could be flanked at any time . He planned to pull his men back just before dusk , when they would have enough light to escape through the woods . Bouck ordered his men to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear . He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the woods to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements . 
 Bouck tried to contact Regimental headquarters on the SCR @-@ 300 radio for instructions . A sniper shot the radio as Bouck held it to his ear . The sniper also hit the SCR @-@ 284 radio mounted in the Jeep behind Bouck , eliminating any possibility of calling for reinforcements or instructions . 
 The German troops were reluctant to attack head on once again , and Sergeant <unk> <unk> pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk . Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American 's southern flank through the woods . Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal , German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes . Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes . Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn . Surprisingly , the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes . Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun , and he thought he would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger ; it was empty . Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets . The German fell seriously wounded , while Bouck was struck in the calf . Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command , and Bouck replied that he was . Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting , and Bouck said it was not his men doing it . Bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to the village . 
 = = = Conclusion = = = 
 During their dawn to dusk fight , the 15 remaining men of the I & R platoon plus the four men of the 371st Artillery Forward Observation Team repeatedly engaged elements of the 1st Battalion , 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment , 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division of about 500 men . The Germans reported 16 killed , 63 wounded , and 13 missing in action . Other reports say the Americans inflicted between 60 and five hundred casualties on the Germans . Only one American , forward artillery observer Billy Queen , was killed ; in Bouck 's platoon , 14 out of 18 men were wounded . The small American force had seriously disrupted the schedule of the entire 6th Panzer Army 's drive for Antwerp along the entire northern edge of the offensive . After virtually no sleep during the preceding night and a full day of almost non @-@ stop combat , with only a few rounds of ammunition remaining , flanked by a superior enemy force , the platoon and artillery observers were captured .

 Kampfgruppe Peiper , the lead element of the Sixth Panzer Army 's spearhead , 1st SS Panzer Division , consisted of 4 @,@ 800 men and 600 vehicles . On December 16 , it started as much as 36 kilometres ( 22 mi ) to the east in <unk> , Germany , and was unable to advance at its scheduled rate because of road congestion . The road from Scheid to Losheim was one solid traffic jam , in part due to two blown railroad overpasses blocking the advance of the 3rd Parachute Regiment and the 12th <unk> Division to Losheimergraben , but also due to the stiff American resistance . Peiper 's lead units did not reach Losheim until 7 : 30 pm , when he was ordered to swing west and join up with the 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division , which had finally cleared the route through Lanzerath . Peiper was furious about the delay . En route to Lanzerath , Peiper 's unit lost five tanks and five other armored vehicles to American mines and anti @-@ tank weapons . Kampfgruppe Peiper finally reached Lanzerath near midnight . 
 Lt. Bouck , held in Café <unk> , turned 21 years old at midnight on December 17 . At midnight , he watched as a senior German officer ( who he later identified as Peiper ) attempt to obtain accurate information about the U.S. Army 's strength in the area . Peiper was told by Obersturmbannführer <unk> von Hoffman , a former Luftwaffe general staff officer from Berlin and commanding officer of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment , 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division , that his men had run into stiff resistance . He reported that the woods and road ahead were packed with American troops and tanks . He had bedded his troops down for the night and planned to probe the forest for Americans at first light . Their expectations of further resistance was all based on the stiff defense offered by Bouck 's force of just 18 men . 
 Peiper asked the Battalion commander and a Hauptmann ( captain ) in the same unit about the American resistance . Both said they had not personally seen the Americans , but that the woods were heavily fortified . Peiper learned that no patrols had been conducted into the woods and no one had personally reconnoitered the area . Disgusted , Peiper demanded that von Hoffman give him a battalion of paratroops to accompany his tanks . At 4 : 30 on December 17 , more than 18 hours behind schedule , the 1st SS Panzer Division rolled out of <unk> and headed northwest for Bucholz Station . The entire timetable of their advance on the River Meuse and Antwerp had been seriously slowed , allowing the Americans precious hours to move in reinforcements . 
 Peiper 's lead units entered Bucholz Station without resistance at 5 : 00 am . They found only two rifle companies from the 3rd Battalion , 394th Infantry Regiment had been left to defend it ; these were quickly captured , except for a headquarters company radio operator . Hidden in a cellar , he called in reports to division headquarters until he was finally captured . Driving west , the Germans entered <unk> at 6 : 00 am where his column merged in the dark with an American column . In <unk> , they encountered one of the 99th Division 's rest centers , which was clogged with still sleeping , confused American troops . They killed many , destroyed a number of American armored units and vehicles , and took several dozen prisoners , who were later executed by elements of his force . 
 Based on the noise to the northeast , Peiper decided that the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend was encountering more resistance than expected . Unable to contact his division headquarters , and with his vehicles low on fuel , Peiper decided to switch his planned route to the south through Büllingen , where he believed an American fuel depot existed . His units entered the town at 8 : 00 am and easily captured 50 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 190 @,@ 000 l ; 42 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of fuel for his vehicles . He was apparently unaware he had nearly taken the town and unknowingly bypassed an opportunity to flank and trap the entire 2nd and 99th Divisions . Peiper turned south to detour around Hünningen , interested only in hurrying west as quickly as he could . The unit gained notoriety when on this route they encountered a lightly armored American convoy and killed 84 U.S. prisoners of war in what became known as the Malmedy massacre . Peiper was later released after 11 years in prison . 
 The German advance never recovered from its initial delay , and Kampfgruppe Peiper only got as far as <unk> , where the remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from American aircraft , artillery , and tanks . Having advanced less than half @-@ way to the River Meuse , they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in the town , including six Tiger II tanks . The soldiers were left to find their own way east on foot . Having started the offensive with about 5 @,@ 800 men , 60 tanks ( including 30 King Tigers ) , 3 flak tanks , 75 half @-@ tracks , 14 20mm Flak Wagons , 27 75mm assault guns , plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers , Hitler 's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through the brush at night , trying to get back to their own line . 
 The task of defeating the 99th Division was the objective of 12th SS Panzer Division reinforced by additional Panzergrenadier and <unk> divisions . On December 17 , German engineers repaired one of the road bridges over the railroad along the Losheim @-@ Losheimergraben road and the 12th Division 's armor began advancing towards the key road junction at Losheimergraben and the twin villages of <unk> and <unk> . However , in more than ten days of intense battle , the 12th SS Panzer Division was unable to dislodge the Americans from Elsenborn Ridge , where elements of the V Corps of the First U.S. Army prevented the German forces from reaching the key road network to their west . 
 Due to the determined resistance of the 99th Division , which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops , along with the 2nd and 30th Divisions , the northern shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation . Had the Americans given way , the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Liège and Spa and possibly have changed the outcome of the Battle of Bulge . 
 = = = Prisoners of war = = = 
 The I & R platoon members who were able to walk were sent to Germany . James was so seriously wounded he couldn 't speak . He and Kalil , who was also seriously wounded , were loaded onto trucks and eventually put aboard trains . Bouck was jammed into a single railroad cattle car with 71 others POWs and traveled for days without food or water . By Christmas Day , seven men in Bouck 's car had died and the rest were barely hanging on . The prisoners were transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover . McConnell , also wounded , ended up like James in Stalag XI @-@ B near Bad <unk> , the most primitive POW camp in Germany . Bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in Stalag XIII @-@ D in Nuremberg and later in Stalag XIII @-@ C in <unk> , where the non @-@ commissioned and enlisted men were split , with the officers sent to Oflag XIII @-@ B. <unk> was designed for 300 prisoners , but it soon housed more than 1500 POWs . 
 Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were captured before they reached Allied lines , and they later joined Bouck and the rest of the platoon in prison . The men barely survived , most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition . When Task Force Baum from Patton 's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp , Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all . Almost all of Baum 's unit was captured ; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended . He was too weak to file a combat report , and hospitalized for several months after the war ended . He did not think his men had accomplished that much . " We were in those foxholes and ... what we did was to defend ourselves and try to live through it . "

 All who were wounded and captured recovered to return home after the war . In 1965 , the U.S. Army published a multi @-@ volume history of World War II , including one on The Ardennes : The Battle of the Bulge . Author Hugh M. Cole only briefly mentioned Bouck 's platoon , which upset former platoon member William James ( who had changed his name from Tsakanikas ) . James contacted Bouck and encouraged him to get his men proper recognition . 
 Bouck contacted his former division commander , Maj. Gen. Walter E. Lauer , who nominated Bouck for a Silver Star . In June 1966 , a Silver Star arrived in Bouck 's mailbox , but no other platoon member was recognized . Bouck was shortly afterward interviewed by John S. D. Eisenhower for his book The Bitter Woods , which described the actions of the unit in detail . Columnist Jack Anderson unsuccessfully campaigned for William James ( Tsakanikas ) to be awarded the Medal of Honor . Congressional hearings on the men 's action resulted in a recommendation to the Secretary of Defense that Bill James be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor . The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force concurred , but the Marine Corp responded that James failed to show sufficient " intrepidity " . The hearings also resulted in Public Law 96 @-@ 145 , which waived the time limitation exclusively for members of the platoon . It was signed by President Jimmy Carter on December 14 , 1979 . 
 On October 26 , 1981 , after considerable lobbying and letter @-@ writing by Bouck , the men of the unit were finally decorated . Fourteen of the 18 were present at the ceremony hosted by Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh . Every man was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation . Four received the Distinguished Service Cross , five the Silver Star , and nine got the Bronze Star with V device for their 10 @-@ hour struggle against a 500 @-@ man strong German battalion . 
 All members of the platoon who received individual awards also received the Presidential Unit Citation . Platoon members and the citations they received were :

 † Bouck was awarded a Silver Star while a prisoner of war in 1945 , although he did not receive it until 1966 . This was superseded by his DSC award later . 
 Lieutenant Warren Springer and his three @-@ man artillery observation unit — Sergeant Peter <unk> , T / 4 Willard <unk> , and T / 5 Billy Queen - also joined the men in battle . Queen was killed in action before the remainder were captured . All four were awarded the DSC for their valor at Lanzerath . 
 In 2004 , the book The Longest Winter was published , documenting the defensive actions of the platoon . Bouck cooperated with the author , Alex Kershaw , but imposed one condition , " I told him that other authors never wrote about the other men in the platoon , just me . I said I wouldn 't talk to him unless he promised that he 'd also write about the other men . " 
 On May 12 , 2005 , veterans of the 99th Infantry Division and local citizens of Lanzerath , Belgium , dedicated a monument composed of a small brass plaque alongside a bench and a United States flag to commemorate the fight on the grassy hill overlooking the village . 
 Uncommon valor was a common valor

 = Refugio oil spill = 
 The Refugio oil spill on May 19 , 2015 deposited 142 @,@ 800 U.S. gallons ( 3 @,@ 400 barrels ) of crude oil onto one of the most biologically diverse coastlines of the west coast . The corroded pipeline blamed for the spill has been closed indefinitely , resulting in financial impacts to the county estimated as high as $ 74 million if it and a related pipeline remain out of service for three years . The cost of the cleanup was estimated by the company to be $ 96 million with overall expenses including expected legal claims and potential settlements to be around $ 257 million . 
 The oil spill , located immediately north of Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County , California , originated in a 2 feet ( 61 cm ) diameter underground pipeline named Line 901 owned by Plains All American Pipeline . Crude oil produced by offshore platforms was transported from onshore receiving plants to another pipeline that transported the oil inland for processing . The oil pipeline operators in Midland , Texas had turned off an alarm that would have notified them of the leak as they were dealing with a separate problem with a pump . The 28 year old pipeline was not equipped with an automatic shut @-@ off valve and was eventually shut down by control operators when they were notified of the leak from parties who has visually located the spill . 
 Hundreds of animals along the coast were coated with the thick crude oil and many died . State parks and beaches located along the coastline were temporarily closed . While much smaller than the oil rig blowout that resulted in the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill , this spill may have greater long term effects due to its potential impact on four state marine protected areas . Due to the unique characteristics of the area , it is one of the most studied marine environments in the United States . 
 = = Background = = 
 The area was one of the earliest locations in California developed for offshore oil and gas production . Crude oil and natural gas produced by offshore platforms is processed at onshore receiving plants before being transported to distant refineries . The source of the spill was Line 901 , a 10 @.@ 6 @-@ mile pipeline ( 17 @.@ 1 km ) owned by Plains All American Pipeline . The 24 @-@ inch buried line ( 610 mm ) was constructed in 1987 along the Gaviota coast to service the crude oil produced by offshore drilling . The pipeline can transport 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons ( 48 @,@ 000 barrels ) a day and the contents are heated to as high as 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) . Santa Barbara area pipelines are typically not heated but they are insulated to retain the oil 's heat during transit . The viscous oil is also blended with natural gas liquids to allow it to flow more readily through the pipeline . Truck transportation of oil was phased out in Santa Barbara County in the 1970s because pipelines were considered a safer option . 
 = = = Pipeline corrosion = = = 
 Before the spill , an inspection of the 28 year old Line 901 pipeline found extensive corrosion problems resulting in thinning pipeline walls . The pipeline did not have an automatic shut @-@ off valve that would have been required on an intrastate pipeline as Line 901 is categorized as an interstate pipeline . Officials from Plains All American Pipeline claimed that installing a new valve would present other potential dangers . The line underwent a comprehensive internal inspection in July 2012 and since then the area where the pipe broke had been repaired at least three times . Line 903 is a much longer pipeline that transports the oil from Line 901 inland to gathering facilities and refineries . <unk> 903 was also found to be corroded though not as seriously . 
 = = = Offshore oil production = = = 
 Exxon Mobil owns three offshore platforms , Hondo , Harmony and Heritage , that transport their oil to onshore tanks at its Santa Ynez Unit in Las Flores Canyon . They depend on Line 901 to transport the oil from Las Flores to a pump station in a coastal canyon near Gaviota . The crude oil , known as Las Flores Canyon OCS ( Outer Continental Shelf ) , then flows into Line 903 as it is transported inland 128 miles ( 206 km ) to gathering facilities in Kern County and on to refineries throughout Southern California . <unk> ’ s Platform Holly located in the South Ellwood Offshore Oil Field also depends on Lines 901 and 903 . The Holly platform is about 2 @-@ mile offshore ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the Coal Oil Point where about 4 @,@ 000 U.S. gallons ( 95 barrels ) a day comes from natural seeps . Line 903 is also used to move the production from platforms Hidalgo , Harvest and Hermosa of Point Arguello Unit owned by Freeport @-@ <unk> to the ConocoPhillips refinery in Santa Maria . 
 = = = Gaviota coast = = = 
 The narrow coastal terrace where the spill took place is primarily used for recreation and cattle grazing . Local land use agencies have kept oil processing facilities to a minimum along the lightly populated Gaviota coast where much of the land is held in agricultural preserves under the Williamson Act and used for avocado and lemon tree orchards . The parks and agricultural areas on this narrow coastal terrace are situated between a rugged coastline and the Santa Ynez Mountains of the Los Padres National Forest . The nearest city is Goleta , about 11 @-@ mile down the coast ( 18 km ) . US 101 and the main coastal railroad line both parallel the coastline and the Hondo and Harmony oil rigs can be easily seen offshore in the Santa Barbara Channel from the highway or railroad . 
 The Gaviota coast with its Mediterranean climate is considered unique for the biodiversity of ocean life . The unusual species found here are the result of the cold water from the north meeting the warm water from the south . The annual migration of about 19 @,@ 000 Gray whales through the Santa Barbara Channel was in progress at the time of the spill . They may come as close as 100 @-@ foot from the shoreline ( 30 m ) .

 On May 19 , 2015 , the pipeline operators in Midland , Texas remotely detected pressure anomalies and shut down Line 901 at 11 : 30 am . The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11 : 40 am to a report of a strong smell coming from the area . Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a drainage culvert that passed under U.S. 101 , and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak to authorities . Local pipeline workers did not know about the leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water . After struggling to find the leaking pipeline , workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm culvert around 1 : 30 pm . Company officials in Bakersfield who were responsible for notifying the National Response Center did not do so until 2 : 56 pm . The Center , staffed by United States Coast Guard officers and marine science technicians , is the sole federal point of contact for reporting all hazardous substances releases and oil spills . An oil spill triggers mandatory federal notification requirements in a timely manner but company officials said they were unable to contact employees on site as the employees were busy dealing with the immediate demands and distractions of the situation . 
 On May 20 , 2015 , the state parks agency closed Refugio State Beach and El Capitán State Beach . Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency . Santa Barbara County also declared a state of emergency . The Santa Barbara emergency management team eventually recommended that the Board of Supervisors keep the proclamation of local emergency intact till until May 2016 . They anticipated that a significant winter storm could bring up submerged oil and the situation could be reassessed in the spring .
