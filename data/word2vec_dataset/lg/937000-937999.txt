 Roger Allan Crozier ( March 16 , 1942 – January 11 , 1996 ) was a Canadian professional hockey goaltender who played fourteen seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Detroit Red Wings , Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals . During his career , Crozier was named to the NHL First All @-@ Star Team once , was a Calder Memorial Trophy winner , and was the first player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy while playing for the losing team in the Stanley Cup Finals . Also , Crozier is the last goaltender in the NHL to start all of his team 's games during the regular season , doing so in 1964 – 65 . 
 From his junior days with the St. Catharines Teepees of the Junior Ontario Hockey Association until his death , Crozier had recurring pancreatitis that plagued his health . Despite his health issues , Crozier helped his junior team win the Memorial Cup in 1959 – 60 , played in over 500 NHL regular season games and participated in two Stanley Cup Finals ( 1965 – 66 and in 1974 – 75 ) . His health problems eventually led to his retirement in 1976 – 77 and he joined the Capitals ' front office shortly after . Crozier left the Capitals organization in 1983 to work for MBNA bank . In 2000 , MBNA unveiled a new trophy called the Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award which was awarded annually to the goaltender who records the best save percentage during the regular season in the NHL . The trophy was awarded from 1999 – 2000 to 2006 – 07 . The Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame posthumously inducted Crozier in 2009 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Crozier was born and raised in the town of Bracebridge , Ontario . His mother was Mildred " Austin " Crozier and his father was Lloyd Crozier . He was one of 14 children . At the age of six , Crozier first started playing the position of goaltender , a position that he would grow to " like " . Identified as a " special goaltending talent " by his town 's senior hockey team , the Bracebridge Bears , he was recruited to be their starting goaltender at the age of 14 . In 1958 – 59 , Crozier helped the Bears become District Champions in the Intermediate C playoffs . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Crozier spent his junior career with the St. Catharines Teepees of the Junior Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA @-@ Jr . ) from 1959 to 1962 . At the time , the Teepees were owned by the Chicago Black Hawks thanks to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) sponsorship system . The sponsorship system gave the Black Hawks the rights to all of the Teepees ' players . In 1959 – 60 , Crozier helped his team win the Memorial Cup . During his tenure with the Teepees , Crozier developed his first ulcer , a problem that would constantly plague him for the rest of his career . 
 During the 1960 – 61 season , Crozier spent the majority of his time in the OHA @-@ Jr . Due to his small frame and size , Crozier was not a favourite with either scouts or critics . Despite this , the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) recruited Crozier to fill in for their injured starting goaltender , Denis <unk> that same season . Appearing in three games , Crozier recorded two wins and a 2 @.@ 31 goals against average ( GAA ) . Crozier returned as the starting goaltender for the Teepees for the 1961 – 62 season . He also had short stints with the Sault Ste . Marie Thunderbirds of the Eastern Professional Hockey League ( <unk> ) , and the Bisons . 
 While playing in the minors , Crozier adopted the butterfly style of goaltending , which he would later use during his NHL career . This technique was popularized by Glenn Hall and was improved upon by Crozier . Initially , his minor league coaches tried to convince him to abandon this style , thinking that it would never succeed in the NHL . Crozier also added an element of <unk> in his game . 
 = = = Detroit Red Wings ( 1963 – 70 ) = = = 
 The Black Hawks traded Crozier to the Detroit Red Wings in 1963 . The young goaltender , turned full @-@ time professional , spent the season in the minors with the St. Louis Braves in the <unk> and the Buffalo Bisons in the AHL . The majority of his time though was spent in St. Louis as he played 70 games for them . In 1963 – 64 , he played 44 games with the Pittsburgh Hornets , Detroit 's AHL affiliate . At the end of the season , Crozier earned numerous accolades , which included the Hap Holmes Memorial Award ( fewest goals against ) , the Dudley " Red " Garrett Memorial Award ( top rookie ) and a spot on the league 's Second All @-@ Star Team . Crozier also made his NHL debut that same season . The Red Wings starting goaltender , Terry Sawchuk , was injured and Crozier was called up as a temporary replacement . Although Crozier played in only 15 games , he impressed management enough that they decided he was going to be their next starting goaltender . This led to Sawchuk being left unprotected by the Red Wings during the <unk> waiver draft in the off @-@ season , and he was subsequently picked up by the Toronto Maple Leafs . This made Crozier the Red Wings ' starting goaltender at the age of 22 . 
 During his rookie season , Crozier started all of his team 's games , the last goalie to do so in the NHL . He also led the league in both wins and shutouts with 40 and 6 respectively . His 2 @.@ 42 GAA was the second lowest in the league . At the end of the season , Crozier was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL 's top rookie and he was also named to the NHL First All @-@ Star Team . During his sophomore season , Crozier missed the team 's first couple of games due to pancreatitis . He would return and play the team 's remaining 64 games , posting 27 wins and leading the league with seven shutouts . The Red Wings were also able to clinch a spot in the playoffs . Benefiting from Crozier 's strong play in the playoffs , the Red Wings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals . After eliminating the Black Hawks in the semi @-@ finals , the Red Wings squared off against the Montreal Canadiens in the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals . The Red Wings won the first two games , but the Canadiens came back and won the next two . During the game four loss , Crozier suffered a leg injury . Although Crozier returned for game five , the injury limited his mobility . In the end , the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in game six . Even though the Red Wings lost the Stanley Cup , Crozier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy , which is awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs . He became the first goaltender to win the award and also the first player to win it in a losing effort . 
 Due to pancreatitis , Crozier played only 58 out of 70 games for the Red Wings in 1966 – 67 . His numbers were down as he won only 22 games and recorded a 3 @.@ 35 GAA . The Red Wings missed the playoffs . After another bout of pancreatitis at the beginning of the 1967 – 68 season , Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression . His announcement was short @-@ lived as after six weeks , he returned to hockey . Before re @-@ joining the Red Wings , Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League ( CPHL ) as conditioning . Crozier spent two more seasons on a mediocre Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970 . 
 = = = Buffalo Sabres ( 1970 – 77 ) & Washington Capitals ( 1977 ) = = = 
 In the 1970 NHL Expansion Draft , Sabres General Manager Punch Imlach drafted Tom Webster from the Boston Bruins and promptly dealt him to the Red Wings for Crozier . Crozier started the Sabres ' first NHL game on October 10 , 1970 against the Pittsburgh Penguins . He stopped 35 of 36 shots to earn the franchise 's first victory , 2 – 1 . On December 6 , 1970 , Crozier earned the franchise 's first shutout in a 1 – 0 win over the Minnesota North Stars . By late December however , Crozier was deeply exhausted and the majority of the Sabres ' goaltending duties were transferred to goalies Joe Daley and Dave Dryden . Crozier finished the season with a 9 – 20 – 7 record ( win @-@ loss @-@ tie ) and a 3 @.@ 68 GAA . The Sabres also missed the playoffs , finishing fifth in the East Division . Adding to Crozier 's continuing health problems , his gallbladder was removed during the off @-@ season . 
 The 1971 – 72 season was even worse for the Sabres as they finished with the least wins in the league with 16 . Crozier posted a 13 – 34 – 14 record and a 3 @.@ 51 GAA . He faced 2 @,@ 190 shots during the season . This remains as the franchise record for most shots faced by a goalie in a single season . The Sabres improved the next season and they were able to make the playoffs for the first time in franchise history . Playing 49 games , Crozier had his first winning record with the Sabres and he posted a much improved 2 @.@ 76 GAA . In the first round , the Sabres were matched up against the Canadiens . Crozier played four games and won two , but his team was ultimately dispatched in six games . 
 Facing continuing problems with pancreatitis and the new additions of ulcers and gallbladder problems , Crozier saw his playing time greatly reduced . In 1974 – 75 , Crozier posted 17 wins and two losses , helping the Sabres rank first in the Adams Division . During the playoffs , Crozier played five games including two in the Stanley Cup Finals . After eliminating the Black Hawks and the Canadiens , the Sabres earned a matchup with the Philadelphia Flyers in the Stanley Cup Finals . Game three of the Finals in Buffalo was known as the " Fog Game " . A heat wave in May hit the arena and with no air conditioning inside , the temperature increased . Fog started to develop and soon visibility decreased . Gerry Desjardins was the starting goaltender but after allowing three goals in the first period , he was replaced by Crozier . Crozier allowed one goal during the rest of the game , helping his team win 5 – 4 in overtime . The series went to a game six with the Sabres trailing the series 3 – 2 . Crozier was selected to start and he denied the Flyers of any scoring after two periods . The third period saw the Flyers score the only goals of the game . For the second time , Crozier was denied a Stanley Cup championship . 
 In 1975 – 76 , Crozier participated in only 11 games due to his persisting ailments , leaving the starting job to Gerry Desjardins . Due to his continuous illness , the Sabres traded him to the Washington Capitals in exchange for cash on March 3 , 1977 . He played only three games with the Capitals before retiring after 14 seasons in the NHL .

 After retiring , Crozier served in the Capitals ' front office . He eventually became interim general manager during the 1981 – 82 season after Max McNab was relieved of his duties . Crozier was also the head coach of the Capitals for one game during the season . Under his watch , the Capitals picked future hall @-@ of @-@ famer defenceman Scott Stevens during the 1982 NHL Entry Draft . Crozier left the Capitals organization in 1983 , and moved to Wilmington , Delaware , to work at MBNA Bank .

 Roger Crozier died after a battle with cancer on January 11 , 1996 , at the age of 53 . He was survived by his wife Janice , and his two daughters , Katie and Brooke .

 = Arroyo Seco Parkway = 
 The Arroyo Seco Parkway , formerly known as the Pasadena Freeway , is the first freeway in the Western United States . It connects Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river . It is notable not only for being the first , mostly opened in 1940 , but for representing the transitional phase between early parkways and modern freeways . It conformed to modern standards when it was built , but is now regarded as a narrow , outdated roadway . A 1953 extension brought the south end to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles and a connection with the rest of the freeway system . 
 The road remains largely as it was on opening day , though the plants in its median have given way to a steel guard rail , and most recently to concrete barriers , and it now carries the designation State Route 110 , not historic U.S. Route 66 . Between 1954 and 2010 , it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway . In 2010 , as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety , the California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) restored the original name to the roadway . All the bridges built during parkway construction remain , as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s . The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway , National Civil Engineering Landmark , and National Scenic Byway . It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The six @-@ lane Arroyo Seco Parkway ( part of State Route 110 ) begins at the Four Level Interchange , a symmetrical stack interchange on the north side of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena ( SR 110 north ) , Harbor ( SR 110 south ) , Hollywood ( US 101 north ) , and Santa Ana ( US 101 south ) Freeways . The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street , and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium . Beyond Hill Street , SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park , where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges . One interchange , with Solano Avenue and Amador Street , is located between the first and second tunnels . Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway ( I @-@ 5 ) . Immediately after those ramps , the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three @-@ lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco , one rail line on each bank , and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank . A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I @-@ 5 , and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street . Here the original 1940 freeway , mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco , begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes . 
 As the original freeway begins , it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge , one of four bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway 's construction . A southbound exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps , and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I @-@ 5 . SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco , passing under the Gold Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at the first of many folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight ( right @-@ in / right @-@ out ) curves on the exit and entrance ramps . The next interchange , at Avenue 52 , is a normal diamond interchange , and soon after is Via Marisol , where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps , but on the southbound side Avenue 57 acts as a folded diamond connection . The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge , and is another folded diamond , with southbound traffic using <unk> Street to connect . The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge ( now Gold Line ) lies just beyond , and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way / Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only . After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge , the pre @-@ parkway bridge , southbound connections between the freeway and cross street can be made via Salonica Street . As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena , the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east , crossing the stream into South Pasadena . A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street , the parkway 's west @-@ side frontage road . 
 As they enter South Pasadena , northbound motorists can see a " City of South Pasadena " sign constructed , in the late 1930s , of stones from the creek bed embedded in a hillside . This final segment of the Arroyo Seco Parkway heads east in a cut alongside <unk> Street , with a full diamond at Orange Grove Avenue and a half diamond at Fair Oaks Avenue . In between those two streets it crosses under the Gold Line for the third and final time . Beyond Fair Oaks Avenue , SR 110 curves north around the east side of Raymond Hill and enters Pasadena , where the final ramp , a southbound exit , connects to State Street for access to Fair Oaks Avenue . The freeway , and state maintenance , ends at the intersection with Glenarm Street , but the six- and four @-@ lane Arroyo Parkway , now maintained by the city of Pasadena , continues north as a surface road to Colorado Boulevard ( historic U.S. Route 66 ) and beyond to Holly Street near the Memorial Park Gold Line station .

 The Arroyo Seco ( Spanish : " dry gulch , or streambed " ) is an intermittent stream that carries rainfall from the San Gabriel Mountains southerly through western Pasadena into the Los Angeles River near downtown Los Angeles . During the dry season , it served as a faster wagon connection between the two cities than the all @-@ weather road on the present Huntington Drive . 
 The first known survey for a permanent roadway through the Arroyo was made by T.D. Allen of Pasadena in 1895 , and in 1897 two more proposals were made , one for a scenic parkway and the other for a commuter cycleway . The latter was partially constructed and opened by Horace Dobbins , who incorporated the California <unk> Company and bought a six @-@ mile ( 10 km ) right @-@ of @-@ way from downtown Pasadena to Avenue 54 in Highland Park , Los Angeles . Construction began in 1899 , and about 1 1 ⁄ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) of the elevated wooden bikeway were opened on January 1 , 1900 , starting near Pasadena 's Hotel Green and ending near the Raymond Hotel . The majority of its route is now Edmondson Alley ; a toll booth was located near the north end , in the present Central Park . Due to the end of the bicycle craze of the 1890s and the existing Pacific Electric Railway lines connecting Pasadena to Los Angeles , the cycleway did not and was not expected to turn a profit , and never extended beyond the Raymond Hotel into the Arroyo Seco . In the 1900s ( decade ) , the structure was dismantled , and the wood sold for lumber , and the Pasadena Rapid Transit Company , a failed venture headed by Dobbins to construct a streetcar line , acquired the right @-@ of @-@ way . 
 Due to the rise of the automobile , most subsequent plans for the Arroyo Seco included a roadway , though they differed as to the purpose : some , influenced by the City Beautiful movement , concentrated on the park , while others , particularly those backed by the Automobile Club of Southern California ( ACSC ) , had as their primary purpose a fast road connecting the two cities . The first plan that left the Arroyo Seco in South Pasadena to better serve downtown Pasadena was drawn up by Pasadena City Engineer Harvey W. Hincks in 1916 and supported by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and ACSC . Frederick Law Olmsted , Jr. and Harland Bartholomew 's 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles , while concentrating on traffic relief , and noting that the Arroyo Seco Parkway would be a major highway , suggested that it be built as a parkway , giving motorists " a great deal of incidental recreation and pleasure " . By the mid @-@ 1930s , plans for a primarily recreational parkway had been overshadowed by the need to carry large numbers of commuters . 
 Debates continued on the exact location of the parkway , in particular whether it would bypass downtown Pasadena . In the late 1920s , Los Angeles acquired properties between San Fernando Road and Pasadena Avenue , and City Engineer Lloyd Aldrich began grading between Avenues 60 and 66 in the early 1930s . By June 1932 , residents of Highland Park and <unk> , who had paid special assessments to finance improvement of the park , became suspicious of what appeared to be a road , then graded along the Arroyo Seco 's west side between Via Marisol ( then Hermon Avenue ) and Princess Drive . Merchants on North Figueroa Street ( then Pasadena Avenue ) also objected , due to the loss of business they would suffer from a bypass . Work stopped while the interested parties could work out the details , although , in late 1932 and early 1933 , Aldrich was authorized to grade a cheaper route along the east side between Avenue 35 and Hermon Avenue . To the north , Pasadena and South Pasadena endorsed in 1934 what was essentially Hincks 's 1916 plan , but lacked the money to build it . A bill was introduced in 1935 to add the route to the state highway system , and after some debate a new Route 205 was created as a swap for the Palmdale @-@ <unk> Route 186 , as the legislature had just greatly expanded the system in 1933 , and the California Highway Commission opposed a further increase .

 To connect the proposed parkway with downtown Los Angeles , that city improved and extended North Figueroa Street as a four @-@ lane road to the Los Angeles River , allowing drivers to bypass the congested North Broadway Bridge on the existing but underutilized Riverside Drive Bridge . A large part of the project lay within Elysian Park , and four Art Deco tunnels were built through the hills . The first three , between Solano Avenue and the river , opened in late 1931 , and the fourth opened in mid @-@ 1936 , completing the extension of Figueroa Street to Riverside Drive . As with the contemporary Ramona Boulevard east from downtown , grade separations were mostly built only where terrain dictated . For Figueroa Street , this meant that all crossings except College Street ( built several years after the extension was completed ) , where a hill was cut through , were at grade . The Figueroa Street Viaduct , connecting the Riverside Drive intersection with North Figueroa Street ( then Dayton Avenue ) across the Los Angeles River , opened in mid @-@ 1937 . Closer to downtown , an interchange was built at Temple Street in 1939 . 
 Although many South Pasadena residents opposed the division of the city that the parkway would bring , the city 's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections . The state , which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it , approved the route on April 4 , 1936 . The route used the Arroyo Seco 's west bank to near Hough Street , where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway ( now Arroyo Parkway ) in Pasadena . Another project , the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel , was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods . A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938 , including Chicago 's Lake Shore Drive , full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey , and Robert Moses 's parkway system in New York City . The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points . Although , in some areas , it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange , other locations required folded diamonds , or , as the engineers called them , " compressed cloverleafs " , where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps , ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit . The highway was designed with two 11 – 12 foot ( 3 @.@ 4 @-@ 3 @.@ 7 m ) lanes and one ten @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) shoulder in each direction , with the wider inside ( passing ) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete . The differently @-@ colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes . ( By mid @-@ 1939 , the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity ; except on a short piece in South Pasadena , these were also paved with Portland cement . So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway , about 50 " safety bays " were constructed in 1949 and 1950 . ) The engineers used a design speed of 45 miles per hour ( 72 kilometres per hour ) , superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this . ( The road is now posted at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . ) Despite the freeway design , many parkway characteristics were incorporated , such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road . 
 Prior to parkway construction , nine roads and two rail lines crossed the Arroyo Seco and its valley on bridges , and a number of new bridges were built as part of the project . Only four of the existing bridges were kept , albeit with some changes : the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge , the 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge , the 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge ( now part of the Gold Line ) near Avenue 64 , and the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge . The Avenue 43 Bridge would have been kept had the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 not destroyed it . At Cypress Avenue , abutments and a foundation were built for a roadway , but were not used until the 1960s , when a pedestrian bridge was built as part of the Golden State Freeway ( I @-@ 5 ) interchange project . In South Pasadena , seven streets and the Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroad lines on a double track combined bridge were carried over the parkway to keep the communities on each side connected . 
 Construction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway , designed under the leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and Design Engineer A. D. Griffin , began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22 , 1938 and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest . The first contract , stretching less than a mile ( 1 @.@ 5 km ) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena , and including no bridges , was opened to traffic on December 10 , 1938 . A 3 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) section opened on July 20 , 1940 , connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles . The remainder in Los Angeles , from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22 , was opened on December 30 , 1940 , in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year 's Day . However , the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30 , 1941 , and landscaping work continued through September . The final cost of $ 5 @.@ 75 million , under $ 1 million per mile , was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations . 
 The state began upgrading the four @-@ lane North Figueroa Street extension ( then part of Route 165 ) in October 1940 as a " Southerly Extension " of the parkway , even before the parkway was complete . The at @-@ grade intersection with Riverside Drive was already a point of congestion , and the six lanes of parkway narrowing into four lanes of surface street would cause much greater problems . The two @-@ way Figueroa Street Tunnels and Viaduct were repurposed for four lanes of northbound traffic , and a higher southbound roadway was built to the west . From the split with Hill Street south to near the existing College Street overpass , the four @-@ lane surface road became a six @-@ lane freeway . The extension was designed almost entirely on freeway , rather than parkway , principles , as it had to be built quickly to handle existing traffic . The new road split from the old at the Figueroa Street interchange , just south of Avenue 26 , and crossed the Los Angeles River and the northbound access to Riverside Drive on a new three @-@ lane bridge . Through Elysian Park , a five @-@ lane open cut was excavated west of the existing northbound tunnel lanes , saving about $ 1 million . The extension , still feeding into surface streets just south of College Street , was opened to traffic on December 30 , 1943 , again allowing its use for the New Year 's Day festivities . 
 While the Arroyo Seco Parkway was being built and extended , the region 's freeway system was taking shape . The short city @-@ built Cahuenga Pass Freeway opened on June 15 , 1940 , over a month before the second piece of the Arroyo Seco Parkway was complete . In the next two decades , the Harbor , Hollywood ( Cahuenga Pass ) , Long Beach ( Los Angeles River ) , San Bernardino ( Ramona ) , and Santa Ana Freeways were partially or fully completed to their eponymous destinations , and others were under construction . The centerpiece of the system was the Four Level Interchange just north of downtown Los Angeles , the first stack interchange in the world . Although it was completed in 1949 , the structure was not fully used until September 22 , 1953 , when the short extension of the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the interchange opened . Though the common name used by the public had become " Arroyo Seco Freeway " over the years , it was officially a " Parkway " until November 16 , 1954 , when the California Highway Commission changed its name to the Pasadena Freeway . 
 Beginning in June 2010 , the state began modifying interchange signs to remove the Pasadena Freeway name and reinstate the Arroyo Seco Parkway name . Signs that indicate route 110 as a " freeway " are being modified to " parkway " or its " <unk> " abbreviation .

 Despite a quadrupling of traffic volumes , the original roadway north of the Los Angeles River largely remains as it was when it opened in 1940 . Trucks and buses were banned in 1943 , though the bus restriction has since been dropped ; this has kept the freeway in good condition and relatively safe , despite its outdated design . This design , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art when built , includes tight " right @-@ in / right @-@ out " access with a recommended exit speed of 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) and stop signs on the entrance ramps ; there are no acceleration or deceleration lanes . While the curves are banked for higher speeds , they were designed at half the modern standard . Except for the Golden State Freeway ( I @-@ 5 ) interchange near the river , completed in 1962 , the few structural changes to the freeway north of the river include the closure of the original southbound exit to Fair Oaks Avenue after its location on a curve proved dangerous and the replacement of shrubs in the 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) median with a steel guard rail . Los Angeles paid for reconstruction of the interchange at Hill Street , south of Elysian Park , in the early 1960s to serve the new Dodger Stadium . 
 When the Arroyo Seco Parkway opened , it was the first freeway in the Western United States . It became a new alignment of U.S. Route 66 , and the old routing via Figueroa Street and Colorado Boulevard became U.S. Route 66 Alternate . The southern extension over the Los Angeles River to downtown Los Angeles also carried State Route 11 ( which remained on the old route when US 66 was moved ) and U.S. Routes 6 and 99 ( which followed Avenue 26 and San Fernando Road to the northwest ) . The 1964 renumbering saw US 66 truncated to Pasadena , and SR 11 was moved from Figueroa Street ( which became SR 159 ) to the Pasadena Freeway . Finally , the number was changed to SR 110 in 1981 , when SR 11 between San Pedro and the Santa Monica Freeway ( I @-@ 10 ) became I @-@ 110 . 
 The Arroyo Seco Parkway remains the most direct route between downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena despite its flaws ; the only reasonable freeway alternate ( which trucks must use ) is the Glendale Freeway ( SR 2 ) to the west , which is itself not easily reached by trucks from downtown Los Angeles . The Gold Line light rail , opened in 2003 over the former Santa Fe Railway line , provides an alternate mode for commuters . The state legislature designated the original section , north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct , as a " California Historic Parkway " ( part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945 ) in 1993 ; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway ( SR 163 ) in San Diego . The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999 , and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 . Occidental College hosted the " <unk> Freeway Walk and Bike Ride " on Sunday , June 15 , 2003 , closing the freeway to motor vehicles to " highlight several ongoing or proposed projects within the Arroyo that can improve the quality of life for everyone in the area " .

 = French battleship Jean Bart ( 1911 ) = 
 Jean Bart was the second ship of the Courbet @-@ class battleships , the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy . She was completed before World War I as part of the 1910 naval building programme . She spent the war in the Mediterranean and helped to sink the Austro @-@ Hungarian protected cruiser Zenta on 16 August 1914 . She spent most of the rest of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until she was torpedoed by the submarine U @-@ 12 on 21 December . Even with three compartments flooded , she was able to steam to Malta on her own for repairs that required three and a half months . Upon her return she spent the remainder of the war participating in the Otranto Barrage , in the Adriatic . 
 After the end of World War I she and her sister ship France were sent to the Black Sea to support Allied troops in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War . Jean Bart 's crew mutinied out of sympathy for the Bolsheviks , but the mutiny was put down and she returned to the Mediterranean in 1920 . She was partially modernized twice during the 1920s , but was deemed in too poor condition to be refitted again in the 1930s . Therefore , she was renamed Océan , disarmed and hulked in 1936 and became a harbour training ship in Toulon . The Germans captured her intact when they occupied Toulon in 1942 and used her for testing large shaped charge warheads . She was sunk by Allied bombing in 1944 , but was raised and scrapped in 1945 .

 Jean Bart was 166 metres ( 544 ft 7 in ) long overall . She had a beam of 27 metres ( 88 ft 7 in ) and at full load a draft of 9 @.@ 04 metres ( 29 ft 8 in ) at the bow . She displaced 23 @,@ 475 tonnes ( 23 @,@ 100 long tons ) at standard load and 25 @,@ 579 tonnes ( 25 @,@ 180 long tons ) at full load . She proved to be rather wet in service as she was bow @-@ heavy because of her superimposed turrets forward . 
 Jean Bart had four propellers powered by four Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines , rated at 28 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 20 @,@ 880 kW ) ; twenty @-@ four Belleville water @-@ tube boilers provided steam for her turbines . These boilers were coal @-@ burning with auxiliary oil sprayers . She had a designed speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . She carried up to 2 @,@ 700 long tons ( 2 @,@ 700 t ) of coal and 906 long tons ( 921 t ) of oil and could steam for 4 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 800 km ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Jean Bart 's main armament consisted of twelve 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 in ) Mle 1910 45 @-@ calibre guns mounted in six twin gun turrets , with two turrets superimposed fore and aft , and one on each flank of the ship . For anti @-@ torpedo boat defence she carried twenty @-@ two 138 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) Mle 1910 guns , which were mounted in casemates . Four 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Modèle 1902 Hotchkiss guns were fitted , two on each beam . She was also armed with four 450 @-@ millimetre ( 18 in ) submerged Modèle 1909 torpedo tubes with twelve torpedoes . 
 Jean Bart 's waterline armoured belt extended well below the waterline as the French were concerned about protection from underwater hits . Her main armour was also thinner than that of her British or German counterparts , but covered more area . It was 270 millimetres ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick between the fore and aft turrets and tapered to 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) towards the bow and stern . It extended 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 ft 10 in ) below the normal waterline . Above the main belt was another belt , 180 mm thick , that covered the sides , and the secondary armament , up to the forecastle deck , 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 14 ft 9 in ) deep , between the fore and aft turrets . The conning tower had armour 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick . The main gun turrets had 290 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 4 in ) of armour on their faces , 250 millimetres ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) on their sides and roofs 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick . Their barbettes had 280 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) of armour . There was no anti @-@ torpedo bulkhead although there was a longitudinal bulkhead abreast the machinery spaces that was used either as a coal bunker or left as a void .

 Jean Bart was built by the Arsenal de Brest at Brest . Her keel was laid down on 15 October 1910 and was launched on 22 September 1911 . She was completed on 19 November 1913 and finished her trials before World War I began the following year . Jean Bart escorted France , which was carrying the President of the French Republic , Raymond Poincaré , on a state visit to Saint Petersburg , Russia in July 1914 . They were returning from Russia when World War I began , but made it to France without encountering German ships . 
 Shortly after the start of the war , the commander of the Allied naval forces in the Mediterranean decided to sweep the Adriatic , to surprise the Austrian vessels enforcing a blockade of Montenegro . The Anglo @-@ French force , which included Jean Bart , succeeded in cutting off and sinking the Austro @-@ Hungarian protected cruiser Zenta in an engagement off Antivari on 16 August 1914 , although her accompanying destroyer managed to escape . Jean Bart spent most of the rest of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until she was torpedoed by the submarine U @-@ 12 off Sazan Island on 21 December . The one torpedo struck her in the wine store just before the forward magazine . She was able to steam to Malta on her own for repairs that required three and a half months , but this attack forced the battleships to fall back to either Malta or Bizerte . After the French occupied the neutral Greek island of Corfu in 1916 the ships moved forward to Corfu and Argostoli , but their activities were very limited as many of their crews were used to man anti @-@ submarine ships . In 1918 , she served off Greece . Before the end of the war she was fitted with seven 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 in ) Mle 1897 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in single mounts . These guns were adaptations of the famous French Mle 97 75 mm field gun . 
 In April 1919 , while Jean Bart was helping to defend Sevastopol from the advancing Bolsheviks , her crew mutinied , along with that of the France , but the mutiny collapsed when Vice @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Françoise @-@ Charles Amet agreed to meet the mutineers ' main demand to take the ships home . Three crewmen were sentenced to prison terms upon her return , although the sentences were commuted in 1922 as part of a bargain between Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré and the parties of the Left . The ship returned to Toulon in 1920 and received the first of her two refits between 12 October 1923 and 29 January 1925 . This included replacing one set of boilers with oil @-@ fired boilers , trunking together her two forward funnels , increasing the maximum elevation of the main armament from 12 ° to 23 ° , removal of her bow armour to make her more seaworthy , the installation of a fire @-@ control director , with a 4 @.@ 57 metres ( 15 @.@ 0 ft ) rangefinder , atop the new tripod foremast , and the replacement of her Mle 1897 AA guns with four Mle 1918 guns and 24 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine guns . 
 Jean Bart was refitted again between 7 August 1929 and 29 September 1931 . This was much more extensive than her earlier refit as another set of boilers was converted to oil @-@ firing , her direct @-@ drive cruising turbines were replaced by geared turbines and her fire @-@ control systems were comprehensively upgraded . A large cruiser @-@ type fire @-@ control director was added atop the foremast with a 4 @.@ 57 @-@ m coincidence rangefinder and a 3 @-@ metre ( 9 ft 10 in ) stereo rangefinder . The rangefinder above the conning tower was replaced by a duplex unit carrying two 4 @.@ 57 @-@ m rangefinders and another 4 @.@ 57 @-@ m rangefinder was added in an armoured hood next to the main mast . Two directors for the secondary guns were added on the navigation bridge , each with a 2 @-@ metre ( 6 ft 7 in ) coincidence rangefinder . A 8 @.@ 2 metres ( 26 ft 11 in ) rangefinder was added to the roof of ' B ' turret , the second one from the bow . Her Mle 1897 AA guns were exchanged for Mle 1918 guns and they were provided with three 1 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 4 ft 11 in ) rangefinders , one on top of the duplex unit on the conning tower , one on ' B ' turret and one in the aft superstructure . Her condition was poor enough that she was not thought to be worth the expense of a third refit like those her sisters were given . She was hulked , disarmed and became a harbour training ship in 1936 . She was renamed Océan that year to free her name for use by the new Richelieu @-@ class battleship Jean Bart then being constructed . 
 The new Océan was captured intact by the Germans on 27 November 1942 , the day the French Fleet was scuttled . The Germans used her for experiments with very large shaped charge warheads as delivered by the <unk> composite aircraft . She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 and later raised for scrapping beginning on 14 December 1945 .

Checking out the systems , the Doctor passes his fifth incarnation ( Peter Davison ) doing the same thing . The Tenth Doctor recognises his past self and is overjoyed to see him , gently poking fun of his particular eccentricities , such as the stick of celery on his lapel and the unneeded glasses he sometimes wears . The Fifth Doctor is annoyed , believing his counterpart to be a fan who has broken into the TARDIS . 
 The Fifth Doctor discovers that two TARDISes have merged , a paradox that will cause a massive black hole . The Tenth Doctor counters it with a supernova , a solution he remembers seeing himself perform in this same incident ( a predestination paradox ) ; the Fifth Doctor realises that the Tenth really is his future self . The Tenth reminisces as the Fifth begins to fade into a separate timeline : 
 " You know , I loved being you . Back when I first started , at the very beginning , I was always trying to be old and grumpy and important — like you do , when you 're young . And then I was you . And it was all dashing about and playing cricket and my voice going all squeaky when I shouted . I still do that , the voice thing , I got that from you . Oh , and the trainers . And ... " [ putting his glasses on ] " snap ! ' Cos you know what , Doctor ? You were my Doctor . " 
 The two Doctors say goodbye : " To days to come , " says the Fifth , raising his hat . " All my love to long ago , " replies the Tenth with a bow . As the time streams split , the Fifth Doctor calls out , warning the Tenth to put his shields up . But it is too late ; the Titanic collides with the TARDIS , leading the narrative into " Voyage of the Damned " .

 The Fifth Doctor mentions " that LINDA lot " , a reference to the Doctor 's fan club from " Love & Monsters " . Both Doctors describe the paradox as " wibbly @-@ wobbly , timey @-@ wimey , " which is the way the Tenth Doctor describes time to Sally Sparrow in " Blink " . The Tenth Doctor , asking when the Fifth Doctor originates , refers to companions Nyssa and Tegan , adversaries Cybermen and the Mara , and " Time Lords in funny hats . " The Fifth inquires about the Master , wondering if he still has " that rubbish beard " ( which his prior incarnations sported ) . The Tenth replies that he actually got married .

 The episode was first conceived by executive producers Julie Gardner and Russell T Davies , who decided to air an interstitial scene for Children in Need 2007 . Gardner asked Steven Moffat to write the special , with the stipulations the scene could be shot in one day and one set , and require no CGI effects . Peter Davison was approached to reprise his role as the Fifth Doctor in July 2007 , and accepted the role to impress his children . The episode was officially announced by the BBC on 21 October . 
 Moffat 's script started by repeating Martha 's departure . The script indicated that " this time , we stay with the Doctor . As before ... the Doctor takes a moment , then slam the controls , " and described the Fifth Doctor as having a " frock coat , cricket jersey , and a stick of celery on his lapel " . Moffat included several references to Fifth Doctor stories in his script : the Tenth Doctor commented about the Fifth Doctor 's attire and his disuse of the sonic screwdriver , saying : " Ooh , I 'm the Doctor , I can save the universe with a kettle and a piece of string and ooh , look at me , I 'm wearing a vegetable . " A line about the effects of the paradox the TARDIS collision had caused gave an explanation of why the Fifth Doctor looked far older than normal , thus getting around the fact that Peter Davison had left the role over twenty years before . And near the end of the episode , he refers to Tegan Jovanka , Nyssa , the Cybermen stories <unk> and The Five Doctors , the Mara serials Kinda and <unk> , the Time Lords ' " funny hats " from Arc of Infinity , and the various Ainley Master stories during Davison 's tenure . 
 " Time Crash " was filmed at Upper Boat Studios in Upper Boat , Cardiff , as part of the fourth recording block of the fourth series ( which included " Partners in Crime " ) on 7 October 2007 . Graeme Harper , director of Davison 's final serial The Caves of Androzani , directed the episode . To replicate the Fifth Doctor 's attire , the production team borrowed items from the Doctor Who exhibition in Blackpool and knitted a new cricket jumper to reflect the style worn from <unk> to Warriors of the Deep . The accompanying Doctor Who Confidential episode reveals that the trousers Davison wore in " Time Crash " were the same pair that Colin Baker wore in his early scenes in The Twin Dilemma .

 Previous Doctor Who charity specials transmitted over the years include Dimensions in Time , Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death and the untitled 2005 special . The anniversary special The Five Doctors was broadcast on Children in Need night for its United Kingdom premier broadcast . 
 The Children in Need telethon was the most @-@ watched television programme of the night , with a final rating of 9 @.@ 6 million viewers , and figures peaked between 8 : 15pm and 8 : 30pm , when " Time Crash " was aired , with a total of 11 @.@ 0 million viewers . The episode was therefore the most @-@ viewed since the show 's revival in 2005 , surpassing the revival 's premiere , " Rose " , which achieved a rating of 10 @.@ 8 million viewers . Donations also peaked during the episode 's airing . When the episode was replayed four hours later , it garnered an audience of 2 @.@ 5 million viewers . This rating was later beaten by " Voyage of the Damned " , which received 13 @.@ 3 million viewers . 
 The episode was positively reviewed by critics . Martin Conaghan of TV Squad expressed the belief that the episode was " the highlight of the evening " . He mainly complimented Moffat for his writing ; he said that Moffat " has a knack for clever paradox @-@ style stories , and managed to capture a fantastic little snippet of emotion , harking back to the early days of Doctor Who , " specifically praising the farewell scene . Dek Hogan of Digital Spy mirrored Conaghan 's beliefs ; he called Moffat 's script " witty " and hoped that Davison would return to film a full @-@ length episode . 
 = Charles I of England = 
 Charles I ( 19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649 ) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England , Scotland , and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649 . 
 Charles was the second son of King James VI of Scotland , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 , he moved to England , where he spent much of the rest of his life . He became heir apparent to the English , Irish and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother , Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , in 1612 . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight @-@ month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations . Two years later , he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead . 
 After his succession , Charles quarrelled with the Parliament of England , which sought to curb his royal prerogative . Charles believed in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience . Many of his subjects opposed his policies , in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent , and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch . His religious policies , coupled with his marriage to a Roman Catholic , generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed groups such as the Puritans and Calvinists , who thought his views too Catholic . He supported high church ecclesiastics , such as Richard Montagu and William Laud , and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years ' War . His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops ' Wars , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall . 
 From 1642 , Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War . After his defeat in 1645 , he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament . Charles refused to accept his captors ' demands for a constitutional monarchy , and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647 . Re @-@ imprisoned on the Isle of Wight , Charles forged an alliance with Scotland , but by the end of 1648 Oliver Cromwell 's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England . Charles was tried , convicted , and executed for high treason in January 1649 . The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared . The monarchy was restored to Charles 's son , Charles II , in 1660 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 The second son of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark , Charles was born in Dunfermline Palace , Fife , on 19 November 1600 . At a Protestant ceremony in the Chapel Royal at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 23 December 1600 , he was baptised by David Lindsay , Bishop of Ross , and created Duke of Albany , the traditional title of the second son of the King of Scotland , with the subsidiary titles of Marquess of Ormond , Earl of Ross and Lord <unk> . 
 James VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen Elizabeth I of England , and when she died childless in March 1603 , he became King of England as James I. Charles was a weak and sickly infant , and while his parents and older siblings left for England in April and early June that year , due to his fragile health , he remained in Scotland with his father 's friend Lord Fyvie , appointed as his guardian . 
 By 1604 , when Charles was three and a half , he was able to walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance , and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family . In mid @-@ July 1604 , Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend most of the rest of his life . In England , Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth , Lady Carey , the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey , who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help strengthen his weak ankles . His speech development was also slow , and he retained a stammer , or hesitant speech , for the rest of his life . 
 In January 1605 , Charles was created Duke of York , as is customary in the case of the English sovereign 's second son , and made a Knight of the Bath . Thomas Murray , a Presbyterian Scot , was appointed as a tutor . Charles learnt the usual subjects of classics , languages , mathematics and religion . In 1611 , he was made a Knight of the Garter . 
 Eventually , Charles apparently conquered his physical infirmity , which might have been caused by rickets . He became an adept horseman and marksman , and took up fencing . Even so , his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother , Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate . However , in early November 1612 , Henry died at the age of 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid ( or possibly porphyria ) . Charles , who turned 12 two weeks later , became heir apparent . As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign , Charles automatically gained several titles ( including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay ) . Four years later , in November 1616 , he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester . 
 = = Heir apparent = = 
 In 1613 , his sister Elizabeth married Frederick V , Elector Palatine , and moved to Heidelberg . In 1617 , the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria , a Catholic , was elected king of Bohemia . The following year , the Bohemians rebelled , <unk> the Catholic governors . In August 1619 , the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch Frederick V , who was leader of the Protestant Union , while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election . Frederick 's acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years ' War . The conflict , originally confined to Bohemia , spiralled into a wider European war , which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants . In 1620 , Charles 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Frederick V , was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands . James , however , had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand 's niece , Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain , and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe . 
 Unfortunately for James , negotiation with Spain proved generally unpopular , both with the public and with James 's court . The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism , and thus , when called by James in 1621 , the members hoped for an enforcement of recusancy laws , a naval campaign against Spain , and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales . James 's Lord Chancellor , Francis Bacon , was impeached before the House of Lords for corruption . The impeachment was the first since 1459 without the king 's official sanction in the form of a bill of attainder . The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters : the Duke of Buckingham , Archbishop Laud , and the Earl of Strafford . James insisted that the House of Commons be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs , while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons ' walls , demanding war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales . Charles , like his father , considered the discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father 's royal prerogative . In January 1622 , James dissolved Parliament , angry at what he perceived as the members ' impudence and intransigence . 
 Charles and the Duke of Buckingham , James 's favourite and a man who had great influence over the prince , travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long @-@ pending Spanish match . In the end , however , the trip was an embarrassing failure . The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel , and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match . The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws , which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament , and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty . A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares , the Spanish chief minister , and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally . When Charles returned to London in October , without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome , he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain . 
 With the encouragement of his Protestant advisers , James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 so that he could request subsidies for a war . Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer , Lionel Cranfield , 1st Earl of Middlesex , who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had . James told Buckingham he was a fool , and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool . An under @-@ funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate , but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast . 
 By 1624 , James was growing ill , and as a result was finding it difficult to control Parliament . By the time of his death in March 1625 , Charles and the Duke of Buckingham had already assumed de facto control of the kingdom . 
 = = Early reign = = 
 With the failure of the Spanish match , Charles and Buckingham turned their attention to France . On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen @-@ year @-@ old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris . Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain . The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury . Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony , to forestall any opposition . Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king 's marriage to a Roman Catholic , fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England . Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions , he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with Louis XIII of France . Moreover , the treaty placed under French command an English naval force that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle . Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey , but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony . 
 Distrust of Charles 's religious policies increased with his support of a controversial anti @-@ Calvinist ecclesiastic , Richard Montagu , who was in disrepute among the Puritans . In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose ( 1624 ) , a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel , Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination , the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God . Anti @-@ Calvinists – known as <unk> – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will . Arminian divines had been one of the few sources of support for Charles 's proposed Spanish marriage . With the support of King James , Montagu produced another pamphlet , entitled <unk> Caesarem , in 1625 shortly after the old king 's death and Charles 's accession . To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament , Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains , increasing many Puritans ' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism . 
 Rather than direct involvement in the European land war , the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World , hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets . Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £ 140 @,@ 000 , which was an insufficient sum for Charles 's war plans . Moreover , the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of tonnage and poundage ( two varieties of customs duties ) to a period of one year , although previous sovereigns since Henry VI of England had been granted the right for life . In this manner , Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full @-@ scale review of customs revenue . The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its first reading . Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained , Charles continued to collect the duties . 
 A poorly conceived and executed naval expedition against Spain under the leadership of Buckingham went badly , and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the duke . In May 1626 , Charles nominated Buckingham as Chancellor of Cambridge University in a show of support , and had two members who had spoken against Buckingham – Dudley Digges and Sir John Eliot – arrested at the door of the House . The Commons was outraged by the imprisonment of two of their members , and after about a week in custody , both were released . On 12 June 1626 , the Commons launched a direct protestation attacking Buckingham , stating , " We protest before your Majesty and the whole world that until this great person be removed from <unk> with the great affairs of state , we are out of hope of any good success ; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will , through his <unk> , be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise , as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given . " Despite Parliament 's protests , however , Charles refused to dismiss his friend , dismissing Parliament instead . 
 Meanwhile , domestic quarrels between Charles and Henrietta Maria were souring the early years of their marriage . Disputes over her jointure , appointments to her household , and the practice of her religion culminated in the king expelling the vast majority of her French attendants in August 1626 . Despite Charles 's agreement to provide the French with English ships as a condition of marrying Henrietta Maria , in 1627 he launched an attack on the French coast to defend the Huguenots at La Rochelle . The action , led by Buckingham , was ultimately unsuccessful . Buckingham 's failure to protect the Huguenots – and his retreat from Saint @-@ Martin @-@ de @-@ Ré – spurred Louis XIII 's siege of La Rochelle and furthered the English Parliament 's and people 's detestation of the duke . 
 Charles provoked further unrest by trying to raise money for the war through a " forced loan " : a tax levied without parliamentary consent . In November 1627 , the test case in the King 's Bench , the " Five Knights ' Case " , found that the king had a prerogative right to imprison without trial those who refused to pay the forced loan . Summoned again in March 1628 , on 26 May Parliament adopted a Petition of Right , calling upon the king to acknowledge that he could not levy taxes without Parliament 's consent , not impose martial law on civilians , not imprison them without due process , and not quarter troops in their homes . Charles assented to the petition on 7 June , but by the end of the month he had prorogued Parliament and re @-@ asserted his right to collect customs duties without authorisation from Parliament . 
 On 23 August 1628 , Buckingham was assassinated . Charles was deeply distressed . According to Edward Hyde , 1st Earl of Clarendon , he " threw himself upon his bed , lamenting with much passion and with abundance of tears " . He remained grieving in his room for two days . In contrast , the public rejoiced at Buckingham 's death , which accentuated the gulf between the court and the nation , and between the Crown and the Commons . Although the death of Buckingham effectively ended the war with Spain and eliminated his leadership as an issue , it did not end the conflicts between Charles and Parliament . It did , however , coincide with an improvement in Charles 's relationship with his wife , and by November 1628 their old quarrels were at an end . Perhaps Charles 's emotional ties were transferred from Buckingham to Henrietta Maria . She became pregnant for the first time , and the bond between them grew ever stronger . Together , they embodied an image of virtue and family life , and their court became a model of formality and morality . 
 = = Personal rule = = 
 = = = Parliament prorogued = = = 
 In January 1629 , Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament , which had been prorogued in June 1628 , with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue . Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles 's policies in light of the case of John Rolle , a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage . Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right . When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March , members held the Speaker , Sir John Finch , down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism , Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber . The provocation was too much for Charles , who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders , including Sir John Eliot , imprisoned over the matter , thereby turning the men into martyrs , and giving popular cause to their protest . 
 Shortly after the prorogation , without the means in the foreseeable future to raise funds from Parliament for a European war , or the influence of Buckingham , Charles made peace with France and Spain . The following eleven years , during which Charles ruled England without a Parliament , are referred to as the personal rule or the " eleven years ' tyranny " . Ruling without Parliament was not exceptional , and was supported by precedent . Only Parliament , however , could legally raise taxes , and without it Charles 's capacity to acquire funds for his treasury was limited to his customary rights and prerogatives . 
 = = = Finances = = = 
 A large fiscal deficit had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckingham 's short lived campaigns against both Spain and France , there was little financial capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas . Throughout his reign Charles was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister , Elizabeth , and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate . England was still the least taxed country in Europe , with no official excise and no regular direct taxation . To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament , Charles resurrected an all @-@ but @-@ forgotten law called the " <unk> of Knighthood " , in abeyance for over a century , which required any man who earned £ 40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king 's coronation to be knighted . Relying on this old statute , Charles fined individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626 . 
 The chief tax imposed by Charles was a feudal levy known as ship money , which proved even more unpopular , and lucrative , than poundage and tonnage before it . Previously , collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars , and only on coastal regions . Charles , however , argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom . Ship money , paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy , provided between £ 150 @,@ 000 to £ 200 @,@ 000 annually between 1634 and 1638 , after which yields declined . Opposition to ship money steadily grew , but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king 's prerogative , though some of them had reservations . The prosecution of John Hampden for non @-@ payment in 1637 – 38 provided a platform for popular protest , and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7 – 5 . 
 The king also derived money through the granting of monopolies , despite a statute forbidding such action , which , though inefficient , raised an estimated £ 100 @,@ 000 a year in the late 1630s . One such monopoly was for soap , referred to as popish soap . Charles also raised funds from the Scottish nobility , at the price of considerable acrimony , by the Act of Revocation ( 1625 ) , whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility since 1540 were revoked , with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent . In addition , the boundaries of the royal forests in England were restored to their ancient limits as part of a scheme to maximise income by exploiting the land and fining land users within the reasserted boundaries for encroachment . The focus of the programme was <unk> and sale of forest lands for conversion to pasture and arable farming , or in the case of the Forest of Dean , development for the iron industry . <unk> frequently caused riots and disturbances including those known as the Western Rising . 
 The practice of granting extensive monopolies agitated the public , who were forced to pay higher prices by the monopoly holders . Against the background of this unrest , Charles faced bankruptcy in the summer of 1640 as parliament continued to refuse new taxes . The City of London , preoccupied with its own grievances further refused to make any loans to the king , and likewise he was unable to subscribe any foreign loans . In this extremity , Charles seized the money held in trust at the mint of the Exchequer in the tower of London . The royal mint held a monopoly on the exchange of foreign coin and from this the mint operated as a bank containing much capital of the merchants and goldsmiths of the city . In July , Charles seized all £ 130 @,@ 000 of this money , and in August he followed it up by seizing all the stocks of pepper held by the East India Company , and selling it at distress prices . 
 = = Religious conflicts = = 
 Throughout Charles 's reign , the issue of how far the English Reformation should progress was constantly brought to the forefront of political debate . Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual 's ability to reject or accept salvation , and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its Calvinist opponents . Charles 's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism , and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from Calvinism in a more traditional and sacramental direction , were perceived by Puritans as irreligious tendencies . In addition , Charles 's Protestant subjects followed news of the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles 's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively . 
 In 1633 , Charles appointed William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury . Together , they began a series of anti @-@ Calvinist reforms that attempted to ensure religious uniformity by restricting non @-@ conformist preachers , insisting that the liturgy be celebrated as prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer , organising the internal architecture of English churches so as to emphasise the sacrament of the altar , and re @-@ issuing King James 's Declaration of Sports , which permitted secular activities on the sabbath . The <unk> for <unk> , an organisation that bought benefices and advowsons so that Puritans could be appointed to them , was dissolved . To prosecute those who opposed his reforms , Laud used the two most powerful courts in the land , the Court of High Commission and the Court of Star Chamber . The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views , and became unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen . For example , in 1637 William Prynne , Henry Burton and John <unk> were pilloried , whipped and mutilated by cropping and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti @-@ episcopal pamphlets . 
 When Charles attempted to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties . Although born in Scotland , Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom ; his first visit since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633 . To the dismay of the Scots , who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice , Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted in the Anglican rite . In 1637 , the king ordered the use of a new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English Book of Common Prayer , without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the Kirk . Although written , under Charles 's direction , by Scottish bishops , many Scots resisted it , seeing the new prayer book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland . On 23 July , riots erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer book 's usage , and unrest spread throughout the Kirk . The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the National Covenant , whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were not authorised by Kirk and Parliament . When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in November 1638 , it condemned the new prayer book , abolished episcopal church government by bishops , and adopted Presbyterian government by elders and deacons . 
 = = = Bishops ' Wars = = = 
 Charles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority , precipitating the First Bishops ' War in 1639 . Charles did not seek subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war , but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed , on the border of Scotland . Charles 's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces , whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots . In the Treaty of Berwick , Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters ' interim government , albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called . 
 Charles 's military failure in the First Bishops ' War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise finance from Spain , while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives , led to the public humiliation of the Battle of the Downs , where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet off the coast of Kent in sight of the impotent English navy . 
 Charles continued peace negotiations with the Scots in a bid to gain time before launching a new military campaign . Because of his financial weakness , he was forced to call Parliament into session in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture . Both English and Irish parliaments were summoned in the early months of 1640 . In March 1640 , the Irish Parliament duly voted in a subsidy of £ 180 @,@ 000 with the promise to raise an army 9 @,@ 000 strong by the end of May . In the English general election in March , however , court candidates fared badly , and Charles 's dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate . The earls of Northumberland and Strafford attempted to broker a compromise whereby the king would agree to forfeit ship money in exchange for £ 650 @,@ 000 ( although the cost of the coming war was estimated at around £ 1 million ) . Nevertheless , this alone was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons . The Parliamentarians ' calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles , who still retained the support of the House of Lords . Despite the protests of Northumberland , the Short Parliament ( as it came to be known ) was dissolved in May 1640 , less than a month after it assembled . 
 By this stage Strafford , Lord Deputy of Ireland since 1632 , had emerged as Charles 's right @-@ hand man and together with Laud , pursued a policy of " Thorough " that aimed to make central royal authority more efficient and effective at the expense of local or anti @-@ government interests . Although originally a critic of the king , Strafford defected to royal service in 1628 ( due in part to Buckingham 's persuasion ) , and had since emerged , alongside Laud , as the most influential of Charles 's ministers . 
 Bolstered by the failure of the English Short Parliament , the Scottish Parliament declared itself capable of governing without the king 's consent and , in August 1640 , the Covenanter army moved into the English county of Northumberland . Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland , who was the king 's commander @-@ in @-@ chief , Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces , despite Strafford being ill himself with a combination of gout and dysentery . The Scottish soldiery , many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years ' War , had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts , and met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne where , at the Battle of Newburn , they defeated the English forces and occupied the city , as well as the neighbouring county of Durham . 
 As demands for a parliament grew , Charles took the unusual step of summoning a great council of peers . By the time it met , on 24 September at York , Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament . After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November , he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime . They recommended making peace . A cessation of arms , although not a final settlement , was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon , signed in October 1640 . The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £ 850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled , which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces . Consequently , Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament . Once again , Charles 's supporters fared badly at the polls . Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November , over 350 were opposed to the king .

 = = = Tensions escalate = = = 
 The Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament . It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king 's leading counsellors of high treason . Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November ; Laud was impeached on 18 December ; Lord Keeper Finch was impeached the following day , and he consequently fled to the Hague with Charles 's permission on 21 December . To prevent the king from dissolving it at will , Parliament passed the Triennial Act , which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years , and permitted the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so . The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill , and so to secure the latter , Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641 . 
 Strafford had become the principal target of the Parliamentarians , particularly John Pym , and he went on trial for high treason on 22 March 1641 . However , the key allegation by Sir Henry Vane that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym 's case collapsed . Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder , which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death . 
 Charles assured Strafford that " upon the word of a king you shall not suffer in life , honour or fortune " , and the attainder could not succeed if Charles withheld assent . Furthermore , many members and most peers were opposed to the attainder , not wishing , in the words of one , to " commit murder with the sword of justice " . However , increased tensions and an attempted coup by royalist army officers in support of Strafford and in which Charles was involved began to sway the issue . The Commons passed the bill on 20 April by a large margin ( 204 in favour , 59 opposed , and 230 abstained ) , and the Lords acquiesced ( by 26 votes to 19 , with 79 absent ) in May . Charles , fearing for the safety of his family in the face of unrest , assented reluctantly on 9 May after consulting his judges and bishops . Strafford was beheaded three days later . 
 On 3 May , Parliament 's Protestation had attacked the " wicked counsels " of Charles 's " arbitrary and tyrannical government " ; while those who signed the petition undertook to defend the king 's " person , honour and estate " , they also swore to preserve " the true reformed religion " , parliament , and the " rights and liberties of the subjects " . Within a week , Charles had assented to an unprecedented Act , which forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without Parliament 's consent . In the following months , ship money , fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful , and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished . All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and <unk> Act . The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy , but these failed in the Lords . 
 Charles had made important concessions in England , and temporarily improved his position in Scotland by securing the favour of the Scots on a visit from August to November 1641 during which he conceded to the official establishment of Presbyterianism . However , following an attempted royalist coup in Scotland , known as " The Incident " , Charles 's credibility was significantly undermined . 
 = = = Irish rebellion = = = 
 In Ireland , the population was split into three main socio @-@ political groups : the Gaelic Irish , who were Catholic ; the Old English , who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic ; and the New English , who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters . Strafford 's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue , but had done so by heavy @-@ handedly imposing order . He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament , while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a <unk> Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians . As a result , all three groups had become disaffected . Strafford 's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him . In a similar manner to the English Parliament , the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles . They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors , and that , moreover , a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance . Strafford 's fall from power weakened Charles 's influence in Ireland . The dissolution of the Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford 's imprisonment , until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army at the end of Strafford 's trial . Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant , particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster , coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England , sowed the seeds of rebellion . When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English , in late October 1641 , the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king . 
 In November 1641 , the House of Commons passed the Grand Remonstrance , a long list of grievances against actions by Charles 's ministers committed since the beginning of his reign ( that were asserted to be part of a grand Catholic conspiracy of which the king was an unwitting member ) , but it was in many ways a step too far by Pym and passed by only 11 votes – 159 to 148 . Furthermore , the Remonstrance had very little support in the House of Lords , which the Remonstrance attacked . The tension was heightened by news of the Irish rebellion , coupled with inaccurate rumours of Charles 's complicity . Throughout November , a series of alarmist pamphlets published stories of atrocities in Ireland , which included massacres of New English settlers by the native Irish who could not be controlled by the Old English lords . Rumours of " papist " conspiracies in England circulated the kingdom , and English anti @-@ Catholic opinion was strengthened , damaging Charles 's reputation and authority . 
 The English Parliament distrusted Charles 's motivations when he called for funds to put down the Irish rebellion ; many members of the Commons suspected that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself . Pym 's Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king , but it did not have the support of the Lords , let alone Charles . Instead , the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance , which they claimed did not require royal assent . The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king . In an attempt to strengthen his position , Charles generated great antipathy in London , which was already fast falling into anarchy , when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford , an infamous , albeit efficient , career officer . When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels , the king decided to take drastic action . 
 = = = Five members = = = 
 Charles suspected , probably correctly , that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots . On 3 January , Charles directed Parliament to give up five members of the Commons – Pym , John Hampden , Denzil Holles , William Strode and Sir Arthur <unk> – and one peer – Lord Mandeville – on the grounds of high treason . When Parliament refused , it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force , which Charles intended to carry out personally . However , news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him , and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January 1642 . Having displaced the Speaker , William Lenthall , from his chair , the king asked him where the MPs had fled . Lenthall , on his knees , famously replied , " May it please your Majesty , I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me , whose servant I am here . " Charles abjectly declared " all my birds have flown " , and was forced to retire , empty @-@ handed . 
 The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles . No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons , and his unprecedented invasion of the chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege . In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters ' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder . 
 Parliament quickly seized London , and Charles fled the capital for Hampton Court Palace on 10 January 1642 , moving two days later to Windsor Castle . After sending his wife and eldest daughter to safety abroad in February , he travelled northwards , hoping to seize the military arsenal at Hull . To his dismay , he was rebuffed by the town 's Parliamentary governor , Sir John Hotham , who refused him entry in April , and Charles was forced to withdraw . 
 = = English Civil War = = 
 In mid @-@ 1642 , both sides began to arm . Charles raised an army using the medieval method of commission of array , and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia . Following futile negotiations , Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642 . At the start of the First English Civil War , Charles 's forces controlled roughly the Midlands , Wales , the West Country and northern England . He set up his court at Oxford . Parliament controlled London , the south @-@ east and East Anglia , as well as the English navy . 
 After a few skirmishes , the opposing forces met in earnest at Edgehill , on 23 October 1642 . Charles 's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine disagreed with the battle strategy of the royalist commander Lord Lindsey , and Charles sided with Rupert . Lindsey resigned , leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth . Rupert 's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks , but instead of swiftly returning to the field , rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train . Lindsey , acting as a colonel , was wounded and bled to death without medical attention . The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded . 
 In his own words , the experience of battle had left Charles " exceedingly and deeply grieved " . He regrouped at Oxford , turning down Rupert 's suggestion of an immediate attack on London . After a week , he set out for the capital on 3 November , capturing Brentford on the way while simultaneously continuing to negotiate with civic and parliamentary delegations . At Turnham Green on the outskirts of London , the royalist army met resistance from the city militia , and faced with a numerically superior force , Charles ordered a retreat . He over @-@ wintered in Oxford , strengthening the city 's defences and preparing for the next season 's campaign . Peace talks between the two sides collapsed in April . 
 The war continued indecisively over the next couple of years , and Henrietta Maria returned to Britain for 17 months from February 1643 . After Rupert captured Bristol in July 1643 , Charles visited the port city and lay siege to Gloucester , further up the river Severn . His plan to undermine the city walls failed due to heavy rain , and on the approach of a parliamentary relief force , Charles lifted the siege and withdrew to Sudeley Castle . The parliamentary army turned back towards London , and Charles set off in pursuit . The two armies met at Newbury , Berkshire , on 20 September . Just as at Edgehill , the battle stalemated at nightfall , and the armies disengaged . In January 1644 , Charles summoned a Parliament at Oxford , which was attended by about 40 peers and 118 members of the Commons ; all told , the Oxford Parliament , which sat until March 1645 , was supported by the majority of peers and about a third of the Commons . Charles became disillusioned by the assembly 's ineffectiveness , calling it a " mongrel " in private letters to his wife . 
 In 1644 , Charles remained in the southern half of England while Rupert rode north to relieve Newark and York , which were under threat from parliamentary and Scottish Covenanter armies . Charles was victorious at the battle of <unk> Bridge in late June , but the royalists in the north were defeated at the battle of Marston Moor just a few days later . The king continued his campaign in the south , encircling and disarming the parliamentary army of the Earl of Essex . Returning northwards to his base at Oxford , he fought at Newbury for a second time before the winter closed in ; the battle ended indecisively . Attempts to negotiate a settlement over the winter , while both sides re @-@ armed and re @-@ organised , were again unsuccessful . 
 At the battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645 , Rupert 's horsemen again mounted a successful charge , against the flank of Parliament 's New Model Army , but Charles 's troops elsewhere on the field were pushed back by the opposing forces . Charles , attempting to rally his men , rode forward but as he did so , Lord Carnwath seized his bridle and pulled him back , fearing for the king 's safety . Carnwath 's action was misinterpreted by the royalist soldiers as a signal to move back , leading to a collapse of their position . The military balance tipped decisively in favour of Parliament . There followed a series of defeats for the royalists , and then the Siege of Oxford , from which Charles escaped ( disguised as a servant ) in April 1646 . He put himself into the hands of the Scottish Presbyterian army besieging Newark , and was taken northwards to Newcastle upon Tyne . After nine months of negotiations , the Scots finally arrived at an agreement with the English Parliament : in exchange for £ 100 @,@ 000 , and the promise of more money in the future , the Scots withdrew from Newcastle and delivered Charles to the parliamentary commissioners in January 1647 . 
 = = = Captivity = = = 
 Parliament held Charles under house arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army . By this time , mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament , which favoured army disbandment and Presbyterianism , and the New Model Army , which was primarily officered by Independent non @-@ conformists who sought a greater political role . Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions , and apparently viewed Joyce 's actions as an opportunity rather than a threat . He was taken first to Newmarket , at his own suggestion , and then transferred to Oatlands and subsequently Hampton Court , while more ultimately fruitless negotiations took place . By November , he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape – perhaps to France , Southern England or to Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed , near the Scottish border . He fled Hampton Court on 11 November , and from the shores of Southampton Water made contact with Colonel Robert Hammond , Parliamentary Governor of the Isle of Wight , whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic . Hammond , however , confined Charles in Carisbrooke Castle and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody . 
 From Carisbrooke , Charles continued to try to bargain with the various parties . In direct contrast to his previous conflict with the Scottish Kirk , on 26 December 1647 he signed a secret treaty with the Scots . Under the agreement , called the " Engagement " , the Scots undertook to invade England on Charles 's behalf and restore him to the throne on condition that Presbyterianism be established in England for three years . 
 The royalists rose in May 1648 , igniting the Second Civil War , and as agreed with Charles , the Scots invaded England . Uprisings in Kent , Essex , and Cumberland , and a rebellion in South Wales , were put down by the New Model Army , and with the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Preston in August 1648 , the royalists lost any chance of winning the war . 
 Charles 's only recourse was to return to negotiations , which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight . On 5 December 1648 , Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king , but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power . Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November , and placed in the custody of the army the following day . In Pride 's Purge on 6 and 7 December , the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride , while others stayed away voluntarily . The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament . It was effectively a military coup . 
 = = Trial = = 
 Charles was moved to Hurst Castle at the end of 1648 , and thereafter to Windsor Castle . In January 1649 , the Rump House of Commons indicted him on a charge of treason , which was rejected by the House of Lords . The idea of trying a king was a novel one . The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England – Henry Rolle , Oliver St John and John Wilde – all opposed the indictment as unlawful . The Rump Commons declared itself capable of legislating alone , passed a bill creating a separate court for Charles 's trial , and declared the bill an act without the need for royal assent . The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 commissioners , but many either refused to serve or chose to stay away . Only 68 ( all firm Parliamentarians ) attended Charles 's trial on charges of high treason and " other high crimes " that began on 20 January 1649 in Westminster Hall . John Bradshaw acted as President of the Court , and the prosecution was led by the Solicitor General , John Cook . 
 Charles was accused of treason against England by using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of the country . The charge stated that he , " for accomplishment of such his designs , and for the protecting of himself and his adherents in his and their wicked practices , to the same ends hath <unk> and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament , and the people therein represented " , and that the " wicked designs , wars , and evil practices of him , the said Charles Stuart , have been , and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will , power , and pretended prerogative to himself and his family , against the public interest , common right , liberty , justice , and peace of the people of this nation . " Reflecting the modern concept of command responsibility , the indictment held him " guilty of all the treasons , murders , <unk> , burnings , spoils , <unk> , damages and mischiefs to this nation , acted and committed in the said wars , or occasioned thereby . " An estimated 300 @,@ 000 people , or 6 % of the population , died during the war . 
 Over the first three days of the trial , whenever Charles was asked to plead , he refused , stating his objection with the words : " I would know by what power I am called hither , by what lawful authority ... ? " He claimed that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch , that his own authority to rule had been given to him by God and by the traditional laws of England , and that the power wielded by those trying him was only that of force of arms . Charles insisted that the trial was illegal , explaining that , 
 no earthly power can justly call me ( who am your King ) in question as a delinquent ... this day 's proceeding cannot be warranted by God 's laws ; for , on the contrary , the authority of obedience unto Kings is clearly warranted , and strictly commanded in both the Old and New Testament ... for the law of this land , I am no less confident , that no learned lawyer will affirm that an impeachment can lie against the King , they all going in his name : and one of their maxims is , that the King can do no wrong ... the higher House is totally excluded ; and for the House of Commons , it is too well known that the major part of them are detained or deterred from sitting ... the arms I took up were only to defend the fundamental laws of this kingdom against those who have supposed my power hath totally changed the ancient government . 
 The court , by contrast , challenged the doctrine of sovereign immunity , and proposed that " the King of England was not a person , but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern ' by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise ' . " 
 At the end of the third day , Charles was removed from the court , which then heard over 30 witnesses against the king in his absence over the next two days , and on 26 January condemned him to death . The following day , the king was brought before a public session of the commission , declared guilty and sentenced . Fifty @-@ nine of the commissioners signed Charles 's death warrant . 
 = = Execution = = 
 Charles 's beheading was scheduled for Tuesday , 30 January 1649 . Two of his children remained in England under the control of the Parliamentarians : Elizabeth and Henry . They were permitted to visit him on 29 January , and he bade them a tearful farewell . The following morning , he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear : " the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake , which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear . I would have no such imputation . " 
 He walked under guard from St James 's Palace , where he had been confined , to the Palace of Whitehall , where an execution scaffold was erected in front of the Banqueting House . Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers , and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold . He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford : " An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect , is punished now by an unjust sentence on me . " He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any , " but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government ... It is not their having a share in the government ; that is nothing appertaining unto them . A subject and a sovereign are clean different things . " He continued , " I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown , where no disturbance can be . " 
 At about 2 : 00 p.m. , Charles put his head on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready by stretching out his hands ; he was then beheaded with one clean stroke . According to observer Philip Henry , a moan " as I never heard before and desire I may never hear again " rose from the assembled crowd , some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in the king 's blood as a memento . 
 The executioner was masked and disguised , and there is debate over his identity . The commissioners approached Richard Brandon , the common hangman of London , but he refused , at least at first , despite being offered £ 200 . It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death , but there are others who have been named as potential candidates , including George Joyce , William Hulet and Hugh Peters . The clean strike , confirmed by an examination of the king 's body at Windsor in 1813 , suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced <unk> . 
 It was common practice for the severed head of a traitor to be held up and exhibited to the crowd with the words " Behold the head of a traitor ! " Although Charles 's head was exhibited , the words were not used , possibly because the executioner did not want his voice recognised . On the day after the execution , the king 's head was sewn back onto his body , which was then embalmed and placed in a lead coffin . 
 The commission refused to allow Charles 's burial at Westminster Abbey , so his body was conveyed to Windsor on the night of 7 February . He was buried in private in the Henry VIII vault alongside the coffins of Henry VIII and Henry 's third wife , Jane Seymour , in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , on 9 February 1649 . The king 's son , Charles II , later planned for an elaborate royal mausoleum to be erected in Hyde Park , London , but it was never built . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Ten days after Charles 's execution , on the day of his interment , a memoir purporting to be written by the king appeared for sale . This book , the <unk> <unk> ( Greek : the " Royal Portrait " ) , contained an apologia for royal policies , and it proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda . John Milton wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder , the <unk> ( " The Iconoclast " ) , but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book . Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom , and the Church of England canonised him as a saint , in the <unk> of Canterbury and York of 1660 . High Anglicans commemorated his martyrdom on the anniversary of his death and churches , such as those at Falmouth and Tunbridge Wells , were founded in his honour . 
 Partly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623 , Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector , amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled . His intimate courtiers including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall group . In Spain , he sat for a sketch by Velázquez , and acquired works by Titian and Correggio , among others . In England , his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House , Whitehall , by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van <unk> , <unk> , and van Dyck . In 1627 and 1628 , he purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua , which included work by Titian , Correggio , Raphael , Caravaggio , del Sarto and Mantegna . Charles 's collection grew further to encompass Bernini , Bruegel , da Vinci , Holbein , Hollar , Tintoretto and Veronese , and self @-@ portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt . By Charles 's death , there were an estimated 1760 paintings , most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament . 
 With the monarchy overthrown , England became a republic or " Commonwealth " . The House of Lords was abolished by the Rump Commons , and executive power was assumed by a Council of State . All significant military opposition in Britain and Ireland was extinguished by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in the Third English Civil War and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland . Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump Parliament in 1653 , thereby establishing The Protectorate with himself as Lord Protector . Upon his death in 1658 , he was briefly succeeded by his ineffective son , Richard . Parliament was reinstated , and the monarchy was restored to Charles I 's eldest son , Charles II , in 1660 . 
 = = = Assessments = = = 
 In the words of John Philipps Kenyon , " Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy " . Revered by high Tories who considered him a saintly martyr , he was condemned by Whig historians , such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner , who thought him duplicitous and delusional . In recent decades , most historians have criticised him , the main exception being Kevin Sharpe who offered a more sympathetic view of Charles that has not been widely adopted . While Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience , Professor Barry Coward thought Charles " was the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI " , a view shared by Ronald Hutton , who called him " the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages " . 
 Archbishop William Laud , who was beheaded by Parliament during the war , described Charles as " A mild and gracious prince who knew not how to be , or how to be made , great . " Charles was more sober and refined than his father , but he was intransigent and deliberately pursued unpopular policies that ultimately brought ruin on himself . Both Charles and James were advocates of the divine right of kings , but while James 's ambitions concerning absolute prerogative were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects , Charles believed that he had no need to compromise or even to explain his actions . He thought that he was answerable only to God . " Princes are not bound to give account of their actions , " he wrote , " but to God alone " .

 = Skagen Painters = 
 The Skagen Painters ( Danish : <unk> ) were a group of Scandinavian artists who gathered in the village of Skagen , the northernmost part of Denmark , from the late 1870s until the turn of the century . Skagen was a summer destination whose scenery and quality of light attracted northern artists to paint en plein air , emulating the French Impressionists — though members of the Skagen colony were also influenced by Realist movements such as the Barbizon school . They broke away from the rather rigid traditions of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts , espousing the latest trends that they had learned in Paris . Among the group were Anna and Michael Ancher , Peder Severin Krøyer , Karl Madsen , Laurits Tuxen , Marie Krøyer , Carl Locher , Viggo Johansen and Thorvald Niss from Denmark , Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén from Sweden , and Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen from Norway . The group gathered together regularly at the Brøndums Inn . 
 Skagen , in the very north of Jutland , was the largest fishing community in Denmark , with more than half of its population so engaged . Among the locals , fishermen were by far the most common subject for the Skagen painters . Skagen 's long beaches were exploited in the group 's landscapes ; P.S. Krøyer , one of the best @-@ known of the Skagen painters , was inspired by the light of the evening " Blue Hour " , which made the water and sky seem to optically merge . This is captured in one of his most famous paintings , Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife ( 1899 ) . Although the painters had their own individual styles without any requirement to adhere to a common approach or manifest , one of their common interests was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings , playing cards , celebrating or simply eating together . 
 Michael Ancher drew attention to the attractions of the area when his Will He Round the Point ? ( 1885 ) was purchased by King Christian IX . He married Anna Brøndum , the only member of the group from Skagen , who became a pioneering female artist at a time when women were not permitted to study at Denmark 's Royal Academy . Today the Skagens Museum , founded in the dining room at Brøndum 's Hotel in October 1908 , hosts many of their works of art , some 1 @,@ 800 pieces in total . Many of the paintings have been digitized under the Google Art Project and are accessible online . Related exhibitions continue to be held ; in 2008 , the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen presented " The Skagen Painters — In a New Light " , and in 2013 , the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington , D.C. presented " A World Apart : Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony " . 
 = = History = = 
 The first notable artist to paint in Skagen was Martinus Rørbye ( 1803 – 1848 ) , one of the central figures of the Golden Age of Danish Painting . His first visit was in 1833 but he returned towards the end of his life in 1847 and 1848 . He is remembered in particular for his Men of Skagen on a Summer Evening in Fair Weather painted in 1848 . Another marine painter , Vilhelm <unk> ( 1824 – 1882 ) , visited Skagen in 1848 , painting his View over Skagen . According to Karl Madsen , the painter Peter <unk> ( 1806 – 1882 ) also visited the town on several occasions between 1862 and 1870 , painting the dunes and the fishermen . Christian <unk> ( 1838 – 1920 ) , another marine painter , first visited Skagen in 1869 when he painted his Grey Lighthouse . It was as a result of his influence that the poet and dramatist Holger Drachmann first visited the town in 1871 . 
 In the 1860s and 1870s , despite evolving trends in Europe , especially in Paris , embracing Realism and Impressionism , the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused to change their approach , insisting their students should continue to paint in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism . Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher , Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen . Madsen , who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn , invited Ancher to join him there in 1874 , to paint the local fishermen . He became a friend of the Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums <unk> , a guest house . He was invited to their 15 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Anna 's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her . The following year , he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism . In particular , Johansen began to paint open @-@ air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism . 
 In 1876 and especially in 1877 , several other artists spent the summer in Skagen , using the Brøndums ' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings . Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home . He became engaged to Anna Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880 . Their home then became a focal point for the artists , especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher 's painting Will He Round the Point ? . Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family 's inn , leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day . She studied them carefully and in 1875 attended Vilhelm Kyhn 's art school in Copenhagen . She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people in their everyday lives and making full use of colour . Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878 , encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin . He brought many of the latest international art trends with him , influencing the other members of the group . His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work . 
 In 1882 , the Anchers travelled abroad . While they were in Vienna , they met P.S. Krøyer who informed them he would also be going to Skagen that year , despite the fact that Ancher was apparently not too keen to have him there . Krøyer , who had enjoyed close contacts with several Impressionist artists in Paris , immediately became the central member and unofficial leader of the artists ' colony . In 1883 , he created the " Evening Academy " where the artists gathered to paint and discuss each other 's work , often enjoying champagne . In 1884 , the German painter Fritz Stoltenberg took photographs of the artists celebrating in the Anchers ' garden , just after the couple had moved into their new home . One of these photos in particular inspired Krøyer to paint Hip , Hip , Hurrah ! , which took him four years to complete . 
 In 1890 , the railway 's arrival in Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists . It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings . However , some of them purchased homes in Skagen : P.S. Krøyer in 1894 , Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903 . 
 Anna and Michael Ancher , Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends . Two core members of the group , Drachmann and Krøyer , died in 1908 and 1909 , bringing the traditional gatherings of the group to an end . There were nevertheless other painters , sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters , who continued to visit the area . They included Jørgen <unk> , <unk> and Gad Frederik Clement , Ella Heide , Ludvig Karsten , Frederik Lange and Johannes <unk> , some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later . Skagens Museum has a number of their works in its collection . Another notable artist who visited Skagen from 1906 was J.F. Willumsen who painted Children Bathing on Skagen Beach in 1909 . 
 = = Family relationships = = 
 The Skagen painters quickly began to form a close @-@ knit community as relationships grew between the artists and the young women from the area . In 1880 , Michael Ancher married Anna Brøndum from the guest house , Viggo Johansen married Martha Møller , Anna 's cousin , and Karl Madsen married Helene Christensen , a schoolteacher . The house the Anchers moved into in 1884 became a focus for the artists ' colony , especially as the couple lived there all the year round . When their daughter Helga ( the little girl in Hip , Hip , Hurrah ! ) died in 1964 , she left the house to a foundation which soon turned it into a museum . The <unk> acquired a large family between 1881 and 1886 : Ellen Henriette ( daughter of Henriette , Martha 's sister , who died during childbirth ) , Lars , Fritz , Gerda and Bodil . They can be seen dancing around the Christmas tree in Johansen 's painting Merry Christmas . 
 Another key figure in Skagen , P.S. Krøyer , married Marie Triepcke after falling in love with her in Paris in 1888 . The daughter of a prosperous German <unk> engineer , she was said to be the most beautiful woman in Copenhagen . However , as the years went by , Krøyer 's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage . The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married . Krøyer died in Skagen four years later , apparently as a result of mental illness . 
 In 1901 , after the death of his first wife Ursule , Laurits Tuxen married Frederikke <unk> , a Norwegian , and shortly afterwards purchased Madam Bendsen 's house in Skagen where first Viggo and Martha Johansen and later Marie and P.S. Krøyer had stayed in the 1880s . He converted it into a stately summer residence . Michael Ancher and Laurits Tuxen died in 1927 , Anna Ancher and Viggo Johansen in 1935 . 
 = = Members of the group = = 
 The principal Danish painters included Karl Madsen , Laurits Tuxen , Marie Krøyer , Carl Locher , Viggo Johansen , Thorvald Niss , and most notably , Anna and Michael Ancher and Peder Severin Krøyer . There were also painters from the rest of Scandinavia including Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén from Sweden and Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen from Norway . The gatherings in Skagen were not restricted to painters . The Danish writers Georg Brandes , Holger Drachmann and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén were also members of the group . 
 A number of other artists also joined the Skagen Painters for shorter periods . From Denmark they included Vilhelm Kyhn , Einar Hein and Frederik Lange , from Norway Frits Thaulow , Charles <unk> and Wilhelm Peters , from Sweden Wilhelm von <unk> and Anna Palm de Rosa , from Germany Fritz Stoltenberg and Julius Runge , and from England Adrian Stokes and his Austrian @-@ born wife , Marianne Stokes . The Danish composer Carl Nielsen and his wife Anne Marie , a sculptor , also spent summers in Skagen and eventually bought a summerhouse there . 
 = = = Anna Ancher = = = 
 The only member of the group born in Skagen , Anna Ancher ( 1859 – 1935 ) , was the daughter of Erik Brøndum , the owner of the grocery shop and guest house which later became Brøndums Hotel . Inspired by the artists who stayed there , she received her first lessons from Karl Madsen , Viggo Johansen and Michael Ancher . From 1875 , she spent several winters in Copenhagen at Vilhelm Kyhn 's school for women painters . As a result of her portraits of family and friends as well as her skills as a colourist , she is considered to be one of Denmark 's finest artists although her talents were not fully appreciated until after her death . Her works depict scenes from the home , children and women and religious life in Skagen . She now stands out as a pioneer at a time when women were not expected to become artists and were not admitted to the Royal Danish Academy . Unlike her husband , she adopted a style of Realism , inspired above all by Christian Krohg . Commenting on her Blind Woman ( 1882 ) in which the face is illuminated in an otherwise dark portrait , Madsen pointed out that she was the first Danish artist to depict a sunbeam . Her most cherished works include Girl in the Kitchen ( 1886 ) , Sunlight in the Blue Room ( 1891 ) and A Mission Meeting ( 1903 ) . 
 = = = Michael Ancher = = = 
 Michael Ancher ( 1849 – 1927 ) , originally from the island of Bornholm , was invited to Skagen in 1874 by his friend Karl Madsen with whom he was studying at the Academy . In 1880 , he married Anna Brøndum and settled in Skagen . He achieved his artistic breakthrough in 1879 with the painting Will he Round the Point ? which was bought by Christian IX . Several other works by Ancher depict Skagen 's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea , combining Realism and with classical composition . Key works include The Lifeboat is Carried Through The Dunes ( 1883 ) , The Crew Are Saved ( 1894 ) and The Drowned Man ( 1896 ) . He also painted portraits and landscapes , especially of Skagen 's Østerby district . Many of his paintings can be seen in Skagens Museum . Michael Ancher has become one of Denmark 's most cherished painters . 
 = = = P.S. Krøyer = = = 
 Born in Stavanger , Norway , but brought up in Copenhagen , Peder Severin Krøyer ( 1851 – 1909 ) came to Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer , finally settling there after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889 . He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement in his travels to France . In Skagen , he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the group of painters , creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light in his beach scenes while painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists . Key works include Summer Evening on Skagen 's Southern Beach ( 1893 ) , In the Grocer 's Store When There is No Fishing ( 1892 ) , and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach ( 1906 ) which shows many members of the community including Krøyer 's daughter Vibeke , mayor Otto Schwartz and his wife Alba Schwartz , Michael Ancher , Degn Brøndum , Anna Ancher , Holger Drachmann and his third wife <unk> , Hugo Alfvén and Marie Krøyer . 
 = = = Viggo Johansen = = = 
 Viggo Johansen ( 1851 – 1935 ) , who had studied at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher ( also without graduating ) , first went to Skagen in 1875 . An active member of the group , he married Anna Ancher 's cousin Martha Møller in 1880 . From 1885 , he exhibited in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet . His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison . Monet 's use of colour is reflected in his painting Christian <unk> is ill ( 1890 ) . The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings , depicting the red @-@ bearded Christian looking out towards the light at the foot of his bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall . Among the works he painted in Skagen are Kitchen Interior ( 1884 ) which depicts his wife Martha arranging flowers , and the much brighter Dividing the Catch ( 1885 ) showing four fishermen who have pulled their boat up onto the beach while one of their wives hopes there will be something for the evening meal . After falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891 , Johansen 's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903 . In 1906 , he became a professor at the Royal Academy where he was director from 1911 to 1914 . 
 = = = Carl Locher = = = 
 Somewhat forgotten today , Carl Locher ( 1851 – 1915 ) was one of the earlier visitors to Skagen . <unk> Drachmann , who had taught him before he attended the Royal Academy , persuaded him to go there in 1872 . Especially interested in marine painting , Locher adopted a realist impressionistic approach , influenced by the time he spent with Léon Bonnat in Paris during the 1870s . A stickler for perfection , especially in his drawings , his works cover the transition from sailing ships to steamships and from the original Skagen to the evolving tourist destination . His paintings include Fishing Cutters in the Moonlit Night , 1888 , The Lightship at Skagen Reef ( 1892 ) and above all The Mail Coach ( c . 1890 ) which depicts the horse @-@ drawn carriage which until the railway reached Skagen in 1890 was the way travellers arrived there from Frederikshavn . In 1910 , Locher built a house overlooking the beach at Skagen Østerby where he painted until he died of heart trouble in 1913 . 
 = = = Laurits Tuxen = = = 
 Born and raised in Copenhagen , Laurits Tuxen ( 1853 – 1927 ) studied at the Royal Danish Academy together with P.S. Krøyer where he was considered to be one of the best painters . In 1875 , he began to study in Paris in Léon Bonnat 's studio with whom he also worked in subsequent years . His Suzanna i <unk> ( 1878 ) , first painted in Paris , was warmly received in the Copenhagen spring exhibition in 1879 . He first visited Skagen in 1870 but after a few more visits in the 1870s , did not return until 1901 . After his first wife died of tuberculosis , he married the Norwegian Frederikke <unk> and bought a house in Skagen . There he painted a number of pictures depicting family and friends as well as landscapes . Among the works from Skagen are The North Sea in Stormy Weather ( 1909 ) , the powerful The Drowned Boy is Brought Ashore ( 1913 ) inspired by paintings of drownings he saw in France and Pouring the Morning Coffee ( 1906 ) depicting Tuxen 's wife Frederikke and his daughters Yvonne and Nina in their Skagen home , Villa <unk> . Through his use of colour , brushstrokes and backlighting through the window flowers , the artist creates a homely atmosphere . Tuxen 's most famous paintings are however his portraits of European royal personalities , including Christian IX of Denmark , Queen Victoria and Czar Nicholas II . 
 = = = Christian Krohg = = = 
 The Norwegian Christian Krohg ( 1852 – 1925 ) first visited Skagen with Frits Thaulow in 1879 . One of the most important figures in Norwegian art , he first studied law but his interest in art was triggered by his friendship with fellow student Eilif Peterssen . He attended J.F. <unk> 's painting school in Christiania ( now Oslo ) before moving to Karlsruhe and Berlin where he studied under Karl Gussow , specializing in figure painting in the new idiom of Realism . In Berlin , he also developed a friendship with Georg Brandes . In 1879 he returned to Christiania before travelling to Skagen where he achieved his artistic breakthrough , attracted by the simple lives of the local fishermen . Depicting a fisherman at sea , his <unk> <unk> ( 1879 ) is considered to be one of his early masterpieces . His association with Ancher , Krøyer and the other members of the colony had a marked effect on his style as can be seen in the works he painted on returning to Norway . He went to Paris in 1881 – 82 , where was influenced by Édouard Manet and the Impressionist movement . His experience of French art can be seen in several of his later Skagen paintings , including Tired ( 1885 ) and <unk> Her Hair ( 1888 ) in which the mother and child unusually have their backs facing the observer . His lighter palette with bold brushstrokes and contrasting tones of blue , red and green give the painting a deeper texture . 
 = = = Marie Krøyer = = = 
 Marie Krøyer née Triepcke ( 1867 – 1940 ) came from a well @-@ to @-@ do German family living in Copenhagen . From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after training privately she went to Paris to continue her studies . It was there , in early 1889 , that she met Krøyer who immediately fell madly in love with her . Although he was 16 years her senior , the couple married that summer . In 1891 , they settled in Skagen , giving Krøyer ample opportunity to paint portraits of Marie , both indoors and especially on the beach . The summers Krøyer spent together with his wife in the 1890s were clearly a source of inspiration for him , especially as Marie had a strong sense of beauty herself , often quoting Keats ' " Beauty is truth , truth beauty " . As a result of the periods of mental illness Krøyer experienced from 1900 , the marriage fell apart . In 1912 , she married Hugo Alfvén who had also been taken by her beauty . It is believed Marie was reluctant to paint after meeting Krøyer whom she looked up to as a far more competent artist . A few of her works have nevertheless survived , including Interior with Girl Sewing . 
 = = Styles of painting = = 
 Encouraged by the Modern Breakthrough movement led by Georg Brandes , the early painters were attracted by Skagen 's village community , its seascapes and culture , all far removed from the effects of industrialization on city life . They all recognized the special light they encountered in Skagen , a combination of its location in the far north of Denmark and , by some accounts , the effects of sand in the air . Their painting styles evolved from the formal Neoclassical approach of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen to embrace the evolving European trends in Realism and Impressionism , including the plein air approach adopted by the Barbizon School . The artists were especially attracted by the opportunities for painting en plein air , focusing on the activities of the local fishermen and their modest cottages . In the absence of any rules within the colony , the painters freely developed their individual styles . Nevertheless , one of the interests they shared was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings , whether playing cards , celebrating or simply eating together . 
 By adopting the plein @-@ air approach , the painters were able to create their works in the open , immediately capturing the special effects of light and colour on their subjects . Fishermen were considered an especially interesting group in view of their dangerous work and their heroic behaviour . Lars Kruse , depicted by Michael Ancher , was famous for his success in rescuing a number of sailors who would otherwise have drowned . P.S. Krøyer 's works were less dramatic , depicting fishermen pulling their nets in after a day at sea . While some of the paintings portrayed authentic occurrences , the artists often paid the fishermen to act as models , supplementing their modest incomes . Krøyer 's works also included scenes of walks on the beach , romantic evenings in the moonlight and portraits of his wife Marie . As time went by , Krøyer increasingly painted " moods " , works which depicted the special atmosphere of the " Blue Hour " which developed in the evening as the sky merged with the sea . In addition to his landscapes and family portraits , Laurits Tuxen is remembered for painting the flowers in his garden . Anna Ancher 's paintings , on the other hand , focused on interiors of the home , including women and children , in a more abstract style . 
 = = Skagens Museum = = 
 Skagens Museum was founded in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908 . Victor Christian <unk> , the local pharmacist , Degn Brøndum , proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher 's brother , and Michael Ancher , Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors . After P.S. Krøyer 's death in 1909 , his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a museum . In 1919 , Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel 's garden to Skagens Museum as a site for a new building . Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened . 
 In 1982 , the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor , architect Jacob Blegvad , who also planned the later extension to the museum inaugurated in 1989 . In 1997 , the museum administration moved into the Technical School . Today Skagens Museum has more than 1 @,@ 800 works of art . Many of the museum 's paintings have been digitized under the Google Art Project and are accessible online .

 The Skagen artists were the subject of the 1987 film Hip Hip <unk> ! by the Swedish director Kjell <unk> , inspired by Krøyer 's famous painting . 
 In 2012 , the film The Passion of Marie , directed by Bille August , covered Marie 's increasingly difficult relationship with her husband P.S. Krøyer . The film is based on the book <unk> om Marie by <unk> Arnold .

 There have been a number of exhibitions of the Skagen Painters in recent years . In 2008 , the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen presented " The Skagen Painters — In a New Light " , contrasting the paintings depicting the artists with those of the fishermen . In 2011 , the Hirschsprung Museum in Copenhagen succeeded in arranging the largest exhibition of Krøyer 's work titled : " Krøyer — i <unk> lys " ( Krøyer — in international light ) , with works from museums and private collections in France , Germany , the United States and Scandinavia . The National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington , D.C. presented " A World Apart : Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony " in 2013 . It was the largest exhibition of Anna Ancher 's paintings ever held in the United States . In 2014 , Skagens Museum , which frequently presents new aspects of the work of the Skagen Painters , concentrated its efforts on " Laurits Tuxen — colour , countryside and crown " , presenting many works held in private collections illustrating the artist 's involvement in establishing <unk> <unk> ( The Artists ' School of Study ) in Copenhagen as well as his work as a court painter . 
 A major exhibition of paintings by the Skagen Painters titled Michael Ancher – P.S. Krøyer : Venner og <unk> ( Friends and Rivals ) is to be held at Arken , Copenhagen from 27 September 2014 to 12 April 2015 . 
 = = Gallery of paintings = = 
 The gallery presents a selection of paintings by the Skagen artists , roughly in chronological order . 
 = Betelgeuse = 
 Betelgeuse , also known by its Bayer designation Alpha Orionis ( shortened to α Orionis or α Ori ) , is the ninth @-@ brightest star in the night sky and second @-@ brightest in the constellation of Orion . Distinctly reddish , it is a semiregular variable star whose apparent magnitude varies between 0 @.@ 0 and 1 @.@ 3 , the widest range of any first @-@ magnitude star . Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the Winter Triangle , and it marks the center of the Winter Hexagon . The star 's name is derived from the Arabic <unk> الجوزاء <unk> al @-@ Jauzā ' or <unk> الجوزاء Yad al @-@ Jauzā ' , meaning " the hand of Orion " . 
 The star is classified as a red supergiant of spectral type M1 @-@ 2 and is one of the largest and most luminous observable stars . If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System , its surface would extend past the asteroid belt , possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond , wholly engulfing Mercury , Venus , Earth and Mars . Estimates of its mass are poorly constrained , but range from 5 to 30 times that of the Sun . Its distance from Earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 light @-@ years , yielding a mean absolute magnitude of about − 6 . Less than 10 million years old , Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass . Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association — which includes the stars in Orion 's Belt — this crimson runaway has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a supersonic speed of 30 km / s , creating a bow shock over 4 light @-@ years wide . Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution , the supergiant is expected to proceed through its life cycle before exploding as a type II supernova within the next million years . An observation by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2013 revealed that the star 's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium . 
 In 1920 , Betelgeuse became the second star ( after the Sun ) to have the angular size of its photosphere measured . Since then , researchers have used telescopes with different technical parameters to measure the stellar giant , often with conflicting results . Studies since 1990 have produced an angular diameter ( apparent size ) ranging from 0 @.@ 043 to 0 @.@ 056 arcseconds , an incongruity largely caused by the star 's tendency to periodically change shape . Due to limb darkening , variability , and angular diameters that vary with wavelength , many of the star 's properties are not yet known with any certainty . Adding to these challenges , the surface of Betelgeuse is obscured by a complex , asymmetric envelope roughly 250 times the size of the star , caused by colossal mass loss . 
 = = Observational history = = 
 Betelgeuse and its red coloration have been noted since antiquity ; the classical astronomer Ptolemy described its color as <unk> ( <unk> ) , a term that was later described by a translator of Ulugh Beg 's Zij @-@ i Sultani as <unk> , Latin for " <unk> " . In the nineteenth century , before modern systems of stellar classification , Angelo Secchi included Betelgeuse as one of the prototypes for his Class III ( orange to red ) stars . By contrast , three centuries before Ptolemy , Chinese astronomers observed Betelgeuse as having a yellow coloration , suggesting that the star may have spent time as a yellow supergiant around the beginning of the common era , a possibility given current research into the complex circumstellar environment of these stars . 
 = = = Nascent discoveries = = = 
 The variation in Betelgeuse 's brightness was first described in 1836 by Sir John Herschel , when he published his observations in Outlines of Astronomy . From 1836 to 1840 , he noticed significant changes in magnitude when Betelgeuse outshone Rigel in October 1837 and again in November 1839 . A 10 @-@ year quiescent period followed ; then in 1849 , Herschel noted another short cycle of variability , which peaked in 1852 . Later observers recorded unusually high maxima with an interval of years , but only small variations from 1957 to 1967 . The records of the American Association of Variable Star Observers ( <unk> ) show a maximum brightness of 0 @.@ 2 in 1933 and 1942 , and a minimum of 1 @.@ 2 , observed in 1927 and 1941 . This variability in brightness may explain why Johann Bayer , with the publication of his Uranometria in 1603 , designated the star alpha as it may have rivaled the usually brighter Rigel ( beta ) . From Arctic latitudes , Betelgeuse 's red colour and higher location in the sky than Rigel meant the Inuit regarded it as brighter , and one local name was <unk> " large star " . 
 In 1920 , Albert Michelson and Francis Pease mounted a 6 @-@ meter interferometer on the front of the 2 @.@ 5 @-@ meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory . Helped by John Anderson , the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0 @.@ 047 " , a figure which resulted in a diameter of 3 @.@ 84 × 108 km ( 2 @.@ 58 AU ) based on the parallax value of 0 @.@ 018 " . However , limb darkening and measurement errors resulted in uncertainty about the accuracy of these measurements . 
 The 1950s and 1960s saw two developments that would impact stellar convection theory in red supergiants : the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure and Evolution of the Stars , principally the work of Martin Schwarzschild and his colleague at Princeton University , Richard <unk> . This book disseminated ideas on how to apply computer technologies to create stellar models , while the Stratoscope projects , by taking balloon @-@ borne telescopes above the Earth 's turbulence , produced some of the finest images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen , thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere . 
 = = = Imaging breakthroughs = = = 
 Astronomers in the 1970s saw some major advances in astronomical imaging technology beginning with Antoine <unk> 's invention of speckle interferometry , a process that significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by astronomical seeing . It increased the optical resolution of ground @-@ based telescopes , allowing for more precise measurements of Betelgeuse 's photosphere . With improvements in infrared telescopy atop Mount Wilson , Mount Locke and Mauna Kea in Hawaii , astrophysicists began peering into the complex circumstellar shells surrounding the supergiant , causing them to suspect the presence of huge gas bubbles resulting from convection . But it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s , when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry , that breakthroughs occurred in visible @-@ light and infrared imaging . Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group , the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane , converting the aperture into an ad @-@ hoc interferometric array . The technique contributed some of the most accurate measurements of Betelgeuse while revealing bright spots on the star 's photosphere . These were the first optical and infrared images of a stellar disk other than the Sun , taken first from ground @-@ based interferometers and later from higher @-@ resolution observations of the <unk> telescope . The " bright patches " or " hotspots " observed with these instruments appeared to corroborate a theory put forth by Schwarzschild decades earlier of massive convection cells dominating the stellar surface . 
 In 1995 , the Hubble Space Telescope 's Faint Object Camera captured an ultraviolet image with a resolution superior to that obtained by ground @-@ based interferometers — the first conventional @-@ telescope image ( or " direct @-@ image " in NASA terminology ) of the disk of another star . Because ultraviolet light is absorbed by the Earth 's atmosphere , observations at these wavelengths are best performed by space telescopes . Like earlier pictures , this image contained a bright patch indicating a region in the southwestern quadrant 2000 K hotter than the stellar surface . Subsequent ultraviolet spectra taken with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph suggested that the hot spot was one of Betelgeuse 's poles of rotation . This would give the rotational axis an inclination of about 20 ° to the direction of Earth , and a position angle from celestial North of about 55 ° . 
 = = = Recent studies = = = 
 In a study published in December 2000 , the star 's diameter was measured with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer ( ISI ) at mid @-@ infrared wavelengths producing a limb @-@ darkened estimate of 55 @.@ 2 ± 0 @.@ 5 milliarcseconds ( mas ) — a figure entirely consistent with Michelson 's findings eighty years earlier . At the time of its publication , the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7 @.@ 63 ± 1 @.@ 64 mas , yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3 @.@ 6 AU . However , numerous interferometric studies in the near @-@ infrared made at the Paranal Observatory in Chile argue for much tighter diameters . On 9 June 2009 , Nobel Laureate Charles Townes announced that the star had shrunk by 15 % since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution in magnitude . Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star 's extended atmosphere . 
 In addition to the discussion of the star 's diameter , questions have arisen about the complex dynamics of Betelgeuse 's extended atmosphere . The mass that makes up galaxies is recycled as stars are formed and destroyed , and red supergiants are major contributors , yet the mechanics of stellar mass loss remain a mystery . With advances in interferometric methodologies , astronomers may be close to resolving this conundrum . In July 2009 , images released by the European Southern Observatory , taken by the ground @-@ based Very Large Telescope Interferometer ( VLTI ) , showed a vast plume of gas being ejected from the star into the surrounding atmosphere with distances approximating 30 AU . This mass ejection was equal to the distance between the Sun and Neptune and is one of multiple events occurring in Betelgeuse 's surrounding atmosphere . Astronomers have identified at least six shells surrounding Betelgeuse . Solving the mystery of mass loss in the late stages of a star 's evolution may reveal those factors that precipitate the explosive deaths of these stellar giants . 
 = = Visibility = = 
 In the night sky , Betelgeuse is easy to spot with the naked eye owing to its distinctive orange @-@ red color . In the Northern Hemisphere , beginning in January of each year , it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset . By mid @-@ September to mid @-@ March ( best in mid @-@ December ) , it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe , except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82 ° . In May ( moderate northern latitudes ) or June ( southern latitudes ) , the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset , reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise . In the intermediate period ( June – July ) it is invisible to the naked eye ( visible only with a telescope in daylight ) , unless around midday ( when the Sun is below horizon ) on Antarctic regions between 70 ° and 80 ° south latitude . 
 The mean apparent magnitude of Betelgeuse is 0 @.@ 50 , making it on average the eighth brightest star in the celestial sphere excluding the Sun . Because Betelgeuse is a variable star whose brightness ranges between 0 @.@ 0 and 1 @.@ 3 , there are periods when it will surpass Procyon to become the seventh brightest star . Occasionally it can even outshine Rigel and become the sixth brightest star . At its faintest , Betelgeuse will fall behind Deneb and Mimosa as 20th brightest star . 
 Betelgeuse has a color index ( B – V ) of 1 @.@ 85 — a figure which points to its advanced " redness " . The photosphere has an extended atmosphere , which displays strong lines of emission rather than absorption , a phenomenon that occurs when a star is surrounded by a thick gaseous envelope . This extended gaseous atmosphere has been observed moving away from and towards Betelgeuse , depending on radial velocity fluctuations in the photosphere . Betelgeuse is the brightest near @-@ infrared source in the sky with a J band magnitude of − 2 @.@ 99 . As a result , only about 13 % of the star 's radiant energy is emitted in the form of visible light . If human eyes were sensitive to radiation at all wavelengths , Betelgeuse would appear as the brightest star in the sky . 
 = = = Parallax = = = 
 Since the first successful parallax measurement by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 , astronomers have been puzzled by Betelgeuse 's apparent distance . Knowledge of the star 's distance improves the accuracy of other stellar parameters , such as luminosity that , when combined with an angular diameter , can be used to calculate the physical radius and effective temperature ; luminosity and isotopic abundances can also be used to estimate the stellar age and mass . In 1920 , when the first interferometric studies were performed on the star 's diameter , the assumed parallax was 0 @.@ <unk> arcseconds . This equated to a distance of 56 parsecs ( pc ) or roughly 180 light @-@ years ( ly ) , producing not only an inaccurate radius for the star but every other stellar characteristic . Since then , there has been ongoing work to measure the distance of Betelgeuse , with proposed distances as high as 400 pc or about 1300 ly . 
 Before the publication of the Hipparcos Catalogue ( 1997 ) , there were two conflicting parallax measurements for Betelgeuse . The first was the Yale University Observatory ( 1991 ) with a published parallax of π 
 = 9 @.@ 8 ± 4 @.@ 7 mas , yielding a distance of roughly 102 pc or 330 ly . The second was the Hipparcos Input Catalogue ( 1993 ) with a trigonometric parallax of π = 
 5 ± 4 mas , a distance of 200 pc or 650 ly — almost twice the Yale estimate . Given this uncertainty , researchers were adopting a wide range of distance estimates , leading to significant variances in the calculation of the star 's attributes . 
 The results from the Hipparcos mission were released in 1997 . The measured parallax of Betelgeuse was π 
 = 7 @.@ 63 ± 1 @.@ 64 mas , which equated to a distance of 131 pc or roughly 430 ly , and had a smaller reported error than previous measurements . However , later evaluation of the Hipparcos parallax measurements for variable stars like Betelgeuse found that the uncertainty of these measurements had been underestimated . In 2007 , Floor van Leeuwen improved upon the Hipparcos parallax , producing a new figure of π = 
 6 @.@ 55 ± 0 @.@ 83 , hence a much tighter error factor yielding a distance of roughly 152 ± 20 pc or 520 ± 73 ly . 
 In 2008 , Graham Harper and colleagues , using the Very Large Array ( VLA ) , produced a radio solution of π = 5 @.@ 07 ± 1 @.@ 10 mas , equalling a distance of 197 ± 45 pc or 643 ± 146 ly . As Harper points out : " The revised Hipparcos parallax leads to a larger distance ( 152 ± 20 pc ) than the original ; however , the astrometric solution still requires a significant cosmic noise of 2 @.@ 4 mas . Given these results it is clear that the Hipparcos data still contain systematic errors of unknown origin . " Although the radio data also have systematic errors , the Harper solution combines the datasets in the hope of mitigating such errors . The European Space Agency 's current Gaia mission may not improve over the measurements of Betelgeuse by the earlier Hipparcos mission because it is brighter than the approximately V = 6 saturation limit of the mission 's instruments .

 Betelgeuse is classified as a semiregular variable star of subgroup <unk> ; these are pulsating red supergiants with low @-@ amplitude variations and periods of stable brightness . Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain Betelgeuse 's pulsations and their rhythm — which result in an absolute magnitude oscillation from − 5 @.@ 27 and − 6 @.@ 27 . Established theories of stellar structure suggest that the outer layers of this supergiant gradually expand and contract , causing the surface area ( photosphere ) to alternately increase and decrease , and the temperature to rise and fall — thereby eliciting the measured cadence in the star 's brightness between its dimmest magnitude of 1 @.@ 2 , seen as early as 1927 , and its brightest of 0 @.@ 2 , seen in 1933 and 1942 . A red supergiant like Betelgeuse will <unk> this way because its stellar atmosphere is unstable . As the star contracts , it absorbs more and more of the energy that passes through it , causing the atmosphere to heat up and expand . Conversely , as the star expands , its atmosphere becomes less dense , allowing the energy to escape and the atmosphere to cool , thus initiating a new contraction phase . Calculating the star 's pulsations and modeling its periodicity have been difficult , as it appears there are several cycles interlaced . As discussed in papers by Stebbins and Sanford in the 1930s , there are short @-@ term variations of around 150 to 300 days that modulate a regular cyclic variation with a period of roughly 5 @.@ 7 years . 
 The supergiant consistently displays irregular photometric , <unk> and spectroscopic variations , phenomena pointing to complex activity on the star 's surface and its extended atmosphere . Martin Schwarzschild in 1975 attributed these brightness fluctuations to the changing granulation pattern formed by a few giant convection cells covering the surface of these stars . For the Sun , these convection cells , known as solar granules , represent the foremost mode of heat transfer — hence those convective elements dominate the brightness variations in the solar photosphere . The typical diameter for a solar granule is about 2000 km ( a surface area roughly the size of India ) , with an average depth of 700 km . With a surface of roughly 6 trillion km2 , there are about 2 million such granules on the Sun 's photosphere , and this large number produces a relatively constant flux . By contrast , Schwarzschild argues that stars like Betelgeuse may only have a dozen granules with diameters of 180 million kilometers or more dominating the surface of the star with depths of about 60 million kilometers , which , due to the low temperatures and extremely low density found in red supergiant envelopes , result in convective inefficiency . Consequently , if only a third of these convective cells are visible at any one time , the variations in their observable light emission may result in the recorded irregular brightness variations of the overall light from the star . 
 The hypothesis that gigantic convection cells dominate the surface of red giants and supergiants remains accepted by the astronomical community . When the Hubble Space Telescope captured its first direct image of Betelgeuse in 1995 revealing a mysterious hot spot , astronomers attributed it to convection . Two years later , astronomers observed intricate asymmetries in the brightness distribution of the star , revealing at least three bright spots , the magnitude of which was " consistent with convective surface hotspots . " In 2000 , another team of astronomers , led by Alex Lobel of the Harvard – Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , noted that Betelgeuse exhibits raging storms of hot and cold gas in its turbulent atmosphere . The team surmised that large areas of the star 's photosphere bulge out in different directions at times , ejecting long plumes of warm gas into the cold dust envelope . Another explanation is the occurrence of shock waves caused by warm gas traversing cooler regions of the star . Observing the atmosphere of Betelgeuse over a period of five years between 1998 and 2003 with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard Hubble , the team likened the rise and fall of convection cells in the chromosphere to the blobs in a lava lamp .

 On 13 December 1920 , Betelgeuse became the first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its photosphere measured . Although interferometry was still in its infancy , the experiment proved a success . The researchers , using a uniform disk model , determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0 @.@ 047 arcseconds , although the stellar disk was likely 17 % larger due to the limb darkening , resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0 @.@ 055 " . Since then , other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0 @.@ 042 to 0 @.@ 069 arcseconds . Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815 ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1 @.@ 2 to 8 @.@ 9 AU . Using the Solar System for comparison , the orbit of Mars is about 1 @.@ 5 AU , Ceres in the asteroid belt 2 @.@ 7 AU , Jupiter 5 @.@ 5 AU — so , assuming Betelgeuse occupying the place of the Sun , its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit , not quite reaching Saturn at 9 @.@ 5 AU . 
 The precise diameter has been hard to define for several reasons : 
 Betelgeuse is a pulsating star , so its diameter changes with time ; 
 The star has no definable " edge " as limb darkening causes the optical emissions to vary in color and decrease the farther one extends out from the center ; 
 Betelgeuse is surrounded by a circumstellar envelope composed of matter ejected from the star — matter which absorbs and emits light — making it difficult to define the photosphere of the star ; 
 Measurements can be taken at varying wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum and the difference in reported diameters can be as much as 30 – 35 % , yet comparing one finding with another is difficult as the star 's apparent size differs depending on the wavelength used . Studies have shown that the measured angular diameter is considerably larger at ultraviolet wavelengths , decreases through the visible to a minimum in the near @-@ infrared , and increase again in the mid @-@ infrared spectrum ; 
 Atmospheric twinkling limits the resolution obtainable from ground @-@ based telescopes since turbulence degrades angular resolution . 
 To overcome these challenges , researchers have employed various solutions . Astronomical interferometry , first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868 , was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy and led to the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s , and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse . Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object , Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star 's spatial intensity distribution . The science evolved quickly and multiple @-@ aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images , which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution . It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s . Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics , space observatories like Hipparcos , Hubble and Spitzer , and the Astronomical Multi @-@ <unk> <unk> ( AMBER ) , which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously , allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution . 
 Which part of the electromagnetic spectrum — the visible , near @-@ infrared ( NIR ) or mid @-@ infrared ( MIR ) — produces the most accurate angular measurement is still debated . In 1996 , Manfred Bester , working with the ISI in the mid @-@ infrared , led a team at the Space Sciences Laboratory ( SSL ) at U.C. Berkeley to produce a solution , showing Betelgeuse with a uniform disk of 56 @.@ 6 ± 1 @.@ 0 mas . In 2000 , the SSL team produced another measure of 54 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 3 mas , ignoring any possible contribution from hotspots , which are less noticeable in the mid @-@ infrared . Also included was a theoretical allowance for limb darkening , yielding a diameter of 55 @.@ 2 ± 0 @.@ 5 mas . The Bester estimate equates to a radius of roughly 5 @.@ 6 AU or 1200 R ☉ , assuming the 2008 Harper distance of 197 @.@ 0 ± 45 pc , a figure roughly the size of the Jovian orbit of 5 @.@ 5 AU , published in 2009 in Astronomy Magazine and a year later in NASA 's Astronomy Picture of the Day . 
 A team of astronomers working in the near @-@ infrared and led by Guy Perrin of the Observatoire de Paris produced a 2004 document arguing that the more accurate photospheric measurement was 43 @.@ 33 ± 0 @.@ 04 mas . The study also put forth an explanation as to why varying wavelengths from the visible to mid @-@ infrared produce different diameters : the star is seen through a thick , warm extended atmosphere . At short wavelengths ( the visible spectrum ) the atmosphere scatters light , thus slightly increasing the star 's diameter . At near @-@ infrared wavelengths ( K and L bands ) , the scattering is negligible , so the classical photosphere can be directly seen ; in the mid @-@ infrared the scattering increases once more causing the thermal emission of the warm atmosphere to increase the apparent diameter . 
 Studies with the <unk> and VLTI published in 2009 brought strong support to Perrin 's analysis and yielded diameters ranging from 42 @.@ 57 to 44 @.@ 28 mas with comparatively insignificant margins of error . In 2011 , Keiichi <unk> and colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy produced a third estimate in the near @-@ infrared corroborating Perrin 's numbers , this time showing a limb @-@ darkened disk diameter of 42 @.@ 49 ± 0 @.@ 06 mas . Consequently , if one combines the smaller Hipparcos distance from van Leeuwen of 152 ± 20 pc with Perrin 's angular measurement of 43 @.@ 33 mas , a near @-@ infrared photospheric estimate would equate to about 3 @.@ 4 AU or 730 R ☉ . A 2014 paper derives an angular diameter of 42 @.@ 28 mas ( equivalent to a 41 @.@ 01 mas uniform disc ) using H and K band observations made with the VLTI AMBER instrument . 
 Central to this discussion is another paper published in 2009 by the Berkeley team , led by Charles Townes , reporting that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15 % , with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47 @.@ 0 mas , not too far from Perrin 's estimate . Unlike most earlier papers , this study encompassed a 15 @-@ year period at one specific wavelength . Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths , often yielding vastly different results . The diminution in Betelgeuse 's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 1 mas seen in 1993 to 47 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 1 mas seen in 2008 — a contraction of almost 0 @.@ 9 AU in 15 years . What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star 's photosphere as astronomers have theorized , and if so , what the periodic cycle might be , although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist , it is probably a few decades long . Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis . 
 The debate about differences between measurements in the mid @-@ infrared , which suggest a possible expansion and contraction of the star , and the near @-@ infrared , which advocates a relatively constant photospheric diameter , remains to be resolved . In a paper published in 2012 , the Berkeley team reported that their measurements were " dominated by the behavior of cool , optically thick material above the stellar photosphere , " indicating that the apparent expansion and contraction may be due to activity in the star 's outer shells and not the photosphere itself . This conclusion , if further corroborated , would suggest an average angular diameter for Betelgeuse closer to Perrin 's estimate at 43 @.@ 33 arcseconds , hence a stellar radius of about 3 @.@ 4 AU ( 730 R ☉ ) assuming the shorter Hipparcos distance of 498 ± 73 ly in lieu of Harper 's estimate at 643 ± 146 ly . The Gaia spacecraft may clarify assumptions presently used in calculating the size of Betelgeuse 's stellar disk . 
 Once considered as having the largest angular diameter of any star in the sky after the Sun , Betelgeuse lost that distinction in 1997 when a group of astronomers measured R Doradus with a diameter of 57 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 5 mas . Betelgeuse is now considered to be in third place , although R Doradus , being much closer to Earth at about 200 ly , has a diameter roughly one @-@ third that of Betelgeuse . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Betelgeuse is a very large , luminous and cool star classified as a red supergiant of M1 @-@ 2 Ia @-@ ab class . The letter " M " in this designation means that it is a red star belonging to the M spectral class and therefore has a relatively low photospheric temperature ; the " Ia @-@ ab " suffix luminosity class indicates that it is an intermediate luminous supergiant , with properties partway between a normal supergiant and a luminous supergiant . Uncertainties regarding the star 's surface temperature , angular diameter and distance make it difficult to achieve a precise measurement of Betelgeuse 's luminosity . Research from 2012 gives Betelgeuse an average luminosity of <unk> ± 30000 L ☉ , assuming a median temperature of 3300 K and a radius of 1200 R ☉ . However , because most of the star 's radiation is in the near infrared , the human eye cannot perceive the star 's intrinsic brightness . Since 1943 , the spectrum of Betelgeuse has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified . 
 The mass of Betelgeuse has never been measured because it has no known companion . A mass estimate is only possible using theoretical modeling , a situation which has produced mass estimates ranging from 5 to 30 M ☉ in the 2000s . Smith and colleagues calculated that Betelgeuse began its life as a star of 15 to 20 M ⊙ , based on a luminosity of <unk> – 150000 L ☉ . A novel method of determining the supergiant 's mass was proposed in 2011 by Hilding Neilson and colleagues , arguing for a current stellar mass of 11 @.@ 6 M ⊙ with an upper limit of 16 @.@ 6 and lower of 7 @.@ 7 M ⊙ , based on observations of the star 's intensity profile from narrow H @-@ band interferometry and using a photospheric measurement of roughly 4 @.@ 3 AU or 955 R ⊙ . 
 Due to its variability and the presence of hotspots , the photospheric temperature of Betelgeuse is uncertain . Studies since 2001 report temperatures ranging from <unk> to 3 @,@ 641 K with a median of about 3300 K. The star is also a slow rotator and the most recent velocity recorded was 5 km / s . Depending on its photospheric radius , it could take the star from 25 to 32 years to turn on its axis — much slower than Antares , which has a rotational velocity of 20 km / s . 
 In 2002 , astronomers using computer simulations speculated that Betelgeuse might exhibit magnetic activity in its extended atmosphere , a factor where even moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star 's dust , wind and mass @-@ loss properties . A series of <unk> observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot Telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory revealed the presence of a weak magnetic field at the surface of Betelgeuse , suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to trigger the onset of a small @-@ scale dynamo effect . 
 = = = Motion = = = 
 The kinematics of Betelgeuse are complex . The age of Class M supergiants with an initial mass of 20 <formula> is roughly 10 million years . Given its motion , a corresponding projection back in time would take Betelgeuse around 290 parsecs farther from the galactic plane — an implausible location , as there is no star formation region there . Moreover , Betelgeuse 's projected pathway does not appear to intersect with the 25 Ori <unk> or the far younger Orion Nebula Cluster ( ONC , also known as Ori <unk> ) , particularly since Very Long Baseline Array astrometry yields a distance to the ONC between 389 and 414 parsecs . Consequently , it is likely that Betelgeuse has not always had its current motion through space and has changed course at one time or another , possibly the result of a nearby stellar explosion . 
 The most likely star @-@ formation scenario for Betelgeuse is that it is a runaway star from the Orion OB1 Association . Originally a member of a high @-@ mass multiple system within Ori <unk> , Betelgeuse was probably formed about 10 – 12 million years ago from molecular clouds observed in Orion , but has evolved rapidly due to its high mass . 
 Like many young stars in Orion whose mass is greater than 10 <formula> , Betelgeuse will use its fuel quickly and not live long . On the Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram , Betelgeuse has moved off the main sequence and has swelled and cooled to become a red supergiant . Although young , Betelgeuse has probably exhausted the hydrogen in its core — unlike its OB cousins born about the same time — causing it to contract under the force of gravity into a hotter and denser state . As a result , it has begun to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen producing enough radiation to unfurl its outer envelopes of hydrogen and helium . Its mass and luminosity are such that the star will eventually fuse higher elements through neon , magnesium , sodium , and silicon all the way to iron , at which point it will probably collapse and explode as a type II supernova . 
 = = = Density = = = 
 As an early M @-@ type supergiant , Betelgeuse is one of the largest , most luminous and yet one of the most ethereal stars known . A radius of 5 @.@ 5 AU is roughly 1180 times the radius of the Sun — able to contain over 2 quadrillion Earths ( 2 @.@ 15 × 1015 ) or more than 1 @.@ 6 billion ( 1 @.@ 65 × 109 ) Suns . That is the equivalent of Betelgeuse being a football stadium like Wembley Stadium in London with the Earth a tiny pearl , 1 millimeter in diameter , orbiting a Sun the size of a mango . Moreover , observations from 2009 of Betelgeuse exhibiting a 15 % contraction in angular diameter would equate to a shortening of the star 's radius from about 5 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 6 AU , assuming that the photosphere is a perfect sphere . A reduction of this magnitude would correspond to a diminution in photospheric volume of about 41 % . 
 Not only is the photosphere enormous , but the star is surrounded by a complex circumstellar environment where light could take over three years to escape . In the outer reaches of the photosphere the density is extremely low , yet the total mass of the star is believed to be no more than 20 M ☉ . Consequently , the average density is less than twelve parts per billion ( 1 @.@ 119 × 10 − 8 ) that of the Sun . Such star matter is so tenuous that Betelgeuse has often been called a " red @-@ hot vacuum " . 
 = = = Circumstellar dynamics = = = 
 In the late phase of stellar evolution , massive stars like Betelgeuse exhibit high rates of mass loss , possibly as much as 1 M ☉ every 10000 years , resulting in a complex circumstellar environment that is constantly in flux . In a 2009 paper , stellar mass loss was cited as the " key to understanding the evolution of the universe from the earliest cosmological times to the current epoch , and of planet formation and the formation of life itself " . However , the physical mechanism is not well understood . When Schwarzschild first proposed his theory of huge convection cells , he argued it was the likely cause of mass loss in evolved supergiants like Betelgeuse . Recent work has corroborated this hypothesis , yet there are still uncertainties about the structure of their convection , the mechanism of their mass loss , the way dust forms in their extended atmosphere , and the conditions which precipitate their dramatic finale as a type II supernova . In 2001 , Graham Harper estimated a stellar wind at 0 @.@ 03 M ☉ every 10000 years , but research since 2009 has provided evidence of episodic mass loss making any total figure for Betelgeuse uncertain . Current observations suggest that a star like Betelgeuse may spend a portion of its lifetime as a red supergiant , but then cross back across the H @-@ R diagram , pass once again through a brief yellow supergiant phase and then explode as a blue supergiant or Wolf @-@ Rayet star . 
 As a result of work done by Pierre Kervella and his team at the Paris observatory , astronomers may be close to solving this mystery . They noticed a large plume of gas extending outward at least six times the stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions . The plume 's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star 's photosphere , often observed in the infrared , is not preserved in its close environment . <unk> on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths . However , due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT , these asymmetries have come into focus . The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss , Kervella noted , were large @-@ scale convection cells or polar mass loss , possibly due to rotation . Probing deeper with ESO 's AMBER , Keiichi <unk> and colleagues observed that the gas in the supergiant 's extended atmosphere is vigorously moving up and down , creating bubbles as large as the supergiant itself , leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella . 
 = = = = Asymmetric shells = = = = 
 In addition to the photosphere , six other components of Betelgeuse 's atmosphere have now been identified . They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere , a gaseous envelope , a chromosphere , a dust environment and two outer shells ( S1 and S2 ) composed of carbon monoxide ( CO ) . Some of these elements are known to be asymmetric while others overlap . 
 At about 0 @.@ 45 stellar radii ( ~ 2 – 3 AU ) above the photosphere there may lie a molecular layer known as the MOLsphere or molecular environment . Studies show it to be composed of water vapor and carbon monoxide with an effective temperature of about 1500 ± 500 K. Water vapor had been originally detected in the supergiant 's spectrum in the 1960s with the two Stratoscope projects but had been ignored for decades . The MOLsphere may also contain SiO and Al2O3 — molecules which could explain the formation of dust particles . 
 Extending for several radii ( ~ 10 – 40 AU ) about the photosphere exists another cooler region known as an asymmetric gaseous envelope . It is enriched in oxygen and especially in nitrogen relative to carbon . These composition anomalies are likely caused by contamination by CNO @-@ processed material from the inside of Betelgeuse . 
 Radio @-@ telescope images taken in 1998 confirm that Betelgeuse has a highly complex atmosphere , with a temperature of <unk> ± 850 K , similar to that recorded on the star 's surface but much lower than surrounding gas in the same region . The VLA images also show this lower @-@ temperature gas progressively cool as it extends outward . Although unexpected , it turns out to be the most abundant constituent of Betelgeuse 's atmosphere . " This alters our basic understanding of red @-@ supergiant star atmospheres " , explained Jeremy Lim , the team 's leader . " Instead of the star 's atmosphere expanding uniformly due to gas heated to high temperatures near its surface , it now appears that several giant convection cells propel gas from the star 's surface into its atmosphere . " This is the same region in which Kervella 's 2009 finding of a bright plume , possibly containing carbon and nitrogen and extending at least six photospheric radii in the southwest direction of the star , is believed to exist . 
 The chromosphere was directly imaged by the Faint Object Camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope in ultraviolet wavelengths . The images also revealed a bright area in the southwest quadrant of the disk . The average radius of the chromosphere in 1996 was about 2 @.@ 2 times the optical disk ( ~ 10 AU ) and was reported to have a temperature no higher than 5500 K. However , in 2004 observations with the STIS , Hubble 's high @-@ precision spectrometer , pointed to the existence of warm chromospheric plasma at least one arcsecond away from the star . At a distance of 197 pc , the size of the chromosphere could be up to 200 AU . The observations have conclusively demonstrated that the warm chromospheric plasma spatially overlaps and coexists with cool gas in Betelgeuse 's gaseous envelope as well as with the dust in its circumstellar dust shells ( see below ) . 
 The first attestation of a dust shell surrounding Betelgeuse was put forth by Sutton and colleagues , who noted in 1977 that dust shells around mature stars often emit large amounts of radiation in excess of the photospheric contribution . Using heterodyne interferometry , they concluded that the red supergiant emits most of its excess beyond 12 stellar radii or roughly the distance of the Kuiper belt at 50 to 60 AU , depending on the assumed stellar radius . Since then , there have been studies done of this dust envelope at varying wavelengths yielding decidedly different results . Studies from the 1990s have estimated the inner radius of the dust shell anywhere from 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 0 arcseconds , or 100 to 200 AU . These studies point out that the dust environment surrounding Betelgeuse is not static . In 1994 , <unk> et al. reported that Betelgeuse undergoes sporadic dust production involving decades of activity followed by inactivity . In 1997 , a group of astronomers led by Chris Skinner noticed significant changes in the dust shell 's morphology in one year , suggesting that the shell is asymmetrically illuminated by a stellar radiation field strongly affected by the existence of photospheric hotspots . The 1984 report of a giant asymmetric dust shell 1 pc ( <unk> AU ) from the star has not been corroborated by recent studies , although another report published the same year said that three dust shells were found extending four light @-@ years from one side of the decaying star , suggesting that Betelgeuse sheds its outer layers as it journeys . 
 Although the exact size of the two outer CO shells remains elusive , preliminary estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7 @.@ 0 arcseconds . Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5 @.@ 5 AU as the star radius , the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii ( ~ 300 to 800 AU ) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii ( ~ 1400 AU ) . The Sun 's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU , so the size of this outer shell would be almost fourteen times the size of the Solar System . 
 = = = = Supersonic bow shock = = = = 
 Betelgeuse is travelling <unk> through the interstellar medium at a speed of 30 km per second ( i.e. ~ 6 @.@ 3 AU per year ) creating a bow shock . The shock is not created by the star , but its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into the interstellar medium at a rate of 17 km / s , heating up the material surrounding the star thereby making it visible in infrared light . Because Betelgeuse is so bright , it was only in 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged . The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide , assuming a distance of 643 light @-@ years . 
 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the bow shock made in 2012 indicate that it is very young — less than 30000 years old — suggesting two possibilities : one , that Betelgeuse moved into a region of the interstellar medium with different properties recently or two , that Betelgeuse has undergone a significant transformation as its stellar wind has changed . In their 2012 paper , Mohamed et al. propose that this phenomenon was caused by Betelgeuse transitioning from a blue supergiant ( BSG ) to a red supergiant ( <unk> ) . In the late evolutionary stage of a star like Betelgeuse , evidence suggests that stars " may undergo rapid transitions from red to blue and vice versa on the Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram , with accompanying rapid changes to their stellar winds and bow shocks . " Moreover , if future research bears out this hypothesis , Betelgeuse may prove to have traveled close to 200000 AU as a red supergiant scattering as much as 3 <formula> along its trajectory . 
 = = = Approaching supernova = = = 
 The fate of Betelgeuse depends on its initial mass — a critical factor which is not well understood . Since most investigators posit a mass greater than 10 M ☉ , the most likely scenario is that the supergiant will continue to burn and fuse elements until its core collapses , at which point Betelgeuse will explode as a supernova , leaving behind a neutron star remnant about 20 km in diameter . As of 2014 , theoretical calculations for a non @-@ rotating star suggest Betelgeuse has developed a 3 – 4 M ☉ carbon @-@ oxygen core which is being enlarged by deposition of fusion products from the surrounding helium shell at about a fifth of the star 's radius . It will explode as a type II supernova within 100000 years after going through carbon , neon , oxygen , and silicon burning in the core . The remnant would be a neutron star around 1 @.@ 5 M ☉ . The estimated age for the red supergiant is between 8 and 8 @.@ 5 million years and its initial mass was 20 + 5 
 − 3 M ☉ . The exact mass , rotation rate , and mass loss are critical to Betelgeuse 's fate ; stellar evolution models show that initially rotating stars more massive than about 18 M ☉ do not explode as supernovae while they are red supergiants . Instead they lose all their outer hydrogen to become yellow hypergiants , luminous blue variables , or even Wolf @-@ Rayet stars before producing a type II @-@ L , IIb or Ib / c supernova . 
 Betelgeuse is already old for its size class and is expected to explode relatively soon compared to its age . Solving the riddle of mass @-@ loss will be the key to knowing when a supernova may occur , an event expected in the next million years . Supporting this hypothesis are unusual features that have been observed in the interstellar medium of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex , which suggest that there have been multiple supernovae in the recent past . Betelgeuse 's suspected birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association is the probable location for such supernovae . Since the oldest subgroup in the association has an approximate age of 12 million years , the more massive stars likely had sufficient time to reach the end of their lifespan and explode already . Also , because runaway stars are believed to be caused by supernovae , there is strong evidence that OB stars μ Columbae , AE Aurigae and 53 Arietis all originated from such explosions in Ori OB1 2 @.@ 2 , 2 @.@ 7 and 4 @.@ 9 million years ago . 
 J. Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas at Austin predicts Betelgeuse 's demise will emit 1046 joules of neutrinos , which will pass through the star 's hydrogen envelope in around an hour , then travel at near light speed to reach the Solar System six centuries later — providing the first evidence of the cataclysm . The supernova could brighten over a two @-@ week period to an apparent magnitude of − 12 , outshining the Moon in the night sky and becoming easily visible in broad daylight . It would remain at that intensity for two to three months before rapidly dimming . Since its rotational axis is not pointed toward the Earth , Betelgeuse 's supernova is unlikely to send a gamma ray burst in the direction of Earth large enough to damage ecosystems . The flash of ultraviolet radiation from the explosion will likely be weaker than the ultraviolet output of the Sun . The year following the explosion , radioactive decay of cobalt to iron will dominate emission from the supernova remnant , and the resulting gamma rays will be blocked by the expanding envelope of hydrogen . If the neutron star remnant becomes a pulsar , it could produce gamma rays for thousands of years . 
 Due to misunderstandings caused by the 2009 publication of the star 's 15 % contraction , Betelgeuse has frequently been the subject of scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year , leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event . The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy , particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar . In their 2012 study , physicists at the Space Sciences Laboratory point out that the apparent contraction in the star 's diameter may be due to the complex dynamics in the star 's surrounding nebula and not the star itself , reconfirming that until we better understand the nature of mass loss , predicting the timing of a supernova will remain a challenge . The latest studies project a supernova in 100000 years .

 In 1985 , Margarita Karovska , in conjunction with other astrophysicists at the Harvard – Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , announced the discovery of two close companions orbiting Betelgeuse . Analysis of polarization data from 1968 through 1983 indicated a close companion with a periodic orbit of about 2 @.@ 1 years . Using speckle interferometry , the team concluded that the closer of the two companions was located at 0 @.@ 06 ″ ± 0 @.@ 01 ″ ( ~ 9 AU ) from the main star with a position angle ( PA ) of 273 degrees , an orbit that would potentially place it within the star 's chromosphere . The more distant companion was estimated at 0 @.@ 51 ″ ± 0 @.@ 01 ″ ( ~ 77 AU ) with a PA of 278 degrees . 
 In the years that followed no confirmation of Karovska 's discovery was published . In 1992 , a team of collaborators from the Cavendish Astrophysics Group questioned the finding . They published a paper noting that the brightness features on the surface of Betelgeuse appear to be " too bright to be associated with a passage of the suggested companions in front of the red giant . " They also noticed that these features were fainter at 710 nanometers compared to 700 by a factor of 1 @.@ 8 , indicating that such features would have to reside within the molecular atmosphere of the star . Despite this , that same year Karovska published a new paper reconfirming her team 's exegesis , but also noting that there was a meaningful correlation between the calculated position angles of the orbiting companion and the reported asymmetries , suggesting a possible connection between the two . Since then , researchers have turned their attention to analyzing the intricate dynamics of the star 's extended atmosphere and little else has been published on the possibility of orbiting companions , although as Xavier <unk> and his team reiterate in 2009 , the possibility of a close companion contributing to the overall flux has never been fully ruled out . <unk> 's double star catalog ( <unk> ) lists at least four adjacent stars , all within three arcminutes of this stellar giant , yet aside from apparent magnitudes and position angles , little else is known .

 Betelgeuse has been known as Betelgeux , and in German <unk> ( according to Bode ) . Betelgeux and <unk> were used until the early 20th century , when the spelling Betelgeuse became universal .

 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Betelgeuse is often mistranslated as " armpit of the central one " . In his 1899 work Star @-@ Names and Their Meanings , American amateur naturalist Richard Hinckley Allen stated the derivation was from the <unk> الجوزاء <unk> al @-@ <unk> , which he claimed degenerated into a number of forms including Bed <unk> , Beit <unk> , Bet El @-@ <unk> , <unk> and more , to the forms Betelgeuse , Betelguese , <unk> and Betelgeux . The star was named <unk> in the Alfonsine Tables , and Italian Jesuit priest and astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli had called it <unk> or <unk> . Paul <unk> , Professor of Arabic Studies at the University of Munich , refuted Allen 's derivation and instead proposed that the full name is a corruption of the Arabic <unk> الجوزاء Yad al @-@ Jauzā ' meaning " the Hand of al @-@ Jauzā ' " , i.e. , Orion . European <unk> into medieval Latin led to the first character y ( <unk> , with two dots underneath ) being misread as a b ( <unk> , with only one dot underneath ) . During the Renaissance , the star 's name was written as بيت الجوزاء Bait al @-@ Jauzā ' ( " house of Orion " ) or <unk> الجوزاء <unk> al @-@ Jauzā ' , incorrectly thought to mean " armpit of Orion " ( a true translation of " armpit " would be <unk> , transliterated as <unk> ) . This led to the modern rendering as Betelgeuse . Other writers have since accepted <unk> 's explanation . 
 The last part of the name , " <unk> " , comes from the Arabic الجوزاء al @-@ Jauzā ' , a historical Arabic name of the constellation Orion , a feminine name in old Arabian legend , and of uncertain meaning . Because <unk> j @-@ w @-@ z , the root of <unk> ' , means " middle " , al @-@ Jauzā ' roughly means " the Central One " . Later , al @-@ Jauzā ' was also designated as the scientific Arabic name for Orion and for Gemini . The modern Arabic name for Orion is <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( " the Giant " ) , although the use of الجوزاء al @-@ Jauzā ' in the name of the star has continued . The 17th @-@ century English translator Edmund Chilmead gave it the name <unk> <unk> ( " Orion 's Hand " ) , from <unk> . Other Arabic names recorded include Al Yad al <unk> ( " the Right Hand " ) , Al <unk> ( " the Arm " ) , and Al <unk> ( " the Shoulder " ) , all appended to " of the giant " , as <unk> الجوزاء <unk> al Jauzā ' .

 Other names for Betelgeuse included the Persian <unk> " the Arm " , and Coptic <unk> " an <unk> " . Bahu was its Sanskrit name , as part of a Hindu understanding of the constellation as a running antelope or stag . In traditional Chinese astronomy , Betelgeuse was known as <unk> ( <unk> , the Fourth Star of the constellation of Three Stars ) as the Chinese constellation <unk> originally referred to the three stars in the girdle of Orion . This constellation was ultimately expanded to ten stars , but the earlier name stuck . In Japan , the Taira or Heike clan adopted Betelgeuse and its red color as its symbol , calling the star Heike @-@ boshi , ( <unk> ) , while the Minamoto or Genji clan had chosen Rigel and its white color . The two powerful families fought a legendary war in Japanese history , the stars seen as facing each other off and only kept apart by the Belt . 
 In Tahitian lore , Betelgeuse was one of the pillars propping up the sky , known as <unk> @-@ <unk> , the pillar to sit by . It was also called Ta 'urua @-@ nui @-@ o @-@ Mere " Great festivity in parental yearnings " . A Hawaiian term for it was Kaulua @-@ koko " brilliant red star " . The Lacandon people of Central America knew it as <unk> <unk> " red butterfly " . 
 = = = Mythology = = = 
 With the history of astronomy intimately associated with mythology and astrology before the scientific revolution , the red star , like the planet Mars that derives its name from a Roman war god , has been closely associated with the martial archetype of conquest for millennia , and by extension , the motif of death and rebirth . Other cultures have produced different myths . Stephen R. Wilk has proposed the constellation of Orion could have represented the Greek mythological figure Pelops , who had an artificial shoulder of ivory made for him , with Betelgeuse as the shoulder , its color reminiscent of the reddish yellow sheen of ivory . 
 In the Americas , Betelgeuse signifies a severed limb of a man @-@ figure ( Orion ) — the <unk> of Brazil know the constellation as <unk> , a hero whose leg was cut off by his wife , with the variable light from Betelgeuse linked to the severing of the limb . Similarly , the Lakota people of North America see it as a chief whose arm has been severed . The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as Ya @-@ <unk> " Owl Eyes <unk> " , its variable light signifying its intermittent watching of ceremonies led by the Red Kangaroo Leader Rigel . In South African mythology , Betelgeuse was perceived as a lion casting a predatory gaze toward the three zebras represented by Orion 's Belt . 
 A Sanskrit name for Betelgeuse was <unk> " the moist one " , eponymous of the Ardra lunar mansion in Hindu astrology . The Rigvedic God of storms Rudra presided over the star ; this association was linked by 19th @-@ century star enthusiast Richard Hinckley Allen to Orion 's stormy nature . The constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals , reflecting their village way of life . To them , Betelgeuse was <unk> " the ploughman " , alongside the rest of Orion which depicted a plough with oxen . The rising of Betelgeuse at around 3 am in late summer and autumn signified the time for village men to go to the fields and plough . To the Inuit , the appearance of Betelgeuse and Bellatrix high in the southern sky after sunset marked the beginning of spring and lengthening days in late February and early March . The two stars were known as <unk> " those ( two ) placed far apart " , referring to the distance between them , mainly to people from North Baffin Island and Melville Peninsula . 
 The opposed locations of Orion and Scorpius , with their corresponding bright variable red stars Betelgeuse and Antares , were noted by ancient cultures around the world . The setting of Orion and rising of Scorpius signify the death of Orion by the scorpion . In China they signify brothers and rivals Shen and Shang . The Batak of Sumatra marked their New Year with the first new moon after the sinking of Orion 's Belt below the horizon , at which point Betelgeuse remained " like the tail of a rooster " . The positions of Betelgeuse and Antares at opposite ends of the celestial sky were considered significant and their constellations were seen as a pair of scorpions . Scorpion days marked as nights that both constellations could be seen .

 The star 's unusual name inspired the title of the 1988 film Beetlejuice , and script writer Michael McDowell was impressed by how many people made the connection . He added that they had received a suggestion the sequel be named <unk> @-@ 69 202 after the former star of SN 1987A . In August Derleth 's short story " The Dweller in the Darkness " set in H. P. Lovecraft 's Cthulhu Mythos , Betelgeuse is the home of the " benign " Elder Gods . The identity of the red star <unk> mentioned in Lord of the Rings was much debated ; Aldebaran , Betelgeuse and the planet Mars were touted as candidates . Professor Kristine Larsen has concluded the evidence points to it being Aldebaran as it precedes <unk> ( Orion ) . Astronomy writer Robert Burnham , Jr. proposed the term <unk> which denotes a rare orange sapphire in India , for the star . In the popular science fiction series The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams , Ford Prefect was from " a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse . " In the poetic work Betelguese , a Trip Through Hell by Jean Louis De Esque , hell is on Betelgeuse because De Esque believed that it was " a celestial pariah , an outcast , the largest of all known comets or outlawed suns in the universe .

 Two American navy ships were named after the star , both of them World War II vessels , the USS Betelgeuse ( AKA @-@ 11 ) launched in 1939 and USS Betelgeuse ( AK @-@ 260 ) launched in 1944 . In 1979 , a French supertanker named Betelgeuse was moored off <unk> Island discharging oil when it exploded , killing 50 people in one of the worst disasters in Ireland 's history .

 = HMS Amazon ( 1799 ) = 
 HMS Amazon was a frigate of the Royal Navy . She served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars under several notable naval commanders and played a key role in the Battle of Copenhagen under Captain Edward Riou , when Riou commanded the frigate squadron during the attack . After Riou was killed during the battle , command briefly devolved to First @-@ Lieutenant John Quilliam . Quilliam made a significant impression on Rear @-@ Admiral Horatio Nelson who appointed him to serve on the flagship HMS Victory , and Amazon passed to William Parker , who continued the association with Nelson with service in the Mediterranean and participation in the chase to the West Indies during the Trafalgar Campaign . She went on to join Sir John Borlase Warren ’ s squadron in the Atlantic and took part in the defeat of Charles @-@ Alexandre Léon Durand Linois 's forces at the Action of 13 March 1806 . During the battle , she hunted down and captured the 40 @-@ gun frigate Belle Poule . 
 Amazon continued in service for several more years , being active in combating raiders and privateers , before being withdrawn from active service in late 1811 . She was retained in ordinary until several years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars , when she was broken up . 
 = = Construction and commissioning = = 
 One of two ships built to a design by Sir William Rule , Amazon was ordered from Woolwich Dockyard on 27 April 1796 and laid down there that month . She was launched on 18 May 1799 and quickly put into service , having cost £ 33 @,@ 972 to build , including fitting her out . She was commissioned in May 1799 under her first commander , Captain Edward Riou . 
 = = British waters and the Baltic = = 
 Riou and the Amazon served initially in the English Channel , capturing the French privateer Bougainville on 14 February 1800 . She was out of Saint Malo , mounted eighteen 6 @-@ pounder guns , and had a crew of 82 men under the command of Pierre Dupont . The next day , she collided with Amazon and eventually sank , with the loss of one man drowned . 
 Amazon sailed from Portsmouth for Jamaica with Severn and Scorpion on 26 April 1800 as escorts for a large convoy . Amazon would only accompany the convoy to " a certain latitude . " 
 Riou and Amazon were then assigned to Sir Hyde Parker 's expedition to the Baltic in 1801 , to compel the Danes to abandon the League of Armed Neutrality . 
 Riou worked closely with Parker 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear @-@ Admiral Horatio Nelson , and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead @-@ up to the Battle of Copenhagen , and Nelson duly appointed Riou commander of the frigates and smaller vessels , instructing <unk> to deploy his ships in support of the main fleet . As the battle began , several of Nelson 's ships of the line ran aground on shoals in the harbour , forcing the improvisation of a new plan of attack . As Nelson 's ships engaged their Danish counterparts , Riou took his frigates in to harass the <unk> Fort and blockships . Although the frigates were heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed , they maintained the engagement for several hours . The ships suffered heavy casualties , and a splinter hit Riou on the head . 
 At 1 @.@ 15 pm , Parker was waiting outside the harbour with the reserve and raised a signal ordering Nelson to withdraw . Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it , while Nelson 's second in command , Rear @-@ Admiral Thomas Graves , repeated the signal but too did not obey it . Riou now found himself in a difficult position . Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order , he remained in action for a further half an hour before reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw . 
 Withdrawing forced his ships to turn their sterns to the Danish guns , thereby exposing their most vulnerable area . When HMS Alcmene and then HMS Blanche withdrew , this reduced the thick cloud of <unk> that was helping to obscure the British ships and left Amazon exposed to the full force of the Danish guns . Lieutenant @-@ Colonel William Stuart , commanding the soldiers of the 48th Regiment , recorded that Riou was killed : 
 [ He ] was sitting on a gun , was encouraging his men , and had been wounded in the head by a splinter . He had expressed himself grieved at being thus obliged to retreat , and nobly observed , ' What will Nelson think of us ? ' His clerk was killed by his side ; and by another shot , several marines , while hauling on the main @-@ brace , shared the same fate . Riou then exclaimed , ' Come , then , my boys , let us all die together ! ' The words were scarcely uttered , when the fatal shot severed him in two . 
 Command of Amazon devolved to her first lieutenant , John Quilliam , who completed the withdrawal . Nelson went aboard the badly damaged Amazon after the battle and asked Quilliam how he was doing . Quilliam replied ' <unk> ' , a response that apparently amused Nelson and may have contributed to Nelson 's subsequent appointment of Quilliam as first lieutenant aboard HMS Victory .

 Command of the Amazon then passed to Captain Samuel Sutton , who was succeeded the following year by Captain William Parker . Under Parker , Amazon captured the 16 @-@ gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803 , and survived a brush with a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804 . Amazon was one of the ships to take part in the Trafalgar Campaign the following year , serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean . On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon . The Amazon was a notably smart ship , and had just been repainted , so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm . Parker duly returned with a shipment , prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour ' Well , Parker , of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything ; have you brought a dozen and a half , or a dozen ? ' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep , prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service . 
 Parker and the Amazon remained with Nelson after the division of the Mediterranean commands left the Spanish coasts under the supervision of Sir John Orde . Nelson suspected that Orde was intercepting his despatches and commandeering Nelson 's frigates to use himself . Nelson therefore ordered Parker not to stop for any of Orde 's ships if this was possible . Parker attempted this but was intercepted by HMS Eurydice . He was however able to convince the Eurydice 's commander , William Hoste , to turn a blind eye and having delivered his despatches to Lisbon , acted on Nelson 's hint that he was not expected back until February by carrying out a cruise that netted him several prizes worth a total of £ 20 @,@ 000 . Orde complained about the ' poaching ' taking place on his station , but the prize money went to Parker and Nelson .

 Amazon went on to join Nelson in the chase to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign . During the voyage across the Atlantic , Nelson wanted to pass on specific instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French , but did not want to lose time by ordering his ships to heave to . Instead he gave the plans to Parker , who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the ' best frigate captain in the service ' , and Parker sped along the line in Amazon , delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost ' hardly a yard of ground ' . Once more in European waters after the fleet 's return , Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805 . Principe was armed with twenty @-@ four 9 @-@ pounder guns and four swivels . Her crew of 160 men , under the command of Captain François Beck , were principally French . She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon , and the letter of marque Lady Nelson , which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow . Part of Lady Nelson 's crew was aboard Principe , as was a considerable amount of specie . 
 Amazon was back in the Atlantic in 1806 , this time as part of Sir John Borlase Warren ’ s pursuit of Jean @-@ Baptiste Philibert Willaumez . When Warren 's fleet unexpectedly encountered a separate French fleet under Charles @-@ Alexandre Léon Durand Linois , Amazon became involved in the resulting Action of 13 March 1806 . During the battle she hunted down and captured the 40 @-@ gun frigate Belle Poule in a running engagement . The Amazon lost four killed and five wounded during the engagement , while the Belle Poule lost six killed and 24 wounded . Amazon captured the 14 @-@ gun privateer Général Pérignon on 21 January 1810 , and Captain John Joyce succeeded Parker as captain in May . Joyce captured the 14 @-@ gun privateer <unk> on 23 March 1811 .

 True at First Light is a book by American novelist Ernest Hemingway about his 1953 – 54 East African safari with his fourth wife Mary , released posthumously in his centennial year in 1999 . The book received mostly negative or lukewarm reviews from the popular press and sparked a literary controversy regarding how , and whether , an author 's work should be reworked and published after his death . Unlike critics in the popular press , Hemingway scholars generally consider True at First Light to be complex and a worthy addition to his canon of later fiction . 
 In a two @-@ day period in January 1954 , Hemingway and Mary were in two plane crashes in the African bush . He was reported dead by the international press , arriving in Entebbe to face questions from reporters . The severity of his injuries was not completely known until he returned to Europe months later . Hemingway spent much of the next two years in Havana , recuperating and writing the manuscript of what he called ' the Africa book ' , which remained unfinished at the time of his suicide in July , 1961 . In the 1970s , Mary donated it along with his other manuscripts to the John F. Kennedy Library . The manuscript was released to Hemingway 's son Patrick in the mid @-@ 1990s . Patrick edited the work to half its original length to strengthen the underlying storyline and emphasize the fictional aspects . The result is a blend of memoir and fiction . 
 In the book , Hemingway explores conflict within a marriage , the conflict between the European and native cultures in Africa , and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible . The book includes descriptions of his earlier friendships with other writers and digressive ruminations on the nature of writing . 
 = = Background = = 
 Hemingway went on safari to Africa in 1933 with his second wife Pauline and always intended to return . That visit inspired Hemingway 's " Snows of Kilimanjaro " published in The Green Hills of Africa , well @-@ known parts of the Hemingway canon . Two decades later in 1953 , having finished writing The Old Man and the Sea , he planned a trip to Africa to visit his son Patrick who lived in Tanganyika . When Look magazine offered to send him to Africa , paying $ 15 @,@ 000 for expenses , $ 10 @,@ 000 for rights to a 3500 word piece about the trip , and Earl Theisen as official photographer to go with him , he quickly accepted . Hemingway and Mary left Cuba in June , traveling first to Europe to make arrangements and leaving from Venice to Tanganyika a few months later . They arrived in August , and Hemingway was thrilled to be deputized as an honorary ranger , writing in a letter , " due to emergency ( Mau Mau rebellion ) been acting game ranger " . Philip Percival , Hemingway 's safari guide in 1933 , joined the couple for the four @-@ month expedition ; they traveled from the banks of the <unk> , where Earl Theisen photographed Hemingway with a herd of elephants , to the <unk> Swamp , the Rift Valley and then on to visit Patrick in central Tanganyika . After visiting Patrick at his farm , they settled for two months on the north slopes of Mt . Kilimanjaro . During this period Percival left their camp to return to his farm , leaving Hemingway as game warden with local scouts reporting to him . Hemingway was proud to be a game warden and believed a book would come of the experience . 
 On January 21 Hemingway chartered a sightseeing flight of the Congo Basin as a late Christmas present to Mary ; two days later , on their way to photograph Murchison Falls from the air , the plane hit an abandoned utility pole and crashed , with the passengers sustaining minor injuries . That night they camped in the bush waiting for a response to their distress call . The crash site was seen by a passing airliner that reported no survivors , and the news of Hemingway 's death was telegraphed around the world . The next day they were found and picked up by a bush pilot , but his de Havilland caught fire during take @-@ off , crashed and exploded , which left Hemingway with a concussion , scalp wound , double @-@ vision , intermittent hearing in his left ear , a crushed vertebra , ruptured liver , spleen and kidney , and burns . The explosion burned their passports , " thirty rolls of exposed film , three pairs of Ernest 's <unk> , all of their money , and their $ 15 @,@ 000 letter of credit . " The group traveled to Entebbe by road , where journalists from around the world had gathered to report his death . On January 26 Hemingway briefed and joked with the reporters , and spent the next few weeks in Nairobi recuperating and reading his obituaries . During his recuperation Hemingway immediately prepared the piece for Look . The magazine paid him an additional $ 20 @,@ 000 for an exclusive about the plane crashes . Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that the piece , " ran for twenty magazine pages spread out over two issues " , with the first issue bearing a publication date of 26 January . 
 In spite of his injuries , Hemingway joined Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing trip in February , but he was irascible and difficult to get along with . When a bushfire broke out , Hemingway fell into the fire while helping extinguish the flames , burning himself on his legs , front torso , lips , left hand and right forearm . Months later in Venice , Hemingway was diagnosed with two cracked discs , a kidney and liver rupture , a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull . 
 As soon as Hemingway returned to Finca Vigía in Cuba , he began work on a book about the safari , wanting to write while it was still vivid in his memory . He quickly wrote 10 @,@ 000 words , despite his pain ( eventually the manuscript grew to about 800 pages ) . In September 1954 , Hemingway wrote in a letter , " At present I work at about 1 / 2 the capacity I should but everything is better all the time . " However , three months later in late December he wrote in a letter : " This has been sort of a rough year .... We call this ' black @-@ ass ' and one should never have it . But I get tired of pain sometimes , even if that is an ignoble feeling . " 
 Almost a year later in October 1955 , he declared : " Am passed 650 pages in the book . Am trying to write now like a good <unk> 's ( sic ) apprentice ... always start to write as an apprentice . By the end of the book you are a master but if you commence as master in writing anyway , you end as a bloody bore . " Two months later , Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease . By January 1956 , he acknowledged , in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents , he was having trouble remembering the trip . In 1956 , Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of The Old Man and the Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book . He wrote to his editor , " I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book . " Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe @-@ deposit box in Havana , although after the 1959 Cuban revolution he feared the manuscript lost . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The book is set in mid @-@ 20th century Kenya Colony during the Mau @-@ Mau rebellion . In his introduction to True at First Light , Patrick Hemingway describes the Kikuyu and Kamba tribes at the time of the Mau @-@ Mau rebellion . He explains that if the Kamba had joined the rebellion , Ernest and Mary Hemingway " would have then stood a good chance of being hacked to death in their beds as they slept by the very servants they so trusted and thought they understood . " The book takes place in December while the narrator , Ernest , and his wife , Mary , are in a safari camp in the Kenyan highlands on the flank of Mt . Kilimanjaro , where they find themselves temporarily at risk when a group of Mau @-@ Mau rebels escape from jail . 
 The blend of travel memoir and fiction opens with the white hunter Philip Percival leaving the safari group to visit his farm , handing control of the camp to Ernest , who is worried about being attacked and robbed , because there are guns , alcohol , and food in the camp . <unk> as an assistant game warden , he makes daily rounds in the game reserve , and maintains communication with the local tribes . He is accompanied by two African game scouts , <unk> and Arap <unk> and , for a period , the district game warden <unk> ( Gin Crazed ) . Other camp members include Keiti , who runs the camp , the safari cook , <unk> , and two stewards , <unk> and <unk> . 
 For six months Mary has been tracking a large black @-@ maned lion , determined to finish the hunt by Christmas . In subsequent chapters , Ernest worries that Mary is unable to kill the lion for various reasons : she is too short to see the prey in the tall grass ; she misses her shots with other game ; and he thinks she is too soft @-@ hearted to kill the animal . During this period , Ernest becomes entranced with Debba , a woman from a local village , whom the others jokingly refer to as his second wife . From her and the villagers he wants to learn tribal practices and customs . 
 When Mary 's lion is finally killed at the book 's halfway mark , the local <unk> ( village ) gathers for a <unk> ( dance ) . Because she has dysentery , Mary leaves for Nairobi to see a doctor ; while she is gone Ernest kills a leopard , after which the men have a protracted <unk> . When Mary returns from Nairobi , she asks Ernest for an airborne sightseeing tour of the Congo Basin as a Christmas present . 
 Ernest describes his close relationships with the local men ; indulges in memories of previous relationships with writers such as George Orwell , and D.H. Lawrence ; and satirizes the role of organized religion . Subjects as diverse as the smell of the pine woods in Michigan , the nature of Parisian cafés , and the quality of Simenon 's writing are treated with stream of consciousness digressions . 
 The back of the book includes a section titled " Cast of Characters " , a Swahili glossary , and the editor 's acknowledgments . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The ownership of Hemingway 's manuscripts is complicated . Two books have been published from the African book manuscript : True at First Light , edited by Patrick Hemingway , and Under Kilimanjaro , edited by scholars Robert Lewis and Robert Fleming . In 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation , and in the 1970s she donated her husband 's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library . A group of Hemingway scholars met in 1980 to assess the donated papers when they formed the Hemingway Society , " committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship " . After Mary Hemingway 's 1986 death , Hemingway 's sons John and Patrick asked the Hemingway Society to take on the duties of the Hemingway Foundation ; in 1997 the Hemingway Estate and the Hemingway Society / Foundation agreed to a two @-@ part publishing plan for the African book . An abridged trade publication of True at First Light was to be published in 1999 , to be edited by Patrick Hemingway ; the Hemingway Foundation would then oversee the reworking of the entire text , to be published as Under Kilimanjaro . Of Under Kilimanjaro , the editors claim " this book deserves as complete and faithful a publication as possible without editorial distortion , speculation , or textually unsupported attempts at improvement " . 
 In the early 1970s , portions of the manuscript had been serialized in Sports Illustrated and anthologized . Mary Hemingway approved the segments published by Sports Illustrated : segments described by Patrick Hemingway as a " straight account of a shooting safari " . In a 1999 talk presented at the annual Oak Park Hemingway Society dinner , Patrick Hemingway admitted ownership of Ernest Hemingway 's manuscripts had " a rather tortuous history " . Access to the Africa manuscript — and to other Hemingway material — required a lawsuit and an eventual agreement with the Hemingway Society . 
 Scribner 's requested a book of fewer than 100 @,@ 000 words . Patrick Hemingway worked for two years with the 200 @,@ 000 @-@ word manuscript — initially converting to an electronic format , and then editing out superfluous material . He strengthened the storyline , and eliminated long descriptive passages with disparaging remarks about family members and living persons . He explains the manuscript was a draft lacking " ordinary housekeeping chores " such as character names . The cuts made , he said , maintained the integrity of the story and " the reader is not deprived of the essential quality of the book " . 
 True at First Light was published on July 7 , 1999 with a print run of 200 @,@ 000 . For the publicity campaign , Patrick Hemingway appeared on the Today Show on the day of publication . The book became the main selection for the Book of the Month Club ( <unk> ) , was serialized in the New Yorker , and rights were sold for translations to Danish , French , German , Icelandic , Italian , Norwegian , Polish , Spanish , and Swedish . A sound recording was released in 2007 .

 In The New York Times James Woods described True at First Light as a travel journal that became a " fanciful memoir " and then a novel of sorts . Patrick Hemingway believed adamantly the manuscript was more than a journal . He emphasized the storyline because , as he explains , " the essential quality of the book is an action with a love interest " . He tightened the hunting scenes , and to honor his father 's statement to the reader that " where I go , you go " he emphasized the mid @-@ 20th century Africa scenes and " the real relation between people ... on that continent " . Although he fictionalized the storyline , Patrick Hemingway said of the characters , " I knew every single one ... very well indeed " . Hemingway scholar Robert Fleming ( who reworked the manuscript as Under Kilimanjaro ) considers Patrick Hemingway 's editing essentially to be correct because he believes the work shows evidence of an author unable to " turn off the mechanism that produces fiction " . The marital conflict is where Fleming believes the book took " a metafictional turn " . The published book is marketed as fiction . 
 Fleming considers True at First Light similar to Hemingway 's Green Hills of Africa and A Moveable Feast — a book that presents a primary topic as a backdrop interspersed with internal dialogue . Unlike the other two books , True at First Light is without a preface " indicating the intentions of the author or dictating how he intended to have the book read " . Fleming thinks Hemingway regarded Green Hills of Africa as experimental and A Moveable Feast as fiction . Rose Marie Burwell , author of Hemingway : The Postwar Years and the Posthumous Novels , believes Hemingway enjoyed writing the " strange combination of memoir and fiction " . She thinks in the fictional aspects of True at First Light he is free to imagine a second wife and to jettison his Protestant background . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Hemingway is " most definitely on vacation " in True at First Light writes Fleming ; and Burwell sees an author who is willingly and happily enjoying a vacation , behaving childishly , blissfully unaware of the effect his behavior has on the members of camp . The impression is of a man seeking to delve into cultural conflicts in Africa , which takes a fictional turn in the Debba storyline . Mary is characterized as a nag whereas the character of the writer is presented as " placid , mature , and loving " , immersing himself in native culture . 
 Burwell and Fleming says the book 's subtext is about aging , as symbolized by the writer 's attraction to the younger fertile woman , and Hemingway used fertility imagery to symbolize " the aging writer 's anxiety about his ability to write " . The images of the old elephant symbolize the aging and unproductive writer , and Burwell approves Patrick Hemingway 's decision to retain those pieces of the manuscript . Hemingway scholar Hilary Justice writes the work shows an emphasis on " the writer not writing " , which for Hemingway would have been a fate worse than aging . Thus , she says , True at First Light invokes a paradox with " an aging writer for whom writing is becoming increasingly difficult in the moment of writing about the not @-@ writing author " . Writing , for Hemingway , had always been difficult . He revised his work endlessly and stuck to the practice of writing " one true sentence " and stopping each writing session when he still had more to write . Tom Jenks , editor of an earlier posthumously published book The Garden of Eden , says Hemingway shows the worst of his writing in True at First Light : presenting himself as a " self @-@ pitying , self @-@ indulgent , self @-@ aggrandizing " persona in a book that is no more than a mass of fragmentary material . Jenks thinks Hemingway is simply aimlessly writing and the plot lacks the tension notable in his earliest works such as The Sun Also Rises . However , he thinks Hemingway had good material to work with and some skeletal thematic structures show promise . 
 True at First Light shows the nature of mid @-@ 20th century conflict in Africa . Colonialism and imperialism pressured African tribes and wildlife . Hemingway shows an awareness of the political future and turmoil in Africa according to Patrick <unk> who , although he lived in Tanzania ( formerly Tanganyika ) for decades , was surprised at the degree of perception apparent in his father 's mid @-@ century writing about Africa . Hemingway scholar Anders Hallengren notes the thematic similarities in Hemingway 's posthumous fiction , particularly in the final books . The genesis of True at First Light was an African insurrection , also symbolically depicted in The Garden of Eden : " The conviction and purposefulness of the Maji @-@ Maji in The Garden of Eden , corresponds to the Kenyan Mau @-@ Mau context of the novel True at First Light " . Writing for The Hemingway Review , Robert <unk> says the clash of cultures is " massively active " in the book with Hemingway exploring tribal practices ; Christianity and Islam are juxtaposed against native religions ; and the Mary / Debba triangle is symbolic of the white " <unk> and the native girl " . 
 Similar to his first African book , Green Hills of Africa , Hemingway embeds in True at First Light digressions and ruminations about the nature of writing , with particular attention to James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence . Patrick Hemingway explains his father was interested in D.H. Lawrence 's belief that each region of the world " should have its own religion " — apparent when the male character invents his own religion . Mary 's intent to decorate a tree for Christmas mystified the native camp members , and Hemingway seemed to realize that Africa was a place without an influential and established religion — a place where religion could be redefined . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Although it was listed on The New York Times Best Seller list , the book received poor reviews from the popular press , although better reviews from Hemingway scholars . In a pre @-@ publication review for The New York Times , Ralph Blumenthal said that True at First Light was not as good as Hemingway 's earlier autobiographical fiction , and he questioned whether Hemingway would have wanted his " reputation and last printed words entrusted solely to any editor , even a son " . Blumenthal wondered about the autobiographical aspects of the work : the relationship between Hemingway and Debba ; the background of the Look magazine photoshoot ; the safari itself ; and the subsequent plane accidents . In the 1999 The New York Times review , James Wood claimed Hemingway knew True at First Light was not a novel though the editors billed it as one . He believes Hemingway 's later work became a parody of the earlier work . True at First Light represents the worst of Hemingway 's work according to a review in The Guardian . 
 Christopher Ondaatje writes in The Independent that the existence of a Hemingway industry tends to overshadow his posthumous work . He considers Hemingway 's African stories to be among his best although the posthumous work about Africa has been disregarded or overlooked . In her piece for Nation , Brenda <unk> describes the book as " poignant but not particularly good " . However , she points out that it " reminds us of Hemingway 's writing at its most touching , acute and beautiful best " . The review in Publishers Weekly is much the same saying the " old Hemingway magic flashes sporadically , like lightning , but not often enough " . 
 Hemingway scholars think the work is more complicated and important than a cursory read suggests . With the publication of True at First Light critics saw a more humane and empathetic Hemingway , and began to shift their emphasis away from the image of the " white man with a gun . " Robert Fleming considers True at First Light to be part of the Hemingway canon declaring , " This is a more complicated book than it appears to be , and Hemingway deserves far more credit for it than the reviewers of the popular press have given it . Serious critics dealing with the late works would be advised not to ignore it " . <unk> praises the prose style , which he says is a new direction in Hemingway 's writing ; he also believes , despite the editing , the book is cohesive and whole with well @-@ ordered themes . Burwell considers the edits to the manuscript generally well @-@ done , though she laments losses that she thinks contribute to some of the subtexts in the book . Biographer Kenneth Lynn criticized Hemingway 's sons for editing the manuscript but of Hemingway he says the " memoirist is being totally , indeed helplessly honest , " and Gray concedes the publication of the book " underscores Hemingway 's courage as a writer " . Despite what he considers poor workmanship in the book , Wood considers Hemingway even at his worst a compelling writer and he says the literary estate should be left alone to save the literary influence . 
 = = Publication controversy = = 
 Many reviewers and writers were critical of the manner in which Patrick Hemingway edited the work . Paul Gray titled his review of the book " Where 's Papa ? " , answering with the opening sentence , " He 's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work " , pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway 's editing of the manuscript . Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been " outraged by his sons ' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication " and was outraged that " Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers , Jack and Gregory , share his belief that ' this job was worth doing ' " . Burwell also wonders whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published , pointing to his statement , " I think maybe it would be better to wait until I 'm dead to publish it " , although she concedes that works by Chaucer , Shakespeare , and Kafka were unfinished and published posthumously . During the final two decades of his life , Hemingway had published two novels but since his death , works continue to be published . Writing in The New Yorker in 1998 , Joan Didion was extremely critical of the Hemingway family and estate for commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy . " The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in his or her work is to make it " , she wrote , adding that True at First Light should not have been " molded " and published . 
 True at First Light was published in Hemingway 's centennial year , to a marketing campaign that attracted criticism . Hemingway 's sons licensed the family name and released that year items such as Thomasville furniture with labels showing the Hemingway lifestyle — " the Pamplona Sofa and the Kilimanjaro Bed " — and the Hemingway Ltd. brand , which Lynn describes as " tastefully chosen fishing rods , safari clothes , and ( surely the ultimate triumph of greed over taste ) shotguns " .

 The Smith family have dinner together , and Stan talks about the events that occurred on a documentary on animals that aired earlier . Shortly after the conversation , Steve is the first person to finish his meal , much to Stan 's surprise . Stan later becomes insecure about the incident , and he is afraid that his stance as the alpha male of the household will be dethroned . The next morning , when Steve is watching a movie on television , Stan abruptly pushes him off the couch and claims it as his " territory " by peeing all over it . Steve becomes furious , and he tells Francine about the situation in the kitchen . Francine tells him that Stan is intimidated by him , and that he feels that he will be dethroned of his dominance by him . Puzzled , Steve talks to Stan about the issue and openly challenges him of his position as the dominant person in the household . Though Steve manages to outdo him in everything , Stan is inspired by a walrus documentary to do the one thing his son can not do : have sex . Turning to Roger for help , Steve is suggested to go to a party to get laid . Informed by Klaus of this , Stan rushes to the party to stop his son . However , upon arriving there , Stan learns that Steve 's various attempts to have sex with a girl failed miserably as the boy is having a mental breakdown . Roger explains now there 's no threat to Steve challenging Stan , and no threat of Steve 's future son ( whom shall never be born ) challenging him . Stan later apologizes to him , and admits to having failed to raise him to be a man . 
 In concurrence with the chain of events , after continuously getting into arguments , Jeff and Hayley decide to take marriage counseling . They arrive at a class dedicated to pottery where the session is intended to start at , learning the counselor to be Principal Lewis . Hayley opts out of the session , but Jeff insists that she stay with the plan . The couple later arrive at Principal Lewis ' home , which is a pigsty , where he tells him that their first goal to accomplish is to clean his house . Confused , Hayley and Jeff refuse to do it , forcing Lewis to hold them at gunpoint to do the laborious tasks . Jeff later pulls out drugs that have the ability to paralyze , and Principal Lewis takes them and Hayley and Jeff steal his rare Mickey Mouse watch and escape . He returns to get the watch back and tells he has fixed Hayley and Jeff 's relationship . After he gets his watch back , he takes more of the " Stephen Hawking pills " and is later used by Stan to teach Steve how to shave and Roger drags him away for unknown ( but quite possibly sexual ) reasons .

 = SMS Vineta ( 1897 ) = 
 SMS Vineta was a protected cruiser of the Victoria Louise class , built for the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) in the 1890s . Vineta was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in 1895 , launched in April 1897 , and commissioned into the Navy in July 1898 . The ship , named for the semi @-@ legendary medieval town of Vineta , was armed with a battery of two 21 cm guns and eight 15 cm guns and had a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 Vineta served abroad in the American Station for the first several years of her career . While on station in the Americas , she participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902 – 1903 and bombarded several Venezuelan fortresses . She returned to Germany in 1905 and was used as a torpedo training ship in 1908 . She was modernized in 1909 – 1911 , after which she was used as a school ship for naval cadets . In November 1912 , she participated in an international naval protest of the First Balkan War . At the outbreak of World War I , Vineta was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group , but served in front @-@ line duty only briefly . She was used as a barracks ship after 1915 , and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Vineta was ordered under the contract name " M " and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig in 1896 . She was launched on 9 December 1897 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the German navy on 13 September 1899 . The ship was 110 @.@ 60 meters ( 362 ft 10 in ) long overall and had a beam of 17 @.@ 40 m ( 57 ft 1 in ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 58 m ( 21 ft 7 in ) forward . She displaced 6 @,@ 491 t ( 6 @,@ 388 long tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines powered by twelve coal @-@ fired Belleville boilers . Her engines provided a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) and a range of approximately 3 @,@ 412 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 319 km ; 3 @,@ 926 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . She had a crew of 31 officers and 446 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with two 21 cm SK L / 40 guns in single turrets , one forward and one aft . The guns were supplied with 58 rounds of ammunition each . They had a range of 16 @,@ 300 m ( 53 @,@ 500 ft ) . Vineta also carried eight 15 cm SK L / 40 guns . Four were mounted in turrets amidships and the other four were placed in casemates . These guns had a range of 13 @,@ 700 m ( 44 @,@ 900 ft ) . She also carried ten 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 35 guns . The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns . She was also equipped with three 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes , two launchers were mounted on the broadside and the third was in the bow , all below the waterline . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Following her commissioning in 1899 , Vineta was sent overseas . Her commander was Kapitän zur See ( Captain at Sea ) Da Fonseca @-@ Wollheim . The ship was assigned to the American Station , along with the small cruiser Geier and the gunboat Luchs . In May 1900 , Vineta inspected Margarita Island for its potential as a naval base , but the Germans determined the port was insufficient for their purposes . In late 1901 , Vineta and the small cruiser Falke were sent to Venezuela in a show of force to compel the Venezuelan government to make reparations for grievances related to internal conflicts in the 1890s . Starting in December 1902 , Vineta participated in the German naval contingent in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902 – 1903 . A British merchant ship had been boarded and its crew arrested by Venezuelan forces on 13 December ; in response , British forces bombarded the forts at Puerto Cabello , and enlisted Vineta in the attack . Vineta was tasked with shelling the fortresses Libertador and Vigia . In January 1903 , the gunboat Panther attacked Fort San Carlos in Maracaibo , but was repulsed . Vineta therefore was sent to silence the guns on 21 January . During the bombardment of the fort , Vineta set it afire and destroyed the fortress 
 In 1903 , one of Vineta 's 15 cm ammunition magazines exploded , but did not cause major damage to the ship . The accident had significant long @-@ term consequences , however , as it exposed the volatility of German propellant charges . The Germans therefore reworked the composition of the propellant , which was in service by 1914 . This new , more stable propellant saved several German battlecruisers from destruction when their magazines were penetrated by British shells during World War I. In January 1904 , the ship visited New Orleans with the rest of the American Squadron , which at that time included Falke , Panther , and Gazelle . Vineta was detached from the American Squadron and returned to Germany in 1905 . She was used as a torpedo training ship starting in 1908 . In 1909 , she went to dry dock at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig for a refit , during which she was re @-@ boilered . Vineta originally had three stacks , and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels . The refit was finished by 1911 , at which point Vineta became a cadet training ship . 
 The ship cruised in the western Mediterranean in the autumn of 1912 , along with her sister Hertha . The old cruiser Geier was also in the region . As the Bulgarian army was poised to march on Constantinople during the First Balkan War , the Great Powers deployed a naval force to ensure the safety of foreign nationals in the Ottoman Empire . Vineta and the battlecruiser Goeben were sent to Constantinople as part of this force . The international fleet sent ashore a force of around 3 @,@ 000 officers and men . The force was withdrawn to Crete after a ceasefire seemed imminent , but by February fighting again broke out , and the island was seized by Greece . On 23 January 1914 , Vineta was in Haiti , when Michel Oreste abdicated from the presidency . He sought refuge aboard the ship , which landed marines along with the American cruiser USS Montana in Port @-@ au @-@ Prince to prevent rioting in the capital . 
 Vineta had a short career during World War I. At the outbreak of hostilities , she was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group , which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea . By the end of 1914 , however , the ships were again removed from service . She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship . After 1915 , she was withdrawn from front @-@ line duty again and employed as a barracks ship at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel . She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship @-@ breakers in Harburg . She was scrapped the following year .

 In November 2009 , in an interview with MTV News , Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna 's then @-@ upcoming fourth studio album , Rated R ( 2009 ) . During the same interview , he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn 't make the final cut on the album , " the record we have is great . It 's a special record , so for it not to make it , I know something had to click . It 's all good . I think the project 's gonna be great no matter what . " Talking for the same publication , Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song , " She 's calling me up saying , ' Where are the files ? ' That 's one thing you don 't hear often from artists on her level . " " What 's My Name ? " was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen , Hermansen , Ester Dean , Traci Hale and Drake , while the production was done by StarGate . In an interview for HitQuarters , Hale explained that she got into the project that 's to a phone call she received from Dean . She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical , while Dean and StarGate did most of the music . When asked what 's the inspiration behind the song she stated , " Oh love , love , love ! And it ’ s sexy – it started as a real sexy track and then you put something sexy over it . " 
 The collaboration was originally planned to be a remix of the song , while the solo version would have been included on Rihanna 's fifth studio album Loud . However , in the end it made the final cut on the album .

 In May 2011 , in The Mix Review , an analyzing commercial productions , Mike Senior of Sound on Sound revisited the original mixing of the song . According to him , before he started the mix , Senior played the song a couple of times before releasing what thing about it " bugged " him . Working it out , he noted that the harmony of the mix is undermined by the kick drum . " What 's My Name ? " contains basic harmonies that are a bar of F # minor , a bar of A major and two bars of D @-@ major . Senior stated that on the other side however , there 's a very little in the arrangement that could be seen like a traditional melodic bass @-@ line . As the result of that , the " 808 @-@ style " kick @-@ drum 's pronounce pitched components with a power of 37 Hz and 74 Hz fill that help void with a ' D ' note . According to Senior , " the problem is that this only really supports the D ‑ major chord , destabilizing the home chord of F # minor ( by implying that it 's actually part of a D ‑ major 7th chord ) and clashing <unk> with the A ‑ major . " He further stated that although might not be as apparent on small speakers , it still represents " weakness " for him . The section of the song at 3 : 12 has four bars without the kick @-@ drum and four without it .

" What 's My Name ? " is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist . " Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the " song 's chorus " and " Drake 's verse " . Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna 's performance saying that " On ' What 's My Name ' , Rihanna doesn 't have to tell us how desirable she is – it is a given .

 Nick Levine from Digital Spy said " ' What 's My Name ? ' is essentially the long , luxuriant lovemaking session to ' Rude Boy 's hard <unk> rut ... it manages to stay classy even when Drake makes a dodgy joke about the ' square root of 69 ' and Rihanna delivers a not @-@ so @-@ coy reference to oral sex . " Megan Vick from Billboard said " As much as ' What 's My Name ' is a joint effort , Rihanna owns the song by delivering a more polished version of her pop persona . " According to Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone with the release of " What 's My Name ? " as second single from the album Rihanna created " a perfect little tropical storm " . He continued : " [ ... ] Over dark , humid synths and swirling snare <unk> , she 's in full @-@ on Caribbean @-@ queen mode , dialing up her islander accent and rolling out a to @-@ do list for any adult male seeking entrance into her chambers " . However , he also criticized Drake 's " Square root of 69 " line , stating that Drake sounds like a nerdy guy from a fraternity while he raps it .

 = = Plot = = 
 After a fashion model dies while undergoing an illegal abortion , the attending doctor moves her body back to her home , staging her death to remove any trace of his involvement . However , he is murdered by a stranger disguised in racing leathers and a motorcycle helmet . At the Albatross Modelling Agency , womanising photographer Carlo ( Nino Castelnuovo ) embarks on an affair with fellow photographer Magda ( Edwige Fenech ) . Meanwhile , a newly hired model , Patrizia ( <unk> Stubing ) , fends off the unwanted advances of Maurizio ( Franco <unk> ) , whose wife owns the agency . One evening , Mario ( Claudio Pellegrini ) , who also works at the agency , invites a woman in racing leathers into his home for a drink , and is stabbed to death . The police question the agency 's owner Gisella ( Lia Amanda ) and another model , Lucia ( Femi <unk> ) about the killing , but learn very little . Gisella and Lucia are sleeping together ; one night when Gisella leaves after a fight , Lucia is attacked and killed . 
 Maurizio propositions another model , Doris ( Erna Schürer ) , but when she refuses to sleep with him for money , he attempts to rape her . However , he suffers from premature ejaculation and Doris leaves unharmed . Shortly afterwards , Maurizio is stabbed by the killer . Carlo later witnesses Gisella being murdered , and is able to photograph the attack ; however , he runs off and is injured in a hit and run accident . While he is in hospital , Magda recovers his camera and attempts to develop the film , but the killer breaks in and destroys the negatives .

However , Patrizia dies of her injuries , leaving no trace of Carlo 's involvement .

 Writer Massimo Felisatti did not wish to be seen as having solely written the film , and gave director Andrea Bianchi credit for the story in order to " deflect his role and not have to bear full responsibility " for the script . Bianchi , Felisatti and cinematographer Franco <unk> Colli would collaborate again the following year in La moglie di mio padre . Nude per l 'assassino 's score was written by <unk> Pisano , who would also go on to write the score for Bianchi 's 1979 film <unk> . Bianchi would later cast Femi <unk> , who portrayed one of the slain models , in two other films — La moglie di mio padre and Cara dolce <unk> . 
 Nude per l 'assassino has been described as following " the giallo formula almost to the letter " , demonstrating that " the giallo conventions established by Bava and Argento and elaborated upon by a number of directors in the early 1970s had become well codified " by the time the film was produced . The film has also been cited as being " the perfect bridge to the American slasher film " , with its emphasis on " violence and sex " and a plot " dumbed down to the barest minimum " .
