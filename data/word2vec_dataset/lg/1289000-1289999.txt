 Arsenal were appearing in the final of the FA Cup for the fourteenth time , their first in over three years . They had won the cup seven times previously ( in 1930 , 1936 , 1950 , 1971 , 1979 , 1993 and 1998 ) and were beaten in the final six times . By comparison , Liverpool were making their twelfth appearance in a FA Cup final . The club won the cup five times ( in 1964 , 1974 , 1986 , 1989 , 1992 ) and lost six finals , most recent of which against Manchester United in 1996 . Arsenal and Liverpool had previously met thirteen times in the FA Cup , including four replays . Arsenal had a slender advantage in those meetings , winning five times to Liverpool 's four . Both clubs were involved in the longest ever semi @-@ final in FA Cup history in 1980 , which required three replays after the original tie ended goalless . Brian Talbot 's goal at Highfield Road earnt Arsenal a 1 – 0 victory . 
 The last meeting between the two teams had been in the Premier League on 23 December 2000 . Liverpool recorded a 4 – 0 win at Anfield which was their third straight victory in all competitions . Gérard Houllier , the manager of Liverpool , enjoyed success in the cup competitions during the 2000 – 01 season ; under his management , the club ended their six @-@ year spell without silverware by winning the League Cup , and in the calendar year beat Roma , Porto and Barcelona to reach the 2001 UEFA Cup Final . Houllier was indifferent that his side were considered the underdogs in the FA Cup final , and told reporters : " We have great work ethic and team ethic . There is a great desire to achieve something as a club . " . He confirmed in his pre @-@ match press conference that Heskey would start the final , and was yet to make a final decision over who would partner the England forward . 
 Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger admitted his team had underachieved during the season , but took criticism of failing to challenge Manchester United in the league and progressing further in the UEFA Champions League as a " compliment to the club . " He spoke in favour of moving FA Cup ties midweek to prevent fixture congestion , because the current system was too demanding for the big clubs : " In England a team that goes for the FA Cup automatically has a problem in the championship , especially if they play in the Champions ' League . There are then so many games something has to be sacrificed and I have sacrificed points in the championship to the FA Cup . " When asked whether reducing the number of teams in the UEFA Champions League would help , Wenger commented it " ... would mean less money and no one with the wages we pay can accept a drop in income . As for cutting the Premiership – they have done that in France and now those teams not involved in the cups are complaining . " 
 The match attracted considerable media interest because of the number of foreigners involved . It marked the first time that the two managers of opposing sides were born outside of the British Isles , and it was anticipated the final would receive a big overseas audience because of the inclusion of several international players . Broadcast in 70 countries , viewing figures for the match totalled close to 600 million .

 = = = Summary = = = 
 Both clubs lined up in a traditional 4 – 4 – 2 formation : a four @-@ man defence ( comprising two centre @-@ backs and left and right full @-@ backs ) , four midfielders ( two in the centre , and one on each wing ) and two centre @-@ forwards . Wenger opted to pair Gilles Grimandi with Vieira in midfield and Wiltord up front with Henry , leaving Bergkamp on the substitutes ' bench . Ashley Cole played in defence , ahead of Sylvinho , who did not feature in the matchday squad . For Liverpool , Houllier named Owen in the starting line @-@ up , and chose Šmicer and Murphy to play in midfield . Gary McAllister , Patrik Berger and Fowler began the final as substitutes . 
 Arsenal in their usual home strip of red shirts and white shorts kicked off the match and immediately won a corner , which was dealt with by Westerveld . A run by Heskey six minutes later resulted in the player taking a tumble under Gilles Grimandi 's challenge , but his appeals for a penalty were ignored by referee Dunn . Arsenal began to dominate play , with Vieira at the heart of their best moves . The midfielder won a challenge with Heskey in the 17th minute and sent the ball in the direction of Fredrik Ljungberg , who in turn passed it to Henry . The Frenchman went around Westerveld and shot the ball goalwards , which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz . Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz 's arm before going wide ; although Henry appealed for a penalty , it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant . Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute , but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown . Arsenal continued to find the best openings , but struggled to split open the Liverpool defence . A long range effort by Grimandi was easily saved by Westerveld as the final approached the half @-@ hour mark , and a duel between Wiltord and Jamie Carragher on the right side resulted in a Liverpool corner . Two minutes before the interval Henry was penalised for drifting into an offside position , having collected a long pass . 
 Liverpool resumed play and won a free @-@ kick in the 48th minute ; Murphy 's delivery found Heskey , whose header forced a save from David Seaman . Arsenal enjoyed their best spell of the match soon afterwards , but failed to make use of their set @-@ pieces . A free @-@ kick taken by Pirès was easily handled by Westerveld , and nothing came out of the resulting corner . Pirès and Henry combined in attack for Arsenal and the latter came close to scoring , had the Liverpool goalkeeper not intervened . The ball rebounded to Cole who shot goalwards , but Sami Hyypiä cleared off the line . Hamann was shown a yellow card for fouling Vieira in the 57th minute , and Houllier responded by replacing him with McAllister four minutes later . The change had the desired effect as it brought composure to Liverpool 's play , particularly in midfield . In the 62nd minute Ljungberg received a yellow card for a challenge on Šmicer . Arsenal squandered another chance , this time two minutes before the 70 ; Henry outpaced Henchoz and his rebounded shot found Ljungberg in the penalty area . The midfielder 's effort , a chip over the advancing Westerveld , was cleared off the line by Hyypiä . 
 With 19 minutes left , Arsenal finally scored . A poor clearance by Westerveld fell to Grimandi , who passed the ball to Pirès . Ljungberg received it and rounded the goalkeeper to score , much to Wenger 's delight . Henry missed a chance to give Arsenal a two @-@ goal lead in the 74th minute , as his shot was point @-@ blank saved by Westerveld and on the follow up cleared by Hyypiä . Both managers made changes in the final period of the game ; Ray Parlour came on for Wiltord in order to protect Arsenal 's lead , whereas Liverpool made an attacking double substitution – Fowler and Berger on for Šmicer and Murphy . Liverpool survived the onslaught and found a foothold in the game when Owen equalised with eight minutes left . Arsenal failed to clear substitute McAllister 's free @-@ kick , and Owen pounced with a right @-@ foot finish past Seaman from eight yards . Liverpool 's comeback was completed five minutes later in the 88th minute , with extra time looming ; Owen was released down the left by a weighted long ball pass from Berger , with the type of vision which had been earlier missing from their play , and he outpaced both Tony Adams and Dixon before shooting low and accurately past Seaman , beating him at the far post . Liverpool held on to their lead for the few minutes remaining to win the final .

 Houllier was disappointed with Liverpool 's start and noticed his players struggled with the humidity . He nevertheless saw set @-@ pieces as an opportunity to score goals from and felt the equaliser turned the final in his team 's favour : " Suddenly the confidence switches to the other camp . They 're affected , they become a bit unsettled , and you keep going . " Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match ; although in his words Arsenal were " ... probably a bit better than us , probably more mature , more experienced , more ability in some areas , " dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day . He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring , rather describing his team as difficult to beat . Owen , the match winner , felt he answered his critics by scoring left @-@ footed : " It 's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven 't got a left foot . I was supposed to be the worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league , and how could an England player play when they haven 't got a left foot . ... It does go to show that I have improved and I am improving . " 
 Wenger lamented Arsenal 's inability to make possession count , saying : " It has happened all season . We don 't finish . " He criticised the referee for not sending off Henchoz , especially as linesman Kevin Pike told him the Liverpool defender had committed a foul . On reflection of the season , Wenger disagreed it was one of failure – " It is not easy to get to the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League , the final of the FA Cup and to finish in the top three of the Premiership in the same season , " but admitted he needed to make signings to strengthen the squad . Henry called for changes to Arsenal 's forward line and felt the team would benefit from a " fox in the box , " a player who would stay in and around the penalty area to score . " When I make wide runs and put in crosses there is often no @-@ one there to put the ball in the net . Owen was the hero because he is always in the right place . We need a goalscorer like that , " he concluded . 
 Journalists and pundits reviewing the final praised Liverpool 's tenacity ; radio commentator Alan Green wrote in his News Letter column of 14 May 2001 : " Simply , they never give up and when you have a player like Michael Owen within your ranks you believe that any situation can be rescued , as it was in the magnificent Millennium Stadium . " The Guardian correspondent David Lacey declared " The Owen of France ' 98 was reborn in Cardiff , " while Hugh McIlvanney of The Sunday Times called Owen " the master executioner of English football . " McIlvanney felt over the 90 minutes the Arsenal team were " unlucky to lose , " lauding Vieira 's show in midfield . James Lawton 's match report in The Independent was not as empathetic ; although in praise of Henry 's performance his indecision compared to Owen , demonstrated how " effect , not style , is everything " in football . Clive White of The Herald criticised Henry 's lack of end product , using the final and Arsenal 's European failure against Valencia to demonstrate how he would never be considered a " natural goalscorer " . Ron Atkinson , writing in his tactics column for The Guardian noted Liverpool 's winning goal only came about because of Arsenal 's eagerness to attack , which left gaps in defence . 
 The final was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both ITV and Sky Sports , with the former providing free @-@ to @-@ air coverage and Sky Sports 2 being the pay @-@ TV alternative . ITV held the majority of the viewership , with an overnight peak audience of 7 @.@ 8 million viewers . Four days after the final Liverpool beat Alavés by five goals to four , to win the UEFA Cup and complete a treble of cup victories . Victory against Charlton Athletic on 20 May 2001 ensured Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and with that earn a place in the 2001 – 02 UEFA Champions League . Arsenal ended the season as league runners @-@ up ; a draw against Newcastle United was enough for them to secure second spot . 
 In his autobiography released a few years later , Gerrard reflected that Liverpool were fortunate to win , but was critical of Arsenal 's " bitter " reaction : " Wenger and Ljungberg kept complaining about the hand @-@ balls . Get real , boys . That 's football . Grow up . " He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however , saying a few days after the game : " It was my job to try and stop him , but he definitely got the better of me that day . He 's such a great player . He 's so fit , and he dictates the pace of a game . There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him . " Assessing his career in a column for the Telegraph , Owen wrote that winning the cup was " ... the best day of my career , the game I look back on more than any other and think it was the most exhilarating experience I ever had playing football . " 
 = Attalus I = 
 Attalus I ( Greek : <unk> Α <unk> ) , surnamed Soter ( Greek : <unk> , " Savior " ; 269 – 197 BC ) ruled Pergamon , an Ionian Greek polis ( what is now <unk> , Turkey ) , first as dynast , later as king , from 241 BC to 197 BC . He was the second cousin and the adoptive son of Eumenes I , whom he succeeded , and was the first of the Attalid dynasty to assume the title of king in 238 BC . He was the son of Attalus and his wife Antiochis . 
 Attalus won an important victory over the Galatians , newly arrived Celtic tribes from Thrace , who had been , for more than a generation , plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of Asia Minor without any serious check . This victory , celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon ( famous for its Dying Gaul ) and the liberation from the Gallic " terror " which it represented , earned for Attalus the name of " Soter " , and the title of " king " . A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of Rome , he played a significant role in the first and second Macedonian Wars , waged against Philip V of Macedon . He conducted numerous naval operations , harassing Macedonian interests throughout the Aegean , winning honors , collecting spoils , and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of Aegina during the first war , and Andros during the second , twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip . 
 Attalus was a protector of the Greek cities of Anatolia and viewed himself as the champion of Greeks against barbarians . During his reign he established Pergamon as a considerable power in the Greek East . He died in 197 BC , shortly before the end of the second war , at the age of 72 , having suffered an apparent stroke while addressing a Boeotian war council some months before . He and his wife were admired for their rearing of their four sons . He was succeeded as king by his son Eumenes II . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little is known about Attalus ' early life . He was born a Greek , the son of Attalus , and Antiochis . The elder Attalus was the son of a brother ( also called Attalus ) of both Philetaerus , the founder of the Attalid dynasty , and Eumenes , the father of Eumenes I , Philetaerus ' successor ; he is mentioned , along with his uncles , as a benefactor of Delphi , won fame as a charioteer , winning at Olympia , and was honored with a monument at Pergamon . 
 Attalus was a young child when his father died , sometime before 241 BC , after which he was adopted by Eumenes I , the incumbent dynast . Attalus ' mother , Antiochis , was related to the Seleucid royal family ( being a granddaughter of Seleucus I Nicator ) with her marriage to Attalus ' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power . This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus ' father had been Philetaerus ' heir designate , but was succeeded by Eumenes , since Attalus I was too young when his father died . 
 = = Defeat of the Galatians = = 
 According to the 2nd century AD Greek writer Pausanias , " the greatest of his achievements " was the defeat of the " Gauls " ( <unk> ) . Pausanias was referring to the Galatians , immigrant Celts from Thrace , who had recently settled in Galatia in central Asia Minor , and whom the Romans and Greeks called Gauls , associating them with the Celts of what is now France , Switzerland , and northern Italy . Since the time of Philetaerus , the first Attalid ruler , the Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon , indeed for all of Asia Minor , by exacting tributes to avoid war or other repercussions . Eumenes I had ( probably ) , along with other rulers , dealt with the Galatians by paying these tributes . Attalus however refused to pay them , being the first such ruler to do so . As a consequence , the Galatians set out to attack Pergamon . Attalus met them near the sources of the river <unk> and won a decisive victory , after which , following the example of Antiochus I , Attalus took the name of Soter , which means " savior " , and claimed the title of king . The victory brought Attalus legendary fame . A story arose , related by Pausanias , of an oracle who had foretold these events a generation earlier : 
 Then verily , having crossed the narrow strait of the Hellespont , 
 The devastating host of the Gauls shall pipe ; and <unk> 
 They shall ravage Asia ; and much worse shall God do 
 To those who dwell by the shores of the sea 
 For a short while . For right soon the son of Cronos 
 Shall raise a helper , the dear son of a bull reared by Zeus 
 Who on all the Gauls shall bring a day of destruction . 
 Pausanias adds that by " son of a bull " the oracle " meant Attalus , king of Pergamon , who was styled bull @-@ horned " . On the acropolis of Pergamon was erected a triumphal monument , which included the famous sculpture the Dying Gaul , commemorating this battle . 
 = = Conquests in Seleucid Asia Minor = = 
 Several years after the first victory over the Gauls , Pergamon was again attacked by the Gauls together with their ally Antiochus <unk> , the younger brother of Seleucus II <unk> , and ruler of Seleucid Asia Minor from his capital at Sardis . Attalus defeated the Gauls and Antiochus at the battle of <unk> and again at a second battle in the east . Subsequent battles were fought and won against Antiochus alone : in <unk> Phrygia , where Antiochus was perhaps seeking refuge with his father @-@ in law , <unk> the king of Bithynia ; near Sardis in the spring of 228 BC ; and , in the final battle of the campaign , further south in Caria on the banks of the <unk> , a tributary of the Maeander . 
 As a result of these victories , Attalus gained control over all of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the Taurus Mountains . He was able to hold on to these gains in the face of repeated attempts by Seleucus III <unk> , eldest son and successor of Seleucus II , to recover the lost territory , culminating in Seleucus III himself crossing the Taurus , only to be assassinated by members of his army in 223 BC . Achaeus , who had accompanied Seleucus III , assumed control of the army . He was offered and refused the kingship in favor of Seleucus III 's younger brother Antiochus III the Great , who then made Achaeus governor of Seleucid Asia Minor north of the Taurus . Within two years Achaeus had recovered all the lost Seleucid territories , " shut up Attalus within the walls of Pergamon " , and assumed the title of king . 
 After a period of peace , in 218 BC , while Achaeus was involved in an expedition to Selge south of the Taurus , Attalus , with some Thracian Gauls , recaptured his former territories . However Achaeus returned from victory in Selge in 217 BC and resumed hostilities with Attalus . 
 Under a treaty of alliance with Attalus , Antiochus crossed the Taurus in 216 BC , attacked Achaeus and besieged Sardis , and in 214 BC , the second year of the siege , was able to take the city . However the citadel remained under Achaeus ' control . Under the pretense of a rescue , Achaeus was finally captured and put to death , and the citadel surrendered . By 213 BC , Antiochus had regained control of all of his Asiatic provinces . 
 = = First Macedonian War = = 
 Thwarted in the east , Attalus now turned his attention westward . Perhaps because of concern for the ambitions of Philip V of Macedon , Attalus had sometime before 219 BC become allied with Philip 's enemies the Aetolian League , a union of Greek states in Aetolia in central Greece , having funded the fortification of Elaeus , an Aetolian stronghold in <unk> , near the mouth of the river Acheloos . 
 Philip 's alliance with Hannibal of Carthage in 215 BC also caused concern in Rome , then involved in the Second Punic War . In 211 BC , a treaty was signed between Rome and the Aetolian League , a provision of which allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League , Attalus being one of these . Attalus was elected one of the two strategoi ( generals ) of the Aetolian League , and in 210 BC his troops probably participated in capturing the island of Aegina , acquired by Attalus as his base of operations in Greece . 
 In the following spring ( 209 BC ) , Philip marched south into Greece . Under command of Pyrrhias , Attalus ' colleague as strategos , the allies lost two battles at Lamia . Attalus himself went to Greece in July and was joined on Aegina by the Roman proconsul P. Sulpicius Galba who wintered there . The following summer ( 208 BC ) the combined fleet of thirty @-@ five Pergamene and twenty @-@ five Roman ships failed to take Lemnos , but occupied and plundered the countryside of the island of <unk> ( Skopelos ) , both Macedonian possessions . Attalus and Sulpicius then attended a meeting in Heraclea <unk> of the Council of the Aetolians , at which the Roman argued against making peace with Philip . 
 When hostilities resumed , they sacked both Oreus , on the northern coast of Euboea and Opus , the chief city of eastern Locris . The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius , who returned there , while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus . With their forces divided , Philip attacked Opus . Attalus , caught by surprise , was barely able to escape to his ships . 
 Attalus was now forced to return to Asia , for he had learned at Opus that , at the instigation of Philip , Prusias I king of Bithynia , related to Philip by marriage , was moving against Pergamon . Soon after , the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal , their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved . In 206 BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip . A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC , formally ending the First Macedonian War . Attalus was included as an <unk> on the side of Rome . He retained Aegina , but had accomplished little else . Since Prusias was also included in the treaty , the war between Attalus and Prusias must also have ended by that time . 
 = = Introduction of the cult of the Magna Mater to Rome = = 
 In 205 BC , following the " Peace of Phoenice " , Rome turned to Attalus , as its only friend in Asia , for help concerning a religious matter . An unusual number of meteor showers caused concern in Rome , and an inspection was made of the Sibylline Books , which discovered verses saying that if a foreigner were to make war on Italy , he could be defeated if the Magna <unk> , the Mother Goddess , associated with Mount Ida in Phrygia , were brought to Rome . Hoping to bring about a speedy conclusion to the war with Hannibal , a distinguished delegation , led by M. Valerius Laevinus , was dispatched to Pergamon , to seek Attalus ' aid . According to Livy , Attalus received the delegation warmly , and " handed over to them the sacred stone which the natives declared to be ' the Mother of the Gods ' , and bade them carry it to Rome . " In Rome the goddess became known as the Magna Mater . 
 = = Macedonian hostilities of 201 BC = = 
 Prevented by the treaty of Phoenice from expansion in the east , Philip set out to extend his power in the Aegean and in Asia Minor . In the spring of 201 BC he took Samos and the Egyptian fleet stationed there . He then besieged Chios to the north . These events caused Attalus , allied with Rhodes , Byzantium and Cyzicus , to enter the war . A large naval battle occurred in the strait between Chios and the mainland , just southwest of Erythrae . According to Polybius , fifty @-@ three decked warships and over one hundred and fifty smaller warships , took part on the Macedonian side , with sixty @-@ five decked warships and a number of smaller warships on the allied side . During the battle Attalus , having become isolated from his fleet and pursued by Philip , was forced to run his three ships ashore , narrowly escaping by spreading various royal treasures on the decks of the grounded ships , causing his pursuers to abandon the pursuit in favor of plunder . 
 The same year , Philip invaded Pergamon ; although unable to take the easily defended city , in part due to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications , he demolished the surrounding temples and altars . Meanwhile , Attalus and Rhodes sent envoys to Rome , to register their complaints against Philip . 
 = = Second Macedonian War = = 
 In 200 BC , Attalus became involved in the Second Macedonian War . Acarnanians with Macedonian support invaded Attica , causing Athens , which had previously maintained its neutrality , to seek help from the enemies of Philip . Attalus , with his fleet at Aegina , received an embassy from Athens , to come to the city for consultations . A few days later , he learned that Roman ambassadors were also at Athens , and decided to go there at once . His reception at Athens was extraordinary . Polybius writes : 
 … in company with the Romans and the Athenian magistrates , he began his progress to the city in great state . For he was met , not only by all the magistrates and the knights , but by all the citizens with their children and wives . And when the two processions met , the warmth of the welcome given by the populace to the Romans , and still more to Attalus , could not have been exceeded . At his entrance into the city by the gate <unk> the priests and priestesses lined the street on both sides : all the temples were then thrown open ; victims were placed ready at all the altars ; and the king was requested to offer sacrifice . Finally they voted him such high honors as they had never without great hesitation voted to any of their former benefactors : for , in addition to other compliments , they named a tribe after Attalus , and classed him among their eponymous heroes . 
 Sulpicius Galba , now consul , convinced Rome to declare war on Philip and asked Attalus to meet up with the Roman fleet and again conduct a naval campaign , harassing Macedonian possessions in the Aegean . In the spring of 199 BC , the combined Pergamon and Roman fleets took Andros in the Cyclades , the spoils going to the Romans and the island to Attalus . From Andros they sailed south , made a fruitless attack on another Cycladic island , <unk> , turned back north , scavenged the fields of Skiathos off the coast of Magnesia , for food , and continued north to Mende , where the fleets were wracked by storm . On land they were repulsed at <unk> , suffering heavy loss . They continued northeast along the Macedonian coast to <unk> , which they sacked , after which they returned to Euboea , their vessels laden with spoils . On their return , the two leaders went to Heraclea to meet with the Aetolians , who under the terms of their treaty , had asked Attalus for a thousand soldiers . He refused , citing the Aetolians ' own refusal to honor Attalus ' request to attack Macedonia during Philip 's attack on Pergamon two years earlier . Resuming operations , Attalus and the Romans attacked but failed to take Oreus and , deciding to leave a small force to invest it , attacked across the straight in Thessaly . When they returned to Oreus , they again attacked , this time successfully , the Romans taking the captives , Attalus the city . The campaigning season now over , Attalus attended the Eleusinian Mysteries and then returned to Pergamon having been away for over two years . 
 In the spring of 198 BC , Attalus returned to Greece with twenty @-@ three quinqueremes joining a fleet of twenty Rhodian decked warships at Andros , to complete the conquest of Euboea begun the previous year . Soon joined by the Romans , the combined fleets took Eretria and later Carystus . Thus , the allies controlled all of Euboea except for Chalcis . The allied fleet then sailed for Cenchreae in preparation for an attack on Corinth . Meanwhile , the new Roman consul for that year , Titus Quinctius Flamininus , had learned that the Achaean League , allies of Macedon , had had a change in leadership which favored Rome . With the hope of inducing the Achaeans to abandon Philip and join the allies , envoys were sent , including Attalus himself , to Sicyon , where they offered the incorporation of Corinth into the Achaean League . Attalus apparently so impressed the Sicyonians , that they erected a colossal statue of him in their market place and instituted sacrifices in his honor . A meeting of the League was convened and after a heated debate and the withdrawal of some of delegates the rest agreed to join the alliance . Attalus led his army from Cenchreae ( now controlled by the allies ) through the Isthmus and attacked Corinth from the north , controlling the access to Lechaeum , the Corinthian port on the Gulf of Corinth , the Romans attacked from the east controlling the approaches to Cenchreae , with the Achaeans attacking from the west controlling the access to the city via the <unk> gate . However the city held , and when Macedonian reinforcements arrived , the siege was abandoned . The Achaeans were dismissed , the Romans left for Corcyra , while Attalus sailed for Piraeus . 
 Early in 197 BC , Flamininus , summoned Attalus to join him at Elateia ( now in Roman hands ) and from there they traveled together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war . At the council Attalus spoke first , reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them , but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed , with one side of his body paralyzed . Attalus was taken back to Pergamon , where he died around the time of the Battle of Cynoscephalae , which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War . 
 = = Family = = 
 Attalus married Apollonis , from Cyzicus . They had four sons , Eumenes , Attalus , Philetaerus and Athenaeus ( after Apollonis ' father ) . Polybius describes Apollonis as " a woman who for many reasons deserves to be remembered , and with honor . Her claims upon a favourable recollection are that , though born of a private family , she became a queen , and retained that exalted rank to the end of her life , not by the use of meretricious fascinations , but by the virtue and integrity of her conduct in private and public life alike . Above all , she was the mother of four sons with whom she kept on terms of the most perfect affection and motherly love to the last day of her life . " 
 The filial " affection " of the brothers as well as their upbringing is remarked on by several ancient sources . A decree of Antiochus IV praises " king Attalus and queen Apollonis … because of their virtue and goodness , which they preserved for their sons , managing their education in this way wisely and well . " An inscription at Pergamon represents Apollonis as saying that " she always considered herself blessed and gave thanks to the gods , not for wealth or empire , but because she saw her three sons guarding the eldest and him reigning without fear among those who were armed . " When Attalus died in 197 BC at the age of 72 , he was succeeded by his eldest son Eumenes II . Polybius , describing Attalus ' life says " and what is more remarkable than all , though he left four grown @-@ up sons , he so well settled the question of succession , that the crown was handed down to his children 's children without a single dispute .

 Just Chillin ' received less than favorable critical reception . Allmusic 's Matt Collar awarded the album two out of five stars and noted his preference for Brown 's 1994 studio album After the Storm . Collar thought that Brown incorporated too many programmed drums and " mid @-@ tempo jams " , producing more " urban and gritty " tracks than his other instrumental albums . He compared " The Feeling I Get " to " instrumental Maxwell " and called Janet Jackson 's " Let 's Wait Awhile " a standout track which reflects Brown 's " overall vision to turn jazz to pop and vice versa " . Chris Walker of JazzTimes also noted the album 's laid @-@ back pace ( " almost too relaxed " ) and thought it lacked Brown 's " trademark <unk> " . Walker complimented the vocalists ' performances , which produced a " pleasant , soulful aura " , but felt they were " far removed " from Brown . He wrote that " Just Chillin ' " and " Dancing in the House " displayed Brown 's acumen ; Walker also complimented " Night Drive " , in part because of Braun 's trumpet performance , and considered " Let 's Wait Awhile " the highlight of the album . In 2003 , the album earned Brown the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album .

 = Scharnhorst @-@ class battleship = 
 The Scharnhorst class were the first capital ships , alternatively referred to as battlecruisers or battleships , built for Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine after World War I. The class comprised two vessels : the lead ship Scharnhorst and Gneisenau . Scharnhorst was launched first , and so she is considered to be the lead ship by some sources ; however , they are also referred to as the Gneisenau class in some other sources , as Gneisenau was the first to be laid down and commissioned . They marked the beginning of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles . The ships were armed with nine 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK C / 34 guns in three triple turrets , though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38 cm ( 15 in ) SK C / 34 guns in twin turrets . 
 The two ships were laid down in 1935 , launched in late 1936 , and commissioned into the German fleet by early 1939 . Scharnhorst and Gneisenau operated together for much of the early portion of World War II , including sorties into the Atlantic to raid British merchant shipping . The two ships participated in Operation Weserübung , the German invasion of Norway . During operations off Norway , the two ships engaged the battlecruiser HMS Renown and sank the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious on 8 June 1940 . In the engagement with Glorious , Scharnhorst achieved one of the longest @-@ range naval gunfire hits in history . In early 1942 , the two ships made a daylight dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany . 
 In late 1942 , Gneisenau was heavily damaged in an Allied air raid against Kiel . In early 1943 , Scharnhorst joined the Bismarck @-@ class Tirpitz in Norway to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union . Scharnhorst and several destroyers sortied from Norway to attack a convoy ; the Germans were instead intercepted by British naval patrols . During the battle of North Cape , the Royal Navy battleship HMS Duke of York sank Scharnhorst . In the meantime , repair work on Gneisenau had begun , and the ship was in the process of being rearmed . However , when Scharnhorst was sunk , work on her sister was abandoned . Instead , she was sunk as a blockship in Gotenhafen in 1945 ; the wreck was broken up for scrap in the 1950s . 
 = = Classification = = 
 They were the first class of German ships to be officially classified by the Kriegsmarine as Schlachtschiff ( battleship ) . Previous German battleships were classified as <unk> ( ships of the line ) , and Panzerschiffe ( armoured ship ) . 
 Their adversary , the Royal Navy , rated them as battlecruisers though after the war classified them as battleships . Jane 's Fighting Ships 1940 lists both the Scharnhorst and Bismarck classes as " Battleships ( <unk> ) " Another adversary , the United States Navy , rated them as battleships . In English language reference works they are sometimes referred to as battleships and sometimes as battlecruisers .

 = = = Development = = = 
 The Treaty of Versailles , which established the terms concluding World War I , restricted German naval shipbuilding to warships displacing no more than 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 11 @,@ 000 short tons ) . Debates in Germany over the role and size of its navy continued through the 1920s , when increased naval shipbuilding in France and the Soviet Union prompted the Germans to begin drawing up designs for large capital ships . The first design , completed in 1928 , called for a 17 @,@ 500 long tons ( 19 @,@ 600 short tons ) battlecruiser armed with eight 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) guns in four twin gun turrets . In 1933 , Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany ; he made clear to the naval command that he had no intention of building a large fleet to challenge British supremacy at sea . He was primarily concerned with the possibility of a limited war with France , which would require the protection of German sea lanes . To this end , he authorized two more ships — the D class — to augment the three Deutschland @-@ class Panzerschiffe ( armoured ships ) . These ships would displace 19 @,@ 000 tons and have the same armament and speed as the Panzerschiffe ; the extra tonnage would be taken up by increased protection . Hitler wanted to follow this course so he would not be seen as overtly flouting the Treaty of Versailles . However , he did not realize that such " unsinkable " commerce raiders would provoke Great Britain more severely than 26 @,@ 000 @-@ ton battlecruisers armed with 28 @.@ 3 cm ( 11 @.@ 1 inch ) guns , which would be regarded as inferior to all the Royal Navy battleships and battlecruisers then in commission . 
 To combat the German Panzerschiffe , the French built two small Dunkerque @-@ class battleships in the early 1930s . This in turn prompted the German navy to begin plans for a more powerful battlecruiser design . Since 1933 , Erich Raeder , the head of the German Navy , had argued to increase the defensive qualities of the Panzerschiffe , and to increase the offensive power of the main battery with the addition of a third triple turret . This was also the view of the Kriegsmarine , which saw the 19 @,@ 000 @-@ ton design as being unbalanced . Hitler agreed to increased armour protection and internal subdivision , but refused to permit an increase in armament . Finally , by February 1934 , Hitler acquiesced over the addition of the third turret . The new ship would displace 26 @,@ 000 long tons ( 29 @,@ 000 short tons ) and be armed with nine 28 @.@ 3 cm guns in three triple turrets . To secure political freedom to build the new ships , Hitler concluded the 1935 Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement , which guaranteed Great Britain a 3 to 1 superiority in capital ships , and , more importantly , removed the limitations of the Treaty of Versailles for the German navy . 
 The construction of new D @-@ class cruisers were canceled to make way for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau . The provisional names of the planned D @-@ class cruisers , Ersatz Elsass and Ersatz Hessen , were reallocated to the new ships , the contracts for which were awarded to the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and the Deutsche Werke in Kiel . Construction was held up by 14 months , partly because Hitler wanted to secure the treaty with Britain before work began , and partly due to numerous design changes after the ships had been ordered . 
 Because the maximum calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement was 40 @.@ 6 cm ( 16 inch ) , Hitler soon had second thoughts about the guns to be used for the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38 cm ( 15 inch ) weapons . However , the 28 @.@ 3 cm turrets were readily available ; 38 cm turrets would take years to develop , and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals . He was also reminded that , despite the allowances of the Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement , the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships . He therefore acquiesced to the ships ' being armed with 28 @.@ 3 cm guns , with the provision that they be <unk> to 38 cm at the earliest opportunity . The 38 cm turret was eventually used in the Bismarck @-@ class battleships . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were 226 m ( 741 ft 6 in ) long at the waterline ; Scharnhorst was 234 @.@ 9 m ( 770 ft 8 in ) long overall , while Gneisenau had a slightly shorter overall length , at 229 @.@ 8 m ( 753 ft 11 in ) . The ships both had a beam of 30 m ( 98 ft 5 in ) . They were designed to displace 35 @,@ 540 t ( 34 @,@ 980 long tons ) , which would have given the ships a draft of 9 @.@ 1 m ( 29 ft 10 in ) . At standard displacement of 32 @,@ 100 long tons ( 32 @,@ 600 t ) , which reduced draft to 8 @.@ 3 m ( 27 ft 3 in ) , while at a full combat load of 38 @,@ 100 long tons ( 38 @,@ 700 t ) , draft increased to 9 @.@ 9 m ( 32 ft 6 in ) . The ships ' hulls were constructed from longitudinal steel frames , over which the outer hull plates were welded . Their hulls contained 21 watertight compartments and had a double bottom for 79 % of their length . 
 The German navy considered the ships to be poor sea boats ; they were bow @-@ heavy when fully equipped and very " wet " as high as the bridge . This problem was mitigated to some extent by replacement of the straight stem with an " Atlantic bow " to both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst in January and August 1939 respectively , though use of the " A " turret remained restricted in heavy seas . The ships had rear problems as well ; their stern was also frequently " wet " and the ships were very slow entering a turn . They always required assistance from tugboats in shallow waters . With the rudder hard over , the ships lost over 50 % speed and heeled over more than 10 ° . During trials , the ships heeled as much as 13 ° at hard rudder . 
 Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had a crew of between 56 to 60 officers and 1 @,@ 613 to 1 @,@ 780 enlisted men . The crew was augmented by another 10 officers and 61 men when serving as a squadron flagship . They carried a number of smaller watercraft , including two picket boats , two launches , two barges , two pinnaces , two cutters , two yawls , and two dinghies . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Initially , diesel propulsion was planned for these ships , as had been used for the three Panzerschiffe . However , it was decided to use superheated steam propulsion . The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe . In the case of triple @-@ screw ships , this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe , and in the case of a quadruple @-@ screw ship , this would have amounted to more than 40 @,@ 000 horsepower per shaft . This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available , and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time . Since high @-@ pressure superheated steam had already proved successful , it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery . 
 Scharnhorst was powered by three Brown , Boveri , & Co geared steam turbines , while Gneisenau was equipped with three Germania geared turbines . The turbines drove three @-@ bladed screws that were 4 @.@ 8 m ( 15 ft 9 in ) in diameter . Steam was provided to the turbines by 12 Wagner ultra @-@ high @-@ pressure oil @-@ fired boilers , which produced pressures up to 58 standard atmospheres ( 5 @,@ 900 kPa ) and temperatures up to 450 ° C ( 842 ° F ) . The engines were rated at 160 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 157 @,@ 811 shp ; 117 @,@ 680 kW ) at 265 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) , and on trials produced up to 165 @,@ 930 PS ( 163 @,@ 660 ihp ; 122 @,@ 041 kW ) at 280 rpm . When steaming in reverse , the engines were rated for 57 @,@ 000 PS ( 56 @,@ 220 ihp ; 41 @,@ 923 kW ) . The ships had a designed speed of 31 knots ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) , though on trials both vessels beat their designed speeds — Scharnhorst hit 31 @.@ 5 knots ( 58 @.@ 3 km / h ; 36 @.@ 2 mph ) and Gneisenau made 31 @.@ 3 knots ( 58 @.@ 0 km / h ; 36 @.@ 0 mph ) . The ships carried 2 @,@ 800 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 800 long tons ; 3 @,@ 100 short tons ) of fuel oil as designed , though additional storage areas , including hull spaces between the belt and torpedo bulkhead , increased capacity to 5 @,@ 080 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 000 long tons ; 5 @,@ 600 short tons ) . At maximum fuel load , the ships were expected to steam for 8 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 300 mi ) at a cruising speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) ; however , Scharnhorst reached only 7 @,@ 100 nmi ( 13 @,@ 100 km ; 8 @,@ 200 mi ) at 19 knots , while Gneisenau managed only 6 @,@ 200 nmi ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at that speed . 
 Electrical power was supplied to the ships by five electricity plants . Each plant consisted of four diesel generators and eight turbo @-@ generators . The four diesel generators were divided into pairs : two provided 150 kilowatts each and two supplied 300 kW each . The eight turbo @-@ generators were also of mixed capacity ; six ran supplied 460 kW each and the remaining two provided 230 kW each . Total power output was 4 @,@ 120 kW at 220 volts . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Scharnhorst @-@ class ships were built with nine 28 @.@ 3 cm ( 11 @.@ 1 inch ) SK C / 34 54 @.@ 5 caliber quick @-@ firing guns in three triple turrets , two forward and one aft . These guns were an improvement over the earlier 28 @.@ 3 cm SK C / 28 guns mounted on the Deutschland @-@ class cruisers . While the 28 @.@ 3 cm guns were of a smaller caliber than main guns of other navies , they were still preferred by a number of gunnery officers in the Kriegsmarine due to their higher rate of fire . The guns were equipped with three different types of shells , an armour @-@ piercing ( AP ) L / 4 @,@ 4 shell that weighed 330 kg ( 727 @.@ 5 lb ) and two high explosive ( HE ) shells that both weighed 315 kg ( 694 @.@ 4 lb ) — an L / 4 @,@ 4 type with a base fuse and an L / 4 @,@ 5 version with a nose fuse . All three types of shells used the same propellant charges : an RPC / 38 42 @.@ 5 kg ( 93 @.@ 7 lb ) fore charge and an RPC / 38 76 @.@ 5 kg ( 168 @.@ 6 lb ) main charge . They fired these shells at a rate of fire of 3 @.@ 5 rounds per minute . Muzzle velocity for the AP shells was 890 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 920 feet per second ) ; the guns were expected to fire 300 rounds before enough wear had been incurred to warrant replacement . Scharnhorst 's and Gneisenau 's guns were mounted in three Drh LC / 34 turrets . The turrets were named , in alphabetical order from the bow of the ship : " Anton " , " Bruno " and " Cäsar " . Similarly to most other German installations , those turrets had an electric system of rotation , but all other operations were hydraulic systems . Although rotating mass of the turret was 750 tonnes ( internal barbette diameter 10 @.@ 2 m ) , traversing speed was quite good – 7 @.@ 2 deg / sec . The turrets allowed depression of the guns to − 8 ° and elevation to 40 ° for " A " and " C " turrets , while " B " turret was capable of depressing to − 9 ° . At maximum elevation , the guns could hit targets out to 40 @,@ 930 m ( 44 @,@ 760 yards ) . 
 The ships carried a secondary battery of twelve 15 cm SK C / 28 L / 55 quick @-@ firing guns . The guns were mounted in four Drh L. C / 34 twin turrets and four MPL / 35 pedestal mounts . Both the turrets and pedestal mounts enabled barrel depression to − 10 ° ; the turrets allowed elevation to 40 ° while the pedestals limited it to 35 ° . These guns fired 45 @.@ 3 kg ( 99 @.@ 87 lb ) shells at a rate of 6 – 8 per minute . They were expected to fire 1 @,@ 100 rounds before barrel wear made repair or replacement necessary . The guns in pedestals had a range of 22 @,@ 000 m ( 24 @,@ 060 yd ) , while those in the turrets , capable of 5 more degrees of elevation , had a slightly longer range , at 23 @,@ 000 m ( 25 @,@ 153 yd ) . They were supplied with between 1 @,@ 600 – 1 @,@ 800 shells , or 133 – 150 shells per gun . 
 Their anti @-@ aircraft battery consisted of fourteen 10 @.@ 5 cm C / 33 L / 65 guns , sixteen 3 @.@ 7 cm L / 83 guns , and between ten and twenty 2 cm guns . The 10 @.@ 5 cm guns fired at a rate of 15 – 18 rounds per minute , and had an effective ceiling of 12 @,@ 500 m ( 41 @,@ 010 feet ) . They were mounted in six <unk> . L. C / 31 twin mounts amidships , which allowed depression to − 8 ° and elevation to 80 ° . When used to engage surface targets , the guns had a maximum range of 17 @,@ 700 m ( 19 @,@ 357 yd ) at an elevation of 45 ° . The 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were placed in eight manually operated Dopp LC / 30 twin mounts . At 85 ° , they had an effective ceiling of 6 @,@ 800 m ( 22 @,@ 310 ft ) , though tracers were limited to 4 @,@ 800 m ( 15 @,@ 750 ft ) . They had a rate of fire of 30 rounds per minute . 
 After 1942 , six 53 @.@ 3 cm deck @-@ mounted torpedo tubes were taken from the light cruisers Leipzig and Nürnberg and installed on the ships . The tubes were supplied with 18 torpedoes . The torpedoes were 7 @.@ 186 m ( 23 ft 7 in ) long and carried a 300 kg ( 661 lb ) Hexanite warhead . They could be set for three speeds : 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) , 40 knots ( 74 km / h ; 46 mph ) , and 44 knots ( 81 km / h ; 51 mph ) . At 30 knots , the torpedoes had a range of 14 @,@ 000 m ( 15 @,@ 300 yd ) ; at 40 knots , the range fell considerably , to 8 @,@ 000 m ( 8 @,@ 750 m ) . At 44 knots , the range was reduced even further , to 6 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 560 yd ) . It was later found that the 44 kn speed caused the engine to overheat , and after this discovery , its use was discontinued . 
 Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were equipped with two sets of Seetakt radar . One was mounted on the forward gun director , which was located on top of the bridge . The second radar set was emplaced on the rear main battery gun director . The Seetakt sets operated at 368 megacycles , initially at 14 kW , though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100 kW , on the 80 cm wavelength . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Scharnhorst @-@ class ships were equipped with Krupp armour . Their upper armoured deck was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick , and backed by the main armour deck . This deck was 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick aft , increased to 50 mm in the central portion of the ship that contained the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces , and decreased down to 20 mm in the bow . It was supported by 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) thick slopes on either longitudinal side . The slopes connected to the lower edge of the main belt , an arrangement referred to as the " turtle deck . " The slopes significantly increased armour protection in the critical areas of the ship . The ships ' vitals were well armoured against any caliber shell fired by battleships at the time at ranges where the shell would have to penetrate both the main belt and the sloping deck . At very long ranges , however , the deck armour could be easily penetrated by heavy @-@ caliber shells . All of these sections were composed of Wotan Hart ( Wotan Hard ) steel . The armoured belt was 350 mm ( 14 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship , where the critical areas of the ship were located . Forward of the " A " turret the belt was reduced to 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) , which tapered down to zero at the bow of the ship . Aft of the rear gun turret the belt decreased to 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) , and eventually tapered down to nothing at the stern . The central portion of the belt was backed by 170 mm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) thick shields . The belt armour was composed of Krupp Cemented steel ( KC ) . The side protection system could not be penetrated by a 2 @,@ 240 lb ( 1 @,@ 020 kg ) 16 in ( 406 mm ) shell at any range over 11 @,@ 000 m ( 12 @,@ 000 yd ) . 
 The forward conning tower had 350 mm @-@ thick sides and a roof that was 200 mm @-@ thick . The rear conning tower was less well armoured , with sides and a roof that were only 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) and 50 mm thick , respectively . The gun turrets for the main battery had 360 mm ( 14 in ) thick faces , 200 mm thick sides , and 150 mm thick roofs . The barbettes that held the 28 cm gun turrets were also heavily armoured ; the sides were 350 mm thick and tapered down to 200 mm on the centerline , where they were shielded by the gun turrets above . The faces of the 15 cm turrets were 140 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) thick , with 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick sides and 50 mm thick roofs . The 10 @.@ 5 cm gun mounts were equipped with 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) gun shields . All of this armour was KC steel . 
 The underwater protection system was designed to withstand a direct hit from a 250 kg ( 550 lb ) explosive warhead ; British aerial torpedoes had smaller warheads than this , though their ship @-@ launched weapons were more powerful . The navy conducted several full @-@ scale underwater explosion tests with sections of armour cut from the old pre @-@ dreadnought Preussen . The tests revealed that welded steel construction better withstood the impact of the 250 kg warhead than did riveted steel plates . However , the torpedo bulkhead , composed of Wotan Weich ( Wotan , soft ) steel , placed behind the armoured belt was riveted ; this was done because plate joints that had been incorrectly welded would not sufficiently withstand explosive shocks . The underwater protection system was constructed out of several layers : the outer layer that was between 12 – 66 mm ( <unk> – 2 @.@ 6 in ) thick , directly underneath the main armoured belt , was designed to detonate the torpedo warhead . Behind the outer plate was a large void which would allow gases from the explosion to expand and dissipate . Beyond this was a fuel bunker with an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) thick outer wall ; this would absorb any remaining explosive force . The bunker was supported by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse bulkheads . 
 The underwater side protection had numerous faults , however . It was extremely strong amidships , but weakened on either end of the citadel . The underwater protection could only stop a 200 kg ( 440 lb ) warhead in these areas . Another significant weakness in the design was the arrangement of the torpedo bulkhead . It was connected to the lower portion of the sloped deck , at an angle of 10 ° ; two riveted angled bars held it in place . The bars were constantly under a great deal of stress , due to normal bending forces in the hull . When combined with the explosive force of a torpedo warhead , the bars could not sustain the increased pressure and could fail . Also , the beam of 30 m meant that the protection system had to be weaker around the main battery turrets , as a significant amount of the hull space was taken up by the magazines and barbettes .

 Gneisenau was laid down on 3 May 1935 at the Deutsche Werke in Kiel . She was launched on 8 December 1936 , and completed on 21 May 1938 . During her launch , the ship sustained minor damage to her stern ; the chains slowing her slide down the slipway broke , and the ship drifted too far and became beached on the opposite shore . After her commissioning , Gneisenau spent the first year of her career conducting trials and training cruises in the Baltic Sea . The cruises revealed the wetness of the bow and bridge ; in January 1939 her " Atlantic bow " was installed . Scharnhorst was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven , on 16 May 1935 . She was launched on 30 June 1936 and completed on 7 January 1939 . In mid 1939 , the ship conducted trials in the Baltic Sea ; as with Gneisenau , the ship 's low freeboard necessitated the installation of the " Atlantic bow " , which was completed in August 1939 . During that refit , a large hangar for the ship 's aircraft was added amidships . The ship emerged from the dockyard in October . 
 On 21 November , Scharnhorst , Gneisenau , the light cruisers Köln and Leipzig , and several destroyers conducted a sweep between Iceland and the Faroe Islands ; during the operation , the German ships encountered the British armed merchant cruiser HMS Rawalpindi ; Scharnhorst sank the ship , but in the process sustained a hit from one of Rawalpindi 's 152 mm guns . Scharnhorst stopped to pick up survivors , but the arrival of the cruiser HMS Newcastle prompted the German ships to withdraw . 
 = = = Operation Weserübung = = = 
 On 7 April 1940 , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau formed the primary covering force for the invasions of Narvik and Trondheim in Norway during Operation Weserübung . At 04 : 30 on 9 April , the Seetakt radar on Gneisenau picked up a contact ; both ships went to battle stations . Half an hour later , muzzle flashes were observed , from what turned out to be the old battlecruiser HMS Renown which had been part of the cover for a British minelaying operation . The British battlecruiser initially targeted Gneisenau , at a range of 11 @,@ 800 m ( 12 @,@ 900 yd ) . In the span of five minutes , Gneisenau hit Renown twice , but sustained one 15 " and two 4 @.@ 5 " hits in return . One of the two 4 @.@ 5 " hits disabled Gneisenau 's A turret , The 15 " hit destroyed the main armament fire control station , and knocked out her Seetakt radar . Scharnhorst 's gunnery radar suffered technical problems , which prevented her from effectively engaging Renown . The British ship engaged Scharnhorst for a brief period starting at 05 : 18 , though effective maneuvering by Scharnhorst allowed her to escape <unk> . Fears that the destroyers escorting Renown might make a torpedo attack prompted the German commander to break off the engagement . By 07 : 15 , the German ships had escaped from the slower Renown . In the course of their escape Scharnhorst suffered from damage to her A turret caused by the heavy seas coming over her bows . Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper before proceeding to Wilhelmshaven . 
 Scharnhorst and Gneisenau , with Admiral Hipper and four destroyers , departed again on 4 June . After operations in the North Sea that resulted in the sinking of several British transports , Admiral Hipper and the destroyers were detached to refuel in occupied Norway . At 16 : 45 on 8 June , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau spotted the British aircraft carrier HMS Glorious , which was escorted by the destroyers Acasta and Ardent , at a range of around 50 @,@ 000 m ( 55 @,@ 000 yd ) . The destroyers laid a smoke screen in an attempt to hide the carrier , but the Germans quickly closed the distance . At 17 : 26 , the range had decreased by half , to around 25 @,@ 000 metres ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) , and both German ships opened fire . Scharnhorst struck Glorious at a range of approximately 24 @,@ 200 m ( 26 @,@ 500 yd ) , one of the longest recorded hits in the history of naval gunfire . Glorious was hit by at least three shells and reduced to a burning hulk . At 19 : 00 , the ship capsized and sank . Scharnhorst shifted fire to Ardent while Gneisenau engaged Acasta ; both ships sank their targets . Before she sank , Acasta launched four torpedoes at Scharnhorst ; the ship evaded three , though the fourth struck the starboard side near the rear gun turret . During the engagement , Scharnhorst fired 212 main battery shells . 
 The torpedo hit caused significant damage to Scharnhorst ; several watertight compartments , including parts of the starboard engine room , were flooded , she took on a list of 3 ° , and she was 3 m ( 9 ft 10 in ) down by the stern . The two ships withdrew to Trondheim , though Scharnhorst was limited to a speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) — they arrived in the afternoon of 9 June . On June 11 , 12 Hudson bombers from the RAF attempted to bomb Scharnhorst ; they all missed their target . Another air raid , this time 15 Blackburn Skuas launched by the Royal Navy 's HMS Ark Royal , followed on 13 June . The Luftwaffe intercepted the raid and shot down eight of the aircraft , though seven made it through to the ship . Only one bomb found its mark , but it failed to explode . On 20 June , enough repair work had been done to permit the ship to sail down to Kiel . Two air attacks followed , but anti @-@ aircraft fire from Scharnhorst and her escorts drove them both back . Reports of British ships in the area forced the ship to seek refuge in Stavanger for two days , before she resumed the journey to Kiel . Repairs were effected over the following six months . 
 = = = Operation Berlin = = = 
 Under the command of Admiral Günther Lütjens , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau broke into the Atlantic in late January 1941 to raid convoys between North America and Great Britain . On 8 February , they spotted a convoy , HX 106 , but it was escorted by the battleship HMS Ramillies , armed with eight 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns . The German ships therefore broke off the attack . A second convoy was encountered on 22 February ; Scharnhorst sank the tanker Lustrous , while Gneisenau accounted for four cargo ships . On 8 March , Scharnhorst spotted another convoy , but it too had battleship protection , in the form of HMS Malaya . A week later , on the 15th , another convoy was intercepted ; Scharnhorst sank two vessels while Gneisenau captured three and sank one . Following the engagement , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau headed for Brest in occupied France ; they arrived by 22 March . 
 On 6 April , four Beaufort torpedo @-@ bombers attacked Gneisenau in port . Only one of the aircraft attacked successfully ; the hit did significant damage to the ship . Gneisenau shipped some 3 @,@ 050 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 000 long tons ; 3 @,@ 360 short tons ) of water , which caused her to list 2 ° and settle lower in the water . The shock force of the explosion also did a great deal of internal damage ; fuel tanks were ruptured and electrical systems were damaged . A salvage tugboat was brought alongside to assist in flood control . Gneisenau was put into dry dock for repairs , which were prolonged by further British air raids . On the night of 9 – 10 April , British high @-@ level bombers attacked both Gneisenau and Scharnhorst . The latter escaped unscathed , but the former was struck four times ; 72 men were killed and another 90 were wounded . 
 While docked in La Pallice on 24 July , Scharnhorst was attacked by several squadrons of Halifax bombers ; five bombs — two high explosive 227 kg ( 500 lb ) and three semi @-@ AP 454 kg ( 1 @,@ 001 lb ) — found their mark . Two 454 kg bomb managed to penetrate both armoured decks , all the way down through the double bottom , before coming to rest on the sea floor ; it however failed to explode . The third also failed to detonate . One of the 227 kg bombs penetrated the upper deck just forward of the rear gun turret , and exploded on the main armoured deck . The last bomb fell on the starboard side and also detonated on the main armour deck . The ship listed at 8 ° , after having taken in between 1 @,@ 520 long tons ( 1 @,@ 700 short tons ) and 3 @,@ 050 long tons ( 3 @,@ 420 short tons ) of water . Casualties amounted to two men killed and 15 wounded . The following day Scharnhorst arrived in Brest for repairs , which lasted for four months . 
 = = = Operation Cerberus = = = 
 In early 1942 , the crews of Scharnhorst , Gneisenau , and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen made preparations for Operation Cerberus , a daylight dash up the English Channel . The ships were to be redeployed to Norway , to assist in the disruption of convoys to the Soviet Union , as well as the defence of occupied Norway . The ships left Brest late on 11 February , and remained undetected for the majority of the operation . East of Dover , a flight of six Swordfish torpedo bombers attacked the ships without result . At 15 : 31 , Scharnhorst struck a magnetic mine , which damaged the ship 's circuit breakers enough to shut down the entire electrical system . The ship was immobilized briefly — between 15 : 49 and 16 : 01 , all three turbines were restarted and the ship resumed a speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) . A series of air attacks ensued , though through evasive maneuvers , anti @-@ aircraft fire , and Luftwaffe fighters , they were all repulsed . By noon on 13 February , Scharnhorst had reached Wilhelmshaven , though after two days she was transferred to Kiel for repairs , which lasted until July 1942 . 
 Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had continued their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized . At 14 : 45 , the ships were attacked by five Whirlwind fighter @-@ bombers — German fighters beat them back . Several more air attacks followed over the next two hours , though without success for the British . At 16 : 17 , five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships , but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced the others to turn away . Near Terschelling , Gneisenau struck a mine that did minor damage to the hull , though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines . Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted , which lasted for about 30 minutes . By 03 : 50 on 13 February , the ship had reached Helgoland . 
 = = = Scharnhorst 's deployment to Norway = = = 
 In January 1943 , it was decided to deploy Scharnhorst to Norway , along with Prinz Eugen and several destroyers . Attempts to sail on 7 and 23 January were aborted after the navy received reports of heavy activity at British air bases in Britain . A third try on 10 February terminated when Scharnhorst ran aground while trying to avoid collision with a U @-@ boat . Repairs lasted until 26 February . On 8 March , Scharnhorst and four destroyers departed Gotenhafen ; she arrived off Narvik on 14 March . For 6 months , fuel shortages curtailed any major operations by Scharnhorst or the other ships in Norway , which included the Bismarck @-@ class Tirpitz and the heavy cruiser Lützow . On 25 November 1943 Scharnhorst carried out a two @-@ hour full power trial achieving 29 @.@ 6 knots ( 54 @.@ 8 km / h ; 34 @.@ 1 mph ) and it was noted that her draught had increased by over .5 metres ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) from her 1940 trials where she had attained 31 @.@ 14 knots ( 57 @.@ 67 km / h ; 35 @.@ 84 mph ) . 
 = = = = Battle of North Cape = = = = 
 On 20 December 1943 , Scharnhorst was ordered to intercept the next convoy to the Soviet Union , Convoy JW 55B . The ship was to operate only with five destroyers ; Tirpitz had been damaged in a British raid in September , and Lützow was away for periodic repairs . On 25 December , the location of the convoy was ascertained , and at 19 : 00 the ship left port , under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Erich Bey . The British fleet had a significant advantage , however : they were able to decrypt German naval codes , and so they were aware of Bey 's intentions . The cruisers HMS Sheffield , Belfast , and Norfolk were positioned to block Scharnhorst . Admiral Bruce Fraser , aboard the battleship HMS Duke of York , was some 270 miles away , and steaming to cut off Scharnhorst after she was engaged by the three cruisers . Belfast picked up Scharnhorst on radar at 08 : 40 ; forty minutes later lookouts on Sheffield spotted the ship , at a distance of 11 @,@ 000 m ( 12 @,@ 000 yd ) . Shortly thereafter , Belfast fired star shells to illuminate the target , and Norfolk opened fire with her 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 in ) guns ; in the span of 20 minutes , she hit Scharnhorst twice . The second hit destroyed Scharnhorst 's forward Seetakt radar . 
 By 10 : 00 , Scharnhorst , using her 4 – 6 knot speed advantage , broke off the engagement and resumed searching for the convoy . At 12 : 00 , Belfast again picked up Scharnhorst , and in 20 minutes were again in range . This time , Scharnhorst had better luck with her gunnery ; at 12 : 23 , Norfolk was hit twice by 28 @.@ 3 cm shells . One hit disabled a gun turret , and the second tore a hole in the hull and disabled her radar . Near @-@ misses rained shell splinters down on Sheffield . At 12 : 41 , Scharnhorst again increased speed and broke off the engagement . The British shadowed her , and relayed position reports to Admiral Fraser in Duke of York . At 13 : 15 , Admiral Bey decided to call off the search and return to port . Shortly before 17 : 00 , the British ships closed it : Belfast again illuminated the ship with star shells , while Duke of York fired salvos from her main battery . A hit from Duke of York disabled " A " turret , and at 18 : 00 , another hit penetrated the upper portion of the belt and caused significant damage to the engine room . This hit temporarily reduced her speed to 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) , though repairs quickly allowed her to steam at 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . 
 Shells from Scharnhorst 's main guns struck Duke of York 's mast and disabled her surface radars . The lack of radar forced Duke of York to cease fire at 18 : 24 , after having hit Scharnhorst at least 13 times . The hits from Duke of York disabled most of Scharnhorst 's armament in the process . Admiral Fraser ordered his destroyers to approach the ship and torpedo her . Scharnhorst was hit at least four times by torpedoes fired by HMS Scorpion and HNoMS Stord . The hits caused extensive flooding and slowed the ship to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Duke of York then closed to 9 @,@ 100 m ( 10 @,@ 000 yd ) to hammer away at the ship . At the time , only " C " turret on Scharnhorst remained operational ; surviving gun crews transferred ammunition from the disabled " A " and " B " turrets to " C " turret . As more water entered Scharnhorst , her speed continued to fall to 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . At 19 : 25 , the light cruiser Jamaica fired three torpedoes , followed by six from Belfast . Several destroyers closed in and fired torpedoes as well , though in the smoke and haze , it was unknown how many hit the crippled ship . Scharnhorst was listing severely and very low in the water . At 19 : 45 , the ship capsized to starboard and sank , with her propellers still spinning . She sank at the position 72 ° 16 ′ 0 ″ N 28 ° 41 ′ 0 ″ E. Of the crew of 1 @,@ 968 officers and men , only 36 survived . Rear @-@ Admiral Erich Bey was lost with his ship . 
 = = = Gneisenau 's reconstruction = = = 
 Gneisenau was also scheduled to deploy to Norway , but she suffered heavy damage during a bombing raid on the night of 26 – 27 February 1942 . A 1000 lb bomb penetrated the armoured deck just ahead of the forward turret ; shell splinters detonated the ammunition magazine , which did tremendous damage to the bow of the ship and burnt out " A " turret ; 112 men were killed and another 21 were injured . It was estimated that it would take two years to make the ship ready for service . Since this was such a long period , it was determined that it would be more efficient if during the repair work , the ship was reconstructed to mount six 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns in place of her 28 @.@ 3 cm weapons . To accomplish this , the hull would need to be lengthened by 10 m ( 32 ft 10 in ) to provide additional buoyancy and the electrical system would have to be overhauled . Turrets " B " and " C " were to be removed and transferred to Norway to serve as coastal defence guns . 
 On 4 April , Gneisenau , along with the icebreaker Castor and the old pre @-@ dreadnought Schlesien departed Kiel for Gotenhafen . Once there , conversion work began : the wrecked bow was removed and her " B " and " C " turrets were removed and disassembled for transport . Krupp would build the new 38 cm turrets , which required strengthening of the barbette structures to support their weight . By early 1943 , repair work was largely completed and the ship was ready to receive the improved bow and 38 cm turrets , but this was not to be . The failure of surface units to intercept and destroy a convoy in the Arctic on 31 December 1942 prompted Hitler to order all major surface units to be scrapped . Work on Gneisenau ceased , and materials that had been allocated for her repair were diverted to other projects . 
 The ship was then disarmed and all but abandoned in the harbor . Her 15 cm guns were placed as coastal batteries in Denmark . When the Soviet army approached in early 1945 , the ship was towed out into the outer harbor and sunk as a block ship , on 23 March 1945 . A Polish salvage firm raised the wreck on 12 September 1951 and subsequently broke the ship up for scrap metal . " C " Turret remains in Trondheim , Norway ; the Norwegian government offered without success to return the turret to Germany for display in a museum . The 15 cm guns in Denmark were taken over by the Danish military ; two of the turrets were moved to <unk> in 1952 . The guns were put into reserve in 1984 , though they continued to be fired during annual training . They fired their last shot in 2000 , after which the fortress was turned into a museum . 
 = Charlene Richard = 
 Charlene Marie Richard ( 13 January 1947 – 11 August 1959 ) was a twelve @-@ year @-@ old Roman Catholic Cajun girl residing in Richard , Louisiana , ( 30 ° 25 ′ 18 ″ N 92 ° 18 ′ 46 ″ W ) in the United States at the time of her death . Richard has become the focus of a popular belief that she is a saint — a person who is in heaven — who has performed a number of miracles . The Roman Catholic Church has not given any official approval or begun any processes leading towards her canonization , but local Catholic clergy and diocesan officials have permitted , promoted , and participated in the popular veneration of Richard . 
 = = Life and final illness = = 
 Richard was the second @-@ oldest of ten children born to Joseph Elvin and Mary Alice Richard . Adults and children who knew her considered her to be smart but otherwise unremarkable . She was a devout Catholic but no more so than was customary in the local Cajun community . Richard 's mother said , " She liked sports and was always busy with something . She went to church and said her rosary , but she was just a normal little girl . " In May 1959 , after reading a book about Therese of Lisieux Richard asked her grandmother whether she , too , could become a saint by praying like Therese . 
 After reporting appearances of a tall woman in black who vanishes , and her teacher recommending that she was not herself , her mother took her to a physician . As a result , only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette , Louisiana . At the request of her family , she was informed by the hospital chaplain , Joseph Brennan , a newly ordained Catholic priest , that she was going to die . Though the illness was painful , she remained cheerful , meekly accepted her fate , and offered up her suffering to God . Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily . While dying , Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism . The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital , <unk> Crowley , a nun , also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others . Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic . Richard died on 11 August 1959 . 
 = = Belief in Richard as saint = = 
 Before her death Brennan and Crowley began telling people about Richard and Richard 's family became aware that there was a belief that she was " special . " Floyd Calais , a Catholic priest who was at the time the chaplain of Charity Hospital in Lafayette , was a close friend of Brennan . In 1961 , Calais began praying to Richard to be assigned to a parish . He was assigned to St. Edwards parish in Richard , Louisiana — Richard 's burial place — that same year . Once there , he discovered the need to raise money to build a new church there . Calais says that he was " invited to retreats and recollections , and began speaking about Charlene , how she achieved grace before she died " and about the need for money to build a new church in the parish . " People started going to her grave , " he said , " and began sending checks to build the church . What I thought would take 8 – 10 years took 2 1 / 2 . " 
 As early as the late 1960s and by 1972 at the latest , prayer cards marked " For Private Devotion only " with a photograph of Richard , a prayer to her , and a prayer for her canonization were in circulation and xerographic copies were frequently being sent to individuals in need of help . A 1975 series of articles about Richard in the newspaper of the Lafayette diocese spread the cult and were republished in a booklet , " Charlene , A Saint from Southwest Louisiana " , in 1979 . Testimonials by individuals who believed that they had benefited by prayer to Richard were added and the booklet was again republished in 1988 . A widespread belief formed in the area that Richard would intercede in heaven for people 's prayers to be answered . 
 By 1989 , the belief had spread outside the Cajun area . Hundreds of people were visiting Richard 's grave each week , which had been illuminated so visits could occur in the evening and a box had been provided in which to leave written petitions to Richard . On the thirtieth anniversary of her death that year , an outdoor mass was held there which was attended by four thousand people and which was covered by Louisiana television stations and the Cable News Network , and was reported in newspapers in Louisiana , Dallas , Houston , Miami , Orlando , Albany , and Seattle . The media coverage resulted in knowledge of Richard spreading world @-@ wide , with interest in her expressed in Yugoslavia , Croatia , Australia , and Africa . Approximately a thousand people attended anniversary masses there in both 1991 and 1999 , with about 400 attending in 2007 , and thousands come to her grave each year , including chartered buses from New Orleans . 
 = = Church position = = 
 No official canonization procedures have begun for Richard , though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991 . Unlike the traditional support for canonization of a saint , which begins with popular devotion and is only later recognized by the Church , support for Richard began outside her immediate home area and was first promoted by the clergy , beginning with Brennan , Crowley , and Calais . The bishop of the Lafayette diocese at the time of her death , Maurice Schexnayder , visited her grave multiple times and referred to her as a saint . Another bishop of the diocese , Harry Flynn , presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989 , along with sixteen other priests . The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization , the Friends of Charlene , to spread her story . 
 = Hurricane Florence ( 1988 ) = 
 Hurricane Florence was the third of four named tropical cyclones to make landfall on the United States during the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season . The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the season , Florence developed on September 7 from an area of convection associated with a dissipating frontal trough in the southern Gulf of Mexico . After initially moving eastward , the storm turned northward and strengthened . Florence reached hurricane status and later peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) on September 9 shortly before striking southeastern Louisiana . The storm rapidly weakened over land and dissipated on September 11 over northeastern Texas . 
 Early in its duration , the storm dropped rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula . Upon striking Louisiana , Florence produced a moderate storm surge , causing severe beach erosion in some locations . Gusty winds were also reported , causing power outages to over 100 @,@ 000 people . In Alabama , one man died while trying to secure his boat . Rainfall from the hurricane caused severe river flooding in portions of the Florida Panhandle in an area already severely affected by heavy rainfall ; the flooding damaged or destroyed dozens of houses in Santa Rosa County . Throughout its path , damage totaled about $ 2 @.@ 9 million ( 1988 USD , $ 5 @.@ 3 million 2008 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 4 , a cold front exited the coast of Texas into the Gulf of Mexico . A convective band from the front continued southeastward and stalled between Veracruz , Mexico and Tampa , Florida . The band began to split into two on September 6 ; the northeastern portion developed into a frontal wave and tracked northeastward , while the southwestern portion remained nearly stationary and began showing signs of tropical organization . Located in an area of generally low pressures , the system developed a spiral band structure , though deep convection was mostly intermittent . Subsequent to the formation of a surface circulation , the system developed into a tropical depression while located about 450 miles ( 725 km ) northwest of Mérida , Yucatán . 
 The depression drifted eastward under the influence of the dissipating frontal trough , and intensified into Tropical Storm Florence to the north of the Yucatán Peninsula , as confirmed by Hurricane Hunters . Initially , the center was located to the north of the deep convection , with only one weak rainband to the north of the circulation . However , subsequent to a drop in vertical wind shear , an increase in moisture , and increase in upper @-@ level outflow , deep convection greatly increased and organized over the circulation early on September 9 . As the trough dissipated and a ridge built northwestward behind it , steering currents became weak , leaving Florence temporarily stationary . Later on September 9 , the influence of a mid- to upper @-@ level trough to its north caused Florence to accelerate northward . Steadily intensifying , Florence attained hurricane status about 100 miles ( 165 km ) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River . The hurricane intensified slightly further , and struck the western Mississippi River Delta with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at 0200 UTC on September 10 . Upon making landfall , dry air became entrained in the circulation , and Florence rapidly weakened over southeastern Louisiana . By the time it passed over New Orleans and Lake Ponchartrain most convection had dissipated , and about ten hours after making landfall Florence degenerated into a tropical depression . The system subsequently crossed over southwestern Mississippi as it turned northwestward , and later entered northern Louisiana before dissipating over northeastern Texas on September 11 . The mid @-@ level circulation turned northeastward through the central United States before dissipating over Ohio on September 13 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On September 9 , about 16 hours before Florence made landfall , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Port Arthur , Texas to Pensacola , Florida . Three hours later , the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron , Louisiana , with a tropical storm warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola , Florida . Around the time of Florence moving ashore , the National Hurricane Center limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola , Florida to Morgan City , Louisiana . Hours after the hurricane made landfall , the warning was replaced by a tropical storm warning from Mobile , Alabama to Grand Isle , Louisiana , which was discontinued two hours later . 
 Prior to the arrival of the hurricane , an estimated 20 @,@ 000 people evacuated the coastal parishes of southeastern Louisiana , including nearly all of the 2 @,@ 000 residents on Grand Isle . Small @-@ scale evacuations were issued for residents living in low @-@ lying or coastal areas of Mississippi and Alabama . Offshore , the threat of the hurricane prompted oil companies to evacuate employees on oil rigs to the mainland . 
 The threat of the hurricane caused Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to cancel a rally and two fund @-@ raising events in New Orleans . Governor Buddy Roemer issued for the Louisiana National Guard to be on standby for emergency duty . Officials closed several bridges across southeastern Louisiana and also canceled ferry travel across Lake Ponchartrain . In Pensacola , Florida , the Navy base moved the USS Lexington into the Gulf of Mexico during the hurricane , and also sent more than 100 aircraft to a base in Ohio .

 The primary rainband extending southward from the circulation of Florence dropped moderate rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula and through southern Mexico . Rainfall amounts peaked at 10 @.@ 79 inches ( 274 mm ) in San Baltazar <unk> , Guerrero , with 10 @.@ 67 inches ( 271 mm ) reported in southeastern Chiapas and 9 @.@ 74 inches ( 247 mm ) near Merida . Damage , if any , is unknown . 
 Upon making landfall on Louisiana , Hurricane Florence produced higher than normal tides , including a peak observation of 7 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) above mean sea level on the Bayou <unk> to the east of New Orleans . Rainfall was relatively light , ranging from about 1 inch ( 25 mm ) to a maximum of 4 @.@ 05 inches ( 103 mm ) at Watson . Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana , with wind gusts peaking at 64 mph ( 103 km / h ) at an automatic Coast Guard Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta . An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish . Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of the levee system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines , Saint Bernard , and Saint Tammany Parishes . On Grand Isle , strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion , with most areas on the island losing about 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) of beach . The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix . The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in Delacroix ; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the levee being pumped to the gulf . Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state , primarily from falling trees . The winds also downed numerous power lines , leaving about 150 @,@ 000 people without power for some period of time during the storm . The power outages were short @-@ lived , with about 6 @,@ 900 left without power by the day after the hurricane . Damage in the state was fairly minor , totaling about $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 1988 USD , $ 4 @.@ 4 million 2007 USD ) . 
 Rainfall from Florence reached over 7 inches ( 178 mm ) at one location in southeastern Mississippi , while a station 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south @-@ southeast of <unk> , Alabama reported a storm @-@ wide peak rainfall total of 10 @.@ 67 inches ( 271 mm ) . Despite the rainfall , no damage was reported in Alabama or Mississippi . In Mobile Bay in Alabama , one man died while attempting to secure his boat — the only direct fatality related to the hurricane . 
 Heavy rainfall was reported along the Florida Panhandle , peaking at over 10 inches ( 254 mm ) in the extreme northwestern portion of the state . The rainfall caused the worst flooding in ten years , and resulted in additional flooding to the already swollen Coldwater Creek and Blackwater River in Santa Rosa County . Near the river , 30 homes were destroyed with an additional 50 houses damaged , totaling about $ 320 @,@ 000 ( 1988 USD , $ 560 @,@ 000 2007 USD ) in damage . Several roads were closed from the flooding , as well . The strong convective band associated with Florence extended across the Florida Panhandle , spawning nine tornadoes in Walton County and one waterspout in Bay County . Damage from the tornadoes amounted to about $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 1988 USD , $ 175 @,@ 000 2007 USD ) . 
 The remnant circulation of Florence produced light to moderate rainfall across the Ohio Valley and central United States . Precipitation reached over 3 inches ( 75 mm ) in extreme southeastern Missouri , southern Illinois , and central Ohio , and extended as far northward as Michigan .

 Stock began training as a professional wrestler in Winnipeg , Manitoba 's Top Rope Championship Wrestling . She trained for five weeks before an open spot on the company 's tour gave her the opportunity to debut . She debuted on the Northwest Territories independent circuit on February 22 , 2002 . She wrestled for Can @-@ Am Wrestling in early 2002 and was awarded the Can @-@ Am Wrestling Women 's Championship upon her debut in the promotion . That July , she joined Real Action Wrestling under the ring name Sweet Sarah , in the Canadian Maritimes as a valet to Johnny Wiseguy . Soon after , she began wrestling in the promotion , teaming with Wiseguy in a series of mixed tag team matches against Duke MacIsaac and his valet , Rachel . The promotion soon folded , but Stock signed with <unk> Wrestling ( MSW ) in Halifax , Nova Scotia , where she debuted in August 2002 and continued to wrestle as Sweet Sarah . There were few female wrestlers in the area , so she worked in several matches against male wrestlers . 
 The following month , Stock began wrestling for Afa <unk> 's World Xtreme Wrestling ( WXW ) , based in Pennsylvania , United States . She worked against female wrestlers , including Mercedes Martinez and Valentina . In October , she returned to Canada and wrestled in Albertan independent promotions under the ring name Sarah Griffin . She engaged in a feud with Charlotte Webb , and the two faced each other in both Hybrid Wrestling Coalition and Can @-@ Am Wrestling . Griffin was successful in the majority of these matches . From November 2002 to April 2003 , she worked for several other Canadian independent promotions , including Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling , Monster Pro Wrestling , and Premier Championship Wrestling . In April , she returned to MSW , where she feuded with male wrestler Kyle <unk> . This feud included matches with special stipulations , including a " Kiss My Ass " match which she won , and a Bra and Panties match .

 In 2003 , in an effort to improve her in @-@ ring skills , Stock relocated to Monterrey , Mexico to face the female wrestlers there . At the suggestion of a promoter , Stock began working while wearing a mask . She also took on the ring name Dark Angel , on the advice of Eddie Watts . She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico , as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match . On October 17 , she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship . 
 While wrestling in Mexico , Stock continued to work for various promotions in the United States and Europe . She worked several matches for World Xtreme Wrestling in November 2003 . On November 23 , she wrestled a match for Ring of Honor ( ROH ) , where she lost to Allison Danger . She also had a match in Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) , which at the time was a developmental promotion for World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . 
 On April 2 , 2004 , Stock lost her mask in a forty @-@ five minute mask vs. mask match against Princesa Sujei at a Lucha Libre Femenil event . Shortly thereafter , she decided to leave Monterrey to move to Mexico City and wrestle for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) . Although Stock began appearing with AAA under the assumption that she would be wrestling , the company had her start out by holding up signs for the crowd at events . Stock did not wrestle regularly for AAA , and she stopped appearing for the promotion after a few sporadic shows .

 Upon returning to Mexico , Stock signed with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) , AAA 's rival promotion . She began working regularly for CMLL as Dark Angel in the promotion 's newly @-@ rebuilt women 's division , while also working for various independent promotions . On March 25 , 2005 , she defeated Princesa Sujei to win Federación Internacional de Lucha Libre Women 's Championship . On September 9 , Stock was one of two winners , along with Marcela , of a Torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine who would get to battle for the vacant CMLL World Women 's Championship . However , on September 16 , at CMLL 's 72nd Anniversary Show , Marcela defeated Stock to win the title . Afterwards , Stock entered a feud with La Amapola , which concluded on April 14 , 2006 , when Stock put her hair on the line against Amapola 's mask . Stock ended up winning the match and forcing Amapola to unmask herself . 
 In September 2006 , Stock toured the Canadian Maritimes with <unk> Wrestling , where she once again wrestled Kyle <unk> , the MSW Atlantic Canadian Champion , and beat him in all three of their matches . Because the title was not on the line , however , she did not win the belt . She also had several high @-@ profile matches against Nattie Neidhart , daughter of professional wrestler Jim Neidhart . Stock and Neidhart split the series , with Stock winning two matches and Neidhart winning three . 
 Returning to CMLL , Stock competed in , and won , a bodybuilding contest between CMLL wrestlers , a contest she would win three times in a row . While working for the promotion , she also appeared in a commercial for PlayStation 3 . An agent came to the arena looking for someone to perform a stunt for the commercial , and Stock was given the role . On November 25 , 2009 , Stock won the CMLL Bodybuilding Contest for the fourth year in a row . She would go on to pick her fifth , sixth , seventh and eighth victories in the contest on November 25 , 2010 , November 24 , 2011 , November 29 , 2012 and November 26 , 2014 .

After wins over Saki Kashima , Kairi Hojo and Kyoko Kimura and a loss against Miho Wakizawa , Dark Angel headed to final day of the tournament at the top of her round @-@ robin block , however , a loss to Natsuki ☆ <unk> meant that she missed advancing to the finals of the tournament . In Dark Angel 's final match of the tour on October 3 , she and Io Shirai wrestled Miho Wakizawa and Nanae Takahashi to a twenty @-@ minute time limit draw . Dark Angel was scheduled to return to Stardom on March 3 , 2013 , but due to a visa issue , she had to postpone her return until March 10 , when she , Io Shirai and Yuzuki Aikawa defeated Act Yasukawa , Natsuki ☆ <unk> and Yoshiko in a six @-@ woman tag team main event .

 On April 21 , 2009 , Stock wrestled a dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) , where she was defeated by Awesome Kong . She then defeated Taylor Wilde in another dark match the following day . On the May 11 , 2009 , episode of the Spanish @-@ language version of TNA Today , Stock was introduced as Sarita . Stock made her debut as a face on the July 16 episode of Impact ! , defeating Alissa Flash . During August and September , Sarita teamed with Taylor Wilde in a tournament , where the winners would be crowned the inaugural Knockouts Tag Team Champions . After defeating the teams of Alissa Flash and Daffney and Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed , Sarita and Wilde defeated The Beautiful People ( Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky ) at No Surrender to win the championship .

This led to a match on the January 4 , 2010 , live episode of Impact ! , where Sarita and Wilde lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Kong and Hamada . 
 Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 episode of Xplosion , when she interfered and helped Wilde defeat Daffney to end the team 's long losing streak . The following week , when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained that she did not want to win by cheating , Sarita claimed that she was a winner and , unlike Wilde , did not need her tag team partner 's help in her match against Daffney . After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match , Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent . On the July 1 episode of Impact ! , Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne , proclaiming she was sick of losing matches . Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion , with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet on the ropes for leverage .

Sarita and Taylor Wilde had their third match at the November 9 tapings of Xplosion , with Sarita once again coming out victorious . Despite wrestling on the November 25 episode of Impact ! as a face , when she answered the challenge of TNA Women 's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne and then defeated her in a non @-@ title match , Sarita resumed her status as a heel and her feud with Sky on the December 9 episode of Impact ! when , despite losing to her and Love in the first round match of a tournament for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship , Sarita claimed that Sky was a loser , and would never be able to beat her . On the December 23 episode of Impact ! , Sky was set to wrestle for the Knockouts Tag Team Championship , but was forced to miss the match , after being attacked backstage by Sarita . The following week , Sarita defeated Sky in a Strap match . On the February 10 episode of Impact ! , Sarita 's on @-@ screen cousin , Rosita , made her TNA debut in an eight @-@ woman tag team match , where the duo teamed with Madison Rayne and Tara and defeated Angelina Love , Mickie James , Velvet Sky and Winter .

Afterwards , Sky challenged Sarita to a one @-@ on @-@ one match , where she agreed to put her career on the line . On the March 3 episode of Impact ! , Sky was able to defeat Sarita in a singles match , salvaging her career in the process . 
 On March 13 at Victory Road , Sarita and Rosita defeated Angelina Love and Winter to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship , with Sarita proclaiming that their victory would start a " Mexican takeover " of TNA . On the following episode of Impact ! , the alliance of Sarita , Rosita and Hernandez was named Mexican America . The three of them were then defeated in a six @-@ person street fight by Love , Winter and Matt Morgan . On the March 24 episode of Impact ! , Anarquia became the fourth member of the group . In the following weeks , Sarita and Rosita successfully defended the Knockouts Tag Team Championship , first against The Beautiful People ( Angelina Love and Velvet Sky ) , and then against Madison Rayne and Tara . They made their third successful defense on the June 16 episode of Impact Wrestling , defeating Velvet Sky and Ms. Tessmacher , following interference from ODB . In early July , Stock was sidelined from in @-@ ring competition after suffering facial paralysis . On the July 21 episode of Impact Wrestling , Sarita , wearing a protective mask , and Rosita lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Ms. Tessmacher and Tara . Sarita and Rosita received a rematch for the title on August 7 at Hardcore Justice , but were again defeated by Tessmacher and Tara . Sarita was eventually unmasked on October 16 , during the Bound for Glory pre @-@ show by Ink Inc. member Toxxin . The following month at Turning Point , Sarita , Anarquia and Hernandez faced Ink Inc . ' s Jesse Neal , Shannon Moore and Toxxin in a six @-@ person tag team match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship , which Mexican America managed to retain , when Sarita pinned Toxxin after hitting her with the title belt . On the March 22 , 2012 , episode of Impact Wrestling , Sarita and Rosita again failed to recapture the Knockouts Tag Team Championship , when they were defeated by Eric Young and ODB . Sarita and Rosita were given another title opportunity on April 15 at Lockdown , but were once again defeated by Eric Young and ODB , this time in a tag team steel cage match . Afterwards , both Sarita and Rosita went inactive from TNA , while Anarquia left the promotion and Hernandez turned face , effectively disbanding Mexican America . 
 Sarita returned to work a house show main event on June 14 in Belton , Texas , in which she , Rosita , Angelina Love and Winter were defeated by Mickie James , Tara and Velvet Sky , before once again going inactive from TNA .

 = Battle of Apple River Fort = 
 The Battle of Apple River Fort , occurred on the late afternoon of June 24 , 1832 at the Apple River Fort , in present @-@ day Elizabeth , Illinois , when Black Hawk and 200 of his " British Band " of Sauk and <unk> surprised by a group of four messengers en route from Galena , Illinois . One of the couriers was wounded in the thigh as the riders quickly made for the protection of the nearby stockade . Fred ed Dixon rode ahead to warn some 70 settlers of the approaching Sauk and Fox , thus saving their <unk> small company of militia at the fort , about 30 men and boys led by Captain Clack Stone , fought off Black Hawk 's 150 @-@ man war party in an action that lasted about an hour . The withering pace of the gunfire eventually convinced Black Hawk that the fort was too heavily defended to lead a direct attack , and he and his band of warriors retreated . 
 After the battle , certain individuals were honored above the others for their bravery in assisting the numerically inferior force . Among them was Elizabeth Armstrong . She rallied the settlement 's 40 or so women and children , who had taken shelter inside the fort . The women and children were divided into two groups : one to mold musket balls and another to roll pre @-@ measured gun powder into cartridges . Some of the married women reload weapons so that the militia could keep up with the pace of the battle . Fr Though the fort was torn down around 1847 , a replica was built in its place and still stands in Elizabeth . George <unk> was the only fatality inside the fort . 
 = = Background = = 
 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830 – 31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies , he attempted to return to Iowa , but the undisciplined Illinois militia 's actions led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed , and the militias of Michigan Territory and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's Band . The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War . 
 The period between Stillman 's Run and the Battle of Apple River Fort was filled with war @-@ related activity and events . A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove , the Plum River settlement , Fort Blue Mounds and the war 's most famous incident , the Indian Creek massacre , all took place between mid @-@ May and late June 1832 . The week preceding the Battle of Apple River Fort was an important turning point for the militia : between June 16 – 18 two key battles , one at Waddams Grove and the other at Horseshoe Bend , played a key role in changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman 's Run . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Following the militia 's disastrous defeat at Stillman 's Run on May 14 , settlers in the lead @-@ mining region around Galena panicked ; many left the area altogether . The exaggerated claim that 2 @,@ 000 " bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping all Northern Illinois with the bosom of destruction " sent terror through the region . At the Apple River Settlement , the situation prompted residents to form a 46 @-@ man militia tentatively under Captain Vance L. Davidson . By late May Davidson was at the Plum River settlement ( present @-@ day Savanna , Illinois ) and Captain Clack Stone had taken over command ; under his lead the Apple River Fort was completed by May 22 , 1832 . In the days immediately preceding June 18 , 1832 , Apple River Fort 's horses were raided and stolen were stolen during the night . This incident was one of several around that time that led Illinois militia officer James W. Stephenson to clash with British Band warriors at " Stephenson 's Fight " ( later erroneously named Waddams Grove on June 18 . 
 On June 24 , 1832 , a supply wagon from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon . Unknown to the men traveling with the wagon , Black Hawk and his British Band , also en route to the fort , had fallen in line with them . Black Hawk 's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire . As the wagon team <unk> , four men traveling on the trail from Galena passed by ; the women inside the fort were eager to hear their news of the conflict with Black Hawk . 
 There were 28 @-@ 30 armed militia inside Apple River Fort at the time of the attack . Another 40 women , children and other settlers were resident in the Apple River Settlement . Captain Stone was in command of the garrison stationed at the fort , some of whom were not present for the battle . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The group of men , George Harkleroad , Fred Dixon , Edmund Welch , and J. Kirkpatrick were formed as a military message escort known as an " express " . They were travelling from Galena to Dixon , stopped briefly at the fort and then continued on their way . The group was about 900 feet ( 274 m ) east of the fort when the only man with a loaded gun , Welch , was ambushed by Black Hawk 's warriors . He was shot in the hip and fell from his horse . His companions aimed their unloaded weapons at the band , putting themselves between the wounded man and his attackers . The group recovered Welch and moved away from their assailants toward the fort . Fred Dixon , covered the retreat of his fellow express men as they raced for the fort . Three of the <unk> attained the safety of the fort , while Dixon fled on horse Apple River and the nearby farm of John McDonald , only to find it overrun by Native Americans as well . Dixon then abandoned his horse and walked to Galena , where he reported the Apple River Fort to be under attack . 
 The settlers took shelter inside the fort while the men and boys took up their positions at the portholes inside the fort . A vicious firefight erupted , involving around 150 of Black Hawk 's British Band . The battle raged for about an hour with heavy gunfire from both sides . At the battle 's onset many of the settlement 's women had been huddled in the cabins , but one woman , Elizabeth Armstrong , rallied the others to provide support to the soldiers . She assumed command of the women , assigning them to such tasks as molding musketballs and reloading the weapons while the soldiers tried to keep up their stream of gunfire . 
 The ferocity of the fight convinced Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat the hold @-@ outs and he abandoned the fight . His band raided cabins near the fort for much @-@ needed horses , flour , and clothing . He then retreated . Casualties were few , given the intensity of the battle . Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died ; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall 's pickets . Besides Welch , the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting , who suffered a non @-@ lethal wound to the side of his head . The number of Sauk casualties is unknown . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The defenders at Apple River Fort awaited the next move by Black Hawk , holding their positions through the night , but dawn came without incident . On the day following the battle , June 25 , a relief party consisting of two companies of mounted rangers arrived at the fort from Galena . The next day Black Hawk 's band would encounter Major John Dement and his detachment at the Second Battle of Kellogg 's Grove . The only militia member killed in the fighting , Harkleroad , was buried near the fort ; there is no trace of his grave . 
 Elizabeth Armstrong was praised by some as a heroine for her actions during the battle , displaying the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War . Her actions , in part , helped give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was heavily defended and a frontal attack would be inane . There has been disagreement regarding the name of the woman who assumed command at Apple River Fort ; a 1900 collection from the Wisconsin Historical Society misidentified her as " Mrs. Graham . " The same source stated that Armstrong was " cursing & swearing like a pirate " throughout the battle ; so angry that even Black Hawk 's band purported to hear her . The same collection described such action as " profane " and " a great drawback upon her credit . " 
 The fort was demolished around 1847 and its timbers used to construct a barn . Today , the fort and its three buildings have been reconstructed by the Apple River Fort Historic Foundation . The Apple River Fort Site is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places for its military and archaeological significance . 
 On January 1 , 2001 , the state of Illinois took over operation of the reconstructed Apple River Fort and its interpretive center . The state now operates the area as the Apple River Fort State Historic Site . Illinois ' purchase was funded , in part , through a US $ 160 @,@ 000 grant from the state of Illinois . 
 = Port Phillip v Van Diemen 's Land , 1851 = 
 On 11 and 12 February 1851 , teams from Port Phillip , Victoria and Van Diemen 's Land ( now Tasmania ) played a timeless cricket match at the Launceston Racecourse , known now as the NTCA Ground , in Tasmania . The match was held under the aegis of the Launceston Cricket Club , which represented the Van Diemen 's Land cricket team as the home team , and the Melbourne Cricket Club , which represented the Port Phillip team as the visiting team . The match was organised in celebration of the separation of Victoria from New South Wales . 
 William Philpott was the captain of the Port Phillip team , while John Marshall led the Van Diemen 's Land team . All overs bowled in the first first @-@ class cricket match had only four deliveries each . The first ball bowled during the match was an underarm delivery by William Henty of Van Diemen 's Land . Port Phillip 's Thomas Ferrier Hamilton scored the most runs during the match , while Thomas Antill , again from Port Phillip , took the most wickets . There were a significant number of additional distinctions earned and records set during the match . The match ended in two days after both teams had played two innings each . Van Diemen 's Land won the match by three wickets . 
 The match , which took close to a year in organising , became the first first @-@ class cricket match in Australia and the first intercolonial cricket match in Australia . The match is considered to be amongst the most significant events in the cricketing history of Australia . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1800s , cricket was not a widely popular sport in Australia , and interregional cricket matches in places like Tasmania were quite rare . The first recorded reference to cricket being played in Australia was on 8 January 1804 , when the Sydney Gazette reported the playing conditions for a domestic cricket match involving amateurs . The first cricketing match under the aegis of the Melbourne Cricket Club was held on 15 November 1838 on the Royal Mint grounds . The earliest images capturing a cricketing game in progress in Australia are artist John Rae 's three watercolour sketches of Hyde Park , painted in 1842 . 
 After the Launceston Cricket Club was founded in 1841 , there was an unsuccessful attempt that year to organise a match between the North and South of Tasmania . The match subsequently took place in 1850 , when Launceston played Hobart at Oatlands ; this match is considered to be the first North @-@ South cricket match . After this match , Launceston cricketers become more interested in playing opponents from across the Bass Strait . 
 At around this time , William Philpott – an English immigrant who played cricket for the Melbourne Cricket Club and who would later captain the Victorian team in the match against Tasmania – proposed at a special Melbourne Cricket Club meeting on 12 January 1850 that a cricketing challenge be sent to Tasmania for an intercolonial match . The match was also proposed in celebration of the impending separation of Victoria from New South Wales in 1851 . 
 Subsequently , in March 1850 , the Launceston Cricket Club received an invitation challenge from Melbourne Cricket Club to organise a cricket match between Van Diemen 's Land and Port Phillip 's cricket teams . In reply , Launceston Cricket Club proposed that the match take place in Launceston in the month of April 1850 . This communication from Launceston Cricket Club was delayed , resulting in the match being postponed . 
 The Cornwall Chronicle noted : " The match arose from a challenge having been sent in February last year by Victoria to the club newly formed in this town , which was then accepted to come off in the March following , and was only then prevented by the gentleman deputed to forward the acceptance forgetting to post his letter in time for the steamer . The Victorians with great courtesy repeating their challenge this spring . It was at once accepted and arranged to come off on the day it did . " A few months later , Melbourne Cricket Club again proposed the match . This subsequently led to the match getting scheduled for the month of February 1851 in Launceston , Tasmania . The fixture came to be considered as the first first @-@ class cricket match in Australia and also became the first intercolonial cricket match in Australia . 
 = = Match proceedings = = 
 The Melbourne Cricket Club decided that their players should have a uniform while playing the match . They chose the colours red , white and blue for the Victorian team 's match jerseys . These remain the official colours of the Melbourne Cricket Club till date . The Victorian team , wearing the multi @-@ coloured jerseys , and with friends and ladies in tow , reached Launceston on the SS Shamrock . The team was met with much fanfare on its arrival and the players were put up at the Cornwall Hotel , now known as the Batman Fawkner Inn . This was followed by considerable banqueting , which led to the team not having enough time to practice for the match . 
 The match started on 11 February 1851 at Launceston Cricket Club Ground , previously known as the Launceston Racecourse , currently known as the North Tasmania Cricket Association Ground . The match was scheduled as a timeless cricket match , in other words , a match that would be played without any limit on the number of days , till the match ended . 
 Expecting a sizeable audience , a number of spectator booths had been set up around the ground . The match was watched by around 2 @,@ 500 spectators in all , including a thousand from across the Bass Strait – with 1 @,@ 000 spectators on the first day and 1 @,@ 500 spectators on the second day . 
 The two captains leading the respective teams were John Marshall , who captained the Tasmanian team , and William Philpott , who captained the Victorian team . The Tasmanian team comprised five players from Launceston and three from Hobart , while the Longford , Perth and Westbury clubs contributed one player each . All cricketers playing in the match had their first @-@ class debuts in the match , with there being no twelfth man for either team . There were no boundaries at the Launceston Cricket Club Ground , and all overs bowled in the match had only four deliveries each – which was the norm in those days . By the very nature of this match , there were a significant number of distinctions earned and records set during the match .

 The Victorian players , after a ground inspection , criticised the quality of the playing ground ; the Tasmanian government apologised for the same , mentioning that they had had possession of the ground since only the past twelve months . As the cricket ground was rough , Charles Lyon and C. J. Weedon , the two umpires for the match , took some time to decide where the playing pitch would be . The toss was won by Marshall , who sent in Victoria to bat . The match started at 11 a.m.

 While the predominant bowling style of the Victorians was roundarm fast , the Tasmanians preferred underarm bowling . Thus , with Tasmania bowling first , leading the series of many firsts was the very first ball bowled in the history of Australian first @-@ class cricket , which was an underarm delivery . The first bowler in Australian first @-@ class cricket was William Henty of Tasmania , an underarm bowler , who opened the Tasmanian attack . Victoria 's Duncan Cooper , who opened the innings with William Philpott at the non @-@ striker 's end , became the first opening batsman in Australian first @-@ class cricket . Tasmania 's captain Marshal also kept the wicket for his team , and thus became the first wicket @-@ keeper in Australia 's first @-@ class cricket history . 
 After Henty 's first over , Tasmania 's Robert McDowall bowled from the other end . The opening batting pair of Cooper and William Philpott took 22 minutes to make 14 runs , when , at his personal score of 4 runs , Cooper became the first batsman in Australian first @-@ class cricket history to be dismissed and to be clean bowled . Tasmania 's Robert McDowall , who dismissed Cooper , consequently became the first wicket @-@ taking bowler and the first to effect a dismissal in this manner in Australian first @-@ class cricket . Thomas Hamilton took Cooper 's place at the wicket as the no . 3 batsman and soon ran the first four runs of Australian first @-@ class cricket . 
 The next dismissal was of Victorian captain Philpott , who scored 17 before getting caught . Philpott became the first batsman in Australian first @-@ class cricket history to reach double @-@ figures , and jointly scored the highest runs with James Brodie . Philpott also became the first batsman in Australian first @-@ class cricket to be dismissed by being caught , with Tasmania 's George Maddox becoming the first cricketer to have taken a catch during a dismissal . Tasmania 's McDowall earned the distinction of becoming the first bowler to effect a dismissal in this manner . Thomas Hamilton followed Philpott back to the stands soon after , getting bowled off McDowall 's bowling after having scored 10 runs . When Hamilton 's wicket fell at the turn of the first hour 's play , the score was 31 runs for 3 wickets . 
 As the match proceeded , Victoria 's Charles Lister , who replaced William Philpott at the crease and scored 10 runs , became the first cricketer in Australian first @-@ class cricket to be run out . Alfred Thomson quickly fell after that , making one run before getting clean bowled by McDowall , with the score standing at 42 runs for 5 wickets . Richard Philpott , the elder brother of Victorian captain William Philpott , made 12 runs to bring the score up to 54 , before getting bowled out by Henty and becoming the sixth Victorian player to get out . The seventh dismissal , Thomas Antill , became the first cricketer in Australian first @-@ class cricket history to have been dismissed after having scored a duck . Antill also became the first batsman in this genre of cricket to be dismissed by stumping . Tasmania 's Henty and Marshall became the first bowler – wicket @-@ keeper pair to effect a dismissal in this manner . 
 At the other end , Victoria 's James Brodie ran four runs thrice for his 17 runs , eventually getting caught at slip by Henty off McDowall 's bowling . The last two wickets fell cheaply , with Frederick Marsden and Matthew Hervey getting bowled by Henty at their individual scores of 2 and 0 respectively . Victoria 's Melmoth Hall remained not out . Victoria was bowled out in the first innings after playing 26 overs in 2 hours and 5 minutes , scoring 82 runs . While Henty took four wickets , McDowall became the first bowler in this genre of cricket to reach a five @-@ wicket haul . 
 For Tasmania , Gervase Du Croz opened the batting innings with captain Marshall at the non @-@ striker 's end . Charles Lister and Thomas Hamilton opened the Victorian bowling attack . Croz and Marshall batted resolutely for an hour , making 25 runs without losing any wicket , when a lunch break was announced by the umpires . When play resumed after lunch , Marshall and Croz maintained their pace to ensure that Tasmania reached 45 without loss . Croz made 27 runs , the highest in Tasmania 's first innings , and became the first Tasmanian batsman to score four runs , which he did twice in his innings . 
 Victoria 's Thomas Antill , who replaced Hamilton in the bowling attack , managed to break this partnership , sending Croz back to the pavilion with a delivery that took the bails off . William Field , who came out to bat after Croz , was bowled clean by Antill off the first ball he faced . George Maddox took Field 's place at the crease and scored one run to hand over the strike to Marshall . Tasmanian captain Marshall lost his wicket off the very next ball , giving a catch to Lister at point off Antill 's bowling . With Marshall 's wicket , Antill had taken three wickets in four balls . Marshall made the second @-@ highest score in the Tasmanian first innings , scoring 13 runs . 
 George Maddox departed next after scoring one run , with Antill taking his wicket . Tasmania 's 5th wicket fell when George Gibson , who replaced Maddox , was sent back to the pavilion by Hamilton , getting clean bowled after scoring 8 runs . Walter Westbrook who came in after Gibson 's wicket , became the first batsman in Australian first @-@ class cricket history to score five runs in a single ball . He was clean bowled by Antill after having scored 10 runs in 40 minutes . While the next player in , Charles Arthur , departed to Antill 's bowling after having scored one run , John Tabart made 2 runs before getting bowled out by Hamilton . Henty walked out to bat with eight wickets down for Tasmania , and was sent back to the pavilion almost immediately by Antill , after having scored a duck . Vincent Giblin and Robert McDowall , the last two Tasmanian players , brought up some rearguard action with a last wicket stand that pushed the team score above 100 . McDowall was the last player out , when , after having scored 11 , he was caught at wide on by Antill off Hamilton . Giblin remained not out on 7 . 
 At the conclusion of their first innings , Tasmania had played 32 overs in 2 hours and 40 minutes , scoring 104 runs and gaining a lead of 22 runs over Victoria 's first innings score . Before the match , the Tasmanians had been expected to struggle against the overarm attack of the Victorians , and Antill had indeed performed effectively ; yet , the Tasmanians were helped by a large total of 24 extras ( which included 11 byes and eight no @-@ balls ) . For Victoria , Antill was the highest wicket @-@ taker in the first innings with a seven @-@ wicket haul . 
 = = = = Second innings = = = = 
 Victoria 's second innings featured James Brodie and Melmoth Hall opening the innings . Brodie made 5 and was the first out , caught at long off by Tabart . Thomas Hamilton came first down the batting and was soon joined by Lister , when Hall was adjudged out leg before wicket to McDowall after scoring 6 . Lister could not score much , losing his wicket after scoring 3 , getting caught by Maddox off Field . Thomson , who came in after Lister 's wicket fell , could not better his first innings score of a single run ; he fell for a duck to Henty . William Philpott , the highest scorer of Victoria 's first innings , came in next . After taking three singles in 15 minutes of batting , Philpott was run out by a Tabart throw to Marshall when the team score stood at 28 runs . Next man in Cooper departed immediately for a duck , bowled Henty ; this was the fifth wicket down for Victoria . 
 At the other end , Hamilton batted on resolutely . Despite his vanguard action , Victoria kept losing wickets regularly . Cooper 's successor Roger Philpott , who made 12 runs in the first innings , could make only a single before getting caught by Westbrook off Henty . Marsden came in next , and lasted five minutes before getting dismissed by McDowall for 2 . The next batsman Hervey lasted less than that , scoring a single in three minutes before Henty took the bails off . 
 After having carried his bat through the hour , Hamilton was the last man out , falling leg before wicket to McDowall . His 35 runs scored in 60 minutes included three fours . This was the highest individual score of both innings for both teams . While Antill remained not out without scoring any run , none of the other Victorian batsmen reached double @-@ figures in the second innings . In the bowling department , Henty , McDowall and Field took 5 , 3 and 1 wickets respectively for Tasmania in the second innings . With the Victorian team getting dismissed in 1 hour and 20 minutes after playing 17 overs and scoring 57 runs , Tasmania was left to score 36 runs for an outright win . 
 Despite it being late in the evening , the two teams were enthusiastic to carry on and decided to attempt a result that day itself . Thus , it was nearly half past five when Vincent Giblin opened the second innings for Tasmania with Croz at the non @-@ striker 's end . Brodie and Antill opened the bowling attack for Victoria . Giblin was the first one to go , getting dismissed by Antill after having scored just one run . Croz 's wicket was the second ; his score of six runs , before getting bowled out by Antill , ensured that he ended the match as the highest scorer for Tasmania with an aggregate score of 33 runs for both innings . Antill took the third wicket too , sending Westbrook back to the stands with Cooper taking the catch . Victoria 's Brodie , who had not bowled during the first innings , got the wicket of the next man in ; Field was caught by Thomson after making a single . Gibson and Marshall , who succeeded Westbrook and Field , were also sent back in quick succession by Antill . 
 While Gibson could only manage a single before getting bowled , Marshall was caught and bowled by Antill for a duck , making this the first caught and bowled instance in Australian first @-@ class cricket . Tabart took Gibson 's place at the crease , while Arthur replaced Marshall . Around this time , the umpires called off play due to bad light . At the end of the first day 's play , Tasmania had lost six wickets scoring 15 runs . The Launceston Examiner wrote in its 19 February 1851 report : " The excitement was now very great , and neither side confident of victory . " 
 = = = Day two = = = 
 The second day 's proceedings started at 11 a.m. , with Tabart and Arthur resuming batting for Tasmania . While Arthur was caught by Hervey off Antill 's bowling without any addition to his overnight score , Tabart was dropped off the very second ball he faced . After getting this life , Tabart 's subsequent big hitting swung the game in the Tasmanians ' favour . McDowall , who replaced Arthur , and Tabart ensured that no further wickets fell while Tasmania successfully chased down the Victorian target . 
 = = = = Result = = = = 
 Needing to score 36 runs in the second innings to win the match , Tasmania scored the required runs taking an hour and 45 minutes in all , losing 7 wickets in 13 overs . Tasmania 's Marshall became the first ever winning captain and Victoria 's Philpott became the first ever losing captain in first @-@ class cricket in Australia . At close of play , Tabart had made 15 runs including one four , while McDowall had scored four runs . Victoria 's Antill had taken six wickets in all , becoming the first bowler in Australian first @-@ class cricket history to take a five @-@ wicket haul twice in the same match . Antill also became the highest wicket @-@ taking bowler for the match amongst both the teams , with an aggregate haul of 13 wickets , both innings combined . For Tasmania , the highest wicket taker was Henty , having taken nine wickets in both innings . On account of having scored 10 runs in the first innings , Victoria 's Hamilton became the highest scorer in the match amongst both the teams , with an aggregate score of 45 runs . 
 While the general level of fielding was considered very high throughout the match , Tasmanian players Marshall , Westbrook and Tabart were specifically praised for their admirable fielding attempts , which drew the crowd 's appreciation . The spectators were also noted to have displayed high levels of sportsmanship throughout the match , noticeably refraining from cheering the fall of the opponent team 's wickets or celebrating scoring shots from their own team . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 There was high camaraderie witnessed between the two teams and the organising clubs throughout the Victorian 's stay . After the first day 's proceedings , around a hundred people from Tasmania and Victoria , including the cricketers , had dinner together , and post that attended a ball . Similarly , after the match , a public ball organised by the Tasmanian hosts was held on the Thursday night at the Cornwall Hotel , where the visiting cricketers were staying . The event – which was attended by more the 350 people , including the Victorians and many of the supporters that had accompanied them – continued into the very early morning before the visitors were instructed to leave . On the day of leaving , the Tasmanian and Victorian players proceeded arm @-@ in @-@ arm to the departure wharf , walking from the Cornwall Hotel with the Launceston Brass Band playing along . 
 Noted Australian journalist Edmund Finn wrote in the book The Chronicles of Early Melbourne : " Everybody invited everybody , and the difficulty was how to contrive so as to partake of all that was offered . From the time of landing to the time of embarking the same spirit continued – dinners , balls , musical parties , picnics and every description of entertainment was got up to give a hearty welcome to the strangers from Port Phillip . " 
 Post their return , the Victorians praised the Tasmanian cricketers and invited their opponents to play a return match in Victoria in the subsequent season . The match , which was held on 29 – 30 March 1852 at the Melbourne Cricket Club ground situated on the south bank of Yarra River , was lost by Tasmania by 61 runs . This became the first intercolonial match played in Victoria . Two years later , Tasmania beat Victoria in a dead rubber match played at Launceston on 3 – 4 March 1854 . 
 Two more years later , Victoria played New South Wales on 26 – 27 March 1856 at Melbourne Cricket Club 's new ground based at Richmond Paddock , now known as Yarra Park . This match , which was won by New South Wales , became the first first @-@ class match between two Australian mainland colonies , and the first first @-@ class match at the current site of Melbourne Cricket Ground . 
 The Victorians , with nine English migrants as a part of their team , returned to tour Tasmania in the 1857 – 58 season and played a two @-@ match fixture , both of which they won . In the first match , held at Launceston Racecourse in February 1858 , Gideon Elliott of Victoria played a significant part in their victory , taking 9 wickets for 2 runs in the first innings . Elliott 's figures put him in the record books with the most economical 9 @-@ wicket haul , a record which is yet to be surpassed . Tasmania – represented primarily by amateurs – scored 33 runs in the first innings and were defeated by an innings . The second match , which was played at Battery Ground , Hobart on 4 – 5 March 1858 , again was won comfortably by the Victorian team . The Tasmanian team , through the series of matches , found it difficult to comprehend the roundarm bowling of the professional and skilled Victorian bowlers . After these fixtures , Victoria and Tasmania played three additional matches between 1869 and 1873 , with Victoria winning all three . 
 The visit of the Victorian team is credited to have provided a significant encouragement to the sport of cricket in Tasmania , and to the formation of the Southern Tasmanian Cricket Club , which came into existence on 28 April 1858 with 136 members . The club was rechristened as the Southern Tasmanian Cricket Association on 1 February 1866 and became the vanguard of future intercolonial and interregional matches . 
 In February 2015 , the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery named its cricket memorabilia exposition " 164 @-@ Not Out " as a mark of remembrance of the number of years that had passed since the historic match . The match by itself is now considered to be one of the most significant events in the cricketing history of Australia , drawing rave mention during the 150th anniversary celebration of Cricket Tasmania in 2015 . 
 = Frog battery = 
 A frog battery is an electrochemical battery consisting of a number of dead frogs ( or sometimes live ones ) , which form the cells of the battery connected in a series arrangement . It is a kind of <unk> . It was used in early scientific investigations of electricity and academic demonstrations . 
 The principle behind the battery is the injury potential created in a muscle when it is damaged , although this was not fully understood in the 18th and 19th centuries ; the potential being caused incidentally due to the dissection of the frog 's muscles . 
 The frog battery is an example of a class of <unk> which can be made from any number of animals . The general term for an example of this class is the muscular pile . 
 The first well known frog battery was created by Carlo Matteucci in 1845 , but there had been others before him . Matteucci also created batteries out of other animals , and Giovanni Aldini created a battery from ox heads . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early days of electrical research , a common method of detecting electric current was by means of a frog 's leg galvanoscope . A good supply of live frogs was kept to hand by the researcher ready to have their legs prepared for the galvanoscope . Frogs were therefore a convenient material to use in other experiments . They were small , easily handled , the legs were especially sensitive to electric current , and they carried on responding longer than other animal candidates for this role . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 It was usual to use the thighs of frogs for the battery construction . The legs of the frog were first skinned , then the lower leg was cut off at the knee joint and discarded . Damaging the muscle during this procedure would detract from the results . The thigh muscle was then cut in two transversely to produce two half @-@ thighs . Only the lower , conical shaped piece was kept . The half @-@ thighs were then laid on an insulator of varnished wood so arranged that the inside surface of one was in contact with the outside surface of the next , with the conical ends of the outside surface being pushed into the cavity of the cut surface . The ends of the pile were placed in cups of water sunk into the wood and formed the terminals of the battery . 
 The arrangement of inside surface connected to outside surface was on the basis of the incorrect theory that there was an electric current in muscles continually flowing from the inside to the outside . It is now known that the half @-@ thighs were more successful at generating electricity because they had suffered the greatest injury to the muscle . This effect of increased electric potential due to injury is known as demarcation potential or injury potential . 
 Other constructions could also be used . For instance the complete rear legs could be used with the sciatic nerves exposed so that the nerve of one frog could be connected to the feet of the next . Whole frogs too could be used . Although it was more time consuming to prepare the thigh muscles , most experimenters preferred to do this since it gave better results . 
 = = History = = 
 The first frog battery was constructed by Eusebio Valli in the 1790s with a chain of 10 frogs . Valli had difficulty understanding all of his own results ; he followed Luigi Galvani in believing that animal electricity ( or galvanic electricity ) was a different phenomenon from metal @-@ metal electricity ( or voltaic electricity ) , even denying its existence . Alessandro Volta 's theory was proved correct when he succeeded in constructing the voltaic pile without the use of any animal material . Because Valli found himself on the wrong side in this dispute , and refused to change his opinion despite the evidence , his work has become a bit of a backwater and his frog battery is little known and poorly documented . 
 Leopoldo Nobili built a frog battery in 1818 out of complete frog legs which he called a frog pile . He used this to investigate animal electricity but his experiments were strongly criticised by Volta who argued that the true source of electricity was dissimilar metals in the external circuit . According to Volta , fluids in the frog merely provided the electrolyte . 
 The first well @-@ known frog battery was constructed by Carlo Matteucci which was described in a paper presented to the Royal Society in 1845 by Michael Faraday on his behalf . It later also appeared in the popular medical student physics textbook Elements of Natural Philosophy by Golding Bird . Matteucci constructed his battery from a pile of 12 to 14 half @-@ thighs of frogs . Despite the misguided theory behind the half @-@ thigh battery , Matteucci 's frog battery was nevertheless sufficiently powerful to decompose potassium iodide . Matteucci aimed with this apparatus to address Volta 's criticism of Nobili by constructing a circuit , as far as possible , entirely out of biological material and hence prove the existence of animal electricity . Matteucci also studied the effects vacuum , various gases , and poisons had on the frog battery , concluding that in many cases its operation was not affected even when the substance would be toxic or lethal to the living animal . 
 Frogs were not the only creatures to be press @-@ <unk> into serving as battery components . In 1803 Giovanni Aldini demonstrated that electricity could be obtained from an ox head from a freshly killed animal . A frog galvanoscope connected between the ox 's tongue and ear showed a reaction when the circuit was completed through the experimenter 's own body . A greater reaction was obtained when Aldini joined two or three heads together into a battery . Later , in the 1840s , Matteucci also created eel batteries , pigeon batteries and rabbit batteries . Further , he created a battery out of living pigeons by connecting a wound made on the breast of one pigeon to the body of the next . Matteucci states that this design was based on a pre @-@ existing battery of living frogs . 
 = 2008 invasion of Anjouan = 
 The invasion of Anjouan ( code @-@ named Operation Democracy in Comoros ) , on March 25 , 2008 , was an amphibious assault led by the Comoros , backed by African Union ( AU ) forces , including troops from Sudan , Tanzania , Senegal , along with logistical support from Libya and France . The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar 's leadership in Anjouan , an island part of the Union of Comoros , when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election , in defiance of the federal government and the AU . The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975 , experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups . 
 The invasion occurred on the early morning of March 25 , 2008 . The main towns were quickly overrun and the island was declared under the control of the invading forces the same day . Mohamed Bacar managed to escape to Mayotte on March 26 and requested political asylum . He was subsequently held in custody there by the French administration and brought to the island of Réunion . On May 15 , France rejected Bacar 's request for asylum but the French refugee office ruled that the ousted leader could not be extradited to the Comoros because of the risk of persecution .

 The Comoran federal government delayed the holding of an election on Anjouan due to alleged irregularities and intimidation , but Bacar nevertheless printed ballots and held an election in June , claiming a landslide victory of 90 percent . 
 = = = Military build @-@ up = = = 
 In March 2008 , hundreds of Comoran government troops began assembling on Mohéli , which is closer to Anjouan than the larger island , Grande Comore . Sudan and Senegal provided a total of 750 troops , while Libya offered logistical support for the operation . In addition , 500 Tanzanian troops were due to arrive soon after . France , the former colonial power , also assisted the operation by airlifting AU troops to the area . 
 Vows of resistance from the self @-@ declared president of Anjouan were met with stern words from the AU envoy , saying " He will be overwhelmed ... I am afraid to say that if he tries to do that , it will be the end of him physically , if necessary . " In an interview with IRIN , Mohamed Bacar said : " [ National president Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed ] <unk> does not know anything concerning the military , but if I had to advise him I would say that it 's not the solution . The first time [ 1997 ] the army came we kicked them out . The second time [ May 2007 ] the army came we kicked them out . That means that if they try to come a third time we will kick them out . " 
 Anjouan promised to hold new elections in May 2008 , which South African President Thabo Mbeki supported as a way to resolve the crisis . Mbeki once more tried to stop the invasion on March 14 , but the AU disregarded his proposal and the invasion went ahead . 
 = = = Pre @-@ invasion incidents = = = 
 On March 3 , 2008 , a fuel ship supplying the Comoros Army caught fire in the port of Comoros ' capital , Moroni . The cause of the fire was unknown . On March 11 , an armed incursion occurred on the islands where three members of the Anjouan Militia loyal to President Bacar were captured and taken to Mohéli for interrogation . Diplomacy continued with an intervention by South African President Thabo Mbeki who attempted to delay the planned AU invasion to the distinct displeasure of the Comorian government . It is understood that Mbeki spoke to the head of the AU , Tanzanian President <unk> <unk> , by phone on March 14 to stall the attack , intended to depose Mohamed Bacar . 
 Despite this intervention , a fishing boat with soldiers left <unk> for Anjouan on March 14 . There were conflicting statements from both sides , with Comoran and AU military sources reporting that a fishing boat carrying around fifty soldiers from the federal government of Comoros landed in southern Anjouan and attempted to capture a police station . In a later statement Comoran Chief of Staff Salim Mohamed revised the information and said a reconnaissance team of about 10 soldiers landed on March 14 in the south of Anjouan island and reached the southern town of Domoni . Two soldiers were wounded , a federal source said . " The target of the operation was the Domoni police station in Anjouan so as to free political prisoners , " said the source . 
 The troops then retreated back to Mohéli and returned to Anjouan on Sunday March 16 to rescue the two wounded soldiers . According to a military source one federal soldier suffered an arm injury and another had a minor foot injury . The same sources reported that during the course of the operation " about twenty people " in Domoni died as a result of the Comoran and AU bombardment of Anjouanese positions . These facts were disputed by the Anjouan administration which insisted that one of the two Comoran soldiers who had attacked Anjouanais positions in Domoni on March 15 had in fact died and that the police station was not captured . They stated that the Comoran and AU forces had been ambushed by Anjouanais forces during the early stages of their incursion at Domoni and had been forced to withdraw from what was a hopeless situation , 
 Contrary to its republican mission the National Army of Development ( Comoran Army ) devotes itself to taking innocent citizens as hostages whose only wrong is to be Anjouanese and not <unk> . In addition to the fishermen kidnapped at <unk> and <unk> , a second aggression [ by ] the National Army of Development dissident forces supported by the trawler provided by Iran failed . The elements of the [ Anjouanese ] gendarmerie retaliated in self @-@ defense , wounding two of the gangster attackers including one lethally . 
 France 's role in the crisis was brought into question when , on March 19 , a French police helicopter on an unauthorised , clandestine mission from the French @-@ administered Comoro island of Mayotte crashed in the sea close to the city of Sima on Anjouan . Reports from officials in the Comoros said that no one was hurt in the crash . The helicopter was owned by France 's Mayotte @-@ based air and border police force . Critics allege the helicopter was involved in an attempt to bring Bacar into French exile , and that Bacar was only holding out so long because he was protected by the French . Lieutenant Colonel <unk> Mohamed Amiri , Comoros Government Spokesman , declared : 
 We don 't know what it was doing . You can imagine the rumors . The government of Comoros did not allow them to come . They were not authorized ... The French said they sent other air and naval assets to pick up the crew . 
 The French military had already transported about 300 Tanzanian troops and 30 tons of freight to Grand Comore between March 14 and March 16 . According to reports a French diplomat said that France was ready to transport Senegalese troops as well , but had not yet done so . The diplomatic source said France remains " favorable " to dialogue but on condition that Bacar accepts the presence of African troops at the port and airport of Anjouan . 
 = = Invasion = = 
 On the morning of March 24 , 2008 , five boats transporting approximately 1 @,@ 500 AU soldiers left the port of <unk> , capital of the island of Mohéli . Bacar and his troops vowed to fight until the last man was left standing , with an Anjouan lieutenant stating , " We will fight until we die . " 
 It was reported that the runway at Ouani Airport close to <unk> was blocked with baggage trolleys and the atmosphere was tense as the island braced itself for the impending assault . Before the telephone lines were cut an Anjouan government spokesperson was quoted as saying : " They have decided to kill but we are not afraid . We are well prepared . Our forces are ready and it 's going to work ! " 
 About 450 troops landed on the north side of the Anjouan Bay at dawn on March 25 . The first shots were heard around 5 a.m. ( GMT + 3 ) on the island , in the town of Ouani , near the airport and the presidential residence . The combined forces quickly advanced on the town of Ouani to secure the airfield . The BBC reported that the island 's capital , airport , seaport and second city were all overrun by dawn , to scenes of jubilation from the local population . By mid @-@ day , the presidential palace was deserted . But other journalists reported that the invaders had " struggled to progress further under the automatic fire of Anjouan forces " and in the afternoon " clashes with heavy artillery continued to shake the town of Ouani . " The army was reportedly looking for Bacar 's hiding place . 
 After the airport was secured the invasion force apparently split where part of it headed south @-@ west to engage Anjouanais loyalists in the capital , <unk> , and the remainder headed south @-@ east capturing the port of <unk> M <unk> and the second city of Domoni without resistance . 
 Early reports indicated that the Bacar government had fled to the interior of the island and were in hiding , however later uncorroborated reports from the Comoros government on March 25 stated that Mohamed Bacar had fled the island incognito seeking exile in Mayotte . There was no comment from the Bacar government but the Comoran government spokesperson said that the invasion troops had been told to look for him and were conducting house to house searches . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Mohamed Bacar managed to escape to Mayotte by speedboat and reports on March 26 confirmed his presence on the island and stated he had requested political asylum in France . The Associated Press reported from Paris that France was considering the request for political asylum but Comoran leaders demanded that France should return Bacar to the Comoros , and there have been anti @-@ French protests calling for the same . France stated that it was treating the asylum request as quickly as possible , but , on March 27 , Bacar was moved to the French island of Réunion , where he was charged and investigated for illegally entering French territory while carrying weapons , along with 23 of his followers . The case was rejected for procedural reasons , but Bacar and the 23 others remained in custody . 
 By the end of March , several prominent supporters of Bacar had been arrested , including <unk> El @-@ <unk> , a former Vice @-@ President , Prime Minister and Interim President of Comoros . Three others were found in hiding near Domoni on March 29 , including Mohamed <unk> <unk> ( a former Minister of Transport and spokesman for Bacar ) , Ibrahim <unk> ( a former Prime Minister and advisor to Bacar ) , and Ahmed Abdallah <unk> ( a former President of the Constitutional Court ) . 
 On April 5 , 2008 , Bacar was remanded in custody . Comoran President <unk> visited Anjouan in early April , marking his first visit to the island since May 2007 . He said that he hoped that separatism in Anjouan would cease with the removal of Bacar from power , and he praised the African leaders who had provided assistance for the invasion . 
 Contrary to previous reports that France was against the invasion , France gave its approval and helped to air @-@ lift the AU troops to the island . French Foreign Minister Bernard <unk> stressed on April 8 that France had not supported Bacar or provided him with any protection , and that it had fully supported African Union intervention . 
 On April 18 , Bacar and with 21 of his close guards were released from prison and returned to house arrest at the Réunion military airbase . On April 23 , it was announced that the French Office of Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons ( Office français de protection des <unk> et <unk> ; <unk> ) had granted asylum to two of Bacar 's men and refused asylum for six of them ; those whose requests were rejected were to be sent to a third country and not returned to the Comoros due to fears of persecution . <unk> had yet to rule on the cases of Bacar or his other men . 
 Bacar 's asylum request was rejected on May 15 , 2008 . France 's Secretary of State for Overseas , Yves <unk> , said France would support the Comoran government 's efforts . " We will continue to act in consultation with the Comoros so that the law can be applied and Col Bacar can be tried . " Presidential elections in Anjouan occurred on June 15 and June 29 , 2008 . The election was won by Moussa <unk> , who defeated Mohamed <unk> in the second round . 
 = Limitation Act 1963 = 
 The Limitation Act 1963 ( 1963 <unk> ) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that amended the statute of limitations to allow actions in some cases where the injured party had not discovered the injury until after the standard date of expiration . The Act was based on the report of the Davies Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury , created after the Court of Appeal decision in the case of Cartledge v Jopling , and the Committee notably produced their final report before Cartledge had been heard in the House of Lords . The draft bill was presented to Parliament on 6 May 1963 ; it was given the Royal Assent on 31 July and came into force on the same day . 
 The act allowed an injured party to bring a claim outside the normal statute of limitations period if he could show that he was not aware of the injuries himself until after the limitation period had expired and if he gained the permission of the court . After a series of problems emerged , including vagueness on a point even the House of Lords was unable to clarify and poor draftsmanship , the Act was repealed bit by bit during the 1970s , with the Limitation Act 1980 scrapping the last remaining sections . 
 = = Background = = 
 Before the passing of the 1963 Act , the only exceptions to the normal statute of limitations ( three years after the events that caused the injury , as established by the Law Reform ( Limitation of Actions , etc . ) Act 1954 ) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud , in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake . In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company 's poorly ventilated steel mills . The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956 , and as a result the injured party had no cause of action . Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused , and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself , Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case . 
 Cartledge pursued the claim anyway in an attempt to have the law changed , and decisions were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal . After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies , which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords . The report , published in September 1962 , made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963 . While it was passing through the House of Lords , Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1937 , but this was never acted on . The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately . 
 = = Act = = 
 The Act created exceptions to the normal statute of limitations in addition to the previous ones of fraud and mistake . It introduced an exception if 1 ) the permission of the court had been gained to bring a case and 2 ) the " material facts " of the case included " facts of a decisive character " which the claimant was not aware of until after the expiry of the statute of limitations . Where these two requirements were fulfilled , a case could be brought as long as it was within twelve months of the claimant finding out the " facts of a decisive character " . The same principles applied if the injured party were dead and the claim was being brought on behalf of his estate or dependants . If leave was refused to open a case , the decision could be appealed up to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales , but no further . 
 These provisions covered both Cartledge @-@ like situations and cases where the injured party , while aware of his injuries , does not connect them to the true cause until more than three years after the injuries were sustained . The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought . If a judgment had already been made in a case , the Act could not apply to it , meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself . 
 = = Problem and repeal = = 
 The main problem with the Act was whether or not the claimant had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply . The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd but " failed spectacularly " , making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board said they could not actually find a ratio decidendi anywhere in the House of Lords ' opinion . The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having " a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book " . The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s , and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections . 
 = <unk> = 
 A sejmik ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] , diminutive of sejm , occasionally translated as a <unk> ; Lithuanian : <unk> ) was the name of various local parliaments throughout the history of Poland . The first sejmiks were regional assemblies in the Kingdom of Poland , though they gained significantly more influence in the later era of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . Sejmiks arose around the late 14th and early 15th centuries and existed until the end of the Commonwealth in 1795 , following the partitions of the Commonwealth . In a limited form , some sejmiks existed in partitioned Poland , and later , in the Second Polish Republic . In modern Poland , since 1999 , the term has been revived with the voivodeship sejmik ( sejmik <unk> ) , referring to the elected council of each of the 16 voivodeships . 
 The competences of sejmiks varied over time , and there were also geographical differences . Often , numerous different types of sejmiks coexisted in the same governance structure . Almost always presided over by the marshal of the sejm , sejmiks could often elect delegates to the national sejm , and sometimes could give them binding instructions . Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century , when they effectively supplanted the inefficient national sejm . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word sejm and sejmik are derived from old Czech <unk> , which means " to bring together " or " to summon " . 
 = = History = = 
 The traditions of a sejmik can be traced to the institution of the <unk> that actually predates the Polish state . They originated from gatherings of nobility , formed for military and consultative purposes . Historians disagree about the specific date of origin of the sejmiks , with some proposed dates being 1374 ( the Privilege of Koszyce ) and 1454 ( the Nieszawa Statutes ) . Geographically , sejmiks first arose in central Poland ( Greater Poland province ) . Over the next century or so , they spread to other provinces of Poland , and finally , by the 16th century , to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . Sejmiks were legally recognized by the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes , in a privilege granted to the szlachta ( Polish nobility ) by King Casimir IV Jagiellon , when the king agreed to consult with the nobility concerning certain decisions . Casimir 's recognition of the sejmik stemmed from an attempt to limit the growing power of the magnates , and counteract it with the middle nobility . 
 With the creation of a national Sejm in 1493 , which took over the powers of taxation and the pospolite ruszenie previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa , the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished . Still , the <unk> continued to play an important role in the governance of Poland as the most direct form of political enfranchisement of the nobility . 
 After the Union of Lublin in 1569 , the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth had about 70 sejmiks ( out of those , 24 were in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ) . Jacek Jędruch notes a trend of an increasing number of sejmiks over time , from about 16 in the 15th century to 104 by the late 18th century , as nobility sought to meet in places that required less travel time . Stanisław <unk> also estimates about 100 at the turn of the 18th century . Those sejmiks elected 170 deputies ( 48 from Lithuania ) . Most sejmiks elected 2 deputies , but there were exceptions . Wojciech Kriegseisen notes that until the late 18th century , there were 44 sejmiks in Poland proper ( the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland ) , 24 in Lithuania , and 1 in Inflanty province . 
 The sejmik 's role grew again in the late 17th century , as central power weakened . Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance at the turn of the 18th century , when they often set their own time limits — that is , they extended their authorized periods of operation . In the face of an inefficient central government , with the national Sejm often disrupted by the liberum veto and the office of starosta losing much of its importance , sejmiks administered a portion of the taxes , and raised their own military ( wojsko <unk> ) . This period , which was known as the " rule of sejmiks " ( <unk> <unk> ) , was brought to an end by acts of the one @-@ day Silent Sejm ( Polish : sejm <unk> ) of 1717 , which removed most taxation and military competences from the sejmiks . Some sejmiks were also affected by liberum veto until it was abolished for sejmiks in 1766 ; this was not always the case , as some decided to forgo unanimity and move to majority rule . 
 Where the middle nobility had been the leading force at the sejmiks in the 16th century , the magnates became increasingly influential in the 18th century . This stemmed from their ability to bribe masses of poorly educated , landless nobility ( known as magnate 's " clients " or " clientele " ) , as all nobles were eligible to vote in the sejmiks . Sejmiks in Lithuania were dominated by the magnates to a greater extent than those in Poland proper , as the Lithuanian magnates were more powerful than their Polish counterparts . The magnate @-@ dominated sejmiks , which gathered impoverished nobility , have been described as more concerned with eating and drinking than debate ; for the poorest of nobility , they were a rare occasion to participate in feasts sponsored by the magnates . When they met , the drunken nobility was known to fight among themselves , which on occasion led to fatalities . 
 Sejmiks were significantly reformed by the Prawo o <unk> , the act on regional sejms , passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized as part of the Constitution of 3 May . This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance , as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class . The voting right became tied to a property qualification ; to be eligible to vote , a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes , or be closely related to another who did . Some 300 @,@ 000 out of 700 @,@ 000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised , much to their displeasure . A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks . 
 Although the independent existence of the Commonwealth ended with the partitions of Poland in 1795 , the institution of the sejmik continued , albeit in a somewhat restricted fashion . In the Duchy of Warsaw , sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw . Similarly , sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831 . Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire , some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges ; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition . In the Prussian partition there were provincial sejmiks ( <unk> ) and powiat sejmiks ( <unk> ) . Near the turn of the century , some limited local representative institutions existed in the Russian partition and Austrian partition , but they did not bear the name of sejmiks . 
 After Poland regained independence , provincial sejms were restored in the Second Polish Republic , although they were called sejms rather than sejmiks . They included the short @-@ lived Sejm of Central Lithuania ( 1921 – 1922 ) ; the three voivodeship sejms ( Silesian Parliament , Greater Poland Sejm , and Pomeranian Sejm , 1920 – 1939 ) , which preserved the tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition ; and the county sejmiks , of which there were 264 in 1939 . The existence of these institutions was interrupted by the occupation of Poland during the Second World War , and they were not reestablished in the era of communist Poland . 
 The sejmiks were revived again after the fall of communism in modern Poland . Since 1999 , the term sejmik ( in full , sejmik <unk> ) has been used to refer to the elected council of each of the 16 voivodeships or regions ( see voivodeship sejmik ) . The word sejmik was chosen by lawmakers in order to eliminate the term rada <unk> ( voivodeship council ) , which conjured memories of voivodeship people 's councils during the communist Poland era . 
 = = Sejmiks of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth = = 
 = = = Features = = = 
 Sejmiks were usually held in a large , open field . The nobility would elect a presiding officer ( <unk> <unk> : sejmik marshal ) , whose role was analogous to the marshal of the sejm at national Sejms . ( This term has been revived since 1999 , but it now refers to the chairman of the voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself . ) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king , soon a loophole was exploited : the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed , using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal . Voivodes and <unk> also had the ability to convene some sejmiks . Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May , all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik . 
 It is estimated that most sejmiks drew around 4 to 6 % of eligible participants . 
 = = = Types = = = 
 Historians distinguish several types of sejmiks , depending on their geographical scope : 
 General ( Polish : <unk> , Latin conventiones <unk> ) , held in western Poland ( Greater Poland ) at Koło , in southern Poland ( Little Poland ) at Nowe Miasto <unk> , in Masovia at Warsaw , in Red Ruthenia at <unk> <unk> , and in Lithuania at <unk> . The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks , and of Senators . Their goal was to agree on a position for the General Sejm ( Sejm <unk> ) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm . The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law ; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened ( such as 1511 , 1513 and 1577 ) , the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters . In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation . In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms . Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned ( with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia , see Prussian estates ) ; instead , provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper . 
 Provincial , Territorial , Voivodeship or County ( Polish : <unk> , Latin conventiones <unk> , conventiones <unk> ) . The names of these sejmiks varied depending on their administrative level and local traditions ; <unk> lists powiat sejmiks ( county sejmiks ; sejmiki <unk> ) , ziemia sejmiks ( territorial sejmiks ; sejmiki <unk> ) , voivodeship sejmiks ( sejmiki <unk> ) and provincial sejmiks ( sejmiki <unk> ) . A theoretical hierarchy that almost never existed in practice could be drawn starting from the powiat sejmiks , and moving upwards to ziemia , voivodeship , general ( of several voivodeships ) and provincial sejmiks ending with the final , national sejm . Almost all <unk> had their own sejmiks , but the importance of the sejmik varied based on whether the given ziemia was autonomous ( that is , whether it was part of a voivodeship ) . <unk> sejms were common in Lithuania , but were rare in the Crown of Poland , where instead voivodeship sejms were much more common . Some voivodeships could hold a single voivodeship sejmik , and others might be covered by more than one sejmik . The importance of the local sejmiks began to diminish with the formation of the national sejm . Thereafter the local sejmiks were relegated to dealing with local matters and electing deputies to the General Sejms . They rose in importance again in the second half of the 17th century , as the central Sejm grew weaker . 
 Kriegseisen , quoting Adam <unk> , argues that there was only one type of sejmik and that the only difference between various sejmiks was the purpose for which they were convened . Nonetheless other scholars often distinguish between different types of sejmiks . Juliusz Bardach and Jędruch , for example , divide sejmiks based on their purpose as follows : 
 Pre @-@ sejm ( Polish : <unk> ) sejmiks were convened by the king who sent a writ ( <unk> <unk> ) to each sejmik , outlining the reasons the next Sejm would be held . Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies ( <unk> ) , depending on the size and importance of the sejmik 's territory , to the ordinary General Sejm ( Polish : Sejm <unk> ) that was held every two years , and to any extraordinary General Sejm that might be called at any time in an emergency . Sometimes pre @-@ sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral . In some cases , a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships – in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies . Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper , although on occasion the instructions could be vague , or even give the deputies full freedom . These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century . 
 Relational or <unk> ( Polish : <unk> ) sejmiks heard the reports of deputies returned from the General Sejm , usually presenting the law ( <unk> <unk> ) decreed by the Sejm . They passed specific instructions with regards to the execution of sejm decrees , and other local resolutions . Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king ; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm . In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation . These sejmiks arose in the 16th century . 
 Electoral ( Polish : <unk> ) sejmiks elected higher voivodeship officials , judges in particular . They were convened irregularly , as such offices were usually held for life . Several candidates would be nominated , and the king would make the final appointment from among them . These sejmiks arose in the 15th century . 
 <unk> or Judicial ( Polish : <unk> ) sejmiks met on a yearly basis and elected deputies ( <unk> ) to tribunals ( Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal ) from the times of King Stefan Batory onwards ( starting in 1578 in Poland , and from 1581 in Lithuania ) . 
 Administrative or Economic ( Polish : <unk> ) sejmiks oversaw voivodeship self @-@ government . Often , they were held on the day following the <unk> sejmik . Their decrees were known as <unk> . Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included : dealing with taxation ( distribution of national taxes ) and tax collectors , managing the local ( voivodeship ) taxes and treasury , recruiting local military and ( from mid @-@ 1700s ) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals . These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century . 
 Hooded ( Polish : <unk> ) sejmiks had special powers during an interregnum . These sejmiks were organized as confederations , and would elect confederation officials . The name was derived from hoods worn in the period of royal mourning . These sejmiks began during the interregnum of 1572 . 
 = = Assessment and historiography = = 
 Kriegseisen notes that the institution of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland , and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth . He cautions against such simplistic assessments , and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since . The stereotype of a group of drunken , fighting nobility , found in some literature , should not be seen as representative , particularly outside the period of the sejmik 's decline in the 18th century . He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery , brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived , they did so because they were just that — sensationalist — and should be seen as exceptions to the long , uneventful , but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common . 
 Kriegseisen also remarks that there is a myth about the uniqueness of sejmiks to Poland , and notes that similar institutions of self @-@ governance and regional parliamentary participation by nobility can be found in other places , such as in Hungary and various German provinces ( Silesia , Prussia , Brandenburg ) .

 = Ontario Highway 61 = 
 King 's Highway 61 , commonly referred to as Highway 61 and historically known as the Scott Highway , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . The 61 @-@ kilometre ( 38 mi ) route connects the Pigeon River Bridge , where it crosses into the United States and becomes Minnesota State Highway 61 , with a junction at Highway 11 , Highway 17 and the Harbour Expressway in Thunder Bay . The highway forms part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour . 
 Highway 61 was added to the highway system on October 6 , 1937 following the amalgamation of the Department of Northern Development into the Department of Highways . Prior to that it was known as the Scott Highway . The bridge over the Pigeon River was originally known as The Outlaw , as it was constructed without formal approval of the Canadian or American governments . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 61 begins at the international border between Ontario and Minnesota at the Pigeon River ; the road continues south to Duluth as State Highway 61 on the American side . It passes the customs station and curves to the north . Passing its former routing along Highway 593 , the highway curves eastward to avoid mountains . It zig @-@ zags around a range of mountains , eventually turning northward and passing to the west of Cloud Bay . The highway continues north for 20 kilometres ( 10 mi ) through <unk> , running between mountain ranges on either side . It rises at Moose Hill , meets Highway 608 and enters one of the few agricultural areas in northwestern Ontario . Shortly thereafter , Highway 61 curves to the east , passing the southern terminus of Highway 130 along the way . It then enters the outskirts of Thunder Bay . 
 The highway passes Chippewa Road , its former route through Thunder Bay , and returns to its northward orientation . It officially enters the city as it crosses the <unk> River . The highway swerves east at Thunder Bay International Airport as it widens to four lanes then continues north , crossing Arthur Street . North of Arthur Street , the highway is also known as the Thunder Bay Expressway . It continues north for 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) and ends at the Harbour Expressway and Trans @-@ Canada Highway . 
 The northernmost section in Thunder Bay is a four @-@ lane , undivided expressway . The remainder of Highway 61 is a conventional two @-@ lane highway . Traffic volumes along the southern portion of the highway are generally low , with an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 1 @,@ 000 vehicles . This increases progressing north ; within Thunder Bay the AADT peaks at 17 @,@ 200 vehicles . 
 Highway 61 also forms a small portion of the Lake Superior Circle Tour , a tourist route of highways following the shoreline of Lake Superior . To the south , the tour continues along Minnesota State Highway 61 ; to the north it continues along Highway 17 towards Sault Saint Marie . 
 = = History = = 
 The road that would become Highway 61 was first constructed in 1916 . The Pigeon River Timber Company had cleared lands surrounding the towns of Port Arthur and Fort William , but no road existed to connect to locations outside . A narrow wilderness trail reached as far as the Pigeon River , and was chosen as the route for the new road . The Department of Mines and Resources agreed to fund the project , and citizens proceeded to lay a new road as far as the river , beginning in 1913 . This road was initially known as the " Scott Highway " after lumberman William Scott . On the opposite shore , Cook County and the State of Minnesota constructed a new road north from Grand Marais . The roads were completed by late 1916 , but no bridge existed to connect them . 
 In response , the Rotary Clubs of Port Arthur and Duluth met to discuss a solution . As an international crossing , any bridge over the river would require federal approval from both governments . Both sides agreed that the approval process would be too slow , and decided to construct the bridge regardless . " The Outlaw " bridge was opened by a travelling motorcade on August 18 , 1917 , finally permitting travel between Ontario and Minnesota . To the surprise of the Rotary Clubs , J.E. Whitson , Roads Commissioner of Northern Ontario , and Howard Ferguson , Minister of Lands , Forest and Mines , were present at the opening , and agreed to pay the $ 768 @,@ 000 ( $ 12 @.@ 3 million in 2016 ) bridge cost . The bridge and the Canadian road approaching it fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Highways ( now the Ministry of Transportation ) on April 1 , 1937 , and the Scott Highway became Highway 61 on October 6 . The Outlaw was rebuilt as a steel truss structure in 1934 following several accidents . 
 By 1962 , construction was underway to bypass the inland route of the highway as well as the bridge . This bypass opened on November 1 , 1963 ; the American approach was rebuilt along the shore of Lake Superior , and a new bridge constructed over the river 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to the east . This bridge was opened on May 23 , 1964 . Highway 61 was realigned as a result ; the former route was redesignated as Highway 593 on September 1 , 1964 . 
 In 1963 , Charles MacNaughton , minister of the Department of Highways , announced plans for the <unk> Expressway to be built on the western edge of the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William ( which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay ) . Construction began in the late 1960s and progressed rapidly . Following its completion by late 1970 , Highway 61 was rerouted along it as far north as Arthur Street . The former route followed Chippewa Road , turned north on James Street and then east on Frederica Street . From there , it turned north along Ford Street and followed it and Kingsway to Highway 11 and Highway 17 at Arthur Street . This route was renumbered as Highway 61B ; it remained in place into the 1990s , but was decommissioned by 1999 . 
 Beginning in 1991 , Highway 61 was completely reconstructed south of Thunder Bay to the border in preparation for the 1995 World Nordic Ski Championships . This involved replacing eight bridges , improving sightlines , and adding five passing lanes and paved shoulders throughout the length of the highway . The highway was extended 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the north on August 17 , 2007 when the <unk> Highway opened , redirecting Highway 11 and Highway 17 off Arthur Street .

 The following table lists the major junctions along Highway 61 , as noted by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario . The entire route is located in Thunder Bay District . 
 = Lier Line = 
 The Lier Line ( Norwegian : Lierbanen ) or LB is an abandoned railway line that ran through Lier in Norway . The private , narrow gauge railway branched from the Drammen Line at the old Lier Station , and ran 21 @.@ 15 kilometers ( 13 @.@ 14 mi ) to Svangstrand on the lake Tyrifjorden , where it connected with a steam ship operated by the railway company . Among the villages the line served were Egge , Sjåstad and Sylling , in addition to two branch lines , from Iledalen to Tronstad Bruk , and from Egge to Egge Gravel Pit . 
 Discussions regarding the building of a line through Lier started in 1895 , and construction commenced in 1901 . The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable , in part because of tourist traffic . In 1920 , the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge , resulting in expensive transshipment between the two lines . This and falling traffic caused the line to become unprofitable . The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932 . All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 and the track was demolished shortly afterwards . 
 = = Route = = 
 The line was built with 1 @,@ 067 mm ( 3 ft 6 in ) narrow gauge , a minimum curve radius of 100 metres ( 330 ft ) and a steepest gradient of 3 @.@ 0 percent . It was the only line in Norway for which no blasting was done during construction . At the old Lier Station , located 24 @.@ 5 meters ( 80 ft ) above mean sea level ( AMSL ) , the line connected with the Drammen Line and then ran 21 @.@ 15 kilometers ( 13 @.@ 14 mi ) northwards up the Lier Valley . The line passed through stations at <unk> and Egge before reaching a branch line to the gravel pit at Egge . The line continued past <unk> and Sjåstad before crossing the wooden , 49 @-@ meter ( 161 ft ) long Sjåstad Bridge . It then ran past Muggerud and ran along the 46 @-@ meter ( 151 ft ) long viaduct across <unk> until passing Iledalen . A 0 @.@ 80 @-@ kilometer ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) branch line ran from Iledalen via a wooden 30 @-@ meter ( 98 ft ) long bridge over <unk> to Tronstad Bruk . The main line continued across the wooden , 90 @-@ meter ( 300 ft ) long bridge over the creek <unk> before reaching Sylling . This was the line 's highest elevation , at 128 @.@ 8 meters ( 423 ft ) AMSL . Between there and <unk> , a branch of the Tyrifjorden lake , the line was built with a zig @-@ zag , so the train had to back 1 kilometer ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) and then continue forward . At Svangstrand , located 65 @.@ 0 meters ( 213 @.@ 3 ft ) AMSL there was connection with a steam ship . 
 The only track left after the demolishing was a short section at Lier Station , which remained until the station closed in 1973 . The old Lier Station has been preserved . The section between <unk> , located a few hundred meters ( yards ) from Lier Station , to <unk> has become the suburban street <unk> . From Landfall to Egge , the right @-@ of @-@ way is an overgrown path . From Egge to Muggerud , the right @-@ of @-@ way is used as the street <unk> . In 1993 , the right @-@ of @-@ way from Muggerud to <unk> was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path . The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street , although most of the right @-@ of @-@ way north of Rønning has disappeared , as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land , particularly north of Sylling . The station area at <unk> in intact , with the station building looking just like it did in 1904 . Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings . 
 = = History = = 
 The first political consideration of a proposal to build a line through the Lier Valley occurred on 2 March 1895 , when the municipal council discarded the idea , stating that it was of no interest for the community . However , there were many locals who had observed the economic impact the Drammen Line had on the southern part of the municipality , and called for a line also to the northern parts . In 1896 , a committee was established , led by captain and entrepreneur H. J. <unk> . Engineering reports estimated the costs to NOK 700 @,@ 000 , including NOK 37 @,@ 000 for a steamship on Tyrifjorden . Estimates called for 23 @,@ 900 passengers and 17 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 17 @,@ 000 long tons ; 19 @,@ 000 short tons ) of cargo each year , which was sufficient to break even . 
 They argued that the valley 's two roads were insufficient for the valley 's transport needs . At the same time , they pointed out that there was no industry in Lier that would need a railway , and that by building a line , such industry would be established . In April 1897 , the committee held a public offering of shares in A / S Lierbanen . At the same time , they sent an application for a social grant to the Ministry of Labour for NOK 330 @,@ 000 , plus NOK 30 @,@ 375 from the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) . 
 The committee proposed that the municipality buy shares for NOK 150 @,@ 000 . When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June , it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier , who stated that they felt that the railway would have no impact on them , and that the municipality should only buy shares for NOK 75 @,@ 000 . It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought shares for NOK 100 @,@ 000 . A year later , the municipality purchased shares for an addition NOK 30 @,@ 000 . The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK 30 @,@ 000 , Buskerud County Municipality with NOK 50 @,@ 000 and private investors , who supplied NOK 174 @,@ 050 . 
 During the debate in the Parliament of Norway in 1899 , it was proposed that construction be delayed until the Drammen Line was upgraded to standard gauge , but this was rejected by the majority . The plans to build the line were passed on 18 May 1899 and parliament gave a grant of NOK 350 @,@ 800 . In 1903 , this was supplemented with NOK 22 @,@ 500 . Construction started in late 1901 and was led by Engineer E. Richter . No blasting was done , but difficulties arose because of the large amounts of clay , which contributed to increase costs to NOK 800 @,@ 000 . 
 The line opened on 12 July 1904 and at the opening there were delivered two six @-@ axle steam locomotives from Hartmann , which were named Lier and Hole . The railway also took delivery of two passenger cars , a combined freight and conductor car , and a number of freight cars . Periodically the railway needed extra haulage power , and therefore sometimes leased locomotives from the Norwegian State Railways . The initial fares were NOK 1 @.@ 30 from Lier to Svangstrand , while the ferry across the lake cost an additional NOK 1 @.@ 50 . The greatest ridership was during the summer , when tourists took the line to reach the steam ships . During winter , the ridership fell , and the railway terminated at Sylling instead of <unk> . 
 The company bought the steamship <unk> , which supplemented the incumbent ferry Ringerike on Tyrifjorden . She a capacity of 50 passengers and a crew of two , and a power output of 6 kilowatts ( 8 hp ) . She had been built in 1892 or 1894 , and sold to A / S Lierbanen in 1904 or 1906 . <unk> was then put into service on the route from <unk> and Svangstrand . She was in bad shape , and was taken out of service in 1909 , sold in 1911 and dismantled in 1914 , after an accident . 
 The first year of operation had 40 @,@ 000 passengers and gave a small profit , but the next two gave deficits of NOK 5 @,@ 000 . Fiscal year 1907 – 08 gave a profit of NOK 11 @,@ 000 , increasing to NOK 18 @,@ 562 in 1912 – 13 — by then the line had 64 @,@ 080 passengers . The line had a large impact on Sylling , where the population increased from 467 in 1900 to 713 in 1910 . 
 In 1920 , the Drammen Line was rebuilt to standard gauge , and all cargo between the two lines had to be transshipped , increasing costs . The cheap construction methods , combined with bad geological conditions , caused derailing and other limitations to operation , including frequent delays . From 1922 , the section from Lier to Egge was rebuilt to dual gauge to allow gravel trains to operate to the gravel pit at Egge . In 1927 , a bus services started through the western part of Lier , claiming many of the trains ' patrons . To help save the company , the employees offered to work for half wage , but it was not sufficient to save the line . All scheduled traffic was terminated on 23 October 1932 , although the section to Tronstad Bruk was retained for some industrial trains until 31 December 1936 . The line was then demolished . 
 = Joe Small ( cricketer ) = 
 Joseph A. " Joe " Small ( 3 November 1892 – 26 April 1958 ) was a West Indian cricketer who played in West Indies ' first Test in their inaugural Test tour of England . He scored the first half century for a West Indies player in Test cricket and played two further Test matches in his career . An all @-@ rounder , he played domestic cricket for Trinidad between 1909 and 1932 . 
 Small first played cricket in Trinidad for a club of low social status . After establishing himself in the Trinidad team , he soon made a name for himself as a batsman and was one of the few black batsmen in the West Indies team at the time . For Trinidad , he was one of the cricketers instrumental in breaking the dominance of the Barbados cricket team in the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament . He first played for West Indies in 1912 – 13 and , after the First World War , was chosen to tour England twice . He was moderately successful on the 1923 tour , but was less effective in 1928 . Small played in the middle of the batting order ; he bowled either medium @-@ fast or off breaks . He died in 1958 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Small was born in Princes Town , Trinidad , in 1892 . He first played cricket for a club in Trinidad called <unk> , which included players from the lowest social class . Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines . For cricket clubs on the island , the colour of a player 's skin was crucial . <unk> was described by writer and historian C. L. R. James : " They were plebeians : the butcher , the tailor , the candlestick maker , the casual labourer , with a sprinkling of unemployed . Totally black and of no social status whatever . " James described Small as a genial presence on the cricket field : " Small talked to everybody and everybody talked to him : Joe radiated good nature and self @-@ satisfaction . " Outside of his cricket career , Small worked for the Stores Department of Trinidad Leaseholds oil company . 
 Small made his first @-@ class debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909 , playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd . Small scored 13 and 0 in the match and bowled two over without taking a wicket . The following January , Small made his first appearance for Trinidad in the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament ; he scored seven runs in his only innings and took four for 16 in British Guiana 's first innings . In the final against Barbados , he took one wicket in the game and scored 17 and 8 in his two innings . Trinidad won the match . Later that year , Small played against Barbados again , in the final of the next Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , but had little success in that match , nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs , and he took a total of three wickets . In both instances , Barbados won the tournament .

 During the 1912 – 13 season , the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) toured West Indies , playing in Barbados , Trinidad and British Guiana . The MCC played two matches against each island and faced a representative West Indies side in each location . Small played for Trinidad against the tourists ; he made scores of 25 and 26 , and took seven for 49 in the MCC first innings , adding another wicket in the second innings . Although that match was lost by Trinidad , the second game was drawn . Small scored 28 runs and took one wicket in the game . He was included in the West Indies team which played at Port of Spain , but had little success . 
 Small did not play more first @-@ class cricket until after the First World War , but during the war he played in Egypt alongside future West Indian captain Karl Nunes . When he resumed his Trinidad career in 1920 , he played in two games against Barbados . In the first , he scored 33 and 62 , his first score over fifty in first @-@ class cricket . In the second , he scored 102 not out , his maiden century . He also took three wickets in total in the games , both of which were won by Barbados . In 1921 , the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament resumed , but despite playing both games , Small had little success . During the 1922 tournament , Small scored 33 and 82 against British Guiana and took three for 46 Guiana 's first innings . Having beaten Guiana , Trinidad lost to Barbados once more in the final in which Small scored 36 and 5 , but took only two wickets in 35 overs . 
 = = = First tour of England = = = 
 In 1923 , the West Indies toured England . Five players were selected from Trinidad , including Small . At the time , West Indian batsmen were traditionally white , but according to James , " Joe Small had made for himself a place as a batsman which could not be denied . " James writes that there was a perception in Trinidad that Small owed his place to his genial nature , but that the selectors did not want any further black batsmen in the side . When the tour began , Small scored 53 in his second game but bowled infrequently . After a run of low scores , he scored 94 and 68 against Lancashire at Old Trafford Cricket Ground . The press praised the innings , particularly Small 's use of the drive . James remembered in later years that Small " startled Old Trafford in 1923 with his driving " . After taking six wickets in a minor game , Small took five for 93 and scored 71 against Nottinghamshire in his next first @-@ class match . He bowled 53 overs in the game , by far his greatest number on the tour . He scored a century in another minor match , followed by 85 in a first @-@ class game against Warwickshire and another three first @-@ class fifties in the remainder of the season . In all first @-@ class matches , he scored 776 runs at an average of 31 @.@ 04 , placing him third in the team 's batting averages . With the ball , he took 19 wickets at an average of 33 @.@ 47 . 
 According to C. L. R. James , Small was asked by either Hampshire or Sussex to qualify to play for their team after the tour , as other West Indian cricketers had done after previous tours . However , he refused . According to James , this contrasted with the ambition of others in the team : " Through cricket , steadiness of character and a limited outlook Joe had made a place for himself that was quite satisfactory to him " .

 Small returned to play for Trinidad in the 1924 Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament ; he scored 62 in the first match but failed in the final against Barbados . He had more success in the February 1925 tournament . After scoring 72 , he took six for 43 to help his team defeat British Guiana . Then in the final , Trinidad defeated Barbados for the first time since 1910 . Small scored 2 and 36 ; with the ball he took five for 34 in the first innings and four for 62 in the second innings to bowl Trinidad to a 13 @-@ run win . Later in the same year , Trinidad retained their title with a two @-@ wicket victory over British Guiana . Small scored 133 in his first innings and took three wickets in British Guiana 's second innings . In January 1926 , the MCC toured West Indies again , playing matches against the islands and a combined West Indies side . Small played twice for Trinidad and three times for West Indies against the touring team , but managed just 106 runs with one fifty in eight innings , and took 11 wickets . In January 1927 , Small scored 100 against Barbados , but although his team established a lead of 384 runs , Trinidad lost after Barbados scored 726 in their second innings ; Small bowled 60 overs in the second innings to take two wickets .

 West Indies were scheduled to tour England in 1928 , including their first Test matches . The selectors organised three trial matches in Barbados in December 1927 and January 1928 . Small was dismissed only twice in five innings and scored 217 runs with a top @-@ score of 81 . He also took five wickets , and was selected to go on the tour . However , he was less successful than on the 1923 tour . Although several batting records were established by English players in a season that produced good batting conditions , Small 's batting average fell and , in common with many of his team @-@ mates , he was generally unsuccessful with the bat . Although he managed a century against Oxford University , he scored only 595 runs at an average of 18 @.@ 59 . He was more successful in bowling ; he fulfilled a supporting role with the ball , took 50 wickets at an average of 20 @.@ 88 and finished third in the team 's bowling averages . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack noted that , compared to 1923 , " Small fell off considerably " with the bat , and that his " increased measure of success " with the ball did not compensate for the failure of other bowlers . 
 West Indies lost every game in the three @-@ Test series . In the first Test , Small took two wickets in England 's innings and scored 0 in his first innings . But in the second innings , he scored 52 , West Indies ' first half @-@ century in Test matches . Wisden recorded : " Small , batting in fine form for an hour and a half , enjoyed the distinction of making the only score of over 50 for his side . " He also played in the third Test , but took no wickets and scored 0 and 2 .

 During the 1928 – 29 Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , Small took four for 14 in Trinidad 's first match , but contributed little else as Trinidad won the competition . Later in the year , he took seven for 77 for a West Indies XI against an English team led by Julien Cahn which was playing in Jamaica ; he and two others joined the Jamaican team for this game . Trinidad lost to British Guiana in the 1929 – 30 tournament , and Small did little in the game . An MCC team toured West Indies again that season , and Small played in one of Trinidad 's two matches against the touring team . Although he was not successful , he was chosen for the second Test of the four @-@ match series between England and West Indies , played in Trinidad . He took one wicket and scored 20 and 5 in the match . This was his final Test match . In three Test matches , he scored 79 runs at an average of 13 @.@ 16 and took 3 wickets at 61 @.@ 33 . 
 Small only played twice more in first @-@ class cricket . There was no first @-@ class cricket in West Indies during the 1930 – 31 season , but he played in the Trinidad team which won the 1931 – 32 Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament . In his final first @-@ class innings , he scored 66 and he took a wicket with his final delivery . In his career , he scored 3 @,@ 063 first @-@ class runs at a batting average of 26 @.@ 17 and took 165 wickets at an average of 27 @.@ 81 . Small continued to play successfully in South Trinidad in local leagues until the early 1940s . He died following a short illness in Pointe @-@ à @-@ Pierre , Trinidad , on 26 April 1958 at the age of 65 , having been largely forgotten in the West Indies . However , in 1984 , he was entered into the Trinidad and Tobago Sports Hall of Fame .

 His Wisden obituary states that Small was a " tall , loose @-@ limbed all @-@ rounder , who did much fine work for Trinidad " . In The Complete Record of West Indian Test Cricketers , Bridgette Lawrence states : " Joe Small was one of West Indies ' pioneering all @-@ rounders in Test cricket . He was a gifted batsman with all the strokes at his command , a medium @-@ pace off @-@ break bowler and a competent slip fielder . " The Daily Gleaner gave Small credit , along with other Trinidadian cricketers of the time , for overcoming the dominance of the Barbados team . Wisden also described him as a " splendid " slip fielder . Small batted in a variety of positions in the batting order , but usually lower than number three . He sometimes opened the bowling and was capable of bowling quickly . He also bowled off spin at medium pace ; his height made him quite difficult for batsmen to face . 
 C. L. R. James wrote about Small in his book Beyond a Boundary . He described an unimportant match where Small was facing the fast bowler George John ; he deliberately hit the ball hard back at John 's feet to make him angry . He also wrote about practising with Small : " International cricketers are not as ordinary men . There might be only two boys fielding , but if you bowled Joe a half @-@ volley outside the off stump , he hit with all his force , though he would have to wait until the ball came back from 150 yards . Then he would bowl at me for ten minutes . "

 Dominica is an island nation located in the far eastern rim of the Caribbean Sea that lis between the French colonies of Guadeloupe ( to the north ) and Martinique to the south . The country 's debut in the Olympics was in Atlanta during the 1996 Summer Olympics , and it has participated in every summer Olympics between then and the Beijing Olympics in 2008 – numbering four in total . The largest delegation sent by Dominica was in 1996 , and the size of its delegation decreased to four in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , then to two in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens . Dominica 's Beijing delegation also only included two athletes , although its appearance at the Olympics marked the first Dominican delegation that included no women . As of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics , Dominican athletes had not won any medals . Jerome Romain , the coach accompanying the Dominican delegation , was the nation 's flagbearer at the ceremonies . 
 The delegation of Dominica in Beijing totaled eight people .

 = Tarrare = 
 Tarrare ( c . 1772 – 1798 ) , sometimes spelled Tarare , was a French showman and soldier , noted for his unusual eating habits . Able to eat vast amounts of meat , he was constantly hungry ; his parents could not provide for him , and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager . He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes , before becoming the warm @-@ up act to a travelling charlatan ; he would swallow corks , stones , live animals and a whole basketful of apples . He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer . 
 At the start of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army . With military rations unable to satisfy his large appetite , he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger . Suffering from exhaustion , he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity , in which , among other things , he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting , ate live cats , snakes , lizards and puppies , and swallowed an eel whole without chewing . Despite his unusual diet , he was of normal size and appearance , and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament . 
 General Alexandre de Beauharnais decided to put Tarrare 's abilities to use , and he was employed as a courier by the French army , with the intention that he would swallow documents , pass through enemy lines , and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination . Unfortunately for Tarrare , he could not speak German , and on his first mission was captured by Prussian forces , severely beaten and underwent a mock execution before being returned to French lines . 
 Chastened by this experience , he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite , and was treated with laudanum , tobacco pills , wine vinegar and soft @-@ boiled eggs . The procedures failed , and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet ; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal in gutters , rubbish heaps and outside butchers ' shops , and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue . After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital . He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis , and died shortly afterwards , following a lengthy bout of <unk> diarrhoea . 
 = = Childhood and early life = = 
 Tarrare was born in rural France , near Lyon , around 1772 . His date of birth is unrecorded and it is not even known if Tarrare was his real name or a nickname . 
 As a child , Tarrare had a huge appetite and by his teens could eat a quarter of a bullock , weighing as much as Tarrare himself , in a single day . By this time , his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home . For some years after this , he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes , begging and stealing for food , before gaining employment as a warm @-@ up act to a travelling charlatan . Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks , stones and live animals , and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other . He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat . 
 In 1788 , Tarrare moved to Paris to work as a street performer . He appears to have been successful in general , but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction . Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel @-@ Dieu hospital , where he was treated with powerful laxatives . He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon 's watch and chain ; M. Giraud , the surgeon , was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so , he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items . 
 = = Appearance and behaviour = = 
 Despite his unusual diet , Tarrare was slim and of average height . At the age of 17 , he weighed only 100 pounds ( 45 kg ; 7 st 2 lb ) . He was described as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth , in which his teeth were heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible . When he had not eaten , his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist . When full , his abdomen would distend " like a huge balloon " . The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely , and when stretched out , he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth . His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily , constantly suffering from foul body odour ; he was described as stinking " to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces " . This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten , his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot , a visible vapour would rise from his body , and he would become lethargic , during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions . He suffered from chronic diarrhoea , which was said to be " fetid beyond all conception " . Despite his large intake of food , he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight . Aside from his eating habits , his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him , other than an apparently apathetic temperament with " a complete lack of force and ideas " . 
 The cause of Tarrare 's behaviour is not known . While there are other documented cases of similar behaviour from the period , none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied and there have been no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare . Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite , rapid weight loss , profuse sweating , heat intolerance , and fine hair . Bondeson ( 2006 ) speculates that Tarrare suffered from a damaged amygdala ; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in animals can induce polyphagia . 
 = = Military service = = 
 On the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition , Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army . Unfortunately for him , military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite . He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps , but this was not enough to satisfy him . Suffering from extreme exhaustion , he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz @-@ Haut @-@ Rhin . He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry ; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers , eat the scraps of food left by other patients , and creep into the apothecary 's room to eat the poultices . Military surgeons could not understand his appetite ; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr. Courville ( surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment ) and George Didier , Baron Percy , surgeon @-@ in @-@ chief of the hospital . 
 Courville and Percy decided to test Tarrare 's capacity for food . A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates ; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food , on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed . Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies , plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk , and then immediately fell asleep ; Courville noted that Tarrare 's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon . On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat . He tore the cat 's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood , and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones , before vomiting up its fur and skin . Following this , hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes , lizards and puppies , all of which were eaten ; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing , having first crushed its head with his teeth . 
 = = = Service as a military courier = = = 
 After several months he spent as an experimental case , military authorities began to press for Tarrare to be returned to active duty . Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare 's eating habits and digestive system , and approached General Alexandre de Beauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare 's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use . A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare . Two days later , the box was retrieved from his excrement , with the document still in legible condition . Courville proposed to de Beauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier , carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched . 
 Tarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the Army of the Rhine . Having swallowed the box successfully , Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) of raw bull 's lungs and liver as a reward , which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals . 
 Following this successful demonstration , Tarrare became employed officially as a spy of the Army of the Rhine . Although General de Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare 's physical capacity to carry messages internally , he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents . Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt ; he was told that the documents were of great military significance , but in reality de Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully , and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements . 
 Tarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness , disguised as a German peasant . Unable to speak German , he soon attracted the attention of local residents , who alerted the Prussian authorities , and he was captured outside Landau . A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person , and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers , he refused to betray his mission . Brought before the local Prussian commander , General Zoegli , he again refused to talk and was imprisoned . After 24 hours of captivity , Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors . He was chained to a latrine , and eventually , 30 hours after being swallowed , the wooden box emerged . Zoegli was furious when the documents , which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence , transpired only to be de Beauharnais 's dummy message , and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck . ( Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box , as Tarrare had the presence of mind to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians . ) At the last minute , Zoegli relented , and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold , given a severe beating , and released near the French lines . 
 = = Attempted cures = = 
 Following this incident , Tarrare was desperate to avoid further military service , and returned to the hospital , telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite . Percy treated him with laudanum without success ; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful . Following these failures , Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft @-@ boiled eggs , but this also failed to suppress his appetite . Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed ; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers ' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters , alleys and rubbish heaps . He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting , and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary . Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum , but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital . 
 After some time , a 14 @-@ month @-@ old child disappeared from the hospital , and Tarrare was immediately suspected . Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him , and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital , to which he never returned . 
 = = Death = = 
 Four years later , in 1798 , a M. Tessier of Versailles hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him . It was Tarrare , now bedridden and weak . Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier , which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness . He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it . Percy , however , recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis . A month later , Tarrare began to suffer from continuous <unk> diarrhoea , dying shortly afterwards . 
 The corpse rotted quickly ; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it . Tessier , however , wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally , and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him . At the autopsy , Tarrare 's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened , surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach . His body was found to be filled with pus , his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large , and his stomach was enormous , covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity . The fork was never found . 
 = Bristol Harbour = 
 Bristol Harbour is the harbour in the city of Bristol , England . The harbour covers an area of 70 acres ( 28 @.@ 3 ha ) . It has existed since the 13th century but was developed into its current form in the early 19th century by installing lock gates on a tidal stretch of the River Avon in the centre of the city and providing a tidal by @-@ pass for the river . It is often called the Floating Harbour as the water level remains constant and it is not affected by the state of the tide on the river . 
 Netham Lock in east Bristol is the upstream limit of the harbour . Beyond the lock is a junction : on one arm the navigable River Avon continues upstream to Bath , and on the other arm is the tidal River Avon . The first 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of the floating harbour , downstream from Netham Lock to Totterdown Basin , is an artificial canal known as the Feeder Canal , while the tidal River Avon follows its original route . Downstream of Totterdown Basin , the floating harbour occupies the former natural course of the River Avon , whilst the tidal River Avon flows through an artificial channel known as the New Cut . This separation of the floating harbour and the tidal River Avon allows boats in the harbour to remain floating at low tide , reduces currents and silting and prevents flooding . 
 Between Bristol Temple Meads railway station and Hotwells , the harbour and the River Avon run parallel at a distance of no more than 0 @.@ 65 miles ( 1 @.@ 0 km ) apart . Downstream of Bristol Temple Meads railway station , the floating harbour meanders through Bristol city centre , Canon 's Marsh and Hotwells . At Hotwells , the floating harbour rejoins the tidal River Avon , via a series of locks , and flows into the Avon Gorge . 
 = = The harbour today = = 
 Bristol Harbour was the original Port of Bristol , but as ships and their cargo have increased in size , it has now largely been replaced by docks at Avonmouth and Portbury . These are located 7 miles ( 11 @.@ 3 km ) downstream at the mouth of the River Avon . 
 The harbour is now a tourist attraction with museums , galleries , exhibitions , bars and nightclubs . Former workshops and warehouses have now largely been converted or replaced by cultural venues , such as the Arnolfini art gallery , Watershed media and arts centre , M Shed museum , Antlers Gallery and the At @-@ Bristol science exhibition centre , as well as a number of fashionable apartment buildings . The Bristol Harbour Railway , operated by M Shed , runs between the museum and the Create Centre on some weekends and bank holidays . Historic boats are permanently berthed in the harbour . These include Isambard Kingdom Brunel 's SS Great Britain , which was the first iron @-@ hulled and propeller @-@ driven ocean <unk> and a replica of the Matthew in which John Cabot sailed to North America in 1497 . The historic vessels of M Shed museum , which include the steam tug Mayflower , <unk> <unk> and motor tug John King , are periodically operated . 
 Bristol Ferry Boats and Number Seven Boat Trips operate ferry services in the harbour , serving landing stages close to most of the harbour @-@ side attractions . The Bristol Packet boats offer regular harbour tours with commentaries and river cruises on the Tower Belle up the River Avon to <unk> , Hanham and Bath and downstream to Avonmouth . In late July each year , the Bristol Harbour Festival is held , resulting in an influx of boats , including tall ships , Royal Navy vessels and lifeboats . 
 = = Sections , quays & harbourside features = = 
 = = History of Bristol docks = = 
 Bristol grew up on the banks of the Rivers Avon and Frome . Since the 13th century , the rivers have been modified for use as docks including the diversion of the River Frome in the 1240s into an artificial deep channel known as " Saint Augustine 's Reach " , which flowed into the River Avon . Saint Augustine 's Reach became the heart of Bristol 's docks with its quays and wharfs . The River Avon within the gorge , and the River Severn into which it flows , has tides which fluctuate about 30 feet ( 9 m ) between high and low water . This means that the river is easily navigable at high @-@ tide but reduced to a muddy channel at low tide in which ships would often run aground . Ships had no option but to be stranded in the harbour for unloading , giving rise to the phrase " <unk> and Bristol fashion " to describe how ships and their secured cargo were capable of taking the strain of repeated strandings on the mud . 
 As early as 1420 , vessels from Bristol were regularly travelling to Iceland and it is speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot . After Cabot arrived in Bristol , he proposed a scheme to the king , Henry VII , in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic . He estimated that this would be shorter and quicker than Columbus ' southerly route . The merchants of Bristol , operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers , agreed to support his scheme . They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s , looking for possible trading opportunities . In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port . 
 By 1670 , the city had 6 @,@ 000 tons of shipping , of which half was used for importing tobacco . By the late 17th century and early 18th century , this shipping was also playing a significant role in the slave trade . 
 = = = Construction of the floating harbour = = = 
 In the 18th century , the docks in Liverpool grew larger and so increased competition with Bristol for the tobacco trade . Coastal trade was also important , with the area called " Welsh Back " concentrating on trows with cargoes from the Slate industry in Wales , stone , timber and coal . The limitations of Bristol 's docks were causing problems to business , so in 1802 William Jessop proposed installing a dam and lock at Hotwells to create the harbour . The £ 530 @,@ 000 scheme was approved by Parliament , and construction began in May 1804 . The scheme included the construction of the Cumberland Basin , a large wide stretch of the harbour in Hotwells where the Quay walls and bollards have listed building status . 
 The tidal new cut was constructed from Netham to Hotwells , with another dam installed at this end of the harbour . The Feeder Canal between Temple Meads and Netham provided a link to the tidal river so that boats could continue upstream to Bath . However , the new scheme required a way to equalise the levels inside and outside the Dock for the passage of vessels to and from the Avon , and bridges to cross the water . Jessop built Cumberland Basin with two entrance locks from the tidal Avon , of width 45 ft ( 13 @.@ 7 m ) and 35 ft ( 10 @.@ 7 m ) , and a 45 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 m ) wide junction lock between the Basin and what became known as the Floating Harbour . This arrangement provided flexibility of operation with the Basin being used as a lock when there were large numbers of arrivals and sailings . The harbour was officially opened on 1 May 1809 . 
 Patterson 's yard within the harbour was used for the construction of many ships notably Brunel 's SS Great Western in 1838 and the SS Great Britain in 1843 . They were some of the largest ships to have been built at the time , and ironically hastened the decline of the city docks by proving the feasibility of large ships . The SS Great Britain was to be towed away from her builders , to have her 1 @,@ 000 hp engines and interior fitted out on the River Thames , but her 48 ft ( 14 @.@ 6 m ) beam was too big to pass through the lock . Thus the SS Great Britain was moored in the Floating Harbour until December 1844 , before proceeding into Cumberland Basin after coping stones and lock gate platforms were removed from the Junction Lock . At one time there were dozens of Bristol shipyards , the largest in the harbour being <unk> , who became Charles Hill & Sons in 1845 . 
 = = = 19th century improvements = = = 
 The harbour cost more than anticipated and high rates were levied to repay loans , reducing any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool . In 1848 the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates . They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements , including new lock gates , a dredger and sluice gates designed to reduce siltation . 
 By 1867 , ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over 300 ft ( 91 m ) from reaching the harbour . A scheme to install a much larger lock at Avonmouth to make the entire river a floating harbour , and to straighten the sharper bends , was dropped after work began on the much cheaper docks at Avonmouth and Portishead . The present entrance lock was designed by Thomas Howard and opened in July 1873 . This has a width of 62 ft ( 18 @.@ 9 m ) and is the only entrance lock now in use at the City Docks . 
 From 1893 until 1934 the Clifton Rocks Railway provided an underground funicular railway link from the western end of the harbour , which is close to the locks , into Clifton . 
 = = = = Railways = = = = 
 The original Bristol Harbour Railway was a joint venture by the GWR and the Bristol and Exeter Railway , opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour . Its route included a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church and a steam @-@ powered bascule bridge over the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin . In 1876 the railway was extended by half a mile to Wapping Wharf . In 1906 , new branches from the south via the Ashton Avenue swing bridge were built to Canons Marsh on the north side of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut . A Coal Concentration Depot owned by Western Fuels was established at Wapping Wharf just behind the Industrial Museum but this closed in 1987 . 
 = = = = Underfall Yard = = = = 
 The docks maintenance facility was established on the land exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day . William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut , this was known as the ' <unk> ' . By the 1830s , the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting . Isambard Kingdom Brunel was , however , able to devise a solution to this problem . In place of the <unk> he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut , together with a dredging vessel . This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls . When the deep sluice opened at low tide , a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide . The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions . 
 Several old buildings , which date from the 1880s , remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status . The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic engine house dates from 1888 , and is grade II * listed , as is the hydraulic engine house itself . It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery , installed in 1907 by Fullerton , <unk> and Barclay of Paisley , which powers the dock 's hydraulic system of cranes , bridges and locks . The former pattern @-@ maker 's shop and stores date from the same period and are grade II listed , as are the Patent slip and quay walls . 
 = = = = Warehouses = = = = 
 A large number of warehouses were built around the harbour for storage and trade . Many survive today and some are being converted into apartment blocks but many have been demolished as part of the regeneration of the area . 
 One which has survived is the A Bond Tobacco Warehouse , which was built in 1905 and was the first of the three brick built bonded warehouses in the Cumberland Basin , and is a grade II listed building . 
 B Bond Warehouse dates from 1908 and was the first in Britain to use Edmond <unk> 's reinforced concrete system . It is now used by Bristol City Council and houses Bristol Record Office , the Create centre and council offices . 
 Robinson 's Warehouse built in 1874 by William Bruce Gingell , and the Granary on Welsh Back are examples of the Bristol Byzantine style with coloured brick and Moorish arches . 
 The Arnolfini art gallery occupies Bush House , a 19th @-@ century Grade II * listed tea <unk> and the Watershed Media Centre occupies another disused warehouse . 
 = = = 20th century improvements = = = 
 In 1908 , the Royal Edward Dock was built in Avonmouth and in 1972 the large deep water Royal Portbury Dock was constructed on the opposite side of the mouth of the Avon , making the Bristol City Docks in the floating harbour redundant as a freight dock . In 1977 Charles Hill & Sons , the last shipbuilder at the Albion Yard , closed after delivering the 1541 tonne beer tanker Miranda Guinness . Part of the yard reopened in 1980 when Abels Shipbuilders began operating , who still produce a steady stream of small ferries , survey vessels , tugs and other craft . 
 Amey <unk> ( formerly T R Brown and Holms Sand & Gravel ) sand dredgers worked from Poole 's Wharf in Hotwells until 1991 . Occasionally coastal trading vessels enter the Cumberland Basin to be loaded with large steel silos manufactured by Braby Ltd at their nearby Ashton Gate works . 
 The old Junction Lock swing bridge is powered by water pressure from the Underfall Yard hydraulic engine house at 750 psi ( 52 bar ) . The new Plimsoll Bridge , completed in 1965 , has a more modern electro @-@ hydraulic system using oil at a pressure of 4 @,@ 480 psi ( 309 bar ) . 
 = = Regeneration of the harbourside = = 
 Since the 1980s , millions of pounds have been spent regenerating the harbourside . In 1999 , Pero 's footbridge was constructed , linking the At @-@ Bristol exhibition with Bristol tourist attractions . In 2000 , the At @-@ Bristol centre opened on semi @-@ derelict land at Canon 's Marsh and some of the existing Grade II listed buildings were refurbished and reused . It was funded with £ 44 @.@ 3 million from the National Lottery , the Millennium Commission , South West of England Regional Development Agency , and a further £ 43 @.@ 4 million from Bristol City Council and commercial partners , including Nestlé . Private investors are also constructing studio apartment buildings . 
 The regeneration of the Canon 's Marsh area is expected to cost £ 240 million . Crest Nicholson were the lead developers , constructing 450 new flats , homes and waterside offices . It is being carried out under the guidance of The Harbourside Sponsors ’ Group , which is a partnership between the City Council , key stakeholders , developers , businesses , operators and funders . 
 The Cumberland Basin & Baltic Wharf are used by a variety of small boats by Baltic Wharf Sailing Club and is surrounded by tourist attractions . The old hydraulic pumping station has been converted into a public house and is a Grade II listed building . 
 There are three active boat building companies in the harbour : Abels Shipbuilders , Bristol Classic Boat Company and the Slipway Co @-@ operative at the Underfall Yard . 
 = = Events = = 
 Bristol Harbour hosts the Bristol Harbour Festival in July of each year , attended by tall ships and hundreds of ships and boats of all kinds . About 200 @,@ 000 visitors view the boats , and watch live music , street performances and other entertainments . 
 In 1996 , the harbour was the setting for the first International Festival of the Sea . A larger version of the annual harbour festivals , this was attended by many tall ships , including the Eye of the Wind , Pride of Baltimore , Rose , <unk> and Earl of Pembroke . The key theme was John Cabot 's pioneering voyage of discovery to the Americas and a replica of Cabot 's ship , the Matthew , was dedicated prior to its reenactment of Cabot 's voyage the following year . In 2009 , the 200th anniversary of the Floating Harbour was commemorated with a series of celebratory events .

 = = Creation , development and characterisation = = 
 Naz is one of four main characters from series two of EastEnders : E20 , created by its team of thirteen writers , along with Asher , Sol and Stevie . Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role , and said : " It 's a really exciting place to start my career . I 'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders , which is one of the reasons I wanted to do the show . " Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something " authentic and real " in her and that she could play the character how they wanted , and said she is similar to the character in some ways , adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as she got into <unk> . The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010 . The show 's producer , Deborah Sathe , said " I am [ ... ] proud of what the writers have achieved . [ They ] have created four new faces for [ Albert ] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting . " 
 The character , of Turkish descent , is described as being " torn between two worlds " , which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life . Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun , but is also a daddy 's girl , the apple of her father 's eye . He sees her as a perfect student . She has a good relationship with her parents and is respectful of them , doing what they want , even though they do not know her very well . She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants . Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more . What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her and to be able to pick her own boyfriend , but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to . She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other , but more of each side is seen as the series goes on , and they eventually meet , leading to bad consequences . Hussen opined that this is a common real @-@ life situation that is rarely portrayed on television , so girls would be able relate to the character . Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness ; she likes to get her own way . 
 Naz believes that her new friends can take her away from her home life . She falls in love with Sol , which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is " the wrong person " . Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected , and she puts up a wall . Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her , and as she is stronger than he is , she sees it as taking him in and teaching him . Sol falls for Naz very quickly , and Cole said they have never met people like each other before . Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun , but causes trouble and drama , such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the main characters of series 1 and 2 . Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film . Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away . She is confident and fiery , she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say . Emer Kenny , who played Zsa Zsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders : E20 and was one of the writers , introducing the characters in the first episode , said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for , she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a " clown " like Fatboy . Kenny compared Naz to Zsa Zsa , saying she is clever but cool , feisty , sassy and able to outwit Fatboy . Kenny also admired the character 's costume and makeup , saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look .

 Naz is one of four characters from series 2 who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter , along with Stevie , Stevie 's boyfriend Olly Manthrope @-@ Hall ( Joshua McGuire ) and Fatboy , where it is revealed that the character works in a kebab shop during the summer holiday . Further posts on Twitter allude to the storyline running up to the start of the series , such as Naz buying the fake ID from Fatboy . Naz also appears in extra video content on the E20 website . In one video , she attempts to take a photo of herself to use on her fake ID . In another , Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park , and Naz makes a video of Stevie , hoping to make Olly jealous , but Stevie ends up with cake on her face . In another video , the four friends play a drinking game in the café .

Most of NY 43 is a two @-@ lane highway that passes through a mixture of rural and residential areas ; however , its westernmost 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) between I @-@ 90 and U.S. Route 4 ( US 4 ) is a four @-@ lane divided highway . NY 43 has an overlap with NY 66 in Sand Lake and intersects NY 22 in Stephentown . 
 When NY 43 was first assigned in the 1920s , it began near the village of Schoharie and ended in downtown Albany . Initially , the portion of modern NY 43 east of Averill Park was designated as part of New York State Route 7 in 1924 . It was renumbered to New York State Route 45 by 1926 and became part of an extended NY 43 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 43 was originally routed on Broadway and Washington Avenue in Rensselaer ; however , it was rerouted to use 3rd Avenue and US 4 instead in the late 1960s . 
 In the early 1970s , the route was truncated to consist only of the portion east of the Hudson River . NY 43 's former routing west to Schoharie was redesignated NY 443 as a result . NY 43 was realigned slightly in the late 1990s to serve the new exit 8 on I @-@ 90 . Its former routing into Rensselaer on 3rd Avenue is now partly NY 151 and unsigned NY <unk> .

 NY 43 begins at an interchange with I @-@ 90 ( exit 8 ) in the town of North Greenbush in western Rensselaer County . The route heads northeastward as a four @-@ lane divided highway through a small forest separating NY 43 from a pair of residential neighborhoods . NY 43 provides access to these neighborhoods at an intersection with Washington Avenue . Past this junction , the highway turns eastward to meet US 4 in the hamlet of Defreestville . NY 43 narrows to two lanes roughly 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) east of US 4 and continues eastward through a densely populated area of North Greenbush . 
 East of Lape Road ( County Route 66 or CR 66 ) , the amount of development along NY 43 begins to decline and give way to small , open fields located amongst forested areas . However , as NY 43 enters the town of Sand Lake , the number of homes and businesses on the highway rises once more . The level of development reaches its greatest point in West Sand Lake , a community centered around NY 43 's junction with NY 150 . NY 43 continues on , passing through residential areas of Sand Lake as it intersects NY 351 and heads eastward to Averill Park . The route meets NY 66 east of the community , and the two routes overlap for 3 miles ( 5 km ) southeastward along the eastern shores of the small Glass and Crooked Lakes . NY 43 and NY 66 split just after crossing into the town of Nassau near the southern edge of Crooked Lake . 
 NY 43 heads southeastward from NY 66 , passing through mostly rural , forested areas as it proceeds toward the Massachusetts state line . Most of the development along the final stretch of the route is concentrated in the small communities along the route . It passes through Dunham Hollow and enters the town of Stephentown as it serves the hamlet of West Stephentown . NY 43 continues through forested areas of Stephentown to Stephentown Center , denoted by a cluster of homes near the intersection of NY 43 and Newton Road . 
 From Stephentown Center , the route heads southeast to the community of Stephentown situated 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the state line . NY 43 serves as the main commercial strip through the hamlet , which is the largest location on the route since Averill Park . Here , NY 43 intersects NY 22 at a junction that features sharp corners for commuters turning onto NY 43 from NY 22 . Past NY 22 , NY 43 heads southeast through mostly open fields and lightly populated areas to the Massachusetts state line , where the roadway becomes Route 43 upon crossing into Hancock , Massachusetts .

 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created a system of unsigned legislative routes across the state of New York . Two of the routes created at this time were Route 7 , which extended from the Pennsylvania state line south of Binghamton to Albany via Oneonta , Cobleskill , Berne , and New Scotland , and Route 24 , a highway extending from the east bank of the Hudson River in Rensselaer to the Massachusetts state line near Mount Lebanon by way of Averill Park and Nassau . In the vicinity of Rensselaer , Route 21 was routed on 3rd Avenue , 3rd Avenue Extension , North Greenbush Road , and West Sand Lake Road . 
 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , a highway connecting Route 21 in Averill Park to the Massachusetts state line at Stephentown was designated as part of NY 7 , a route that continued northwest from Averill Park to Troy on modern NY 66 . By 1926 , the portion of old legislative Route 7 from Central Bridge to East Berne was designated as part of NY 43 , a new route extending from Central Bridge to downtown Albany via East Berne , Clarksville , and Delmar , while NY 7 was renumbered to NY 45 .

 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 43 was truncated slightly on its western end to begin at a junction with the new NY 30 north of Schoharie . Meanwhile , NY 45 was reassigned to another highway in Orange County . The portion of former NY 45 from Troy to Averill Park became part of NY 66 while the remainder became an eastward extension of NY 43 . The extended NY 43 was now concurrent with US 9 and US 20 along Madison Avenue from Delaware Avenue to Rensselaer , where it followed Broadway and Washington Avenue to US 4 in Defreestville . The route continued east to Averill Park on what had been legislative Route 21 . 
 NY 43 was extended slightly following the construction of a new alignment for NY 30 near Central Bridge in the early 1940s . NY 30 now left its old alignment southeast of Central Bridge and bypassed the community to the east . The former routing of NY 30 into Central Bridge became an extension of NY 43 , which overlapped NY 30 between the new alignment and Schoharie . When NY 30A replaced NY 148 in the late 1950s , the short piece of NY 43 near Central Bridge became part of NY 30A and NY 43 was truncated back to NY 30 near Schoharie . In the late 1960s , NY 43 was rerouted through downtown Rensselaer to follow 3rd Avenue ( previously NY 381 ) east to US 4 . From there , NY 43 overlapped US 4 northward to Defreestville , where it rejoined its previous alignment . 
 NY 43 was truncated on its western end to the junction of 3rd Avenue and Broadway in downtown Rensselaer in the early 1970s , eliminating the overlap with US 9 and US 20 through Albany . Its former routing from Schoharie to Albany was renumbered to NY 443 . NY 43 remained on 3rd Avenue up to the late 1990s when it was rerouted to follow a new highway to I @-@ 90 exit 8 west of Defreestville . The realignment eliminated the overlap with US 4 and also took NY 43 outside of the Rensselaer city limits for the first time since being extended across the Hudson River in 1930 . The former alignment of NY 43 along 3rd Avenue from Broadway to Barracks Road became part of NY 151 ; the remainder was designated NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route .

 = Hurricane Lili ( 1996 ) = 
 Hurricane Lili was a relatively long @-@ lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom . Lili formed on October 14 from a tropical wave , which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October 4 . After the storm formed , further strengthening of Lili was gradual , first to tropical storm status on October 16 and then to hurricane status on October 17 . The next day , Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island , the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985 . After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean , the hurricane accelerated northeastward , briefly peaking as a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas . For almost an entire week , Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed . About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October 27 , which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain . 
 Early in its duration , Lili caused flooding in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14 people . Damage was heaviest in Cuba , mostly due to the hurricane 's heavy rainfall which totaled 29 @.@ 41 in ( 747 mm ) . The hurricane affected 11 Cuban provinces , damaging 92 @,@ 542 houses and destroying another 6 @,@ 369 . The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane and banana crops , and overall damage in the country was estimated at $ 362 million ( 1996 USD ) . After 269 @,@ 995 people were evacuated in advance of Lili , there were no deaths in the country . In nearby Florida , one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm 's heavy rains . Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States , which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried driving across a flooded roadway . Damage in the Bahamas was not severe , limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees . When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom , it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses , causing $ 300 million in damage ( 1996 USD ) and six deaths .

 On October 4 , a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa with a large associated circulation . Unfavorable wind shear prevented any development , and the wave continued westward , entering the Caribbean Sea on October 11 . Two days later , the wave axis encountered a pre @-@ existing low pressure area in the southwest Caribbean . It quickly developed a well @-@ defined circulation , becoming a tropical depression on October 14 off the east coast of Nicaragua . Due to an upper @-@ level low in the Gulf of Mexico , the system tracked to the northwest , brushing Central America in its path . The depression developed banding features as the pressure gradually dropped , and intensified into Tropical Storm Lili at around 0600 UTC on October 16 . During this time , the storm executed a small cyclonic loop while a few hundred miles north of the Swan Islands . By early on October 17 , Lili had attained hurricane status while it was turning to the north . 
 Hurricane Lili grazed Isla de la Juventud on October 18 , bringing heavy rains and strong winds to the island . Later that day , Lili made landfall in Matanzas Province , Cuba as a category 2 hurricane , with winds close to 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Despite the mountainous terrain , the storm did not weaken , with the same pressure reading of 975 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) being observed at landfall and when Lili reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean . After reaching warm waters , Lili further strengthened as it approached the Bahamas . The eye of the storm – reaching a width of over 35 mi ( 56 km ) – passed over San Salvador Island and Great Exuma on October 19 , and brushed several other islands . That day , a trough in the westerlies caused Lili to accelerate northeastward , reaching a forward speed of almost 29 mph ( 47 km / h ) . On October 19 at 1200 UTC , Hurricane Lili attained its peak intensity for a brief time , reaching 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) winds and pressure of 960 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , both measured by the Hurricane Hunters . This made Lili the sixth major hurricane – a category 3 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale – of the season . 
 Within six hours , Lili had weakened below its peak intensity on October 19 . The center passed 150 mi ( 240 km ) to the southeast of Bermuda , and subsequently the winds gradually decreased . A mid @-@ level ridge caused Lili to slow to an east @-@ southeast drift on October 22 . After two days , the hurricane again accelerated to the northeast , briefly re @-@ intensifying into a category 2 hurricane . Lili again started a weakening trend soon after , and by October 26 , was downgraded to a tropical storm about 345 mi ( 555 km ) northwest of the Azores . On October 27 , it was estimated that Lili became extratropical , which maintained gale @-@ force winds as it approached Europe . The remnants moved across Ireland and Great Britain on October 28 with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . The remnants of Lili were absorbed by a much larger extratropical system in the North Sea on October 29 , which proceeded to cross over the European mainland .
