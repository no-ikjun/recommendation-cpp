 In downtown Newport News , the Victory Arch , built to commemorate the Great War , sits on the downtown waterfront . The " Eternal Flame " under the arch was cast by Womack Foundry , Inc. in the 1960s . It was hand crafted by the Foundry 's founder and president , Ernest D. Womack . The downtown area has a number of landmarks and architecturally interesting buildings , which for some time were mostly abandoned in favor of building new areas in the northwest areas of the city ( a strategy aided by tax incentives in the postwar years ) . 
 City leaders are working to bring new life into this area , by renovating and building new homes and attracting businesses . The completion of Interstate 664 restored the area to access and through traffic which had been largely rerouted with the completion of the Hampton Roads Bridge @-@ Tunnel in 1958 and discontinuance of the Newport News @-@ Norfolk ferry service at that time . The larger capacity Monitor @-@ Merrimac Memorial Bridge @-@ Tunnel and the rebuilt James River Bridge each restored some accessibility and through traffic to the downtown area . 
 Much of the newer commercial development has been along the Warwick Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue corridors , with newer planned industrial , commercial , and mixed development such as Oyster Point , Kiln Creek and the City Center . While the downtown area had long been the area of the city that offered the traditional urban layout , the city has supported a number of New Urbanism projects . One is Port Warwick , named after the fictional city in William Styron 's novel , Lie Down in Darkness . Port Warwick includes housing for a broad variety of citizens , from retired persons to off @-@ campus housing for Christopher Newport University students . Also included are several high @-@ end restaurants and upscale shopping . 
 City Center at Oyster Point , located near Port Warwick , has been touted as the new " downtown " because of its new geographic centrality on the Virginia Peninsula , its proximity to the retail / business nucleus of the city , etc . Locally , it is often called simply " City Center " . Nearby , the Virginia Living Museum recently completed a $ 22 @.@ 6 million expansion plan . 
 Newport News is also home to a small Korean ethnic enclave on Warwick Boulevard near the Denbigh neighborhood on the northern end of the city . Although it lacks the density and character of larger , more established enclaves , it has been referred to as " Little Seoul " — being the commercial center for the Hampton Roads Korean community .

 = South African War Memorial ( South Australia ) = 
 The South African War Memorial ( also known as the Boer War Memorial or , prior to 1931 , the National War Memorial ) is an equestrian memorial dedicated to the South Australians who served in the Second Boer War of 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902 . It was the first war in which South Australians fought , and 1531 men were sent in nine contingents , with over 1500 horses to accompany them . Over 59 South Australians died in the war . 
 The memorial is located in front of the main entrance to Government House , one of the most prominent buildings in Adelaide , on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street . It was constructed with a budget of £ 2500 raised through public donations , and was designed by the London @-@ based sculptor Adrian Jones . While the statue itself was not intended to represent any particular soldier , there is evidence suggesting that the head of the rider was based on that of George Henry Goodall . 
 The statue was unveiled by the Governor of South Australia , George Le Hunte , on 6 June 1904 . It has since become one of the focal points for the Anzac day marches , as well as being regarded as one of the most " eye @-@ catching " and significant statues in the city . As such , it was added to the national heritage listing in 1990 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1899 , the Orange Free State and Transvaal declared war on Britain . South Australia , " fiercely " loyal to the British Empire and still " two years away from federation " , joined the other Australian colonies in sending troops to support the Empire in the conflict . With the support of Adelaide 's newspapers , nine contingents of South Australian troops were sent to the war during the three years of hostilities , totaling 1531 men and 1507 horses . Funding for the endeavor was garnered through the State and Imperial Governments in combination with funds raised through public subscriptions . In addition to the formal contingent , a number of Australians served as colonial troops , either having paid their way to Southern Africa after the conflict had begun or having already been present in the region prior to the outbreak of hostilities . By the time hostilities ended on 31 May 1902 , at least 59 South Australians had been killed in the war . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 A committee to build a memorial to those who served and died in the Second Boer War was formed shortly after the war was ended , spurred by a suggestion in July 1901 by J. Johnson to erect an equestrian statue . Chaired by George Brookman , the committee rapidly raised £ 2500 from public donations . With the assistance of the Agent @-@ General , Henry A Grainger , a subcommittee consisting of members who were present in London at the time was engaged to find a sculptor who would be able to provide the statue that they desired . The original intent of the committee was to purchase a secondhand statue and to make alterations to suit . Nevertheless , the Agent @-@ General recommended Captain Adrian Jones , a veterinarian , military officer and sculptor who had an " affinity for animals " , and who had previously worked on equestrian projects . Jones made two offers to the committee : the first was to construct a replica of a work that he had entered into a South African competition , on the condition that it would be cast only if the original was accepted ; while the second was to model a smaller work based on a sketch he had produced . The second option he priced at £ 1600 , arguing that the reduced cost was acceptable as it would allow him to keep his staff in employment until the larger South African commission was finalized . The committee were quite taken by his sketch , agreeing to the second option and looking no further . 
 Finding that he needed advice in regard to accouterments and the attitude of Australian soldiers , Jones made inquiries about consulting with an Australian . George Henry Goodall , a South Australian veteran of the Second Boer War , was at the time serving as Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant with the Australian Corps engaged in London at the coronation ceremonies for King Edward VII . Goodall was " volunteered " to attend Jones in order to model and to provide advice . Goodall later described how Jones had requested that he pose while the sculptor created a clay model of his head , but Simon Cameron observed that Jones 's memoirs " do not mention any sittings . " Nevertheless , a 1940 memorandum , based on a conversation with Goodall , noted that " a comparison of a photograph of Mr Goodall , taken in 1902 with the statue itself certainly indicates a strong facial likeness " . In the same memorandum it was noted that Goodall only posed for the head , and that he insisted that his selection to model for the statue was not based on any outstanding merit as a soldier . 
 With the choice of statues settled , a competition was run in Adelaide in 1903 to find the design for the pedestal . A total of 12 entries were received , with the submission by Garlick , Sibley and Wooldridge being selected as the winner . The pedestal is 12 feet in height , and was constructed from granite quarried from the nearby town of Murray Bridge . 
 The bronze plaques which are mounted on the sides of the pedestal list the names of 59 South Australians who died in the conflict , and were cast from gun plates by A. W. Dobbie and Company . ( A. W. Dobbie and Company were later responsible for the bronze castings on the South Australian National War Memorial to those who served in World War I ) . A further 16 South Australians died in relation to the Boer War , while an additional four died either during training or upon their return . Also missing from the list is Harry " Breaker " Morant , who had served in the second contingent of troops to be sent from South Australia , and was executed by the British after being found guilty by court martial of the murder of unarmed Boer troops . There was no controversy at the time in regard to his omission , although the decision not to include his companion Peter <unk> ( who was executed alongside Morant ) on the Bathurst , New South Wales , memorial was more problematic , and was rescinded in 1964 . 
 The memorial is located in front of Government House on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street , one of the busiest corners in the city . 
 = = Unveiling = = 
 The memorial was unveiled on 6 June 1904 . This date was significant both as the birthday of the then Prince of Wales , George V , and the third anniversary of the Battle of <unk> , ( in which South Australian soldiers had served ) . A large crowd gathered to view the unveiling , and the speakers included the chair of the memorial committee , George Brookman , and George Le Hunte , the Governor of South Australia . The memorial itself was shrouded by canvas and the Union Jack , which fell away to reveal the statue underneath . 
 At the time of the unveiling the memorial was referred to as the South Australian " National War Memorial " , but the name was later changed to the South African War Memorial after the 1931 completion of a new memorial on the corner of Kintore Avenue and North Terrace , which was built to remember those who served in the first World War . 
 When it was unveiled , the South African War Memorial was one of only two public equestrian sculptures in the country ( the other being a depiction of Saint George and the Dragon at the National Gallery of Victoria ) , and the only commemorative equestrian work . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The memorial has been well received from the outset . When shown sketches the design , one of the Adelaide contingent described it as " spirited " – a word that was echoed by King Edward VII upon being shown a photograph of the model that was produced . When the completed statue arrived in Adelaide in 1904 , the committee was reportedly delighted , and many in Australia viewed it as the best statue in the country . 
 In more recent times , Ken Inglis has described the work as the " apotheosis " of the bushman soldier , representing the bushman and the horse at war ( the " Australian centaur " ) , and noted that it was possible to view the memorial as commemorating " dead horses as well as dead men " . Simon Cameron , in his work " Silent Witness : Adelaide 's statues and monuments " , described the memorial as the most eye @-@ catching statue in Adelaide , a view that was echoed by Chris Brice in 1999 . More generally , the memorial is regarded as one of " Adelaide 's most significant statues " . The statue received national heritage listing in 1990 , having been described both as a " significant landmark " and an " important piece of public sculpture of its period . "

The route for the march starts at the National War Memorial , heads west along North Terrace , and turns right down King William Road before culminating in a service at the Cross of Sacrifice ( in the Adelaide Park Lands opposite the St Peter 's Cathedral ) . As the marchers turn on to King William Road they salute the South African War Memorial . 
 As part of the State of South Australia 's <unk> @-@ <unk> in 1986 , referred to locally as " Jubilee 150 " , a " Jubilee 150 Walkway " was created along the north side of North Terrace , commencing at the memorial . 
 The memorial 's location on a busy street corner has caused it to deteriorate , resulting in at least two recent clean @-@ up and restoration projects . The first involved a clean @-@ up of the granite base , while the second involved more extensive restoration , and was completed in April , 2007 at a cost of $ 90 @,@ 000 . 
 A commemoration ceremony for the memorial was to be held on the 100th Anniversary of its dedication , 6 June 2004 , with the Governor Marjorie Jackson @-@ Nelson in attendance . 
 In recent years there has been talk of building a replica of the memorial . On 31 May 2008 on ANZAC Parade , Canberra , the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held . A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date , and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial . In the design brief for the memorial , the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide 's : going so far as to say that they would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced . 
 = Maximilian Kolbe = 
 Maximilian Maria Kolbe , <unk> Conv . ( Polish : Maksymilian Maria Kolbe [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 8 January 1894 – 14 August 1941 ) was a Polish Conventual Franciscan friar , who volunteered to die in place of a stranger in the German death camp of Auschwitz , located in German @-@ occupied Poland during World War II . He was active in promoting the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin Mary , founding and supervising the monastery of Niepokalanów near Warsaw , operating a radio station , and founding or running several other organizations and publications . 
 Kolbe was canonized on 10 October 1982 by Pope John Paul II , and declared a martyr of charity . He is the patron saint of drug addicts , political prisoners , families , journalists , prisoners , and the pro @-@ life movement . John Paul II declared him " The Patron Saint of Our Difficult Century " . 
 Due to Kolbe 's efforts to promote consecration and entrustment to Mary , he is known as the Apostle of Consecration to Mary . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Raymund Kolbe was born on 8 January 1894 in <unk> Wola , in the Kingdom of Poland , which was a part of the Russian Empire , the second son of weaver Julius Kolbe and midwife Maria Dąbrowska . His father was an ethnic German and his mother was Polish . He had four brothers . Shortly after his birth , his family moved to <unk> . 
 Kolbe 's life was strongly influenced in 1906 by a childhood vision of the Virgin Mary . He later described this incident : 
 That night I asked the Mother of God what was to become of me . Then she came to me holding two crowns , one white , the other red . She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns . The white one meant that I should persevere in purity , and the red that I should become a martyr . I said that I would accept them both . 
 = = = Franciscan friar = = = 
 In 1907 , Kolbe and his elder brother Francis joined the Conventual Franciscans . They enrolled at the Conventual Franciscan minor seminary in Lwow later that year . In 1910 , Kolbe was allowed to enter the novitiate , where he was given the religious name Maximilian . He professed his first vows in 1911 , and final vows in 1914 , adopting the additional name of Maria ( Mary ) . 
 Kolbe was sent to Rome in 1912 , where he attended the Pontifical Gregorian University . He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1915 there . From 1915 he continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1919 or 1922 ( sources vary ) . He was active in the consecration and entrustment to Mary . During his time as a student , he witnessed vehement demonstrations against Popes St. Pius X and Benedict XV in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the Freemasons . According to Kolbe , 
 They placed the black standard of the " Giordano <unk> " under the windows of the Vatican . On this standard the archangel , St. Michael , was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer . At the same time , countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father ( i.e. , the Pope ) was attacked shamefully . 
 Soon afterward , Kolbe organized the Militia Immaculata ( Army of the Immaculate One ) , to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church , specifically the Freemasons , through the intercession of the Virgin Mary . So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer : 
 O Mary , conceived without sin , pray for us who have recourse to thee . And for all those who do not have recourse to thee ; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee . 
 In 1918 , Kolbe was ordained a priest . In July 1919 he returned to the newly independent Poland , where he was active in promoting the veneration of the Immaculate Virgin Mary . He was strongly opposed to leftist – in particular , communist – movements . From 1919 to 1922 he taught at the Kraków seminary . Around that time , as well as earlier in Rome , he suffered from tuberculosis , which forced him to take a lengthy leave of absence from his teaching duties . In January 1922 he founded the monthly periodical <unk> <unk> ( Knight of the Immaculate ) , a devotional publication based on French Le Messager du Coeur de Jesus ( Messenger of the Heart of Jesus ) . From 1922 to 1926 he operated a religious publishing press in Grodno . As his activities grew in scope , in 1927 he founded a new Conventual Franciscan monastery at Niepokalanów near Warsaw , which became a major religious publishing center . A junior seminary was opened there two years later . 
 Between 1930 and 1936 , Kolbe undertook a series of missions to East Asia . At first , he arrived in Shanghai , China , but failed to gather a following there . Next , he moved to Japan , where by 1931 he founded a monastery at the outskirts of Nagasaki ( it later gained a novitiate and a seminary ) and started publishing a Japanese edition of the Knight of the Immaculate ( <unk> no Kishi ) . The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan . Kolbe built the monastery on a mountainside that , according to Shinto beliefs , was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature . When the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki , Kolbe 's monastery was saved because the other side of the mountain took the main force of the blast . In mid @-@ 1932 he left Japan for Malabar , India , where he founded another monastery ; this one however closed after a while . Meanwhile , the monastery at Niepokalanów began in his absence to publish the daily newspaper , <unk> <unk> ( The Little Daily ) , in alliance with the political group , the National Radical Camp ( Obóz <unk> <unk> ) . This publication reached a circulation of 137 @,@ 000 , and nearly double that , 225 @,@ 000 , on weekends . 
 Poor health forced Kolbe to return to Poland in 1936 . Two years later , in 1938 , he started a radio station at Niepokalanów , the Radio Niepokalanów . He held an amateur radio licence , with the call sign <unk> . 
 = = = Death at Auschwitz = = = 
 After the outbreak of World War II , which started with the invasion of Poland by Germany , Kolbe was one of the few brothers who remained in the monastery , where he organized a temporary hospital . After the town was captured by the Germans , he was briefly arrested by them on 19 September but released on 8 December . He refused to sign the Deutsche Volksliste , which would have given him rights similar to those of German citizens in exchange for recognizing his German ancestry . Upon his release he continued work at his monastery , where he and other monks provided shelter to refugees from Greater Poland , including 2 @,@ 000 Jews whom he hid from German persecution in their friary in Niepokalanów . Kolbe also received permission to continue publishing religious works , though significantly reduced in scope . The monastery thus continued to act as a publishing house , issuing a number of anti @-@ Nazi German publications . On 17 February 1941 , the monastery was shut down by the German authorities . That day Kolbe and four others were arrested by the German Gestapo and imprisoned in the Pawiak prison . On 28 May , he was transferred to Auschwitz as prisoner # <unk> . 
 Continuing to act as a priest , Kolbe was subjected to violent harassment , including beating and lashings , and once had to be smuggled to a prison hospital by friendly inmates . At the end of July 1941 , three prisoners disappeared from the camp , prompting SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer Karl Fritzsch , the deputy camp commander , to pick 10 men to be starved to death in an underground bunker to deter further escape attempts . When one of the selected men , Franciszek <unk> , cried out , " My wife ! My children ! " , Kolbe volunteered to take his place . 
 According to an eye witness , an assistant janitor at that time , in his prison cell , Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer to Our Lady . Each time the guards checked on him , he was standing or kneeling in the middle of the cell and looking calmly at those who entered . After two weeks of dehydration and starvation , only Kolbe remained alive . “ The guards wanted the bunker emptied , so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of carbolic acid . Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection . His remains were cremated on 15 August , the feast day of the Assumption of Mary . 
 = = Canonization = = 
 On 12 May 1955 , Kolbe was recognized as the Servant of God . Kolbe was declared venerable by Pope Paul VI on 30 January 1969 , beatified as a Confessor of the Faith by the same Pope in 1971 and canonized as a saint by Pope John Paul II on 10 October 1982 . Upon canonization , the Pope declared St. Maximilian Kolbe not a confessor , but a martyr . The miracle which was used to confirm his beatification was the July 1948 cure of intestinal tuberculosis in Angela <unk> , and in August 1950 , the cure of calcification of the arteries / sclerosis of Francis Ranier was attributed to Kolbe 's intercession . 
 After his canonization , St. Maximilian Kolbe 's feast day was added to the General Roman Calendar . He is one of ten 20th @-@ century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey , London . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 Kolbe 's recognition as a Christian martyr also created some controversy within the Catholic Church . While his ultimate self @-@ sacrifice of his life was most certainly saintly and heroic , he was not killed strictly speaking out of odium fidei ( hatred of the faith ) , but as the result of an act of Christian charity . Pope Paul VI himself had recognized this distinction at his beatification by naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title " martyr of charity " . Pope John Paul II , however , when deciding to canonize him , overruled the commission he had established ( which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity ) , wishing to make the point that the systematic hatred of ( whole categories of ) humanity propagated by the Nazi regime was in itself inherently an act of hatred of religious ( Christian ) faith , meaning Kolbe 's death equated to martyrdom . 
 Kolbe has also been accused of antisemitism based on the content of newspapers he was involved with , as they printed articles about topics such as a Zionist plot for world domination . Slovenian sociologist Slavoj Žižek criticized Kolbe 's activities as " writing and organizing mass propaganda for the Catholic Church , with a clear anti @-@ Semitic and anti @-@ Masonic edge . " However , a number of writers pointed out that the " Jewish question played a very minor role in Kolbe 's thought and work " . On those grounds allegations of Kolbe 's antisemitism have been denounced by Holocaust scholars Daniel L. Schlafly , Jr. and Warren Green , among others . 
 During World War II Kolbe 's monastery at Niepokalanów sheltered Jewish refugees , and , according to a testimony of a local : " When Jews came to me asking for a piece of bread , I asked Father Maximilian if I could give it to them in good conscience , and he answered me , ' Yes , it is necessary to do this , because all men are our brothers . ' " 
 Nonetheless Kolbe has been " often vilified in Jewish literature as an avowed anti @-@ Semite " , despite " hundreds of testimonials of gratitude for the assistance ... several from the survivors of the Polish Jewish community " . Kolbe 's alleged antisemitism was a source of the controversy in the 1980s in the aftermath of his canonization . Kolbe is not recognized as Righteous Among the Nations . 
 = = = Relics = = = 
 First @-@ class relics of Kolbe exist , in the form of hairs from his head and beard , preserved without his knowledge by two friars at Niepokalanów who served as barbers in his friary between 1930 and 1941 . Since his beatification in 1971 , more than 1 @,@ 000 such relics have been distributed around the world for public veneration . Second @-@ class relics such as his personal effects , clothing and liturgical vestments , are preserved in his monastery cell and in a chapel at Niepokalanów , and may be viewed by visitors . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Kolbe 's influence has found fertile ground in his own Order of Conventual Franciscan friars , in the form of continued existence of the Militia <unk> movement . In recent years new religious and secular institutes have been founded , inspired from this spiritual way . Among these the Missionaries of the Immaculate Mary – Father Kolbe , the Franciscan Friars of Mary Immaculate , and a parallel congregation of Religious Sisters , and others . The Franciscan Friars of Mary Immaculate are even taught basic Polish so they can sing the traditional hymns sung by Kolbe , in the saint 's native tongue . According to the friars , 
 Our patron , St. Maximilian Kolbe , inspires us with his unique Mariology and apostolic mission , which is to bring all souls to the Sacred Heart of Christ through the Immaculate Heart of Mary , Christ 's most pure , efficient , and holy instrument of evangelization – especially those most estranged from the Church . 
 Kolbe 's views into Marian theology echo today through their influence on Vatican II . His image may be found in churches across Europe . Several churches in Poland are under his patronage , such as the Sanctuary of Saint Maxymilian in <unk> Wola or the Church of Saint Maxymilian Kolbe in Szczecin . A museum , Museum of St. Maximilian Kolbe " There was a Man " , was opened in Niepokalanów in 1998 . 
 In 1963 Rolf Hochhuth published a play significantly influenced by Kolbe 's life and dedicated to him , The Deputy . In 2000 , the National Conference of Catholic Bishops ( U.S. ) designated <unk> , home to a community of Conventual Franciscan friars , as the National Shrine of St. Maximilian Kolbe . <unk> is located in Libertyville , Illinois , and also features the Kolbe Holocaust Exhibit . The Polish Senate declared the year 2011 to be the year of Maximilian Kolbe .

 = Carletonomys = 
 Carletonomys cailoi is an extinct rodent from the Pleistocene of Buenos Aires Province , Argentina . Although known only from a single maxilla ( upper jaw ) with the first molar , its features are so distinctive that it is placed in its own genus , Carletonomys . Discovered in 1998 and formally described in 2008 , it is part of a well @-@ defined group of oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus , Noronhomys , Lundomys , and Pseudoryzomys . This group is characterized by progressive semiaquatic specializations and a reduction in the complexity of molar morphology . 
 The single known molar is high @-@ crowned ( hypsodont ) and flat @-@ crowned ( planar ) and is distinctive in lacking the ridge that connects the front to the middle part of the molar , the anterior mure , and in the configuration of another ridge , the mesoloph . Carletonomys was probably herbivorous and lived in a wet habitat . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Carletonomys cailoi was discovered in 1998 in a silt deposit in San Cayetano Partido , southeastern Buenos Aires Province . The stratigraphic context suggests this locality is slightly over 1 million years old ( <unk> South American Land Mammal Age ) , making Carletonomys the oldest known oryzomyine . The single known specimen is now in the collections of the Museo de La Plata . It was initially referred to the genus Noronhomys , which is currently known only from the island of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil , but in 2008 Argentinean mammalogist Ulyses Pardiñas established it as the holotype of a new genus and species of rodent in a publication in the Journal of Mammalogy . The generic name , Carletonomys , combines the name of American mammalogist Michael Carleton with the Ancient Greek μυς mys " mouse " and the specific name , cailoi , honors Argentinean biologist Carlos " <unk> " Galliari . 
 The fossil has a number of features that suggest a relation to a group of oryzomyine rodents that includes the South American marsh rat Holochilus , its living relatives Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys , and the extinct Noronhomys and Holochilus primigenus . They share high @-@ crowned ( hypsodont ) molars and several simplifications of molar morphology , as well as other features that cannot be assessed in Carletonomys , which indicate specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle . It shows the most similarity to Noronhomys and Holochilus , so much so that Pardiñas considered placing it in either of these two genera , but its distinctive morphological features justify placement in a separate genus . 
 This group of genera encompasses only a small part of the diversity of the tribe Oryzomyini , a group of over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America , including nearby islands such as the Galápagos Islands and some of the Antilles . Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae , which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America . Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae , other members of which include voles , lemmings , hamsters , and deermice , all mainly from Eurasia and North America . 
 = = Description = = 
 The holotype is a right maxilla ( upper jaw ) with the upper first molar ( M1 ) in it . It is broken off behind the M1 , but much of the front part is preserved , including the zygomatic plate , the flattened front portion of the zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) . The M1 is moderately worn , indicating that it is from an adult individual . With an M1 length of 3 @.@ 59 mm and width of 2 @.@ 53 mm , C. cailoi was one of the largest oryzomyines known , rivaled only by Lundomys and the extinct Antillean Megalomys and " Ekbletomys " . The height of the M1 is 1 @.@ 37 mm and it has four roots , including a large one in front , another large one on the inner ( lingual ) side , and two smaller ones on the outer ( labial ) side . The presence of a second labial root is a variable character among oryzomyines , occurring among others in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys but not in Lundomys . The maxilla itself shows few significant characters . The back margin of the incisive foramen , which perforates the palate between the upper incisors and the molars , is not visible , suggesting that the foramen was short , as in Holochilus . The configuration of the zygomatic plate shows features that distinguish C. cailoi from some of its relatives . 
 The molar is plane and hypsodont : the crowns are relatively high and the main cusps are about as high as the other parts of the crown , as they are in Holochilus . Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars , in which the crowns are lower and the cusps are higher than the rest of the crown . As in closely related species , the front part of the molar is relatively simple , lacking an anteroloph , an additional ridge that is well @-@ developed in most oryzomyines . A shallow anteromedian flexus is present , superficially dividing the front cusp ( anterocone ) . Uniquely , the anterior mure , which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown , is absent ; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines , it usually develops as a result of wear in adults . The two cusps on the middle part of the molar , the paracone and the protocone , are broadly connected . The median mure , which connects the middle to the back pair of cusps , is attached to the back of the paracone . A complete mesoloph is present , descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone . The configuration of the paracone – median mure – mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys . The two posterior cusps , the hypocone and the metacone , are connected at the back margin of the molar . Unlike in most oryzomyines , no <unk> is present , so that the metacone is situated directly at the back margin . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Carletonomys was found in association with remains of several other animals , including fishes , <unk> turtles , frogs , birds , armadillos , and several rodents , including Reithrodon auritus , the coypu ( <unk> ) , both of which still live in the area , the extinct <unk> <unk> , and unidentified <unk> and <unk> . C. cailoi probably lived in a wetland habitat under relatively warm and moist climatic conditions . Although the limited material known permits few inferences as to the animal 's natural history , it likely fed on hard plant material , as do related , morphologically similar extant species . 
 = Codename : Gordon = 
 Codename : Gordon ( also known as Half @-@ Life 2D ) is a 2D side @-@ scrolling shooter video game made by Paul " X @-@ Tender " Kamma and Sönke " Warbeast " Seidel . The game was produced on behalf of Nuclearvision Entertainment , and was distributed free of charge over Valve Corporation 's Steam online delivery system as a promotional title for the then @-@ upcoming Half @-@ Life 2 . The game has since been removed from Steam 's storefront due to factors related to the developer 's bankruptcy . 
 The game started off as a fan project of Paul Kamma and Sönke Seidel , the concept being inspired by various Half @-@ Life 2 advertisements . Soon after , the two started working on Codename : Gordon on behalf of Nuclearvision Entertainment . The company also presented the game to Valve , the developer team of the original Half @-@ Life series , who later distributed the game through Steam . 
 Codename : Gordon has been overall well received by both reviewers , and the public , the game attracting over 600 @,@ 000 players in the first three weeks after its release . Reviewers appreciated the game for its gameplay and unique dialog style , but also criticized it for its improper optimization , and lack of opponent variety . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Codename : Gordon presents an alternative to the storyline of Half @-@ Life 2 , with locations inspired by both Half @-@ Life and Half @-@ Life 2 . Along the way , Gordon Freeman — the protagonist from the canon games — meets with some of the main characters of the Half @-@ Life series and tries to find what caused the disappearance of the third dimension . 
 The game starts with Gordon Freeman in a dock area . After making his way through a few zombies and headcrabs , Gordon meets with Barney Calhoun , a prominent character in the later Half @-@ Life titles . He tells Gordon of an " entire dimension " missing and also notes that the science team is working on solving the problem . Being injured , Barney cannot leave the place , so he gives Gordon his pistol , telling him to leave without him . 
 In the second chapter , the player meets with Eli Vance and his daughter Alyx who tell Gordon to take their car , which will help him reach City 17 , as seemingly it is the center of the problem . They also tell him to talk to Dr. Kleiner , about his new invention , the gravity gun . Soon after , the player finds Dr. Kleiner , who tells Gordon about his worries regarding the missing dimension and also gives him the gravity gun mentioned by Eli and Alyx . 
 After being attacked by an alien gunship and getting past a prison heavily guarded by Combine soldiers , Gordon manages to reach City 17 , where he finds the G @-@ Man . He tells the player he has been expecting him and claims to not be behind the situation regarding the missing dimension , instead he says he is but a " lowly pawn in a shady game being played by sinister powers " . Soon after , Gordon confronts a strider — a large tripod assault unit — which turns out to be the source of the problem , as upon defeating it a portal is opened ; stepping into this portal , Gordon is sent back to the third dimension . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Just as in Half @-@ Life 2 , the player takes control of Gordon Freeman . However , unlike the other games in the Half @-@ Life series , Codename : Gordon is set in a two @-@ dimensional world . The sidescroller shooter game offers the player the ability to control Gordon by using the keyboard for movement , and the mouse for aiming and firing weapons . 
 Armed with various weapons , including the trademark crowbar , and the gravity gun introduced by Half @-@ Life 2 , the player makes their way around six levels encountering enemies such as zombies , headcrabs , and the Combine . Similarly to the main titles in the Half @-@ Life series , the action sequences of the gameplay are broken up by various puzzles . 
 Along the way the player meets with some of the key characters of the main series , who communicate with Gordon through text dialog , as the game does not feature voice acting . Unlike the core games of the Half @-@ Life series , in Codename : Gordon the player is able to participate interactively in the dialog , by using emoticons , such as : ] , : - ) , each associated with a different type of answer . 
 Upon finishing Codename : Gordon , a new bonus game is unlocked , called " Crow Chase " , in which the player has to try and gather as many points as possible , within a given time limit , by chasing crows , in an attempt to keep them in the air for as long as possible . 
 = = Production and publication = = 
 Development on Codename : Gordon began in mid @-@ 2003 . The game started as a fan project of Paul " X @-@ Tender " Kamma , responsible for the software coding , and Sönke " Warbeast " Seidel , responsible for the game graphics . The game was created using Macromedia Flash , the reason for this choice being the developers ' familiarity with the software . The initial intention was to create a platform game , the setting only being decided upon after noticing various pre @-@ release advertisements of Valve 's Half @-@ Life 2 video game . Soon after the project 's initiation the game was noticed by Tim Bruns , co @-@ founder of Nuclearvision Entertainment , whose company then started working on Codename : Gordon together with Kamma and Seidel . 
 Originally the game was planned to be released for the Nintendo DS portable console ; this decision has been changed only after Nuclearvision Entertainment had contact with Valve Corporation . Being positive about the game , the producers of the Half @-@ Life series begun offering aid in the development of Codename : Gordon , Doug Wood overseeing the project on behalf of Valve . The game was released on 17 May 2004 , and was distributed freely on Valve 's Steam online delivery system , as a form of publicity for the , at that time , upcoming Half @-@ Life 2 . As stated by Gabe Newell , the game was originally supposed to be released on 1 April as an April Fools ' Day joke , with Codename : Gordon supposedly being Valve 's Half @-@ Life 2 . 
 Originally we were going to release it on April 1st . I even wrote a fake press release that went something like , ' Due to tremendous pressure from the gaming community to ship Half @-@ Life 2 , we looked long and hard at the game to see if there was anything we could cut that would let us ship sooner . It looked like if we cut the third dimension , we 'd be all set , so after five years in development , Valve and Nuclearvision proudly present Half @-@ Life 2D . ' Fortunately <unk> minds prevailed . 
 Codename : Gordon was initially meant to receive several updates , including a second bonus game which could be unlocked after finishing the game , however Paul Kamma announced that the update was eventually canceled . The game was eventually removed from the Steam storefront in February 2008 following the liquidation of developer Nuclearvision Entertainment . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game received much attention from the community , even before its release to the public ; as noted by Tim Bruns , art director of Nuclearvision Entertainment , the game attracted over 600 @,@ 000 players in the first three weeks of its release . Bruns declared himself surprised by this number , and said that " the ability to reach this many gamers almost overnight is amazing " . 
 Codename : Gordon has received overall good reviews from game critics . Home of the Underdogs , described it as being " one of the best fangames " . The game has also been widely appreciated for its inclusion of the gravity gun , Gameplanet saying that it " works as advertised , and is indeed , pretty [ cool ] " , 
 However the game has received negative feedback as well . Home of the Underdogs complained about the game 's high system requirements , considering its complexity , a 1 @.@ 6 GHz processor or higher being necessary in order to play . The game has also been criticized for its lack of opponent variety , and simple but awkward control scheme , as well as its lack of a save function . 
 = = Removal from Steam = = 
 The game was taken off of the Steam Store because of issues with the website banner built into the game . The original developers ( due to their bankruptcy ) allowed the domain to expire , and it was purchased for advertising use . This led to the site containing links to pornographic content and viruses . The game is still obtainable through Steam through the obscure method of entering steam : / / install / 92 in a web browser 's address field after installing the Steam client or by enabling the steam developer console and typing " app _ install 92 " .

 The Smith @-@ Harris House , listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Thomas Avery House , is a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half story clapboarded Greek Revival home on Society Road in East Lyme , Connecticut . It is believed that the farmhouse was built in 1845 @-@ 1846 as a wedding gift for Thomas Avery and Elizabeth Griswold . It remained in the Avery family until 1877 when it was purchased by William H. Smith . By the 1890s , the farm was managed by Smith 's younger brother , Herman W. Smith and nephew , Frank A. Harris . In 1900 , the two married Lula and Florence Munger , sisters , and both resided in the house . In 1955 , the house was sold to the Town of East Lyme and the sisters continued to live in the house until requiring a nursing home . The house was saved from demolition by citizens and restored . It opened on July 3 , 1976 , as a historic house museum , operated and maintained by the Smith @-@ Harris House Commission and the Friends of Smith @-@ Harris House . It is open from June through August and throughout the year by appointment . The Smith @-@ Harris house was added to the National Historic Register of Places on August 22 , 1979 .

 The Smith @-@ Harris House is believed to have been preceded by another dwelling that was used in the original construction . The Avery family was originally in the area from at least 1751 and the property and the surrounding farm was consolidated under Jonathan Avery 's son , Abraham Avery . It is believed , through a newspaper discovered in the wall and other records that the house was built in 1845 @-@ 1846 as a wedding gift for Thomas Avery and Elizabeth Griswold . The house remained in the Avery family until 1877 when it was sold to William H. Smith . 
 By the 1890s , the farm was managed by Smith 's younger brother , Herman W. Smith and nephew , Frank A. Harris . In 1900 , the two married Lula and Florence Munger , sisters , and both resided in the house . William H. Smith deeded the house to his brother and nephew in 1921 . Smith died in 1951 and his widow and Frank Harris , shortly before his death , sold the house and the 103 acres ( 41 @.@ 6 hectare ) of land to the Town of East Lyme for $ 34 @,@ 000 . The two widows continued to live in the house until they went to a nursing home . The land served as a farm under the Avery family including a dairy and cattle farm ; the dairy farm would continue to operate under the Harris family . Portions of the land were later used for the construction of Interstate 95 and two East Lyme schools . The two schools are the East Lyme Junior High School ( East Lyme Middle School ) and Lillie B. Haines Elementary School .

 " Valley Girls " doubles as both a Gossip Girl episode and the pilot episode of Valley Girls , a possible Gossip Girl prequel . The spin @-@ off television series would chronicle the life of Lily Rhodes while attending high school and living with Carol in 1980s Los Angeles . 
 Discussion about a Gossip Girl spin @-@ off began in 2008 . Despite believing the project was " unlikely , " Gossip Girl executives explored potential concepts including an adaptation of the Gossip Girl book series ' spin @-@ off , The It Girl . However , they felt that The It Girl 's world , centered on character Jenny Humphrey 's stay at boarding school , was too small and insular to sustain a television series . They were also concerned about disrupting Gossip Girl 's chemistry by taking away any of the show 's cast members . In December 2009 , Variety magazine reported that while the " Gossip Girl spinoff [ was ] still in the very early stages of development " , CW had begun to consider making a backdoor pilot . Such a pilot would allow the company to evaluate viewer interest in a spin @-@ off while saving money . 
 On January 14 , 2009 , CW green @-@ lit a back @-@ door pilot for an untitled spin @-@ off series starring a young Lily van der Woodsen . The concept was based on an original idea by Gossip Girl producers Schwartz and Savage . The pilot episode , eventually named " Valley Girls " , was written by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz and directed by Mark Piznarski , all of whom had previously worked the same roles for the Gossip Girl pilot . " Valley Girls " was shot on location in New York City , New York and in Los Angeles , California beginning in February 2009 . Flashbacks were set apart from present day scenes through a grainy , sepia tone . A scene in which Lily conceives and carries out an " elaborate plan to kiss a boy , and then lie about it " in order to violate her school 's honor code and be expelled , was cut from the final episode . " Valley Girls " aired on May 11 , 2009 . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 On February 5 , 2009 , Krysten Ritter became the first guest star to be officially cast for the Valley Girls pilot . Brittany Snow was the producers ' top choice for young Lily Rhodes and was offered the role in early February 2009 without auditioning . Initially , the series ' producers wanted to cast an undiscovered star in the role while Snow was interested in continuing her film career . However , after viewing a reel featuring Snow 's work ranging from Hairspray to Nip / Tuck , Savage and Schwartz found her " perfect " and " pulled out all the stops " to convince her to come back to TV . Ryan Hansen had previously starred as " Douche " on Schwartz 's web series Rockville CA . Schwartz deemed Hansen 's performance there " so unlikable in such a likable way , that we cast him on the Gossip Girl spin @-@ off . " On March 6 , 2009 , Entertainment Weekly reported that Cynthia Watros and Andrew McCarthy were in final talks to join the show as Lily 's parents , thereby filling Valley Girls ' last starring roles .

 When asked what was being done to make modern day audiences comfortable with 1980s American culture , Schwartz replied , 
 If you never lived through that era — like most of our “ Gossip Girl ” audience didn ’ t — there is a fascination , like we were fascinated by the ’ 70s . My sense [ ... ] is that their connection to that era is via Michael Jackson , Madonna — those broader pop culture references . Fashion @-@ driven , especially . So there ’ s an appetite there , they want to go deeper into that era . [ ... ] In the same way New York is a character on “ Gossip Girl , ” the ’ 80s will be a character on Valley Girls " . 
 The producers worked to incorporate 1980s fashion into the show in a way that " felt fun , definitely , but also grounded in a reality where [ they ] could tell dramatic stories . " The styles featured were therefore constructed so that viewers would not be distracted from an emotional scene by characters wearing 1980s makeup , hairstyles , or shoulder pads . In addition , show makers wanted to make the series feel " like something that you 'd want to be a part of , rather than make fun of " , and that young women would be inspired by the clothing styles featured in the spin @-@ off as well as on Gossip Girl . During flashbacks in " Valley Girls " , Lily dresses in two styles of clothing . She appears in a preppy , upper @-@ crust riding outfit while associating with her rich parents , but changes into a dress more typical of the " underground punk @-@ rock scene " after running away to the San Fernando Valley . Snow describes her hairstyle as " a little teased , feathered like Farrah Fawcett with curly bangs like Brooke Shields . " In present @-@ day scenes , Blair and Serena both attend Prom in designer dresses ; Blair dons a black and gold gown from the Marchesa Spring 2008 collection , while Serena wears a pink halter dress from the Christian Dior Spring 2009 collection . Belinda Goldsmith of Reuters cited the episode 's Prom scene as an example of the media 's glamorization of U.S. formal dances , which she says has caused the cost of formal dances around the world to rise . 
 Songs featured within " Valley Girls " were taken from both the Los Angeles punk rock scene and mainstream 1980s hits in order to represent the two worlds surrounding character Lily Rhodes . " Jumping between these two worlds is important to the show . Lily is living with her sister in the Valley and kind of hanging out in the punk rock scene , but she and her sister come from a wealthy family and their parents are more aligned with a Pacific Palisades / Beverly Hills / Malibu , Less Than Zero world . So her struggle ... is to try and figure out what kind of world she wants to be in " , says Savage . Music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas oversaw music selection for the episode . With the exception of Fountains of Wayne 's " Prom Theme " ( 1999 ) , every song featured within " Valley Girls " was released prior to or in 1983 , the year in which Lily 's flashbacks take place . Savage explains that the show makers hoped to introduce modern audiences to bands and music they had not known before . No Doubt makes an uncredited guest appearance during the episode as a fictional band called " Snowed Out " , a play on words of " No Doubt " . During the cameo , part of the band 's return to music after a four @-@ year hiatus , No Doubt premiered their cover of Adam and the Ants ' " Stand and Deliver " , the band 's first new song in five years . The band performs in the Sunset Strip club where Lily meets Carol for the first time in a year .

 Rumors that the spin @-@ off would not be picked up as a series began well before the pilot premiered due to the limited number of spots available on CW 's fall line @-@ up . Seven CW series were renewed for another season , leaving three spots open for pick @-@ ups . " Valley Girls " competed against pilots for several other promising shows . On May 7 , Nikki Finke wrote on her blog , Deadline Hollywood , that despite enthusiasm of CW executives , " the show went from hot , to lukewarm , to ' fading but wouldn 't count out ' , to now dead , according to my insiders . " CW eventually chose to pick up Melrose Place , The Beautiful Life , and The Vampire Diaries . 
 However , on May 21 , 2009 , the day CW 's fall schedule was formally announced , CW President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff told reporters at a CW upfront that Valley Girls was still in contention for use as a midseason replacement . Said Ostroff , 
 " It was the toughest year we 've ever had , figuring out what to pick up , because [ our pilots ] were all really , really good . We do have room for another midseason show . We have some reality , and we 'll probably have another scripted drama . We 're just going to take a beat and see where we are . In all honesty , I think the Gossip Girl spinoff is the show that we would love to be able to find a place for as the season goes on . " 
 During a television press tour on August 4 , 2009 , when Ostroff was asked if the series would ever be green @-@ lit , she said , " Not right now . " She explained that she believed using " Valley Girls " episode as a backdoor pilot " instead of doing a full pilot " put the potential series at a disadvantage because " it was hard for everybody to understand what the world would be like on its own . " However , she stated that if Schwartz and Savage were interested in creating a different Gossip Girl spin @-@ off , CW would " of course [ ... ] be open to it . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Valley Girls " received generally positive comments from reviewers . TV Guide 's Jennifer Sankowski enjoyed the episode and believed the producers had captured all aspects of popular 1980s teen culture well , but that " at times it felt like they were trying too hard , throwing everything and anything ' 80s at us " such as a montage of 1980s outfits worn by Lily and mentions of MTV videos , fanny packs , Rubik 's Cube , and Jane Fonda workout videos . " At this rate , " said Sankowski , " they won 't have anything left to showcase . " Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly " loved " the episode and complimented the casting choices , but agrees with Sankowski in that " if this ends up being an actual series , they need to dial down the ' 80s references a tad . " Kona Gallagher of Cinema Blend said the premise was interesting and that " [ Valley Girls ] has the potential to be a strong spinoff , and [ she ] hope [ s ] that CW decides to pick it up this fall . " Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times writes that he " especially liked the moxie of Brittany Snow as young Lily and Krysten Ritter [ ... ] as her sister , Carol . And of course the retro soundtrack was a total trip . " A few review sites took issue with the episode 's script , such as BuddyTV , which claimed it was cliché , and Television Without Pity , which found it repetitive . While writing for The Frisky , Sara <unk> praised the clothing styles and called the overall episode " awesome fun ! [ ... ] weirdly sentimental , and sweet " . She also believed that the confrontation between the Valley dwellers and the rich attendees of Keith 's party was " clearly a giant , dance @-@ friendly metaphor for Reaganomics and the woes of a trickle @-@ down world . " Michelle Graham for Film School Rejects liked both the 1980s and present day scenes separately , but when put <unk> , " the overall effect was disjointed and showed it for what it was : an attempt to shove two shows together in order to save money on a proper pilot . " 
 " Valley Girls " was viewed live by a relatively small audience of 2 @.@ 31 million in the United States according to Nielsen Media Research . However , Schwartz notes that " Gossip Girl became the first show that indicated that the way people watch television is changing . You can go on iTunes , every episode is No. 1 , ahead of all these bigger shows . The streams are high , the DVR time @-@ shifting number was something like 40 % . There ’ s a much bigger audience for the show than the ( Nielsen ) numbers might indicate . " 
 = Frederick Browning = 
 Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Arthur Montague " Boy " Browning , GCVO , KBE , CB , DSO ( 20 December 1896 – 14 March 1965 ) was a senior officer of the British Army who has been called the " father of the British airborne forces " . He was the commander of I Airborne Corps and deputy commander of First Allied Airborne Army during Operation Market Garden in September 1944 . During the planning for this operation he memorably said : " I think we might be going a bridge too far . " He was also an Olympic bobsleigh competitor , and the husband of author Dame Daphne du Maurier . 
 Educated at Eton College and then at the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , Browning was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards in 1915 . During the First World War he fought on the Western Front , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 . In September 1918 , he became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson . After the war , he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in which his team finished tenth . He married Daphne du Maurier in July 1932 . 
 During the Second World War , Browning commanded the 1st Airborne Division and I Airborne Corps . He led the latter during Operation Market Garden , travelling by glider to participate in the assault . In December 1944 he became Chief of Staff of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten 's South East Asia Command . From September 1946 to January 1948 , he was Military Secretary of the War Office . 
 In January 1948 , Browning became Comptroller and Treasurer to Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth , Duchess of Edinburgh . After she ascended to the throne to become Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 , he became treasurer in the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh . He suffered a severe nervous breakdown in 1957 and retired in 1959 . He died at Menabilly , the mansion that inspired his wife 's novel Rebecca , on 14 March 1965 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Frederick Arthur Montague Browning was born on 20 December 1896 at his family home in Kensington , London . The house was later demolished to make way for an expansion of Harrods , allowing him to claim in later life that he had been born in its piano department . He was the first son of Frederick Henry Browning , a wine merchant , and his wife Nancy ( née Alt ) . He had one sibling , his older sister Helen Grace . From an early age he was known to his family as " Tommy " . He was educated at West Downs School and Eton College , which his grandfather had attended . While at Eton , he joined the Officer Training Corps . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Browning sat the entrance examinations for the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , on 24 November 1914 . Although he did not achieve the necessary scores in all the required subjects , the headmasters of some schools , including Eton , were in a position to recommend students for nomination by the Army Council . The head master of Eton , Edward Lyttelton , put Browning 's name forward and in this way he entered Sandhurst on 27 December 1914 . He graduated on 16 June 1915 , and was commissioned a second lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards . Joining such an exclusive regiment , even in wartime , required a personal introduction and an interview by the regimental commander , Colonel Sir Henry <unk> . 
 Initially , Browning joined the 4th Battalion , Grenadier Guards , which was training at Bovington Camp . When it departed for the Western Front in August 1915 , he was transferred to the 5th ( Reserve ) Battalion . In October 1915 he left to join the 2nd Battalion at the front . Around this time he acquired the nickname " Boy " . For a time he served in the same company of 2nd Battalion as Major Winston Churchill . Upon Churchill 's arrival , Browning was given the job of showing him the company 's trenches . When Browning discovered that Churchill had no greatcoat , Browning gave Churchill his own . Browning was invalided back to England with trench fever in January 1916 , and , although only hospitalised for four weeks , did not rejoin the 2nd Battalion at the front until 6 October 1916 . 
 Browning participated in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July , the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October and the Battle of Cambrai in November . He distinguished himself in this battle , for which he received the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . The order was generally given to officers in command , above the rank of captain . When a junior officer like Browning , who was still only a lieutenant , was awarded the DSO , this was often regarded as an acknowledgement that the officer had only just missed out on the award of the Victoria Cross . His citation read : 
 For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . He took command of three companies whose officers had all become casualties , reorganised them , and proceeded to consolidate . Exposing himself to very heavy machine @-@ gun and rifle fire , in two hours he had placed the front line in a strong state of defence . The conduct of this officer , both in the assault and more especially afterwards , was beyond all praise , and the successful handing over of the front to the relieving unit as an entrenched and strongly fortified position was entirely due to his energy and skill . 
 He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre on 14 December 1917 , and mentioned in despatches on 23 May 1918 . In September 1918 , Browning became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson , after which he returned to his regiment . He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain , and appointed adjutant of the 1st Battalion , Grenadier Guards , in November 1918 . 
 = = Inter @-@ war period = = 
 Browning was granted the substantive rank of captain on 24 November 1920 . He retained his post as adjutant until November 1921 , when he was posted to the Guards ' Depot in Caterham . In 1924 he was posted to Sandhurst as adjutant . He was the first adjutant , during the Sovereign 's Parade of 1926 , to ride his horse ( named " The Vicar " ) up the steps of Old College and to dismount in the Grand Entrance . There is no satisfactory explanation as to why he did it . After the Second World War this became an enduring tradition , but since horses have great difficulty going down steps , a ramp is now provided for the horse to return . Other members of staff at Sandhurst at the time included Richard O 'Connor , Miles Dempsey , Douglas Gracey , and Eric Dorman @-@ Smith , with whom he became close friends . Browning relinquished the appointment of adjutant at Sandhurst on 28 April 1928 , and was promoted to major on 22 May 1928 . Following a pattern whereby tours of duty away from the regiment alternated with those in it , he was sent for a refresher course at the Small Arms School before being posted to the 2nd Battalion , Grenadier Guards , at <unk> . 
 His workload was very light , allowing plenty of time for sports . Browning competed in the Amateur Athletic Association of England championships in hurdling but failed to make Olympic selection . He did however make the Olympic five @-@ man bobsleigh team as brake @-@ man . An injury incurred during a training accident prevented his participation in the bobsleigh at the 1924 Winter Olympics , but he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in which his team finished tenth . Browning was also a keen sailor , competing in the Household Cavalry Sailing Regatta at Chichester Harbour in 1930 . He purchased his own motor boat , a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) cabin cruiser that he named Ygdrasil . 
 In 1931 , Browning read Daphne du Maurier 's novel The Loving Spirit and , impressed by its graphic depictions of the Cornish coastline , set out to see it for himself in Ygdrasil . Afterwards , he left the boat moored in the River Fowey for the winter , but returned in April 1932 to collect it . He heard that the author of the book that had impressed him so much was convalescing from an appendix operation , and invited her out on his boat . After a short romance , he proposed to her but she rejected this , as she did not believe in marriage . Dorman @-@ Smith then went to see her and explained that their living together without marriage would be disastrous for Browning 's career . Du Maurier then proposed to Browning , who accepted . They were married in a simple ceremony at the Church of St Willow , <unk> @-@ by @-@ Fowey on 19 July 1932 , and honeymooned on Ygdrasil . Their marriage produced three children : two daughters , Tessa and Flavia , and a son , Christian , known as Kits . 
 Browning was promoted to lieutenant @-@ colonel on 1 February 1936 , and was appointed commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion , Grenadier Guards . The battalion was deployed to Egypt in 1936 and returned in December 1937 . His term as commander ended on 1 August 1939 ; he was removed from the Grenadier Guards ' regimental list but remained on full pay . On 1 September , he was promoted to colonel , with his seniority backdated to 1 February 1939 , and became Commandant of the Small Arms School .

 In mid @-@ May 1940 , Browning was given command of the 128th ( Hampshire ) Infantry Brigade ( consisting of three battalions of the Hampshire Regiment ) with the rank of brigadier . Part of the 43rd ( Wessex ) Infantry Division , the 128th Brigade was a Territorial Army brigade that was preparing to join the British Expeditionary Force in France . This was pre @-@ empted by the Fall of France in June 1940 , and the division assumed a defensive posture . In February 1941 , Browning became commander of the 24th Guards Brigade Group , whose mission was to defend London from an attack from the south . 
 On 3 November 1941 , Browning was promoted to major @-@ general , and appointed commander of the 1st Airborne Division . In this new role he was instrumental in parachutists adopting the maroon beret , and assigned an artist , Major Edward <unk> , to design the Parachute Regiment 's now famous emblem of the warrior Bellerophon riding Pegasus , the winged horse . However , Browning " designed his own uniform , made of <unk> with a false Uhlan @-@ style front , incorporating a zip opening at the neck to reveal regulation shirt and tie , worn with medal ribbons , collar patches , and rank badges , capped off with grey kid gloves , and a highly polished Guards Sam Browne belt and swagger stick " , all of which were worn in the field . He qualified as a pilot in 1942 , and henceforth wore the Army Air Corps wings , which he also designed himself . 
 Browning supervised the newly formed division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training , with new brigades raised and assigned to the division , and new equipment tested . Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary , he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry , and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles . As the airborne forces expanded in size , the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft . The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war , and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley . Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command 's resources . 
 When Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the United States Army Chief of Staff , General George C. Marshall , visited the 1st Airborne Division on 16 April 1942 , they were treated to a demonstration involving every available aircraft of No. 38 Wing RAF — 12 Whitleys and nine Hawker Hector biplanes towing General Aircraft Hotspur gliders . At a meeting on 6 May chaired by Churchill , Browning was asked what he required . He stated that he needed 96 aircraft to get the 1st Airborne Division battle @-@ ready . Churchill directed Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal to find the required aircraft , and Portal agreed to supply 83 Whitleys , along with 10 Halifax bombers to tow the new , larger General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders . 
 In July 1942 , Browning travelled to the United States , where he toured airborne training facilities with his American counterpart , Major General William C. Lee . Browning 's tendency to lecture the Americans on airborne warfare made him few friends among the Americans , who felt that the British were still novices themselves . Browning was envious of the Americans ' equipment , particularly the C @-@ 47 Dakota transports . On returning to the United Kingdom , he arranged for a joint exercise to be conducted with the 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry . In mid – September , as the 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength , Browning was informed that Operation Torch , the Allied invasion of North Africa , would take place in November . When he found that the 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry , was to take part , Browning argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised , as the vast distances and comparatively light opposition would provide opportunities for airborne operations . 
 The War Office and the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Home Forces , General Sir Bernard Paget , were won over by Browning 's arguments , and agreed to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion . After it had been brought to full operational strength , partly by cross @-@ posting personnel from the newly formed 2nd Parachute Brigade , and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources , the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November . 
 The results of British airborne operations in North Africa were mixed , and the subject of a detailed report by Browning . The airborne troops had operated under several handicaps , including shortages of photographs and maps . All the troop carrier aircrew were American , who lacked familiarity with airborne operations and in dealing with British troops and equipment . Browning felt that the inexperience with handling airborne operations extended to Eisenhower 's Allied Forces Headquarters ( AFHQ ) and that of the British First Army , resulting in the paratroops being misused . He felt that had they been employed more aggressively and in greater strength they might have shortened the Tunisia Campaign by some months . The 1st Parachute Brigade had been called the " Rote Teufel " or " Red Devils " by the German troops they had fought . Browning pointed out to the brigade that this was an honour , as " distinctions given by the enemy are seldom won in battle except by the finest fighting troops . " The title was officially confirmed by General Sir Harold Alexander and henceforth applied to all British airborne troops . 
 On 1 January 1943 , Browning was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath . He relinquished command of the 1st Airborne Division in March 1943 to take up a new post as major @-@ general , Airborne Forces at Eisenhower 's AFHQ . He soon clashed with the commander of the US 82nd Airborne Division , Major General Matthew Ridgway . When Browning asked to see the plans for Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of Sicily , Ridgway replied that they would not be available for scrutiny until after they had been approved by the U.S. Seventh Army commander , Lieutenant General George Patton . When Browning protested , Patton backed Ridgway , but Eisenhower and his chief of staff , Major General Walter Bedell Smith , supported Browning and forced them to back down . 
 Browning 's dealings with the British Army were no smoother . His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division , Major @-@ General George F. Hopkinson , had sold the commander of the British Eighth Army , General Sir Bernard Montgomery , on Operation Ladbroke , a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse . Browning 's objections to the operation were ignored , and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion had to go through him . Browning concluded that to be effective , the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders . 
 In September 1943 , Browning travelled to India , where he inspected the 50th Parachute Brigade , and met with Major @-@ General Orde Wingate , the commander of the Chindits , an airborne special force . Browning held a series of meetings with General Sir Claude Auchinleck , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , India ; Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse , the Air Officer Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief ; and Lieutenant @-@ General Sir George Giffard , the General Officer Commanding Eastern Army . They discussed plans for improving the airborne establishment in India and expanding the airborne force there to a division . As a result of these discussions , and Browning 's subsequent report to the War Office , the 44th Indian Airborne Division was formed in October 1944 . Browning sent his most experienced airborne commander , Major @-@ General Ernest Down , to India to command it . Down 's replacement as commander of the 1st Airborne Division by Montgomery 's selection , Major @-@ General Roy Urquhart , an officer with no airborne experience , rather than Browning 's choice , Brigadier Gerald Lathbury of the 1st Parachute Brigade , would become controversial . 
 Some saw him as " a ruthless and manipulative empire builder who brooked no opposition " . Brigadier @-@ General James M. Gavin , assistant division commander of the 82nd Airborne Division , recalled that when he travelled to England in November 1943 , Ridgway " cautioned me against the machinations and scheming of General F. M. Browning , who was the senior British airborne officer , and well he should have . " Major @-@ General Ray Barker told him that Browning was " an empire builder " , an assessment that Gavin came to agree with . 
 = = = Operation Market Garden = = = 
 Browning assumed a new command on 4 December 1943 . His Directive No. 1 announced that " the title of the force is Headquarters , Airborne Troops ( 21st Army Group ) . All correspondence will bear the official title , but verbally it will be known as the Airborne Corps and I will be referred to as the Corps Commander . " He was promoted to lieutenant @-@ general on 7 January 1944 , with his seniority backdated to 9 December 1943 . He officially became commander of I Airborne Corps on 16 April 1944 . 
 I Airborne Corps became part of the First Allied Airborne Army , commanded by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton , in August 1944 . While retaining command of the corps , Browning also became Deputy Commander of the Army , despite a poor relationship with Brereton and being disliked by many American officers , including Major General Ridgway , now commander of the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps . During preparations for one of many cancelled operations , <unk> II , his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation , which , due to differences in military culture , Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order . Browning was forced into a humiliating <unk> . 
 When I Airborne Corps was committed to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944 , Browning 's rift with Brereton had severe repercussions . Browning was concerned about the timetable put forward by Major @-@ General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command , under which the drop was staggered over several days , and not to make two drops on the first day . This restricted the number of combat troops available on the first day . He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie <unk> of No. 38 Group RAF , which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem , but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen . 
 Browning downplayed evidence brought to him by his intelligence officer , Major Brian Urquhart , that the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg were in the Arnhem area , but was not as confident as he led his subordinates to believe . According to Major @-@ General Urquhart , commander of the British 1st Airborne , when informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days , Browning responded that they could hold it for four , but then added : " But I think we might be going a bridge too far . " 
 <unk> ' Browning landed by gliders with a tactical headquarters near Nijmegen . His use of 38 aircraft to move his corps headquarters on the first lift has been criticised . Half of these gliders carried signal equipment but for much of the operation he had no contact with either the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem or Major General Taylor 's U.S. 101st Airborne Division at Eindhoven . His headquarters had not been envisaged as a frontline unit , and the signals section that had been hastily assembled just weeks before lacked training and experience . In his pack , Browning carried three teddy bears and a framed print of Albrecht Dürer 's The Praying Hands . 
 Major General Gavin , now commanding the 82nd Airborne Division , was critical of Browning , writing in his diary on 6 September 1944 that he " ... unquestionably lacks the standing , influence and judgement that comes from a proper troop experience .... his staff was superficial ... Why the British units fumble along ... becomes more and more apparent . Their tops lack the know @-@ how , never do they get down into the dirt and learn the hard way . " 
 After the war , Gavin and his staff were criticised for the decision to secure the high ground around Groesbeek before attempting the capture of the Waal bridge at Nijmegen . Browning took responsibility for this , noting that he " personally gave an order to Jim Gavin that , although every effort should be made to effect the capture of the Grave and Nijmegen bridges as soon as possible , it was essential that he should capture the Groesbeek Ridge and hold it " . 
 After the battle , Browning was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta ( II class ) by the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile , but his critical evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major @-@ General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade . Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat for the failure of Market Garden . Field Marshal Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates , or indeed acknowledged failure at all . He told the Chief of the Imperial General Staff , Sir Alan Brooke , that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O 'Connor were transferred to another theatre . 
 = = = South East Asia Command = = = 
 Events took a different course . Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten , the Supreme Allied Commander , South East Asia Command ( SEAC ) , had need of a new chief of staff owing to the poor health of Lieutenant @-@ General Henry Royds Pownall . Brooke turned down Mountbatten 's initial request for either Lieutenant @-@ General Archibald Nye or Lieutenant @-@ General John Swayne . Brooke then offered Browning for the post , and Mountbatten accepted . Pownall considered that Browning was " excellently qualified " for the post , although he had no staff college training and had never held a staff job before . Pownall noted that his " only reservation is that I believe [ Browning ] is rather nervy and highly strung " . For his services as a corps commander , Browning was mentioned in despatches a second time , and was awarded the Legion of Merit in the degree of Commander by the United States government . 
 Browning served in South East Asia from December 1944 until July 1946 ; Mountbatten soon came to regard him as indispensable . Browning had an American deputy , Major @-@ General Horace H. Fuller , and brought staff with him from Europe to SEAC headquarters in Kandy , Ceylon . SEAC headquarters developed an adversarial relationship with that of Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Oliver Leese 's Allied Land Forces South East Asia ( <unk> ) . Matters came to a head when Leese attempted to replace the victorious commander of the Fourteenth Army , Lieutenant @-@ General Sir William Slim . In the resulting furore , Leese was relieved instead . Slim took over <unk> and was replaced as Fourteenth Army commander by Browning 's friend General Sir Miles Dempsey . For his services at SEAC , Browning was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1946 . His last major military post was as Military Secretary of the War Office from September 1946 to January 1948 . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In January 1948 , Browning became Comptroller and Treasurer to Her Royal Highness the Princess Elizabeth Duchess of Edinburgh , although he did not officially retire from the Army until 5 April 1948 . This appointment was made on the recommendation of Lord Mountbatten , whose nephew Philip Mountbatten was now the Duke of Edinburgh . As such , Browning became the head of the Princess ' personal staff . He also juggled other duties . In 1948 he was involved with the 1948 Summer Olympics as Deputy Chairman of the British Olympic Association , and commandant of the British team . From 1944 to 1962 he was Commodore of the Royal Fowey Yacht Club ; on stepping down in 1962 , he was elected its first Admiral . 
 Upon the death of King George VI in 1952 , the Duchess of Edinburgh inherited the throne as Queen Elizabeth II . Browning and his staff became redundant , as the Queen was now served by the large staff of the monarch . The domestic staff remained at Clarence House , where they continued to serve the Queen Mother . The remainder were reorganised as the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh , with Browning as treasurer , the head of the office , moving into a new and larger office at Buckingham Palace . Like the Duke they served , the office had no constitutional role , but followed his sporting , cultural and scientific interests . Browning became involved with the Cutty Sark Trust , set up to preserve the famous ship , and in the administration of the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award . In June 1953 , Browning and Du Maurier attended the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . 
 Browning had been drinking since the war , but it had now become chronic . This led to a severe nervous breakdown in July 1957 , forcing his resignation from his position at the Palace in 1959 . Du Maurier had known of his taking a mistress in Fowey , but his breakdown brought to light two other girlfriends in London . For her part , Du Maurier confessed to her own wartime affair . For his services to the Royal Household , Browning was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1953 , and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1959 . He retreated to Menabilly , the mansion that had inspired Du Maurier 's novel Rebecca , which she had leased and restored in 1943 . In 1960 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall . Browning caused a scandal in 1963 when , under the influence of prescription drugs and alcohol , he was involved in an automobile accident in which two people were injured . He was fined £ 50 and forced to pay court and medical costs . He died from a heart attack at Menabilly on 14 March 1965 .

 Browning was portrayed by Dirk Bogarde in the film A Bridge Too Far , based on the events of Operation Market Garden . A copy of Browning 's uniform was made to Bogarde 's measurements from the original in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum . The Airborne Forces Museum , which opened in 1969 , was for many years located in Browning Barracks , which had been built in 1964 and named after Browning . Browning Barracks remained the depot of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces until 1993 . The museum moved to the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 2008 , and Browning Barracks was sold for housing development . 
 = Capture of Jenin = 
 The Capture of Jenin occurred on 20 September 1918 , during the Battle of Sharon which together with the Battle of Nablus formed the set piece Battle of Megiddo fought between 19 and 25 September during the last months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War . During the cavalry phase of the Battle of Sharon carried out by the Desert Mounted Corps , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade , Australian Mounted Division attacked and captured the town of Jenin located on the southern edge of the Esdraelon Plain ( also known as the Jezreel Valley and the plain of Armageddon ) 40 – 50 miles ( 64 – 80 km ) behind the front line in the Judean Hills . The Australian light horse captured about 2 @,@ 000 prisoners , the main supply base and the ordnance depot of the Seventh and the Eighth Armies in and near the town . They also cut the main road from Nablus and a further 6 @,@ 000 Ottoman Empire and German Empire prisoners , were subsequently captured as they attempted to retreat away from the Judean Hills . 
 The Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) cavalry had ridden through a gap on the Mediterranean Sea coast , created by the infantry during the Battle of Tulkarm , to capture the two Ottoman armies ' main lines of communication and supply north of the Judean Hills , while the infantry battles continued . On 20 September , the Desert Mounted Corps captured Afulah , Beisan and Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain . The next day the headquarters of the Seventh Army at Nablus , and the General Headquarters ( GHQ ) of the Yilderim Army Group at Nazareth , were both captured , while Haifa was captured two days later . During a subsequent early morning attack on 25 September , a German rearguard was captured during the Battle of Samakh , which ended the Battle of Sharon . During these operations the greater part of one Ottoman army was captured in the Judean Hills and at Jenin . These and other battles fought during the Battle of Megiddo including the Battle of Nablus and Third Transjordan attack , forced the retreating Ottoman Fourth , and remnants of the Seventh and the Eighth Armies , to the eastern side of the Jordan River . As they withdrew northwards towards Damascus they were pursued by the Desert Mounted Corps . 
 After the infantry established a gap in the Ottoman front line on the coast early on the morning of 19 September , the Australian Mounted Division 's 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades ( less the 5th Light Horse Brigade temporarily detached to the 60th Division ) in reserve , followed the 4th Cavalry Division north on the Plain of Sharon and across the Mount Carmel Range , by the Musmus Pass , to Lejjun on the Esdrealon Plain . While the 4th Light Horse Brigade remained to garrison Lejjun and provide various guards for artillery , supplies , and corps headquarters before being ordered to capture Samakh , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade advanced to Jenin , where the 9th and 10th Light Horse captured the town after a brief fire fight . Subsequently , these two regiments captured some 8 @,@ 000 Ottoman soldiers , who had been attempting to retreat northwards out of the Judean Hills , during the night of 20 / 21 September . The outnumbered Australian Light Horsemen were reinforced as quickly as possible , and the majority of the prisoners were marched back into holding camps , near Lejjun in the morning . The 3rd Light Horse Brigade remained in the area to garrison Jenin until they advanced to capture Tiberias on 25 September 1918 , before participating in the pursuit to Damascus .

 Following the Capture of Jericho in February , the commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) , General Edmund Allenby ordered the occupation of the Jordan Valley . In March – April and April – May 1918 , the First and the Second Transjordan attacks took place , while the front line across the Judean Hills to the Mediterranean Sea was defended . During this time , three @-@ quarters of the British infantry and yeomanry cavalry regiments were redeployed to the Western Front to counter Ludendorff 's Spring Offensive . They were replaced by British India Army infantry and cavalry which required a reorganisation . These newly arrived soldiers carried out a series of attacks on sections of the Ottoman front line in the Judean Hills during the summer months , as part of their training . These attacks including the Battle of Tell ' Asur and Action of <unk> in March and April , were aimed at pushing the front line to more advantageous positions in preparation for a major attack , and to acclimatise the newly arrived infantry . This fighting continued during the summer months . By the middle of September the consolidated EEF was once again ready for large @-@ scale offensive operations . 
 On 19 September , the Battle of Megiddo commenced with the XXI Corps ( commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin ) , under cover of a creeping barrage , broke through the Ottoman front line to begin the Battle of Sharon . In the afternoon the XX Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode began the Battle of Nablus , also supported by an artillery barrage . This offensive by the XX and XXI Corps , continued until midday on 21 September , when a successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps , combined with the XX Corps assault , forced the Seventh and the Eighth Armies , to disengage . The Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area towards the Jordan River , crossing at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge before a rearguard at Nablus was captured . While the EEF infantry were fighting the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills , the Desert Mounted Corps commanded by the Australian Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel advanced through the gap created by the XXI Corps infantry on the morning of 19 September , to ride northwards and virtually encircle the Ottoman forces before they disengaged . The cavalry divisions captured Nazareth , Haifa , Afulah , Beisan , and Jenin before and Samakh and the Capture of Tiberias ended the Battle of Megiddo . During this time , Chaytor 's Force ( temporarily detached from Desert Mounted Corps ) commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor , captured part of the retreating Ottoman and German column at the Capture of Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River to cut off this line of retreat , during the Third Transjordan attack . To the east of the river , as the Ottoman Fourth Army began its retreat , Chaytor 's Force advanced to capture Es Salt on 23 September and Amman on 25 September . Units of Chaytor 's Force captured Amman after defeating a strong Fourth Army rearguard during the Second Battle of Amman .

 In preparation for the Battle of Megiddo , the Desert Mounted Corps , consisting of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions , the Australian Mounted Division 's 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades , concentrated near Ramleh , Ludd ( Lydda ) , and Jaffa . Here dumps were formed of all surplus equipment , before the brigades and divisions moved up close behind the XXI Corps infantry divisions , near the Mediterranean coast . 
 Each mounted division of about 3 @,@ 500 troopers , consisted of three brigades , each brigade being made up of three regiments . Five of the six brigades of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions , most of which had recently arrived from France , consisted of one British yeomanry regiment and two British Indian Army cavalry regiments , one of which was usually lancers , including the Indian Princely States ' 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade of three lancer regiments . Some of the cavalry regiments were armed in addition to their Lee – Enfield rifles , bayonets and swords , with lances . The Australian Mounted Division consisting of three light horse brigades , each with three regiments , containing a headquarters and three squadrons . With 522 men and horses in each regiment , they were armed in addition to their rifles and bayonets with swords . The mounted divisions were supported by machine gun squadrons , three artillery batteries from the Royal Horse Artillery or the Honourable Artillery Company , and light armoured car units — two Light Armoured Motor Batteries , and two Light Car Patrols . 
 By 17 September the 5th Cavalry Division , which would lead the advance , was deployed north @-@ west of Sarona , eight miles ( 13 km ) from the front line , with the 4th Cavalry Division in orange groves to the east , ten miles ( 16 km ) from the front , and the Australian Mounted Division in reserve near Ramleh and Ludd , 17 miles ( 27 km ) from the front line . All movement , restricted to the night hours , culminated in a general move forward on the eve of battle during the night of 18 / 19 September , when the Australian Mounted Division moved up to Sarona . The supplies for the three divisions concentrated in the rear in divisional trains , in massed horse @-@ drawn transport and on endless strings of camels , clogging every road in the area . One iron ration and two days ' special emergency ration for each man , and 21 pounds ( 9 @.@ 5 kg ) of grain for each horse , was carried on the trooper 's horse , with an additional day 's grain for each horse , carried on the first @-@ line transport limbered wagons . 
 = = = Advance to Lejjun = = = 
 During the initial cavalry advance up the coastal Plain of Sharon to Litera on the Nahr el Mefjir , the Desert Mounted Corps was to advance , " strictly disregarding any enemy forces " which were not on the path of their advance . The mounted units were to cross the Mount Carmel Range from the coast to the Esdraelon Plain , through two passes . The 5th Cavalry Division took a northern and more difficult track from Sindiane to Abu Shusheh , 18 miles ( 29 km ) south @-@ east of Haifa , heading towards Nazareth , while the 4th Cavalry Division followed by the Australian Mounted Division in reserve crossed the mountain range by the historic southern Musmus Pass , ( used by armies of the Egyptian Pharaoh Thothmes III in the 15th century BC , and the Roman Emperor Vespasian in the 1st century AD ) to Lejjun before advancing to Afulah in the centre of the Esdrealon Plain . This southern pass was about 14 miles ( 23 km ) long and about 300 yards ( 270 m ) wide , as it followed the Wadi Ara up the side of the Samarian Hills to 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) above sea level , before falling to the plain . During their advance , the Australian Mounted Division halted for ten minutes every hour , when saddle girths may have been loosened and a few minutes sleep snatched , with the reins looped around an arm jammed deeply into a pocket . 
 The Esdrealon Plain , also known as the Jezreel Valley , and the Plain of Armageddon , stretches to the white houses of Nazareth in the foothills of the Galilean Hills on its northern edge 10 miles ( 16 km ) away , to Jenin on its southern edge at the foot of the Judean Hills , through Afulah to Beisan on its eastern edge , close to the Jordan River . On its western edge near Lejjun , at the mouth of the Musmus Pass , the ancient fortress of Megiddo on Tell al Mutesellim , dominates the Esdrealon Plain , across which Romans , Mongols , Arabs , Crusaders and the army of Napoleon had marched and fought . The road and railway network , on which the German and Ottoman forces in Palestine depended for supplies and communications , crossed this plain via the two important communication hubs of Afulah and Beisan . ( See Falls Map 21 Cavalry advances detail ) The railway passed from the plain into the Judean Hills south of Jenin , to wind through a narrow pass in the foothills before climbing to Messudieh Junction , where it again branched . One line ran westward to Tulkarm and Eighth Army headquarters , before turning south to the railhead to supply the Eight Army front line troops on the coastal plain , while the main railway line continued south @-@ eastward to Nablus , and the Seventh Army headquarters . 
 No defensive works of any kind had been identified on the Esdrealon Plain , or covering the approaches to it during aerial reconnaissance flights , except German troops known to garrison the commander of the Yildirim Army Group , General Otto Liman von Sanders ' headquarters in Nazareth . However , at 12 : 30 on 19 September , Liman von Sanders ordered the 13th Depot Regiment at Nazareth and military police , a total of six companies with 12 machine guns , to occupy Lejjun to defend the Musmus Pass against a possible attack . In reserve , the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades , Australian Mounted Division rode 28 miles ( 45 km ) from the south @-@ east of Jaffa at 08 : 45 to arrive at 01 : 45 at the Nahr Iskanderun , still on the coast , on the Plain of Sharon . The 3rd Light Horse Brigade and divisional troops of the Australian Mounted Division resumed their advance , passing through Kerkuk at 05 : 00 on 20 September , to move through the Musmus Pass before rest between 07 : 30 and 08 : 30 for breakfast . They arrived on the Esdrealon Plain at Lejjun at 11 : 45 on 20 September . The 4th Light Horse Brigade had been detached to various escort and guard duties . The 4th Light Horse Regiment served as escort to the Desert Mounted Corps ' headquarters , while the 11th Light Horse Regiment escorted divisional transport . The remainder of the brigade moved to Liktera at 03 : 00 on 20 September to organize and escort the transport convoy through the Musmus Pass . The transport of the Australian Mounted Division , and the Desert Mounted Corps , was consolidated by the brigade at Liktera , before moving at 14 : 00 to Kerkuk , where the 5th Cavalry Division 's transport joined their column . At 16 : 30 the combined transport began moving through the Musmus Pass . ' A ' echelon arrived at Lejjun at 21 : 00 on 20 September .

 According to Woodward , " [ c ] <unk> , surprise , and speed were key elements in the blitzkrieg warfare planned by Allenby . " The question of whether or not it was Allenby 's plan has been raised in the literature . According to Chauvel , Allenby had already decided on his plan before the Second Transjordan attack in April / May . Victory at the Battle of Megiddo depended on the intense British Empire artillery barrage successfully covering the front line infantry attacks , and to drive a gap in the line so the cavalry could advance quickly to the Esdraelon Plain 50 miles ( 80 km ) away during the first day of battle . Control of the skies was achieved and maintained by destroying German aircraft or forcing them to retire . Constant bombing raids by the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) and Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) , were carried out on Afulah , Tulkarm and Nablus , which cut communications with the Yildirim Army Group commander , Liman von Sanders at Nazareth . 
 After entering the Esdraelon Plain the Desert Mounted Corps was to ride as far as the Jordan River to encircle the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies in the Judean Hills , where they were still busy fighting the XXI and the XX Corps . If the Esdraelon Plain could be quickly captured , the railways cut , the roads controlled , the lines of communication and retreat cut , two Ottoman armies could be captured . The main objectives for 20 September were : 
 The 5th Cavalry Division 's attack on Nazareth and Liman von Sanders ' Yildirim Army Group 's headquarters 70 miles ( 110 km ) from Asurf , before clearing the plain to Afulah . 
 The 4th Cavalry Division 's capture of Afulah and Beisan and occupation of the bridges over the Jordan River — in particular , they were to hold or destroy the Jisr Mejamieh bridge 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Beisan , 97 miles ( 156 km ) from the old front line . 
 The Australian Mounted Division , in reserve , was to occupy Lejjun , while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade advanced to capture Jenin , 68 miles ( 109 km ) from their starting point , cutting the main line of retreat for the German and Ottoman soldiers . Nazareth has been mentioned as the place where the brigade was to " await the retreating Turks beginning to stream back through the Dothan pass . " Without communications , no combined action could be organized by the Ottoman forces , and the continuing EEF infantry attack forced the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies to withdraw northwards from the Judean Hills . They withdrew along the main roads and railways from Tulkarm and Nablus through the Dothan Pass to Jenin . After capturing Jenin , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was to wait for them . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 15 : 35 on 20 September , Major General Henry Hodgson , commanding the Australian Mounted Division , ordered Brigadier General Lachlan Wilson 's 3rd Light Horse Brigade to capture Jenin . The 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments , accompanied by the Nottinghamshire Battery ( RHA ) , and four cars of the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery moved out , leaving the 8th Light Horse Regiment for local protection at Lejjun . By 16 : 30 , this force had left Lejjun to advancing at the fast rate of ten miles ( 16 km ) per hour towards Jenin . As they were approaching Kufr Adan , three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north @-@ west of Jenin , a detached troop " rode down an enemy outpost " of between 1 @,@ 200 and 1 @,@ 800 German and Ottoman soldiers in an olive grove on the right flank . They had " immediately deployed " with swords drawn before charging " right into the Turks . " The whole force was captured including several wounded . 
 The 10th Light Horse Regiment with six machine guns of the 3rd Machine Gun Squadron formed the advanced guard . With the Afulah to Nazareth road already cut , one squadron of the advanced guard moved swiftly to control the road north from Jenin to Zir 'in , on which a column of Ottoman soldiers was retiring . The remainder of the advanced guard rode directly towards Jenin , passing the railway station about 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) on their right to cut the main road leading north , and the road east towards Beisan , with the 9th Light Horse Regiment following at the trot . Having cut the road and railway the 10th Light Horse Regiment turned south riding directly towards the village and railway station . They had galloped the 11 miles ( 18 km ) from Lejjun in 70 minutes to arrive from the north @-@ west . The Australian light horsemen charged into the town with drawn swords , to swiftly overwhelm all the German and Ottoman troops caught in the open . The 9th and the 10th Light Horse Regiments had attacked the town from two different directions , throwing the garrison into confusion . However , a " machine gun duel " between the 3rd Machine Gun Squadron and Germans , firing from windows and gardens on the light horsemen in the streets , developed . After about two hours of fighting , the Germans attempted to withdraw , when a number were killed and the remainder were captured . A total of about 4 @,@ 000 prisoners were captured , along with what the General Staff Headquarters of the Australian Mounted Division 's War Diary described as , an " enormous amount of booty . " 
 Jenin had been the main supply and ordnance depot of the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies , and huge quantities of war material , including guns , machine guns , and ammunition , were captured . In nearby caves , large stores of German beer , wine , and canned food were found . Jenin had also been the main German air base , and 24 burnt aircraft were found on two aerodromes . At the railway station , locomotives and rolling stock were captured , along with a number of well @-@ equipped workshops . Three hospitals were also captured . An armed guard was placed on 120 cases of champagne ( some of which was later distributed ) and a " wagon load of bullion " , worth nearly £ 20 @,@ 000 . Some of the gold was later used to buy food and forage for the Desert Mounted Corps , when they had outdistanced their lines of communication , and were forced to requisition supplies from the local population . 
 After securing the town , the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments were deployed across the main line of retreat from the Judean Hills , at the outlet of the Dothan Pass , about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Jenin , to wait for the expected retreating columns . At 21 : 00 on 20 September , a burst of machine gun fire stopped a long column of retreating German and Ottoman soldiers , resulting in the capture of 2 @,@ 800 prisoners and four guns . During the night the light horsemen were to capture 8 @,@ 000 prisoners who had retreated , in the face of EEF infantry attacks in the Judean Hills , along the good quality road from Nablus and Tulkarm , north towards Jenin and Damascus . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Outnumbered many times over , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade force patrolled 7 @,@ 075 prisoners for the remainder of the night , with drawn swords until reinforcements began to arrive . The first were the 12th Light Armoured Motor Battery , which arrived at 04 : 15 on 21 September . The 4th Light Horse Brigade left Lejjun at 04 : 30 on 21 September , to reinforce the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Jenin . The brigade moved out less one squadron , but with the 4th and 11th Light Horse Regiments and a section of the Nottinghamshire Battery RHA , and / or the 19th Brigade RHA ( less one battery and one section ) to arrive at 06 : 00 . They found virtually the whole plain covered with prisoners , motor cars , lorries , wagons , animals , and stores " in an inextricable confusion . " The headquarters of the Australian Mounted Division arrived Jenin at 06 : 30 and , half an hour later , the 14th Cavalry Brigade ( 5th Cavalry Division ) also arrived at Jenin to help manage the thousands of prisoners , but were able to return to their division at Afulah at 16 : 15 that afternoon . Meanwhile , the 8th Light Horse Regiment ( 3rd Light Horse Brigade ) also quickly followed after being relieved at Lejjun . They arrived at Jenin at 07 : 00 and two hours later departed , on their way back to Lejjun , escorting a convoy of about 7 @,@ 000 prisoners . It took 10 hours to escort them to the prison compound , where a total of about 14 @,@ 000 prisoners would eventually be held . 
 More than 40 hours after the offensive began , substantial columns of the Seventh Ottoman Army were seen withdrawing northeastwards from Nablus , in the direction of the Jordan River where many would be captured by the 11th Cavalry Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division . Liman von Sanders , the commander of the Yildirim Army Group , had been surprised by the arrival of EEF cavalry at Nazareth in the early hours of 20 September . With no combat formations available to stop the EEF cavalry , he and his staff were forced to retire from Nazareth , driving via Tiberias , to reach Samakh in the late afternoon . Here he made arrangements to establish a strong rearguard garrison in what he planned would be the center of a rearguard line which was to stretch from Lake <unk> to Irbid . Liman von Sanders drove on to Deraa on the morning of 21 September , where he received a report from the Ottoman Fourth Army , which he ordered to withdraw to the Deraa @-@ to @-@ Irbid line , without waiting for the southern Hejaz garrisons . He subsequently continued his journey back to Damascus . 
 As a result of the capture of Jenin , all the main direct northern routes across the Esdrealon Plain , which the retreating Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies could have used , were now held by the Desert Mounted Corps . The 4th Cavalry Division controlled the Beisan area on the eastern edge of the plain after they captured both Afulah and Beisan , while the 5th Cavalry Division garrisoned the Afulah and Nazareth areas in the center and to the north , with the Australian Mounted Division holding Jenin in the south and patrolling the surrounding area . 
 The 4th Cavalry Division had ridden 70 miles ( 110 km ) ( the first 20 miles ( 32 km ) over sandy soil ) and fought two actions , in 34 hours . The 13th Brigade of the 5th Cavalry Division covered 50 miles ( 80 km ) in 22 hours . On its way to Jenin , the Australian Mounted Division rode 62 miles ( 100 km ) , with its 3rd Light Horse Brigade riding 51 miles ( 82 km ) in less than 25 hours . These cavalry divisions had started the advance with three days rations , so they were on their last day 's supplies when their brigade transport and supply companies arrived . These divisional trains had been supplied from motor lorry convoys , one of which arrived at Jenin during 21 September . The Australian Mounted Division motor ambulance transport , also rejoined their division at Jenin on 21 September , after the main road had been cleared . 
 The 5th Light Horse Brigade ( Australian Mounted Division ) , which had been attached to the infantry in the Judean Hills , was ordered to rejoin their division at Jenin . The brigade doubled back to turn down the road to Jenin , arriving on dusk at 18 : 00 on 22 September to relieve the 3rd Light Horse Brigade , which then withdrew to Afulah . The 4th Light Horse Brigade remained at Jenin until 22 September , when it was ordered back to Afulah , where they arrived at midday on 23 September . The 5th Light Horse Brigade was still at Jenin on 25 September , the last day of the Battle of Megiddo , when it was ordered to send a regiment to reinforce the 4th Light Horse Brigade 's pre @-@ dawn attack on Samakh . They charged against a well prepared German and Ottoman rearguard during the Battle of Samakh . Later in the day , one squadron of the 8th Light Horse Regiment , 3rd Light Horse Brigade approached Tiberias along the road from Nazareth , while a squadron from the 12th Light Horse Regiment , advanced north from Samakh . Together they captured Tiberias and 56 prisoners , half of which were German . The next day Allenby held a corps commanders ' conference at Jenin where he ordered the pursuit to Damascus . Infantry from the 7th Brigade of the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division were detached to the Desert Mounted Corps to relieve the mounted and cavalry divisions of their garrison duties . The infantry took over the captured areas , marching via Jenin , and Nazareth , to arrive at Samakh on 28 September .

 = Swaminarayan = 
 Swaminarayan ( IAST : <unk> , 3 April 1781 – 1 June 1830 ) , also known as Sahajanand Swami , is the central figure in a modern sect of Hinduism known as the Swaminarayan Hinduism . 
 Swaminarayan was born Ghanshyam Pande in <unk> , Uttar Pradesh , India in 1781 . In 1792 , he began a seven @-@ year pilgrimage across India at the age of 11 years , adopting the name Nilkanth <unk> this journey , he did welfare activities and after 9 years and 11 months of this journey , he settled in the state of Gujarat around 1799 . In 1800 , he was initiated into the Uddhav sampradaya by his guru , Swami Ramanand , and was given the name Sahajanand Swami . In 1802 , his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampraday to him before his death . Sahajanand Swami held a gathering and taught the Swaminarayan Mantra . From this point onwards , he was known as Swaminarayan . The Uddhav Sampraday became known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday . 
 Swaminarayan developed a good relationship with the British Raj . He had followers not only from Hindu denominations but also from Islam and Zoroastrianism . He built six temples in his lifetime and appointed 500 <unk> to spread his philosophy . In 1826 , Swaminarayan wrote the Shikshapatri , a book of social principles . He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in Gadhada , Gujarat . Before his death , Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as acharyas to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampraday . 
 Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor , performing <unk> ( fire sacrifices ) on a large scale as well as performing miracles . Swaminarayan had an estimated 1 @.@ 8 million followers when he died . By 2007 , he had an estimated of 20 million followers . He has , however , been criticised by people such as Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Mahatma Gandhi . The acceptance of Swaminarayan as God and secondary treatment of women is questioned by critics . 
 = = Childhood as Ghanshyam = = 
 Swaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 ( Chaitra Sud 9 , Samvat 1837 ) in <unk> , Uttar Pradesh , a village near Ayodhya , in a Hindi speaking region in India . Born into the brahmin or priestly caste of <unk> , Swaminarayan was named Ghanshyam Pande by his parents , Hariprasad Pande ( father , also known as <unk> ) and Premvati Pande ( mother , also known as <unk> and <unk> ) . The birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of Rama Navami , celebrating the birth of Rama . The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the waxing moon in the month of Chaitra ( March – April ) , is celebrated as both Rama Navami and Swaminarayan Jayanti by Swaminarayan followers . This celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers . Swaminarayan had an elder brother , <unk> Pande , and a younger brother , <unk> Pande . He is said to have mastered the scriptures , including the Vedas , the Upanishads , the Puranas , the Ramayana , and the Mahabharata by the age of seven . 
 = = Travels as Nilkanth Varni = = 
 After the death of his parents , Ghanshyam Pande left his home on 29 June 1792 ( <unk> Sud 10 , Samvat 1849 ) at the age of 11 . He took the name Nilkanth Varni while on his journey . Nilkanth Varni travelled across India and parts of Nepal in search of an ashram , or hermitage , that practiced what he considered a correct understanding of Vedanta , Samkhya , Yoga , and <unk> , the four primary schools of Hindu philosophy . To find such an ashram , Nilkanth Varni asked the following five questions on the basic Vaishnava Vedanta categories : 
 What is Jiva ? 
 What is Ishvara ? 
 What is Maya ? 
 What is Brahman ? 
 What is Para Brahman ? 
 While on his journey , Nilkanth Varni mastered Astanga yoga ( eightfold yoga ) in a span of 9 months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi . In Nepal , it is said that he met King Rana Bahadur Shah and cured him of his stomach illness . As a result , the king freed all the ascetics he had imprisoned . Nilkanth Varni visited the Jagannath Temple in Puri as well as temples in Badrinath , Rameshwaram , Nashik , Dwarka and Pandharpur . 
 In 1799 , after a seven @-@ year journey , Nilkanth 's travels as a yogi eventually concluded in <unk> , a village in the Junagadh district of Gujarat . In <unk> , Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami , a senior disciple of Ramanand Swami . Muktanand Swami , who was twenty @-@ two years older than Nilkanth , answered the five questions to Nilkanth 's satisfaction . Nilkanth decided to stay for the opportunity to meet Ramanand Swami , whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat . He later claimed in the <unk> that during this period , he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mothers flesh and blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family , was completely removed . 
 = = Leadership as Sahajanand Swami = = 
 According to the sect , Nilkanth 's understanding of the metaphysical and epistemological concepts of the pancha @-@ tattvas ( five eternal elements ) , together with his mental and physical discipline , inspired senior sadhus of Ramanand Swami . 
 Nilkanth Varni received <unk> initiation from Ramanand Swami on 20 October 1800 , and with it was granted the names Sahajanand Swami and Narayan Muni to signify his new status . 
 At the age of 21 , Sahajanand Swami was appointed successor to Ramanand Swami as the leader of the Uddhav Sampraday by Ramanand Swami , prior to his death . The Uddhav Sampraday henceforth came to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday . According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity , Krishna or Narayana . Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata . In contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha @-@ <unk> Sampradaya , he had a more puritanical approach , rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery . While being a worshipper of Krishna , Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in <unk> in favor of worship in the mood of majesty , alike to earlier <unk> teachers , Ramanuja and <unk> . 
 Sahajanand Swami was later known as Swaminarayan after the mantra he taught at a gathering , in <unk> , a fortnight after the death of Ramanand Swami . He gave his followers a new mantra , known as the Swaminarayan mantra , to repeat in their rituals : Swaminarayan . When chanting this mantra , some devotees went into samadhi ( a form of meditation ) This act is also called maha @-@ samadhi ( " great samadhi " ) and claimed that they could see their personal gods , even though they had no knowledge of Astanga Yoga . Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj , <unk> Maharaj , Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari . As early as 1804 , Swaminarayan , who was reported to have performed miracles , was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and <unk> , Nishkulanand Swami . This work , the Yama Danda , was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect . 
 Swaminarayan encouraged his followers to combine devotion and dharma to lead a pious life . Using Hindu texts and rituals to form the base of his organisation , Swaminarayan founded what in later centuries would become a global organisation with strong Gujarati roots . He was particularly strict on the separation of sexes in temples . Swaminarayan was against the consumption of meat , alcohol or drugs , adultery , suicide , animal sacrifices , criminal activities and the appeasement of ghosts and tantric rituals . Alcohol consumption was forbidden by him even for medicinal purposes . Many of his followers took vows before becoming his disciple . He stated that four elements need to be conquered for ultimate salvation : dharma , bhakti ( devotion ) , <unk> ( knowledge ) and vairagya ( detachment ) . Doctrinally , Swaminarayan was close to eleventh century philosopher Ramanuja and was critical of Shankaracharya 's concept of <unk> , or monistic non @-@ dualism . Swaminarayan 's ontology maintained that the supreme being is not formless and that God always has a divine form . 
 = = Work and views = = 
 = = = Women = = = 
 According to the author Raymond Brady Williams , " Swaminarayan is an early representative of the practice of advocacy of women 's rights without personal involvement with women " . To counter the practice of sati ( self @-@ immolation by a widow on her husband ’ s funeral pyre ) , Swaminarayan argued that , as human life was given by God it could be taken only by God , and that sati had no Vedic sanction . He went to the extent to call sati nothing but suicide . Swaminarayan offered parents help with dowry expenses to discourage female infanticide , calling infanticide a sin . 
 The Swaminarayan faith has been linked to patriarchal class structures that subjugate women . Professor David Hardiman states that Swaminarayan was not free from misogyny and " after travelling as an ascetic throughout India he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman " . Swaminarayan 's writings like the Shikshapatri portray women as polluted beings who pull men down . Swaminarayan taught that “ the woman who attracts attention is made up of bones , blood vessels , spittle , blood , mucus and feces ; she is simply a collection of these things , and there is nothing to be attractive . ” Women are thus depicted as dirty , slimy , polluted beings who pull men down . This discriminative treatment is endorsed to the full by the Shikshapatri . Swaminarayan refused to interact with women himself and barred them from leadership positions in his movement , causing critics to label him a hypocrite regarding the status of women . No women are allowed to serve on the managing committees of temples ; neither can they act as trustees of the trusts which look after temple funds . 
 Members of the faith are defensive of the fact that some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible . Female followers are segregated rigorously . They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women 's temples . Concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship . Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women . 
 In case of widows , Swaminarayan directed those who could not follow the path of chastity to remarry . For those who could , he lay down strict rules which included them being under the control of male members of the family . This may seem regressive , however it gave them " a respected and secure place in the social order " of the time . Swaminarayan restricted widows " to live always under the control of male members of their family and prohibited them from receiving instruction in any science from any man excepting their nearest relations . " 
 However , while " many would assert that Swaminarayan Hinduism serves a patriarchal agenda , which attempts to keep women in certain roles " , Swaminarayan himself , despite considerable criticism from those in his own contemporary society who " loathed the uplift of lower caste women , " insisted that education was the inherent right of all people . At that time , influential and wealthy individuals educated their girls through private and personal tuition . Male followers of Swaminarayan made arrangements to educate their female family members . The literacy rate among females began to increase , and they were able to give discourses on spiritual subjects . Within the sect , Swaminarayan is considered a pioneer of education of females in India . 
 = = = Caste system and the poor = = = 
 After assuming the leadership of the Sampraday , Swaminarayan worked to assist the poor by distributing food and drinking water . He undertook several social service projects and opened almshouses for the poor . Swaminarayan organized food and water relief to people during times of drought . The faith largely had excluded the mass of the poor , such as marginal peasants , agricultural labourers , the informal sector working class , <unk> <unk> . Dalits were banned from Swaminarayan temples from the beginning though in one case a separate temple was created for their use . 
 Some suggest that Swaminarayan worked towards ending the caste system , allowing everyone into the Swaminarayan Sampraday . However partaking in the consumption food of lower castes and caste pollution was not supported by him . A political officer in Gujarat , Mr. Williamson reported to Bishop Herber that Swaminarayan had " destroyed the yoke of caste . " He instructed his paramhansas to collect alms from all sections of society and appointed people from the lower strata of society as his personal attendants . Members of the lower castes were attracted to the movement as it improved their social status . Swaminarayan would eat along with the lower Rajput and <unk> castes but not any lower . He established separate places of worship for the lower caste population where they were in large numbers . However , Dalits - the lowest in the caste system - were formally excluded from Swaminarayan temples . In the Shikshapatri , he wrote do not take food or water from a person of a lower caste . Members of a lower caste are prohibited from wearing a full sect mark ( tilak <unk> ) on their forehead . Even now , however , for the vast majority of Gujarat 's lower @-@ caste , Untouchable and tribal population , the sect is out of bounds . 
 According to Narrative of a Journey Through the Upper Provinces of India , from Calcutta to Bombay , Volume 2 1824 to 1825 by Reginald Bishop Heber - Lord Bishop of Calcutta , which says that <unk> of Swaminarayan are across the casts including Muslims / <unk> and lower casts such as <unk> , <unk> and Kolis . They all pray to one god with no difference of casts . They live as if they are brothers . 
 Page 109 under head " Swaamee Narain " discussion between Mr. Williamson and Bishop Heber about The social and law & order situation of Kutch ( then Cutch ) and <unk> ( then <unk> ) during AD 1824 : " On other occasions , however , their opposition to law has been sufficiently open and daring . The districts of Cutch and <unk> have ever been , more or less in a state of rebellion ; and neither the <unk> of the former state nor the <unk> , as feudal sovereign of the latter , nor the English government in the districts adjoining to both , which are under their controul , have ever got through a year <unk> one or more sieges of different forts or <unk> . 
 Some good had been done , Mr. Williamson said , among many of these wild people , by the preaching and popularity of the Hindoo reformer , Swaamee Narain , who had been mentioned to me at Baroda . His morality was said to be far better than any which could be learned from <unk> ( <unk> ) . He preached a great degree of purity , forbidding his disciples so much as to ( not ) look on any woman whom they passed . He condemned theft and bloodshed ; and those villages and districts which had received him , from being among worst , were now among the best and most orderly in the provinces . Nor was this all , insomuch as he was said to have destroyed the yoke of caste , - to have preached one God , and in <unk> , to have made so considerable approaches to the truth , that I could not but hope he might be an appointed instrument to prepare the way for gospel . 
 While I was listening with much interest to Mr. Williamson 's account of this map , six persons came to the tent , four in the dress of peasants or <unk> ; one , a yong man , with a large which turban and the quilted <unk> , of a Coolie , but clean and decent , with a handsome sward and shield and other marks of rustic wealth ; and the sixth , an old <unk> , which a white beard and pretty much appearance , dress , and manner of an ancient serving @-@ man . After offering some sugar and sweetmeats , as their <unk> , and as usual , sitting down on the ground , one of the peasants began , to my exceeding surprise and delight , " <unk> Swaamee Narain , send his salaam " . and proceeded to say that person whom I so much desired to see was in the neighbourhood and asked permission to call on my next day . I , of course , returned a favourable answer , and stated with truth that I greatly desired his <unk> , and had heard much good of him . I asked if they were his disciples , and was answered in the affirmative . ... He added that though of different castes , they were all disciples of Swaamee Narain , and taught to regard each other as brethren . " 
 Page 115 - Meeting with <unk> and discussion between Bishop and Swaminarayan " I ( Bishop Heber ) asked ( to Swaminarayan ) about castes , to which he answered , that he did not regard the subject as of much importance , but that he wished not to give offence ( to ancient Hindu system ) ; that people might eat separately or together in this world , but that above " <unk> " pointing to heaven , those distinctions would cease , where we should be all " ek <unk> Jat " ( one like another ) .

 It is said that Swaminarayan dispelled the myth that moksha ( salvation ) was not attainable by everyone . He taught that the soul is neither male nor female . 
 = = = Animal Sacrifices and <unk> = = = 
 Swaminarayan was against animal sacrifices as carried out by Brahmin priests during Vedic rituals , such as yajnas ( fire sacrifices ) , influenced by the Kaula and Vama Marg cults . The priests consumed " sanctified " prasad in the form of meat of these animals . To solve this problem , Swaminarayan conducted several large scale yajnas involving priests from Varanasi . These did not have animal sacrifices and were conducted in strict accordance with Vedic scriptures . Swaminarayan was successful in reinstating ahimsa through several such large scale yajnas . Swaminarayan stressed lacto vegetarianism among his followers and forbade meat consumption . 
 According to <unk> Shloka 12 : " ( My followers ) shall never kill goats and / or other living beings in sacrifice performed for the propitiation of deities and <unk> ( ancestors ) , for non @-@ violence is declared ( by the Shastras ) as the highest Dharma of all the <unk> . "

 = = = Establishing Law and Order of Gujarat = = = 
 During the time when Swaminarayan came to Gujarat , the law and order situation of Gujarat was in worst ever . Neither British government nor local kings were able to control the robberies , killings , internal conflicts , rapes , and other uncultured events in <unk> , Kutch and Gujarat . Upon reaching to Gujarat , Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians . These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values to the extent that they would never rob , or kill any living being . Even they would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian . Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat . Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature . 
 Joban Pagi of Vadtal 
 One of the notorious criminal at time of Maharaja <unk> Gaikwad 2 was Joban Pagi . Joban Pagi had robbed treasury of Gaikwad at Okha Mandal and killed many of the soldiers . He had also killed officers of British government at Vadtal . But neither British Government nor Gaikwad could arrest him alive . He had his robbers network from Puna till <unk> . <unk> tried to steal Swaminarayan 's favorite mare named " <unk> " at <unk> but despite of his efforts through out night he could not steal it . <unk> the master of robbery shocked with his defeat and met Swaminarayan during a vast assembly of <unk> Yagna and confessed his crime and took his shelter . He then left robbery . Sayajirao Gaikwad had invited him and awarded him " Bahadur " by making him State Guest after he became a disciple of Swaminarayan . 
 Jogidas <unk> 
 Jogidas <unk> was one of the strongest <unk> - rebellion turned robber . He became rebellion against Bhavnagar state because he was not given share of kingdom and Bhavnagar Maharaja did not supported him in giving justice . The <unk> periodically rob villages belonging to Wajesinhji - <unk> Maharaja , razing them and pilfering the cattle and then escape to nearby Gir Forests . Despite of multiple efforts by British and Wajesinhji , Jogidas was not convinced to settle down the dispute . Wajesinhji was desperate for truce with Jogidas <unk> in 1829 He come to know that Jogidas had recently visited Gadhada at Data Khachar Darbar and had met Dada and Swaminarayan on demise of Jiva Khachar . <unk> requested Dada Khachar to help make truce with Jogidas . Dada Khachar being a subservient devotee of Swaminarayan asked permission of Swaminarayan <unk> . Swaminarayan gave him permission . Dada become mediator and by bless of Swaminarayan , Dada made truce between <unk> and Jogidas . D.A. Blane , then Political Agent in Rajkot , ratified the truce and sent it to the Bombay Presidency , which approved it . This clearly reflected Swaminarayan 's calming influence on outlaws of Gujarat and make them streamline without killing them .

 Swaminarayan ordered the construction of several Hindu temples and he had built six huge temples by himself and installed the idols of various deities such as Nara @-@ Narayana in two temples , Laxminarayan dev , <unk> <unk> , Radha Raman dev and <unk> <unk> . The images in the temples built by Swaminarayan provide evidence of the priority of Krishna . Disciples of Swaminarayan composed devotional poems which are widely sung by the tradition during festivals . Swaminarayan introduced fasting and devotion among followers . He conducted the festivals of Vasant Panchami , Holi , and Janmashtami with organization of the traditional folk dance <unk> . 
 The first temple Swaminarayan constructed was in Ahmedabad in 1822 , with the land for construction given by the British Imperial Government . Following a request of devotees from Bhuj , Swaminarayan asked his follower <unk> to build a temple there . Construction commenced in 1822 , and the temple was built within a year . A temple in Vadtal followed in 1824 , a temple in <unk> in 1826 , a temple in Junagadh in 1828 and a temple in Gadhada , also in 1828 . By the time of his death , Swaminarayan had also ordered construction of temples in <unk> , Dholka and <unk> . 
 From early on , ascetics have played a major role in the Swaminarayan sect . They contribute towards growth and development of the movement , encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life . Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night . <unk> is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment . <unk> were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect . Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami , Gopalanand Swami , <unk> Swami , Gunatitanand Swami , <unk> Swami , Nishkulanand Swami , and Nityanand Swami . 
 = = Scriptures = = 
 Swaminarayan propagated general Hindu texts . He held the Bhagavata Purana in high authority . However , there are many texts that were written by Swaminarayan or his followers that are regarded as shastras or scriptures within the Swaminarayan sect . Notable scriptures throughout the sect include the Shikshapatri and the Vachanamrut . Other important works and scriptures include the Satsangi Jeevan , Swaminarayan 's authorized biography , the Muktanand Kavya , the Nishkulanand Kavya and the Bhakta Chintamani . 
 Shikshapatri 
 Swaminarayan wrote the Shikshapatri on 11 February 1826 . While the original Sanskrit manuscript is not available , it was translated into Gujarati by Nityanand Swami under the direction of Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect . The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow . A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma , it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses , outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well @-@ disciplined and moral life . The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and it is one of the very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself . Acharya <unk> of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text . 
 Vachanamrut 
 Swaminarayan 's philosophical , social and practical teachings are contained in the Vachanamrut , a collection of dialogues recorded by five prominent saints ( Muktanand Swami , Gopalanand Swami , Nityanand Swami , <unk> Muni , & <unk> Swami ) from his spoken words . The Vachanamrut is the scripture most commonly used in the Swaminarayan sect . It contains views on dharma ( moral conduct ) , jnana ( understanding of the nature of the self ) , vairagya ( detachment from material pleasure ) , and bhakti ( pure , selfless devotion to God ) , the four essentials Hindu scriptures describe as necessary for a jiva ( soul ) to attain moksha ( salvation ) . 
 Satsangi Jeevan 
 Satsangi Jeevan is the authorised biography of Swaminarayan . The book contains information on the life and teachings of Swaminarayan . It is written by Shatanand Swami and completed in Vikram Samvat 1885 . Swaminarayan decided to make Gadhada his permanent residence on the insistence of Dada Khachar and his <unk> instructed Shatanand Swami to write a book on his life and pastimes . 
 To enable Shatanand swami to write from His childhood , Swaminarayan had blessed Shatanand Swami with Sanjay Drishti - special power to see the entire past right from His childhood . 
 Once written by Shatanand Swami , this book was verified and authenticated by Swaminarayan . He was much pleased to read the book . Swaminarayan then asked his disciples to do Katha of Satsangi Jeevan 
 = = Relations with other religions and the British Government = = 
 Swaminarayan strived to maintain good relationships with people of other religions , sometimes meeting prominent leaders . His followers cut across religious boundaries , including people of Muslim and Parsi backgrounds . Swaminarayan 's personal attendants included <unk> Muslims . In <unk> , many Muslims wore <unk> necklaces given by Swaminarayan . He also had a meeting with Reginald Heber , Lord Bishop of Calcutta and a leader of Christians in India at the time . Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying <unk> and swords . Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him ( fifty horses and fifty muskets ) and mentioned that it was humiliating for him to see two religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies , his being the smaller contingent . As a result of the meeting , both leaders gained mutual respect for one another . 
 Swaminarayan enjoyed a good relationship with the British Imperial Government . The first temple he built , in Ahmedabad , was built on 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 km2 ) of land given by the government . The British officers gave it a 101 gun salute when it was opened . It was in an 1825 meeting with Reginald Heber that Swaminarayan is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of <unk> : Rp = 81 In 1830 , Swaminarayan had a meeting with Sir John Malcolm , Governor of Bombay ( 1827 to 1830 ) . According to Malcolm , Swaminarayan had helped bring some stability to a lawless region . During the meeting with Malcolm , Swaminarayan gave him a copy of the Shikshapatri . This copy of the Shikshapatri is currently housed at the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford . Swaminarayan also encouraged the British Governor James Walker to implement strong measures to stop the practice of sati . 
 = = Death and succession = = 
 In 1830 , Swaminarayan gathered his followers and announced his departure . He later died on 1 June 1830 ( <unk> sud 10 , Samvat 1886 ) , and it is believed by followers that , at the time of his death , Swaminarayan left Earth for Akshardham , his abode . He was cremated according to Hindu rites at Lakshmi Wadi in Gadhada . 
 Prior to his death , Swaminarayan decided to establish a line of acharyas or preceptors , as his successors . He established two <unk> ( seats of leadership ) . One seat was established at Ahmedabad ( Nar Narayan Dev Gadi ) and the other one at Vadtal ( Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi ) on 21 November 1825 . Swaminarayan appointed an acharya to each of these <unk> to pass on his message to others and to preserve his fellowship , the Swaminarayan Sampraday . These acharyas came from his immediate family after sending representatives to search them out in Uttar Pradesh . He formally adopted a son from his brothers and appointed them to the office of acharya . <unk> , the son of Swaminarayan 's elder brother <unk> and <unk> , the son of his younger brother <unk> , were appointed acharyas of the Ahmedabad Gadi and the Vadtal Gadi respectively . Swaminarayan decreed that the office should be hereditary so that acharyas would maintain a direct line of blood descent from his family . The administrative division of his followers into two territorial dioceses is set forth in minute detail in a document written by Swaminarayan called Desh <unk> Lekh . Swaminarayan stated to all the devotees and saints to obey both the <unk> and Gopalanand Swami who was considered as the main pillar and chief ascetic for the Sampraday . 
 The current acharyas of the Swaminarayan Sampraday are <unk> Pande , of the Ahmedabad Gadi , and <unk> Pande , of the Vadtal Gadi . 
 Decades after his death , several divisions occurred with different understandings of succession . This included the establishment of <unk> Shri <unk> Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha ( BAPS ) , the founder of which left the Vadtal Gadi in 1905 , and Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi <unk> , the founder of which left the Ahmedabad Gadi in the 1940s . The followers of BAPS hold Gunatitanand Swami as the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan , asserting that on several occasions Swaminarayan revealed to devotees that Gunatitanand Swami was <unk> manifest . Followers of BAPS believe that the acharyas were given administrative leadership of the sect while Gunatitanand Swami was given spiritual leadership by Swaminarayan . The current spiritual and administrative leader of BAPS is Shastri <unk> . The followers of the Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi <unk> hold Gopalanand Swami as the successor to Swaminarayan . The current leader of this sect is <unk> Maharaj . 
 = = Following and manifestation belief = = 
 According to the biographer Raymond Williams , when Swaminarayan died , he had a following of 1 @.@ 8 million people . In 2001 , Swaminarayan centres existed on four continents , and the congregation was recorded to be five million , the majority in the homeland of Gujarat . The newspaper Indian Express estimated members of the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism to number over 20 million ( 2 crore ) worldwide in 2007 . 
 In his discourses recorded in the Vachanamrut , Swaminarayan mentions that humans would not be able to withstand meeting god in his divine form , hence God takes human form ( simultaneously living in his abode ) so people can approach , understand and love him in the form of an Avatar . While no detailed statistical information is available , most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars . A Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair , was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan . 
 Some of Swaminarayan 's followers believe he was an incarnation of Lord Krishna . The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect . The story of the birth of Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna 's birth from the scripture Bhagavata Purana . Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of God in a meeting with Reginald Heber , the Lord Bishop of Calcutta , in 1825 . 
 The belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also drawn criticism . According to Professor Raymond B. Williams , Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a Maharaja even though he had taken the vows of renunciation of the world . Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers . 
 Mahatma Gandhi , leader of the Indian independence movement in British @-@ ruled India , had a low opinion of the sect and he criticized Swaminarayan and Vallabha Acharya for propagating the values which he thought were contrary to the true spirit of Vaishnavism . In a letter dated 25 July 1918 , to <unk> Gandhi , he stated , “ To be sure , I have felt in all seriousness that Swaminarayan and <unk> have robbed us of our manliness . They made the people incapable of self @-@ defense ... It was all to the good that people gave up drinking , smoking , ect . , this , however , is not an end in itself , it only is a means . The love taught by Swaminarayan and <unk> is all sentimentalism . They have made an undesirable effect on Gujarat ... Do not mix up the Vaishnava tradition with the teaching of Vallabha and Swaminarayan . ” 
 The manifestation belief and Swaminarayan 's teachings were also criticized by Hindu reformist leader Swami Dayananda ( 1824 – 1883 ) . He questioned the acceptance of Swaminarayan as the Supreme Being and was disapproving towards the idea that visions of Swaminarayan could form a path to attaining perfection . Accused of deviating from the Vedas , his followers were criticised for the illegal collection of wealth and the " practice of frauds and tricks . " In the views of Swami Dayananda , published as early as 1875 , the Shikshapatri <unk> <unk> pamphlet came as a reaction to bring out the absurdities of the Shikshapatri . Furthermore , he believed it was a historical fact that Swaminarayan decorated himself as Narayana in order to gain followers . 
 = Italian cruiser Nino Bixio = 
 Nino Bixio was a protected cruiser built by the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the early 1910s . She was the lead ship of the Nino Bixio class , which were built as scouts for the main Italian fleet . She was equipped with a main battery of six 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns and had a top speed in excess of 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , but her engines proved to be troublesome in service . Nino Bixio saw service during World War I and briefly engaged the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Helgoland in 1915 . Her career was cut short in the post @-@ war period due to severe cuts to the Italian naval budget , coupled with her unreliable engines . Nino Bixio was stricken from the naval register in March 1929 and sold for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Nino Bixio was 140 @.@ 3 meters ( 460 ft ) long at the waterline , with a beam of 13 m ( 43 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 1 m ( 13 ft ) . She displaced up to 4 @,@ 141 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 076 long tons ; 4 @,@ 565 short tons ) at full load . Her crew consisted 13 officers and 283 enlisted men . The ship 's propulsion system consisted of three Curtiss steam turbines , each driving a screw propeller . Steam was provided by fourteen mixed coal and oil firing Blechynden boilers . The engines were rated at 23 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 17 @,@ 000 kW ) for a top speed of 26 @.@ 82 knots ( 49 @.@ 67 km / h ; 30 @.@ 86 mph ) . She had a range of 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ; 1 @,@ 600 mi ) at a cruising speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of six 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 50 guns mounted singly . She was also equipped with six 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 50 guns and two 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . Nino Bixio was only lightly armored , with a 38 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) thick deck , and 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick plating on her main conning tower . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Nino Bixio , named for the soldier and politician , was built at the Castellammare shipyard ; her keel was laid down on 15 February 1911 , the same day as her sister Marsala . Nino Bixio 's completed hull was launched ten months later on 30 December , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . The ship was completed by 5 May 1914 , when she was commissioned into the Italian fleet . Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914 , but by May 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers . Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the Italian naval chief of staff , believed that Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic , which could also be easily seeded with minefields . The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way . Instead , Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Nino Bixio , Marsala , and the cruiser Quarto were based at Brindisi during the war , where they could patrol the path from the narrow Adriatic to the Mediterranean . 
 In December 1915 , an Austro @-@ Hungarian force of two cruisers and five destroyers attempted to intercept transports supplying the Serbian Army trapped in Albania . Quarto departed first , along with the British cruiser HMS Dartmouth and five French destroyers ; Nino Bixio followed two hours later with HMS Weymouth and four Italian destroyers . The first flotilla engaged in a running battle with the fleeing Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Helgoland but Nino Bixio 's group was too far behind to join the fray . By May 1917 , the reconnaissance forces at Brindisi had come under the command of Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton . On the night of 14 – 15 May , the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers Helgoland , Novara , and Saida raided the Otranto Barrage — a patrol line of drifters intended to block Austro @-@ Hungarian and German U @-@ boats . She did not participate in the ensuing Battle of the Otranto Straits because she did not have steam up in her boilers when the Italo @-@ British forces counterattacked . 
 The Regia Marina demobilized after the end of the war in 1918 and the draw @-@ down continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls in the postwar period . The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service , which ultimately cut her career short . She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap ; in contrast , the much more efficient Quarto , which had been built before Nino Bixio , remained in service for another decade .

 Stacy Carter first appeared on World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) ' s flagship program , Raw is War , in August 1999 . She debuted as Miss Kitty , an assistant to Debra , appointed to her by Jeff Jarrett , whom Debra managed . The partnership ended when Jarrett left the company after losing the Intercontinental Championship to Chyna at No Mercy . Because Jarrett was departing the company after the match , Carter began managing Chyna , and then started dressing in ' Chyna @-@ like ' clothing and wearing a black wig . 
 At Armageddon in December 1999 , Miss Kitty won her only WWF Women 's Championship in a Four Corners Evening Gown Pool match by defeating then @-@ champion Ivory , Jacqueline , and Barbara " BB " Bush by stripping them of their gowns . The special guest referees were The Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young . After the match , Miss Kitty stripped out of her dress in celebration and quickly flashed the crowd her breasts . This was the first instance of intentional nudity in the WWF . The following evening , she announced before successfully defending her title in a Chocolate Pudding Match that she was changing her name to The Kat . The Kat then appeared at the Royal Rumble in the ' Miss Royal Rumble Swimsuit Contest ' , where she appeared in a bikini made out of bubble wrap . The contest , however , was won by Mae Young . She lost the Championship on the January 31 edition of Raw to <unk> in a Lumberjill <unk> match , a match that took place in a snow filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers whose purpose was to keep The Kat and <unk> from leaving the pool . 
 The Kat then began an on @-@ screen rivalry with Terri Runnels , although neither were trained wrestlers . At WrestleMania 2000 , Runnels ( accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah ) defeated The Kat ( with Mae Young ) in a catfight . Val Venis was the special guest referee , but he was distracted during the match when Young kissed him , which allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring . When Venis saw her out of the ring , he declared Runnels the winner . Post @-@ match , The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping off her pants to expose her thong . The feud continued , and the duo had an arm wrestling match at <unk> . Carter was victorious , but after the match , Runnels pulled The Kat 's top off , exposing her breasts , which Carter allowed instead of acting disgusted or embarrassed . The two women continued to feud throughout the summer , often in mixed tag matches . In June 2000 , Carter attempted to regain the Women 's Championship by entering a battle royal to become the # 1 contender , but she was eliminated by her rival Terri . The feud resurfaced in a ' Thong Stink Face ' match at SummerSlam , which The Kat won by performing a <unk> on Runnels . 
 In early 2001 , The Kat began a new storyline with a stable called the Right to Censor , a group of conservative wrestlers , where she demanded equal time for the " right for nudity " . At No Way Out , Jerry Lawler , who was representing The Kat , lost a match to Steven Richards , the head of the stable , after The Kat mistakenly hit Lawler with the Women 's Championship belt . As a result of Lawler losing the match , she was forced to join the stable . On February 27 , 2001 , however , Carter was released from the WWF in the middle of the storyline . As a result , her husband Jerry Lawler also quit the company . According to Lawler , Carter was released from the WWF because Vince McMahon decided to end the angle with the Right to Censor . Other insiders cite Carter 's negative backstage attitude as the reason for her dismissal .

Carter moved to Memphis to live with her mother , Cathy , after graduating from high school . 
 Stacy Carter met Jerry Lawler , her future husband , at a charity softball game at Treadwell High School in Memphis on July 23 , 1989 , two months before her nineteenth birthday . She was attending the game with her mother , who was dating one of the players on the team for which Lawler also played . Lawler , however , was married at the time , and he claims that when he initially met Carter , he considered an affair . After Lawler separated from his wife , Carter moved in with him . When Carter first met Lawler , she was working as a bank teller . Lawler later helped her get a job at a photography studio , and she also opened and ran her own hair salon . 
 Lawler and Carter married in September 2000 . While they were together , former professional wrestler Missy Hyatt offered Carter $ 10 @,@ 000 to pose nude on her website , but Carter refused the offer . Carter decided to leave Lawler in July 2001 , and they separated not long after . She left the wrestling business upon separating from Jerry Lawler . She worked in the field of real estate in Lee County , Florida for Century 21 for some time after the divorce . 
 Carter and professional wrestler Nick Cvjetkovich announced their engagement on June 12 , 2010 . Cvjetkovich and Carter were married in St. Petersburg Florida July 29 , 2010 on the beach in front of many family and friends .

 = Technetium = 
 Technetium ( / <unk> / ) is a chemical element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43 . It is the lightest element of which all isotopes are radioactive ; none are stable . Only one other element , promethium , is followed ( in the periodic table ) by elements with stable isotopes . Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically , and only minute amounts are found in the Earth 's crust . Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores . The chemical properties of this silvery gray , crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese . 
 Many of technetium 's properties were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev before the element was discovered . Mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name <unk> ( Em ) . In 1937 , technetium ( specifically the technetium @-@ 97 isotope ) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced , hence its name ( from the Greek <unk> , meaning " artificial " , + -ium ) . 
 Its short @-@ lived gamma ray @-@ emitting nuclear isomer — technetium @-@ 99m — is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests . Technetium @-@ 99 is used as a gamma @-@ ray @-@ free source of beta particles . Long @-@ lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by @-@ products of fission of uranium @-@ 235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods . Because no isotope of technetium has a half @-@ life longer than 4 @.@ 2 million years ( technetium @-@ 98 ) , the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants , which are billions of years old , helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Search for element 43 = = = 
 From the 1860s through 1871 , early forms of the periodic table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained a gap between molybdenum ( element 42 ) and ruthenium ( element 44 ) . In 1871 , Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties . Mendeleev gave it the provisional name <unk> ( from <unk> , the Sanskrit word for one ) because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese . 
 = = = Early mis @-@ identifications = = = 
 Many early researchers , both before and after the periodic table was published , were eager to be the first to discover and name the missing element ; its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements . 
 = = = <unk> results = = = 
 German chemists Walter Noddack , Otto Berg , and Ida <unk> reported the discovery of element 75 and element 43 in 1925 , and named element 43 masurium ( after Masuria in eastern Prussia , now in Poland , the region where Walter Noddack 's family originated ) . The group bombarded columbite with a beam of electrons and deduced element 43 was present by examining X @-@ ray diffraction <unk> . The wavelength of the X @-@ rays produced is related to the atomic number by a formula derived by Henry Moseley in 1913 . The team claimed to detect a faint X @-@ ray signal at a wavelength produced by element 43 . Later experimenters could not replicate the discovery , and it was dismissed as an error for many years . Still , in 1933 , a series of articles on the discovery of elements quoted the name masurium for element 43 . Whether the 1925 team actually did discover element 43 is still debated . 
 = = = Official discovery and later history = = = 
 The discovery of element 43 was finally confirmed in a December 1936 experiment at the University of Palermo in Sicily by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè . In mid @-@ 1936 , Segrè visited the United States , first Columbia University in New York and then the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California . He persuaded cyclotron inventor Ernest Lawrence to let him take back some discarded cyclotron parts that had become radioactive . Lawrence mailed him a molybdenum foil that had been part of the deflector in the cyclotron . 
 Segrè enlisted his colleague Perrier to attempt to prove , through comparative chemistry , that the molybdenum activity was indeed from an element with the atomic number 43 . They succeeded in isolating the isotopes technetium @-@ 95m and technetium @-@ 97 . University of Palermo officials wanted them to name their discovery " <unk> " , after the Latin name for Palermo , <unk> . In 1947 element 43 was named after the Greek word <unk> , meaning " artificial " , since it was the first element to be artificially produced . Segrè returned to Berkeley and met Glenn T. Seaborg . They isolated the metastable isotope technetium @-@ 99m , which is now used in some ten million medical diagnostic procedures annually . 
 In 1952 , astronomer Paul W. Merrill in California detected the spectral signature of technetium ( specifically wavelengths of 403 @.@ 1 nm , 423 @.@ 8 nm , 426 @.@ 2 nm , and 429 @.@ 7 nm ) in light from S @-@ type red giants . The stars were near the end of their lives , yet were rich in this short @-@ lived element , indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions . This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars . More recently , such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s @-@ process . 
 Since that discovery , there have been many searches in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium . In 1962 , technetium @-@ 99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely small quantities ( about 0 @.@ 2 ng / kg ) ; there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium @-@ 238 . The Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium @-@ 99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium @-@ 99 .

 Technetium is a silvery @-@ gray radioactive metal with an appearance similar to platinum , commonly obtained as a gray powder . The crystal structure of the pure metal is hexagonal close @-@ packed . Atomic technetium has characteristic emission lines at these wavelengths of light : 363 @.@ 3 nm , 403 @.@ 1 nm , 426 @.@ 2 nm , 429 @.@ 7 nm , and 485 @.@ 3 nm . 
 The metal form is slightly paramagnetic , meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields , but will assume random orientations once the field is removed . Pure , metallic , single @-@ crystal technetium becomes a type @-@ II superconductor at temperatures below 7 @.@ 46 K. Below this temperature , technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth , greater than any other element except niobium . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Technetium is located in the seventh group of the periodic table , between rhenium and manganese . As predicted by the periodic law , its chemical properties are between those two elements . Of the two , technetium more closely resembles rhenium , particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds . Unlike manganese , technetium does not readily form cations ( ions with a net positive charge ) . Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from − 1 to + 7 , with + 4 , + 5 , and + 7 being the most common . Technetium dissolves in aqua regia , nitric acid , and concentrated sulfuric acid , but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration . 
 Technetium can catalyse the destruction of hydrazine by nitric acid , and this property is to its multiplicity of <unk> . This caused a problem in the separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing , where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state . The problem was exacerbated by the mutually @-@ enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage , and required a process modification .

 The reaction of technetium with hydrogen produces the negatively charged hydride <unk> − 
 9 ion , which has the same type of crystal structure as ( in other words , it is isostructural with ) <unk> − 
 9 . It consists of a trigonal prism with a technetium atom in the center and six hydrogen atoms at the corners . Three more hydrogen atoms make a triangle lying parallel to the base and crossing the prism in its center . Although those hydrogen atoms are not equivalent geometrically , their electronic structure is almost the same . This complex has a coordination number of 9 ( meaning that the technetium atom has nine neighbors ) , which is the highest for a technetium complex . Two hydrogen atoms in the complex can be replaced by sodium ( Na + ) or potassium ( K + ) ions . 
 Metallic technetium slowly tarnishes in moist air and , in powder form , burns in oxygen . Two oxides have been observed : <unk> and Tc2O7 . Under oxidizing conditions , which tend to strip electrons from atoms , technetium ( VII ) exists as the pertechnetate ion , TcO − 
 4 . 
 At temperatures of 400 – 450 ° C , technetium oxidizes to form the pale @-@ yellow heptoxide : 
 4 Tc + 7 O2 → 2 Tc2O7 
 This compound adopts a centrosymmetric structure with two types of Tc − O bonds with 167 and 184 pm bond lengths , and 180 ° Tc − O − Tc angle . 
 Technetium heptoxide is the precursor to sodium pertechnetate : 
 Tc2O7 + 2 NaOH → 2 <unk> + H2O 
 Black @-@ colored technetium dioxide ( <unk> ) can be produced by reduction of heptoxide with technetium or hydrogen . 
 <unk> acid ( <unk> ) is produced by reacting Tc2O7 with water or oxidizing acids , such as nitric acid , concentrated sulfuric acid , aqua regia , or a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids . The resulting dark red , hygroscopic substance is a strong acid and easily donates protons . In concentrated sulfuric acid , Tc ( VII ) <unk> anion converts to the octahedral form of <unk> ( VII ) acid <unk> ( OH ) ( H2O ) 2 . 
 The <unk> ( <unk> ) anion TcO − 
 4 consists of a tetrahedron with oxygens in the corners and a technetium atom in the center . Unlike permanganate ( MnO − 
 4 ) , it is only a weak oxidizing agent . <unk> is often used as a convenient water @-@ soluble source of technetium isotopes , such as 99mTc , and as a catalyst . 
 = = = = <unk> , selenides , and tellurides = = = = 
 Technetium forms various sulfides . <unk> is obtained by direct reacting technetium with elemental sulfur , while Tc2S7 is formed from <unk> acid as follows : 
 2 <unk> + 7 H2S → Tc2S7 + 8 H2O 
 In this reaction , technetium is reduced to Tc ( IV ) while excess sulfur forms a disulfide ligand . The produced technetium <unk> has a polymeric structure ( <unk> ( <unk> – S ) ( S2 ) <unk> ) n with a core similar to <unk> ( <unk> – S ) ( S2 ) 62 − . 
 Upon heating , technetium <unk> decomposes into disulfide and elemental sulfur : 
 Tc2S7 → 2 <unk> + 3 S 
 Analogous reactions occur with selenium and tellurium . 
 = = = = Clusters and organic complexes = = = = 
 Several technetium clusters are known , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The more stable <unk> and <unk> clusters have prism shapes where vertical pairs of Tc atoms are connected by triple bonds and the planar atoms by single bonds . Every technetium atom makes six bonds , and the remaining valence electrons can be saturated by one axial and two bridging ligand halogen atoms such as chlorine or bromine . 
 Technetium forms numerous organic complexes , relatively well @-@ investigated because they are important for nuclear medicine . Technetium carbonyl ( <unk> ( CO ) 10 ) is a white solid . In this molecule , two technetium atoms are weakly bound to each other ; each atom is surrounded by octahedra of five carbonyl ligands . The bond length between technetium atoms , 303 pm , is significantly larger than the distance between two atoms in metallic technetium ( 272 pm ) . Similar carbonyls are formed by technetium 's congeners , manganese and rhenium . 
 A technetium complex with an organic ligand ( shown in the figure on right ) is commonly used in nuclear medicine . It has a unique Tc − O functional group ( moiety ) oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the molecule , where the oxygen atom can be replaced by a nitrogen atom . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Technetium , with atomic number ( denoted Z ) 43 , is the lowest @-@ numbered element in the periodic table of which all isotopes are radioactive . The second @-@ lightest , exclusively radioactive element , promethium , has an atomic number of 61 . Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers , even when the total number of nucleons ( protons + neutrons ) is even , and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes . 
 The most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium @-@ 98 with a half @-@ life of 4 @.@ 2 million years ( Ma ) , technetium @-@ 97 with 2 @.@ 6 Ma , and technetium @-@ 99 with 211 @,@ 000 years . Thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 85 to 118 . Most of these have half @-@ lives that are less than an hour , the exceptions being technetium @-@ 93 ( half @-@ life : 2 @.@ 73 hours ) , technetium @-@ 94 ( half @-@ life : 4 @.@ 88 hours ) , technetium @-@ 95 ( half @-@ life : 20 hours ) , and technetium @-@ 96 ( half @-@ life : 4 @.@ 3 days ) . 
 The primary decay mode for isotopes lighter than technetium @-@ 98 ( <unk> ) is electron capture , producing molybdenum ( Z 
 = 42 ) . For technetium @-@ 98 and heavier isotopes , the primary mode is beta emission ( the emission of an electron or positron ) , producing ruthenium ( Z = 
 44 ) , with the exception that technetium @-@ 100 can decay both by beta emission and electron capture . 
 Technetium also has numerous nuclear isomers , which are isotopes with one or more excited nucleons . Technetium @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ; ' m ' stands for <unk> ) is the most stable , with a half @-@ life of 91 days ( 0 @.@ 0965 MeV ) . This is followed by technetium @-@ 95m ( half @-@ life : 61 days , 0 @.@ 03 MeV ) , and technetium @-@ 99m ( half @-@ life : 6 @.@ 01 hours , 0 @.@ 142 MeV ) . Technetium @-@ 99m emits only gamma rays and decays to technetium @-@ 99 . 
 Technetium @-@ 99 ( <unk> ) is a major product of the fission of uranium @-@ 235 ( 235U ) , making it the most common and most readily available isotope of technetium . One gram of technetium @-@ 99 produces 6 @.@ 2 × 108 disintegrations a second ( that is , 0 @.@ 62 GBq / g ) . 
 = = Occurrence and production = = 
 Only minute traces of technetium occur naturally in the Earth 's crust . This is because technetium @-@ 98 's half @-@ life is only 4 @.@ 2 million years . More a thousand of such periods have passed since the formation of the Earth , so the probability for the survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero . However , small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores . A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1 nanogram ( 10 − 9 g ) of technetium . Some red giant stars with the spectral types S- , M- , and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium . These red @-@ giants are known informally as technetium stars . 
 = = = Fission waste product = = = 
 In contrast to the rare natural occurrence , bulk quantities of technetium @-@ 99 are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods , which contain various fission products . The fission of a gram of uranium @-@ 235 in nuclear reactors yields 27 mg of technetium @-@ 99 , giving technetium a fission product yield of 6 @.@ 1 % . Other fissile isotopes produce similar yields of technetium , such as 4 @.@ 9 % from uranium @-@ 233 and 6 @.@ 21 % from plutonium @-@ 239 . An estimated 49 @,@ 000 TBq ( 78 metric tons ) of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors between 1983 and 1994 , by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium . Only a fraction of the production is used commercially . 
 Technetium @-@ 99 is produced by the nuclear fission of both uranium @-@ 235 and plutonium @-@ 239 . It is therefore present in radioactive waste and in the nuclear fallout of fission bomb explosions . Its decay , measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel , is dominant after about 104 to 106 years after the creation of the nuclear waste . From 1945 to 1994 , an estimated 160 TBq ( about 250 kg ) of technetium @-@ 99 was released into the environment during atmospheric nuclear tests . The amount of technetium @-@ 99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is on the order of 1000 TBq ( about 1600 kg ) , primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing ; most of this was discharged into the sea . <unk> methods have reduced emissions since then , but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium @-@ 99 into the environment is by the Sellafield plant , which released an estimated 550 TBq ( about 900 kg ) from 1995 – 1999 into the Irish Sea . From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90 TBq ( about 140 kg ) per year . Discharge of technetium into the sea resulted in contamination of some seafood with minuscule quantities of this element . For example , European lobster and fish from west Cumbria contain about 1 Bq / kg of technetium . 
 = = = Fission product for commercial use = = = 
 The metastable isotope technetium @-@ 99m is continuously produced as a fission product from the fission of uranium or plutonium in nuclear reactors . Because used fuel is allowed to stand for several years before reprocessing , all molybdenum @-@ 99 and technetium @-@ 99m is decayed by the time that the fission products are separated from the major actinides in conventional nuclear reprocessing . The liquid left after plutonium – uranium extraction ( PUREX ) contains a high concentration of technetium as TcO − 
 4 but almost all of this is technetium @-@ 99 , not technetium @-@ 99m . 
 The vast majority of the technetium @-@ 99m used in medical work is produced by irradiating dedicated highly enriched uranium targets in a reactor , extracting molybdenum @-@ 99 from the targets in reprocessing facilities , and recovering at the diagnostic center the technetium @-@ 99m produced upon decay of molybdenum @-@ 99 . Molybdenum @-@ 99 in the form of molybdate <unk> − 
 4 is adsorbed onto acid alumina ( Al 
 2O 
 3 ) in a shielded column chromatograph inside a technetium @-@ 99m generator ( " technetium cow " , also occasionally called a " molybdenum cow " ) . Molybdenum @-@ 99 has a half @-@ life of 67 hours , so short @-@ lived technetium @-@ 99m ( half @-@ life : 6 hours ) , which results from its decay , is being constantly produced . The soluble pertechnetate TcO − 
 4 can then be chemically extracted by elution using a saline solution . A drawback of this process is that it requires targets containing uranium @-@ 235 , which are subject to the security precautions of fissile materials . 
 Almost two @-@ thirds of the world 's supply comes from two reactors ; the National Research Universal Reactor at Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario , Canada , and the High Flux Reactor at Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group in <unk> , Netherlands . All major reactors that produce technetium @-@ 99m were built in the 1960s and are close to the end of life . The two new Canadian <unk> Applied Physics Lattice Experiment reactors planned and built to produce 200 % of the demand of technetium @-@ 99m relieved all other producers from building their own reactors . With the cancellation of the already tested reactors in 2008 , the future supply of technetium @-@ 99m became problematic . 
 The Chalk River reactor was shut down for maintenance in August 2009 , and reopened in August 2010 . The <unk> reactor had a 6 @-@ month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday , February 19 , 2010 , and reopened September 2010 . With millions of procedures relying on technetium @-@ 99m every year , the low supply has left a gap , leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years . Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium . 
 = = = Waste disposal = = = 
 The long half @-@ life of technetium @-@ 99 and its potential to form anionic species creates a major concern for long @-@ term disposal of radioactive waste . Many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at cationic species such as caesium ( e.g. , caesium @-@ 137 ) and strontium ( e.g. , strontium @-@ 90 ) . Hence the pertechnetate escapes through those processes . Current disposal options favor burial in continental , geologically stable rock . The primary danger with such practice is the likelihood that the waste will contact water , which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment . The anionic pertechnetate and iodide tend not to adsorb into the surfaces of minerals , and are likely to be washed away . By comparison plutonium , uranium , and caesium are tend to bind to soil particles . Technetium could be immobilized by some environments , such as microbial activity in lake bottom sediments , and the environmental chemistry of technetium is an area of active research . 
 An alternative disposal method , transmutation , has been demonstrated at CERN for technetium @-@ 99 . In this process , the technetium ( technetium @-@ 99 as a metal target ) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short @-@ lived technetium @-@ 100 ( half @-@ life = 16 seconds ) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium @-@ 100 . If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal , an extremely pure technetium target is needed ; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium are present in the target , they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target . The formation of ruthenium @-@ 106 ( half @-@ life 374 days ) from the ' fresh fission ' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal , which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used . 
 The actual separation of technetium @-@ 99 from spent nuclear fuel is a long process . During fuel reprocessing , it comes out as a component of the highly radioactive waste liquid . After sitting for several years , the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long @-@ lived isotopes , including technetium @-@ 99 , becomes feasible . A series of chemical processes yields technetium @-@ 99 metal of high purity . 
 = = = Neutron activation = = = 
 Molybdenum @-@ 99 , which decays to form technetium @-@ 99m , can be formed by the neutron activation of molybdenum @-@ 98 . When needed , other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission , but are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes ( for example , technetium @-@ 97 can be made by neutron irradiation of ruthenium @-@ 96 ) .

 The feasibility of technetium @-@ 99m production with the 22 @-@ MeV @-@ proton bombardment of a molybdenum @-@ 100 target in medical cyclotrons following the reaction <unk> ( p , 2n ) 99mTc was demonstrated in 1971 . The recent shortages of medical technetium @-@ 99m reignited the interest in its production by proton bombardment of isotopically @-@ enriched ( > 99 @.@ 5 % ) molybdenum @-@ 100 targets . Other techniques are being investigated for obtaining molybdenum @-@ 99 from molybdenum @-@ 100 via ( n , 2n ) or ( γ , n ) reactions in particle accelerators .

 Technetium @-@ 99m ( " m " indicates that this is a metastable nuclear isomer ) is used in radioactive isotope medical tests . For example Technetium @-@ 99m is a radioactive tracer that medical imaging equipment tracks in the human body . It is well suited to the role because it emits readily detectable 140 keV gamma rays , and its half @-@ life is 6 @.@ 01 hours ( meaning that about 94 % of it decays to technetium @-@ 99 in 24 hours ) . The chemistry of technetium allows it to be bound to a variety of biochemical compounds , each of which determines how it is metabolized and deposited in the body , and this single single isotope can be used for a multitude of diagnostic tests . More than 50 common radiopharmaceuticals are based on technetium @-@ 99m for imaging and functional studies of the brain , heart muscle , thyroid , lungs , liver , gall bladder , kidneys , skeleton , blood , and tumors . 
 The longer @-@ lived isotope , technetium @-@ 95m with a half @-@ life of 61 days , is used as a radioactive tracer to study the movement of technetium in the environment and in plant and animal systems . 
 = = = Industrial and chemical = = = 
 Technetium @-@ 99 decays almost entirely by beta decay , emitting beta particles with consistent low energies and no accompanying gamma rays . Moreover , its long half @-@ life means that this emission decreases very slowly with time . It can also be extracted to a high chemical and isotopic purity from radioactive waste . For these reasons , it is a National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) standard beta emitter , and is used for equipment calibration . Technetium @-@ 99 has also been proposed for optoelectronic devices and nanoscale nuclear batteries . 
 Like rhenium and palladium , technetium can serve as a catalyst . In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol , it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium . However , its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications . 
 When steel is immersed in water , adding a small concentration ( 55 ppm ) of potassium pertechnetate ( VII ) to the water protects the steel from corrosion , even if the temperature is raised to 250 ° C ( 523 K ) . For this reason , pertechnetate has been used as an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel , although technetium 's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self @-@ contained systems . While ( for example ) CrO2 − 
 4 can also inhibit corrosion , it requires a concentration ten times as high . In one experiment , a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20 years and was still <unk> . The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood , but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer ( passivation ) . One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion ; the same effect explains how iron powder can be used to remove pertechnetate from water . ( Activated carbon can also be used for the same purpose . ) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added . 
 As noted , the radioactive nature of technetium ( 3 MBq / L at the concentrations required ) makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations . Nevertheless , corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed ( but never adopted ) for use in boiling water reactors . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Technetium plays no natural biological role and is not normally found in the human body . Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission , and spreads more readily than many radionuclides . It appears to have low chemical toxicity . For example , no significant change in blood formula , body and organ weights , and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15 µg of technetium @-@ 99 per gram of food for several weeks . The radiological toxicity of technetium ( per unit of mass ) is a function of compound , type of radiation for the isotope in question , and the isotope 's half @-@ life . 
 All isotopes of technetium must be handled carefully . The most common isotope , technetium @-@ 99 , is a weak beta emitter ; such radiation is stopped by the walls of laboratory glassware . The primary hazard when working with technetium is inhalation of dust ; such radioactive contamination in the lungs can pose a significant cancer risk . For most work , careful handling in a fume hood is sufficient , and a glove box is not needed .

 George McTurnan Kahin was born on January 25 , 1918 , in Baltimore , Maryland , and grew up in Seattle , Washington . He received a B.S. in history from Harvard University in 1940 . 
 Kahin married Margaret Baker in 1942 , but the marriage ended in divorce . During World War II , Kahin served in the United States Army between 1942 and 1945 , where " he was trained as one of a group of 60 GIs who were to be parachuted into Japanese @-@ occupied Indonesia in advance of Allied forces " . However , the operation was canceled after it was determined that U.S. forces would bypass the Indies after the Potsdam Conference . As a result , his unit was sent to the European theater . He earned the rank of sergeant before leaving the Army . Kahin 's interest in Southeast Asia developed during this period , and he learned to speak Indonesian and Dutch . 
 Kahin returned after the war to complete his M.A. from Stanford University , which he received in 1946 . His thesis was titled The Political Position of the Chinese in Indonesia ( Kahin 1946 ) , describing the role of Chinese Indonesians in the new country . He continued to pursue of his interest in Southeast Asia , going to Indonesia in 1948 to conduct research during the Indonesian National Revolution . During his work , he was arrested by Dutch colonial authorities and expelled from the country . Kahin received a Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins University in 1951 . His dissertation , titled Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia ( Kahin 1952 ) , is considered a classic on Indonesian history .

 We voted for the maintenance of academic freedom , believing that without that essential quality there can be no relationship of any kind between blacks and a university , because without that quality you don 't have a university . 
 — George McTurnan Kahin , April 25 , 1969 
 On April 19 , 1969 , Cornell 's Afro @-@ American Society occupied the Willard Straight Hall student union in protest against " the university 's racist attitudes and irrelevant curriculum " regarding racial issues . The university was divided between proponents of the inclusion of the principles of social justice in course instruction and advocates of academic freedom for the faculty . This clash affected the Department of Government , where Kahin and a number of professors defending academic freedom resided . Many of these professors had considered leaving the university due to the administration 's policies promoting racial justice , and many did following the end of the occupation . The following week , the Department of Government organized a teach @-@ in on academic freedom , and Kahin was invited to speak at the event by department chair Peter <unk> . Historian Walter <unk> would later remember his remarks as " the most eloquent speech about academic freedom I have ever encountered anywhere up to that time or since that time " .

 Kahin was a leading critic of the Vietnam War and opposed United States involvement . He participated in a teach @-@ in in May 1965 and led the anti @-@ war position . Later , he co @-@ wrote The United States in Vietnam ( Kahin & Lewis 1969 ) with Stanford professor John Lewis , a publication which helped to turn people in academia against U.S. intervention in Vietnam . It was one of the most comprehensive studies of American involvement in the war to date . According to Kahin and Lewis , American policy was based on a distorted view of Vietnam . " Vietnam is a single nation , not two , " Kahin and Lewis argued , and " South Vietnam constitutes an artificial creation whose existence depends on the sustained application of American power . " 
 When U.S. Senator George McGovern campaigned in the 1972 presidential election on a platform to end the war , Kahin became his foreign policy adviser .

 Kahin , along with his graduate student Gareth Porter , was optimistic about the prospect of a takeover of Cambodia by the communist Khmer Rouge . In early 1975 , Kahin predicted of a Khmer Rouge victory : " I know of no basis for assuming that there is going to be a major bloodbath . " He also spoke highly of the Khmer Rouge leadership , particularly Khieu Samphan , whom he called " a very talented person . " 
 Following the victory of the Khmer Rouge and the brutal evacuation of Phnom Penh , Kahin backed Porter 's attempts to discredit reports of the mass killings . In his foreword to Porter 's book Cambodia : Starvation and Revolution , Kahin argued that Khmer Rouge policies " were not , then , applications of some irrational ideology , but reflected pragmatic solutions by leaders who had to rely exclusively on Cambodia 's own food resources and who lacked facilities for its internal transport .

 After Kahin was expelled from Indonesia in 1949 , he helped young Indonesian diplomats Sumitro <unk> , <unk> Sastrosatomo , and Soedjatmoko during their work at the United Nations and in Washington , D.C. He also developed a close relationship with Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta , the first President and Vice President of Indonesia . In his book Subversion as Foreign Policy ( Kahin & Kahin 1995 ) , he attempted to clear former Prime Minister Mohammad Natsir , with whom he also developed a personal relationship , of any involvement with a rebellion movement against the Indonesian government . The book also described a " destructive relationship " between the United States and Indonesia during Sukarno 's presidency . 
 Kahin helped develop Indonesian studies in the United States at a time when the majority of material on Indonesia was held at Leiden University in the Netherlands . At Cornell , he introduced a postgraduate education program for diplomats from around the world who were in the middle of their careers . He also helped many Indonesian intellectuals , including <unk> Noer and sociologist Selo Soemardjan , obtain education in the United States . Several of Kahin 's students and associates , including Herbert Feith , went on to establish similar programs at the universities where they subsequently taught . 
 At one point , the United States blocked Kahin 's passport , and the Suharto government in Indonesia also denied him a visa . In 1991 , Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas awarded Kahin the Bintang Jasa <unk> ( English : Medal of Merit , First Class ) for his work as a " pioneer and precursor of Indonesian studies in the U.S. "

 Kahin died at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester , New York , on January 29 , 2000 . Several months after his death , a memorial service was held in Ithaca , New York , for him and to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War . A memoir which he never completed was brought to publication by his wife Audrey Richey Kahin ( Kahin 2003 ) . Kahin is also survived by his son Brian , daughter Sharon , sister Peggy Kahin Webb , and two grandchildren .

 = Frog = 
 Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short @-@ bodied , tailless amphibians composing the order Anura ( Ancient Greek an- , without + oura , tail ) . The oldest fossil " proto @-@ frog " appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar , but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian , 265 million years ago . Frogs are widely distributed , ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions , but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforests . There are approximately 4 @,@ 800 recorded species , accounting for over 85 % of extant amphibian species . They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders . 
 The body plan of an adult frog is generally characterized by a stout body , protruding eyes , cleft tongue , limbs folded underneath , and the absence of a tail in adults . Besides living in fresh water and on dry land , the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees . The skin of the frog is glandular , with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic . <unk> species of frog tend to be called toads but the distinction between frogs and toads is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than taxonomy or evolutionary history ; some toads are more closely related to frogs than to other toads . Frogs ' skins vary in colour from well @-@ camouflaged dappled brown , grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and warn off predators . 
 Frogs typically lay their eggs in water . The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills . They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous , omnivorous or <unk> diets . The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults . A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage . Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates , but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit . Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass . They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world 's ecosystems . The skin is semi @-@ permeable , making them susceptible to dehydration , so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats . Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations , particularly in their breeding season , and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates , to fend off predators and to generally survive . 
 Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature , symbolism and religion . Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s . More than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s . The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease , chytridiomycosis , has spread around the world . Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them . 
 = = Etymology and taxonomy = = 
 The name frog derives from Old English <unk> , abbreviated to <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , probably deriving from Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European <unk> = " to jump " . About 88 % of amphibian species are classified in the order Anura . These include around 4 @,@ 810 species in 33 families , of which the Leptodactylidae ( 1 @,@ 100 spp . ) , Hylidae ( 800 spp . ) and Ranidae ( 750 spp . ) are the richest in species . 
 The use of the common names " frog " and " toad " has no taxonomic justification . From a classification perspective , all members of the order Anura are frogs , but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered " true toads " . The use of the term " frog " in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi @-@ aquatic and have smooth , moist skins ; the term " toad " generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry , warty skins . There are numerous exceptions to this rule . The European fire @-@ bellied toad ( Bombina bombina ) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian golden frog ( Atelopus <unk> ) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin . 
 The Anura include all modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition . The characteristics of anuran adults include : 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae , the presence of a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae , no tail , a long and forward @-@ sloping ilium , shorter fore limbs than hind limbs , radius and ulna fused , tibia and fibula fused , elongated ankle bones , absence of a prefrontal bone , presence of a hyoid plate , a lower jaw without teeth ( with the exception of <unk> guentheri ) consisting of three pairs of bones ( <unk> , dentary , and <unk> , with the last pair being absent in <unk> ) , an unsupported tongue , lymph spaces underneath the skin , and a muscle , the protractor lentis , attached to the lens of the eye . The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles . 
 Frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders : <unk> , which includes four families of primitive frogs ; <unk> , which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs ; and Neobatrachia , by far the largest group , which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs , including most common species throughout the world . The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies <unk> and <unk> . This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae , the structure of the pectoral girdle , and the morphology of tadpoles . While this classification is largely accepted , relationships among families of frogs are still debated . 
 Some species of anurans hybridize readily . For instance , the edible frog ( Pelophylax esculentus ) is a hybrid between the pool frog ( P. <unk> ) and the marsh frog ( P. ridibundus ) . The fire @-@ bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata are similar in forming hybrids . These are less fertile than their parents , giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated . A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe @-@ finned fishes . This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split . Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl @-@ origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories . The <unk> seemed to have originated in Africa / India , the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea . Other researchers , while agreeing with the main thrust of this study , questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data . They proposed that the date of <unk> diversification should be placed in the Permian , rather less than 300 million years ago , a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data . A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological , as well as molecular data , came to the conclusion that Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli . The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous , some 290 to 305 million years ago . The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago , rather later than most molecular studies suggest , with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago . 
 In 2008 , <unk> <unk> , a temnospondyl with many <unk> and salamander @-@ like characteristics , was discovered in Texas . It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link , a stem <unk> close to the common ancestor of frogs and salamanders , consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other ( forming a clade called Batrachia ) than they are to caecilians . However , others have suggested that <unk> <unk> was only a <unk> temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians . 
 Salientia ( Latin <unk> ( <unk> ) , " to jump " ) is the name of the total group that includes modern frogs in the order Anura as well as their close fossil relatives , the " proto @-@ frogs " or " stem @-@ frogs " . The common features possessed by these proto @-@ frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae ( modern frogs have eight or 9 ) , a long and forward @-@ sloping ilium in the pelvis , the presence of a frontoparietal bone , and a lower jaw without teeth . The earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are Triadobatrachus <unk> , from the early Triassic period of Madagascar ( about 250 million years ago ) , and <unk> <unk> , from the Early Triassic of Poland ( about the same age as Triadobatrachus ) . The skull of Triadobatrachus is frog @-@ like , being broad with large eye sockets , but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs . These include a longer body with more vertebrae . The tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs . The tibia and fibula bones are also separate , making it probable that Triadobatrachus was not an efficient leaper . 
 The earliest known " true frogs " that fall into the anuran lineage proper all lived in the early Jurassic period . One such early frog species , Prosalirus <unk> , was discovered in 1995 in the Kayenta Formation of Arizona and dates back to the Early Jurassic epoch ( 199 @.@ 6 to 175 million years ago ) , making Prosalirus somewhat more recent than Triadobatrachus . Like the latter , Prosalirus did not have greatly enlarged legs , but had the typical three @-@ pronged pelvic structure of modern frogs . Unlike Triadobatrachus , Prosalirus had already lost nearly all of its tail and was well adapted for jumping . Another Early Jurassic frog is <unk> <unk> , which is known only from dorsal and ventral impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be 33 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) from snout to vent . <unk> <unk> from the middle Jurassic is slightly younger , about 155 – 170 million years old . The main evolutionary changes in this species involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail . The evolution of modern Anura likely was complete by the Jurassic period . Since then , evolutionary changes in chromosome numbers have taken place about 20 times faster in mammals than in frogs , which means speciation is occurring more rapidly in mammals . 
 Frog fossils have been found on all continents except Antarctica , but biogeographic evidence suggests they also inhabited Antarctica in an earlier era when the climate was warmer . 
 A cladogram showing the relationships of the different families of frogs in the clade Anura can be seen in the table above . This diagram , in the form of a tree , shows how each frog family is related to other families , with each node representing a point of common ancestry . It is based on Frost et al . ( 2006 ) , Heinicke et al . ( 2009 ) and <unk> and Wiens ( 2011 ) . 
 = = Morphology and physiology = = 
 Frogs have no tail , except as larvae , and most have long hind legs , elongated ankle bones , webbed toes , no claws , large eyes , and a smooth or warty skin . They have short vertebral columns , with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused <unk> ( urostyle or coccyx ) . Like other amphibians , oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins . This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air , respiring through their skins . The ribs are poorly developed , so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them . For the skin to serve as a respiratory organ , it must remain moist . This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment , some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream . This may be one of the causes of the worldwide decline in frog populations . 
 Frogs range in size from the recently discovered 7 @.@ 7 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 30 in ) Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea to the 300 @-@ millimetre ( 12 in ) goliath frog ( Conraua goliath ) of Cameroon . The skin hangs loosely on the body because of the lack of loose connective tissue . Frogs have three eyelid membranes : one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater , and two vary from translucent to opaque . They have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and , in some species , is covered by skin . True toads completely lack teeth , but most frogs have them , specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue . These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths . No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole . The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed , a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head . The African bullfrog ( <unk> ) , which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs , has cone shaped bony projections called <unk> processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth . 
 = = = Feet and legs = = = 
 The structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species , depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground , in water , in trees or in burrows . Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators , and numerous adaptations help them to do so . Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were , with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose . The tibia , fibula , and tarsals have been fused into a single , strong bone , as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs ( which must absorb the impact on landing ) . The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow the frog to push against the ground for a longer period on take @-@ off . The <unk> has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which , in specialist jumpers such as ranids and <unk> , functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps . The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis . This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap . 
 The muscular system has been similarly modified . The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition ( one muscle to flex the knee , a different muscle to extend it ) , as is seen in most other limbed animals . However , in modern frogs , almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping , with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture . The muscles have also been greatly enlarged , with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17 % of the total mass of the frog . 
 Many frogs have webbed feet and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water . The completely aquatic African dwarf frog ( Hymenochirus sp . ) has fully webbed toes , whereas those of White 's tree frog ( Litoria caerulea ) , an arboreal species , are only a quarter or half webbed . 
 Arboreal frogs have pads located on the ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces . These are not suction pads , the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands . When the frog applies pressure , the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension . This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces , but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet . 
 In many arboreal frogs , a small " intercalary structure " on each toe increases the surface area touching the substrate . Furthermore , since hopping through trees can be dangerous , many arboreal frogs have hip joints to allow both hopping and walking . Some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes . This allows the frogs to " parachute " or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to another . 
 Ground @-@ dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs . Most have smaller toe pads , if any , and little webbing . Some burrowing frogs such as Couch 's spadefoot ( Scaphiopus <unk> ) have a flap @-@ like toe extension on the hind feet , a keratinised tubercle often referred to as a spade , that helps them to burrow . 
 Sometimes during the tadpole stage , one of the developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph . In some cases , the full leg still grows , but in others it does not , although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs . Occasionally , a parasitic flatworm ( Ribeiroia ondatrae ) digs into the rear of a tadpole , causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two . 
 = = = Skin = = = 
 A frog 's skin is protective , has a respiratory function , can absorb water and helps control body temperature . It has many glands , particularly on the head and back , which often exude distasteful and toxic substances . The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist , protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria , and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators . The skin is shed every few weeks . It usually splits down the middle of the back and across the belly , and the frog pulls its arms and legs free . The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten . 
 Being cold @-@ blooded , frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature . To warm up , they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface ; if they overheat , they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air . This posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body . The colour of a frog 's skin is used for thermoregulation . In cool damp conditions , the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day . The grey foam @-@ nest tree frog ( <unk> <unk> ) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating . 
 Many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin , especially around the pelvic area , but the permeability of a frog 's skin can also result in water loss . <unk> located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation . Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus . Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue @-@ like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet . Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin , and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion . Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water , including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water @-@ conserving position . Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours . This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface , and thus reduces water loss . Woodhouse 's toad ( Bufo <unk> ) , if given access to water after confinement in a dry location , sits in the shallows to rehydrate . The male hairy frog ( <unk> robustus ) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs , giving it a bristly appearance . They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase the area of the skin available for respiration . 
 Some species have bony plates embedded in their skin , a trait that appears to have evolved independently several times . In certain other species , the skin at the top of the head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co @-@ ossified with the bones of the skull ( exostosis ) . 
 Camouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frogs . Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal ; during the day , they seek out a position where they can blend into the background and remain undetected . Some frogs have the ability to change colour , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours . For example , White 's tree frog ( Litoria caerulea ) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature , and the Pacific tree frog ( Pseudacris <unk> ) has green and brown morphs , plain or spotted , and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour . Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground @-@ dwelling frogs , for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage . Certain frogs change colour between night and day , as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract . 
 = = = Respiration and circulation = = = 
 The skin of a frog is permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide , as well as to water . There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater , oxygen diffuses directly into the blood . When not submerged , a frog breathes by a process known as buccal pumping . Its lungs are similar to those of humans , but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration , and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out . Instead , it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils , which in many species can then be closed by valves . When the floor of the mouth is compressed , air is forced into the lungs . The fully aquatic Bornean flat @-@ headed frog ( <unk> <unk> ) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely . 
 Frogs have three @-@ chambered hearts , a feature they share with lizards . <unk> blood from the lungs and de @-@ oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through separate atria . When these chambers contract , the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel , the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood . The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of the two types of blood . These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible . 
 Some species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water . The Lake Titicaca frog ( <unk> <unk> ) is one such species and has wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange . It normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it . 
 = = = Digestion and excretion = = = 
 Frogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed . These teeth are very weak , and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey . Instead , the frog uses its sticky , cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey . The tongue normally lies coiled in the mouth , free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front . It can be shot out and retracted at great speed . Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands . The eyes assist in the swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat . The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up . It then proceeds to the small intestine ( duodenum and ileum ) where most digestion occurs . Pancreatic juice from the pancreas , and bile , produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder , are secreted into the small intestine , where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed . The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca . 
 Although adapted to terrestrial life , frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively . When they are on land , much water is lost by evaporation from the skin . The excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood . Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules . The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea , a less toxic product , by most terrestrial adults . A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid . The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca . All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent . 
 = = = Reproductive system = = = 
 In the male frog , the two testes are attached to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts . It then travels on through the ureters , which are consequently known as <unk> ducts . There is no penis , and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them . The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior . 
 When frogs mate , the male climbs on the back of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body , either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs . This position is called amplexus and may be held for several days . The male frog has certain hormone @-@ dependent secondary sexual characteristics . These include the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season , to give him a firm hold . The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs , usually wrapped in jelly , as spawn . In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female . Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks , particularly in the breeding season , and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound . 
 = = = Nervous system = = = 
 The frog has a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain , spinal cord and nerves . Many parts of the frog 's brain correspond with those of humans . It consists of two olfactory lobes , two cerebral hemispheres , a pineal body , two optic lobes , a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata . Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum , and the medulla oblongata regulates respiration , digestion and other automatic functions . The relative size of the cerebrum in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans . Frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain , and ten pairs of spinal nerves which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord . By contrast , all amniotes ( mammals , birds and reptiles ) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves . 
 = = = Sight = = = 
 The eyes of most frogs are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges . They provide binocular vision over a field of 100 ° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360 ° . They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water . Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection , especially when the frog is swimming . Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head , a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above . The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes . The common toad ( Bufo bufo ) has golden irises and horizontal slit @-@ like pupils , the red @-@ eyed tree frog ( <unk> <unk> ) has vertical slit pupils , the poison dart frog has dark irises , the fire @-@ bellied toad ( Bombina spp . ) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog ( <unk> spp . ) has circular ones . The irises of the southern toad ( <unk> terrestris ) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin . 
 The distant vision of a frog is better than its near vision . Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is , the less well it is seen . When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended . Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable but it has been shown that it responds positively to blue light , perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened . 
 = = = Hearing = = = 
 Frogs can hear both in the air and below water . They do not have external ears ; the eardrums ( tympanic membranes ) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye . The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls . In some species such as the bullfrog , the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog ; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females , the eyes and tympani are much the same size . A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear . The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation . In the inner ear , the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea , the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla . The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies . Because the cochlea is short , frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds . This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics . In some species that inhabit arid regions , the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state . A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight . 
 = = = Call = = = 
 The call or croak of a frog is unique to its species . Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat . In most calling frogs , the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs , membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth , that distend during the amplification of the call . Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away . 
 Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and <unk> lack vocal sacs but can still produce a loud call . Their buccal cavity is enlarged and dome @-@ shaped , acting as a resonance chamber that amplifies the sound . Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy , flowing water . They need to use an alternative means to communicate . The coastal tailed frog ( <unk> <unk> ) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize . 
 The main reason for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate . Males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites . Females of many frog species , such as the common tree frog ( <unk> <unk> ) , reply to the male calls , which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony . Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency , attributes that stand out in a crowd . The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess , the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring . 
 A different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male . This is a distinct <unk> sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body . Tree frogs and some non @-@ aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower . Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males . All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed . A distress call , emitted by some frogs when they are in danger , is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher @-@ pitched call . It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or <unk> the attacker so that it releases the frog . 
 Many species of frog have deep calls . The croak of the American bullfrog ( Rana <unk> ) is sometimes written as " jug o ' rum " . The Pacific tree frog ( Pseudacris <unk> ) produces the onomatopoeic " <unk> " often heard in films . Other renderings of frog calls into speech include " <unk> <unk> <unk> " , the call of the marsh frog ( Pelophylax ridibundus ) in The Frogs , an Ancient Greek comic drama by Aristophanes . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 During extreme conditions , some frogs enter a state of torpor and remain inactive for months . In colder regions , many species of frog hibernate in winter . Those that live on land such as the American toad ( Bufo americanus ) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant . Others , less proficient at digging , find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves . Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog ( Rana catesbeiana ) normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie , semi @-@ immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water . Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves . Some frogs can even survive being frozen . Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose . An apparently lifeless , frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up . 
 At the other extreme , the striped burrowing frog ( Cyclorana <unk> ) regularly <unk> during the hot , dry season in Australia , surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of the year . It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin . Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation , the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased . This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner . This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold @-@ blooded and have no need to generate heat . Other research showed that , to provide these energy requirements , muscles atrophy , but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected . Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius . 
 = = Locomotion = = 
 Different species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including jumping , running , walking , swimming , burrowing , climbing and gliding . 
 Jumping 
 Frogs are generally recognized as exceptional jumpers and , relative to their size , the best jumpers of all vertebrates . The striped rocket frog , Litoria <unk> , can leap over 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) , a distance that is more than fifty times its body length of 5 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) . There are tremendous differences between species in jumping capability . Within a species , jump distance increases with increasing size , but relative jumping distance ( body @-@ lengths jumped ) decreases . The Indian skipper frog ( Euphlyctis <unk> ) has the ability to leap out of the water from a position floating on the surface . The tiny northern cricket frog ( Acris <unk> ) can " <unk> " across the surface of a pond with a series of short rapid jumps . 
 Slow @-@ motion photography shows that the muscles have passive flexibility . They are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position , then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air . The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended , streamlined position for the duration of the jump . In some extremely capable jumpers , such as the Cuban tree frog ( Osteopilus septentrionalis ) and the northern leopard frog ( Rana pipiens ) , the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing . When the muscles contract , the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone . Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle @-@ powered acceleration . A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers . 
 Walking and running 
 Frogs in the families Bufonidae , <unk> , and <unk> have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump . When they try to move rapidly , they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait . The Great Plains narrow @-@ mouthed toad ( <unk> <unk> ) has been described as having a gait that is " a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length " . In an experiment , Fowler 's toad ( Bufo fowleri ) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds . By measuring the toad 's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high @-@ intensity activity . 
 The red @-@ legged running frog ( <unk> maculata ) has short , slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping . It can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind legs are used alternately . Slow @-@ motion photography shows , unlike a horse that can trot or gallop , the frog 's gait remained similar at slow , medium , and fast speeds . This species can also climb trees and shrubs , and does so at night to catch insects . The Indian skipper frog ( Euphlyctis <unk> ) has broad feet and can run across the surface of the water for several metres ( yards ) . 
 Swimming 
 Frogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities . The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong . The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area of the foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water . Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization . They have inflexible vertebral columns , flattened , streamlined bodies , lateral line systems , and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet . Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side . 
 Burrowing 
 Some frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground . They tend to have rounded bodies , short limbs , small heads with bulging eyes , and hind feet adapted for excavation . An extreme example of this is the purple frog ( <unk> <unk> ) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground . It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools . It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump , rounded body . Because of this fossorial existence , it was first described in 2003 , being new to the scientific community at that time , although previously known to local people . 
 The spadefoot toads of North America are also adapted to underground life . The Plains spadefoot toad ( <unk> <unk> ) is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the metatarsals of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground . As it digs , the toad wriggles its hips from side to side to sink into the loose soil . It has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage . In winter , it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) . The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end . During this time , urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by osmosis to supply the toad 's needs . <unk> toads are " explosive breeders " , all emerging from their burrows at the same time and converging on temporary pools , attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location . 
 The burrowing frogs of Australia have a rather different lifestyle . The western spotted frog ( Heleioporus <unk> ) digs a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage . Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow . The eggs partially develop there , but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall . The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development . Madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter . One of these , the green burrowing frog ( <unk> marmorata ) , has a flattened head with a short snout and well @-@ developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation . It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes . It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains . 
 Climbing 
 Tree frogs live high in the canopy , where they scramble around on the branches , twigs , and leaves , sometimes never coming down to earth . The " true " tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae , but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit , a case of convergent evolution . These include the glass frogs ( <unk> ) , the bush frogs ( <unk> ) , some of the narrow @-@ mouthed frogs ( <unk> ) , and the shrub frogs ( <unk> ) . Most tree frogs are under 10 cm ( 4 in ) in length , with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips . The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat @-@ topped , hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus . These toe pads , moistened by the mucus , provide the grip on any wet or dry surface , including glass . The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also surface tension and viscosity . Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed . Some members of the subfamily <unk> have opposable toes on their feet . The reticulated leaf frog ( <unk> <unk> ) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet . This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat . 
 Gliding 
 During the evolutionary history of the frog , several different groups have independently taken to the air . Some frogs in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor . Typical of them is Wallace 's flying frog ( <unk> <unk> ) from Malaysia and Borneo . It has large feet with the fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and the digits fully webbed . <unk> of skin occur on the lateral margins of the limbs and across the tail region . With the digits splayed , the limbs outstretched , and these flaps spread , it can glide considerable distances , but is unable to undertake powered flight . It can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to 15 m ( 49 ft ) between trees . 
 = = Life history = = 
 Like other amphibians , the life cycle of a frog normally starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills , commonly known as a tadpole . After further growth , during which it develops limbs and lungs , the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged . After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature , air @-@ breathing frog . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Two main types of reproduction occur in frogs , prolonged breeding and explosive breeding . In the former , adopted by the majority of species , adult frogs at certain times of year assemble at a pond , lake or stream to breed . Many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae . This often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals . In explosive breeders , mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area . In these frogs , mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pools before they dry up . 
 Among prolonged breeders , males usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned . This means that males outnumber females at the water 's edge and defend territories from which they expel other males . They advertise their presence by calling , often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs . Larger , stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories . Females select their mates at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice . In some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call . They may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory . Calling is an energy @-@ sapping activity . Sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite . 
 In explosive breeders , the first male that finds a suitable breeding location , such as a temporary pool , calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on the pool . Explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away . The spadefoot toads ( Scaphiopus spp . ) of North America fall into this category . Mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction . In some years , suitable conditions may not occur and the frogs may go for two or more years without breeding . Some female New Mexico spadefoot toads ( <unk> multiplicata ) only spawn half of the available eggs at a time , perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later . 
 At the breeding site , the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body . Typically , amplexus takes place in the water , the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm ; fertilization is external . In many species such as the Great Plains toad ( Bufo cognatus ) , the male restrains the eggs with his back feet , holding them in place for about three minutes . Members of the West African genus <unk> are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous ; <unk> <unk> , Eleutherodactylus <unk> and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous . In these species , fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs , except L. <unk> , which give birth to tadpoles .

 = = = = Eggs / <unk> = = = = 
 Frogs ' embryos are typically surrounded by several layers of gelatinous material . When several eggs are clumped together , they are collectively known as <unk> . The jelly provides support and protection while allowing the passage of oxygen , carbon dioxide and ammonia . It absorbs moisture and swells on contact with water . After fertilization , the innermost portion <unk> to allow free movement of the developing embryo . In certain species , such as the Northern red @-@ legged frog ( Rana aurora ) and the wood frog ( Rana sylvatica ) , symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material . It is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis . Most eggs are black or dark brown and this has the advantage of absorbing warmth from the sun which the insulating capsule retains . The interior of globular egg clusters of the wood frog ( Rana sylvatica ) has been found to be up to 6 ° C ( 11 ° F ) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae . 
 The shape and size of the egg mass is characteristic of the species . <unk> tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas <unk> produce long , cylindrical strings . The tiny yellow @-@ striped pygmy <unk> ( Eleutherodactylus limbatus ) lays eggs singly , burying them in moist soil . The smoky jungle frog ( <unk> <unk> ) makes a nest of foam in a hollow . The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded , or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur . The red @-@ eyed treefrog ( <unk> <unk> ) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch , the larvae fall into the water below . The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes , and will hatch early to avoid being eaten . In general , the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions . Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae . 
 = = = = Tadpoles = = = = 
 The larvae that emerge from the eggs , known as tadpoles ( or occasionally <unk> ) , typically have oval bodies and long , vertically flattened tails . As a general rule , free @-@ living larvae are fully aquatic , but at least one species ( <unk> <unk> ) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks . Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons , lateral line systems , gills for respiration ( external gills at first , internal gills later ) , and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming . 
 From early in its development , a gill pouch covers the tadpole 's gills and front legs . The lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ . Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs . Tadpoles lack true teeth , but the jaws in most species have two elongated , parallel rows of small , keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws . Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak , but the number of rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification . In the Pipidae , with the exception of Hymenochirus , the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels , which make them resemble small catfish . Their tails are stiffened by a notochord , but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis . This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles ; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast , the tail is made of soft tissue only , as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed . The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear , which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail . 
 Tadpoles are typically herbivorous , feeding mostly on algae , including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills . Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage , eating insects , smaller tadpoles , and fish . The Cuban tree frog ( Osteopilus septentrionalis ) is one of a number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic . Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others , so late developers may have better long @-@ term survival prospects . 
 Tadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish , newts , predatory diving beetles , and birds , such as kingfishers . Some tadpoles , including those of the cane toad ( Bufo marinus ) , are poisonous . The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring . 
 = = = = Metamorphosis = = = = 
 At the end of the tadpole stage , a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form . This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours , and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine . This causes different tissues to develop in different ways . The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch , making the front legs visible . The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult , and the long , spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator . The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision , and for new methods of locomotion and feeding . The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed . The eardrum , middle ear , and inner ear are developed . The skin becomes thicker and tougher , the lateral line system is lost , and skin glands are developed . The final stage is the disappearance of the tail , but this takes place rather later , the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs . Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis . At this time , the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established . 
 = = = = Adults = = = = 
 After metamorphosis , young adults may disperse into terrestrial habitats or continue to live in water . Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults , preying on invertebrates , including arthropods , worms , snails , and slugs . A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs , small mammals , and fish . Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast @-@ moving prey , while others push food into their mouths with their hands . A few species also eat plant matter ; the tree frog <unk> truncata is partly herbivorous , its diet including a large proportion of fruit , <unk> <unk> has been found to eat plants , and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis <unk> , with plants constituting 79 @.@ 5 % of its diet by volume . Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators . The northern leopard frog ( Rana pipiens ) is eaten by herons , hawks , fish , large salamanders , snakes , raccoons , skunks , mink , bullfrogs , and other animals . 
 Frogs are primary predators and an important part of the food web . Being cold @-@ blooded , they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes , while the rest is transformed into biomass . They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates , most of which feed on plants . By reducing herbivory , they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem . 
 Little is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild , but some can live for many years . <unk> is a method of examining bones to determine age . Using this method , the ages of mountain yellow @-@ legged frogs ( Rana <unk> ) were studied , the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter . The oldest frogs had ten bands , so their age was believed to be 14 years , including the four @-@ year tadpole stage . Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years , an age achieved by a European common toad ( Bufo bufo ) . The cane toad ( Bufo marinus ) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity , and the American bullfrog ( Rana catesbeiana ) 14 years . Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter , and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time , including the wood frog ( Rana sylvatica ) .
