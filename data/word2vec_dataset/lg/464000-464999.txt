 After retiring , Stebbins remained active in painting , conservation , and education , and continued to make natural history observations . He revised his well @-@ known and widely used Field Guide in 1985 and again in 2003 . He co @-@ wrote the non @-@ specialist book A Natural History of Amphibians with former student Nathan Cohen in 1997 , and revised his Field Guide to California Amphibians and Reptiles in 2012 , with new contributions by Samuel McGinnis , another former student . In 2009 he produced Connecting With Nature : A Naturalist 's Perspective , a book intended to help connect children with nature . He took additional art lessons , broadened his subject matter to include landscapes , African wildlife , portraits , and still lifes , and took up the violin , which he had studied decades earlier . His paintings have been shown and sold in galleries and museums in Berkeley , Palm Springs , and Oregon . 
 Stebbins was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences , which awarded him its highest honor , the Fellows Medal , in 1991 . 
 Stebbins died at age 98 at his home in Eugene , Oregon on September 23 , 2013 , having been in declining health over the previous year . He was survived by his wife and three children . Only one week before his death , he was honored in the scientific name of a newly described species of legless lizard , <unk> stebbinsi . His collected field notes , comprising over 35 bound volumes , are archived in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology .

 Stebbins ' book A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians , first published in 1966 and revised in 1985 and 2003 , has widely been considered " the bible of the field " for American herpetologists . Often referred to simply as " Stebbins " , the book has educated and inspired generations of naturalists and herpetologists . On the impact of the guide , professor Samuel Sweet of UC Santa Barbara stated " Before that book , if people went out to look for snakes , it was so they could gather them up to sell to pet shops or just show off to their buddies . What [ Stebbins ] did was help make a transition to a similar situation as bird watching , where it became OK to just look at the animals and leave them alone . " 
 In 1966 , the Houghton @-@ Mifflin Company first published A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians as part of its Peterson Field Guide series . While including some illustrations from Stebbins ' previous books , the high quality of the artwork was immediately recognized , as was the quality and thoroughness of the writing . Biologist David Wake , then of the University of Chicago but later to work with Stebbins at Berkeley , considered the only " serious defect " to be absence of any coverage of snake @-@ bite first aid . Wake also noted that the geographic area covered left a gap ranging from 75 miles to over 400 miles wide when paired with the earlier Peterson Guide to eastern reptiles and amphibians by Roger Conant . 
 The second edition , published in 1985 , included several changes such as 37 new species , 12 new plates of illustrations , the inclusion of endemic species of the Baja California Peninsula , and new common names chosen to enhance clarity . In his 1986 review , Sweet remarked on the frankness of imperfect knowledge : " For the first time we have a field guide that indicates clearly which taxonomic interpretations are tentative and where distributions and life history features remain poorly known . " Concerned about the impact of over @-@ collecting , Stebbins reduced coverage of collecting and keeping animals , and also removed a section on handling venomous snakes . 
 The third edition , published in 2003 , included 36 new species and several new paintings . Stebbins considered keeping up @-@ to @-@ date with current scientific literature the most daunting task due to the volume of recent publications .

 = SpaceX reusable launch system development program = 
 The SpaceX reusable launch system development program is a privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times in a manner similar to the reusability of aircraft . The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles . The project 's long @-@ term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours . SpaceX 's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return . 
 The program was publicly announced in 2011 and the design for returning the rocket to its launchpad using only its own propulsion systems was completed in February 2012 . SpaceX 's active test program began in late 2012 with testing low @-@ altitude , low @-@ speed aspects of the landing technology . High @-@ velocity , high @-@ altitude aspects of the booster atmospheric return technology began testing in late 2013 and continued to late 2015 , when SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage . 
 The reusable launch system technology is under development for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets . It is particularly well @-@ suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two outer cores separate from the rocket earlier in the flight , and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation . On flight 20 the speed at separation was close to 6000 km / h and this allowed a return to near the launch site . On flight 22 , going to GTO , the speed was faster between 8000 and 9000 km / h . At faster speeds it is not possible to return the booster to near the launch site and a landing , if attempted , would need to be hundreds of kilometres downrange likely on an autonomous drone ship . The process involves flipping the rocket around , a <unk> burn to slow the rocket , a reentry burn , controlling direction to arrive at the landing site and a landing burn . 
 It is intended that the reusable technology will be extended to both the first and upper stages of the future launch vehicle for the Mars Colonial Transporter and is considered paramount to the plans SpaceX is developing to colonize Mars . 
 The first controlled vertical splashdown of an orbital rocket stage on the ocean surface was achieved in April 2014 on the ninth flight of a Falcon 9 . Two subsequent flights in January and April 2015 attempted to land the returning first stage on a floating platform . Although both boosters were guided accurately to the target , they did not succeed in landing vertically on the drone ship and were destroyed . A historic vertical landing was finally achieved on December 21 , 2015 , when the first @-@ stage booster of Falcon 9 Flight 20 successfully touched down at Landing Zone 1 , Cape Canaveral . On April 8 , 2016 , Flight 23 achieved the first soft landing on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean . 
 = = History = = 
 The broad outline of the reusable launch system was first publicly described on September 29 , 2011 . SpaceX said it would attempt to develop powered descent and recovery of both Falcon 9 stages — a fully vertical takeoff , vertical landing ( VTVL ) rocket . The company produced a computer @-@ animated video depicting a notional view of the first stage returning tail @-@ first for a powered descent and the second stage with a heat shield , reentering head first before rotating for a powered descent . In September 2012 , SpaceX began flight tests on a prototype reusable first stage with the suborbital Grasshopper rocket . Those tests continued into 2014 , including testing of a second and larger prototype vehicle , F9R Dev1 . 
 News of the Grasshopper test rocket become public earlier in September 2011 , when the US Federal Aviation Administration released a draft Environmental Impact Assessment for the SpaceX Test Site in Texas , and the space media had reported it by September 26 . In May 2012 , SpaceX obtained a set of atmospheric test data for the recovery of the Falcon 9 first stage based on 176 test runs in the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center wind tunnel test facility . The work was contracted for by SpaceX under a <unk> Space Act Agreement with NASA . 
 In 2012 , it was noted that for the technology projected for use on a reusable Falcon 9 rocket the first @-@ stage separation would occur at a velocity of approximately 2 @.@ 0 km / s ( 6 @,@ 500 km / h ; 4 @,@ 100 mph ; Mach 6 ) rather than the 3 @.@ 4 km / s ( 11 @,@ 000 km / h ; 7 @,@ 000 mph ; Mach 10 ) for an expendable Falcon 9 , to provide the residual fuel necessary for the deceleration and turnaround maneuver and the controlled descent and landing . 
 In November 2012 , CEO Elon Musk announced SpaceX 's plans to build a second , much larger , reusable rocket system , this one to be powered by LOX / methane rather than LOX / RP @-@ 1 used on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy . The new system will be " an evolution of SpaceX 's Falcon 9 booster " , and SpaceX reiterated their commitment to develop a breakthrough in vertical landing technology . By the end of 2012 , the demonstration test vehicle , Grasshopper , had made three VTVL test flights — including a 29 @-@ second hover flight to 40 meters ( 130 ft ) on December 17 , 2012 . In early March 2013 , SpaceX successfully tested Grasshopper for a fourth time when it flew to an altitude of over 80 meters ( 260 ft ) . 
 In March 2013 , SpaceX announced that it would instrument and equip subsequent Falcon 9 first @-@ stages as controlled descent test vehicles , with plans for over @-@ water propulsively @-@ decelerated simulated landings beginning in 2013 , with the intent to return the vehicle to the launch site for a powered landing — possibly as early as mid @-@ 2014 . The April 2013 draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed SpaceX South Texas Launch Site includes specific accommodations for return of the Falcon 9 first @-@ stage boosters to the launch site . Elon Musk first publicly referred to the reusable Falcon 9 as the Falcon 9 @-@ R in April 2013 . 
 In September 2013 , SpaceX successfully relit three engines of a spent booster on an orbital launch , and the booster re @-@ entered the atmosphere at hypersonic speed without burning up . With the data collected from the first flight test of a booster @-@ controlled descent from high altitude , coupled with the technological advancements made on the Grasshopper low @-@ altitude landing demonstrator , SpaceX announced it believed it was ready to test a full land @-@ recovery of a booster stage . Based on the positive results from the first high @-@ altitude flight test , SpaceX advanced the expected date of a test from mid @-@ 2014 to early 2015 , with the intention of doing so on the next Space Station cargo resupply flight pending regulatory approvals . That flight took place on April 18 , 2014 . 
 Musk stated in May 2013 that the goal of the program is to achieve full and rapid reusability of the first stage by 2015 , and to develop full launch vehicle reusability following that as " part of a future design architecture " . 
 In February 2014 , SpaceX made explicit that the newly defined super @-@ heavy launch vehicle for the Mars Colonial Transporter would also make use of the reusable technology . This is consistent with Musk 's strategic statement in 2012 that " The revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable . We will never conquer Mars unless we do that . It 'll be too expensive . The American colonies would never have been pioneered if the ships that crossed the ocean hadn 't been reusable . " 
 Also in May 2014 , SpaceX publicly announced an extensive test program for a related reusable technology : a propulsively @-@ landed space capsule called DragonFly . The tests will be run in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility in 2014 – 2015 . 
 In June 2014 , COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that all funding for development and testing of the reusable launch system technology development program is private funding from SpaceX , with no contribution by the US government . SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the cost of the development program . 
 For the first time , SpaceX stated in July 2014 that they are " highly confident of being able to land successfully on a floating launch pad or back at the launch site and <unk> the rocket with no required refurbishment . " 
 By late 2014 , SpaceX suspended or abandoned the plan to recover and reuse the Falcon 9 second stage ; the additional mass of the required heat shield , landing gear , and low @-@ powered landing engines would incur too great a performance penalty . 
 = = Technologies = = 
 Several new technologies needed to be developed and tested to facilitate successful launch and recovery of both stages of the SpaceX reusable rocket launching system . Following the completion of the third high @-@ altitude controlled @-@ descent test , and the completion of the third low @-@ altitude flight of the second @-@ generation prototype test vehicle ( plus eight flights of the first @-@ generation Grasshopper prototype flight test vehicle ) , SpaceX indicated that they are now able to consistently " reenter from space at hypersonic velocity , restart main engines twice , deploy landing legs and touch down at near zero velocity . " 
 The technologies that were developed for this program , some of which are still being refined , include : 
 restartable ignition system for the first @-@ stage booster <unk> are required at both supersonic velocities in the upper atmosphere — in order to decelerate the high velocity away from the launch pad and put the booster on a descent trajectory back toward the launch pad — and at high transonic velocities in the lower atmosphere — in order to slow the terminal descent and to perform a soft landing . 
 new attitude control technology — for the booster stage and second stage — to bring the descending rocket body through the atmosphere in a manner conducive both to non @-@ destructive return and sufficient aerodynamic control such that the terminal phase of the landing is possible . This includes sufficient roll control authority to keep the rocket from spinning excessively as occurred on the first high @-@ altitude flight test in September 2013 , where the roll rate exceeded the capabilities of the booster attitude control system ( ACS ) and the fuel in the tanks " <unk> " to the side of the tank shutting down the single engine involved in the low @-@ altitude deceleration maneuver . The technology needs to handle the transition from the vacuum of space at hypersonic conditions , decelerating to supersonic velocities and passing through transonic buffet , before relighting one of the main @-@ stage engines at terminal velocity . 
 hypersonic grid fins were added to the booster test vehicle design beginning on the fifth ocean controlled @-@ descent test flight . Arranged in an " X " configuration , the grid fins control the descending rocket 's lift vector once the vehicle has returned to the atmosphere to enable a much more precise landing location . 
 <unk> rocket engine technology is required to reduce engine thrust because the full thrust of even a single Merlin 1D engine exceeds the weight of the nearly empty booster core . 
 terminal guidance and landing capability , including a vehicle control system and a control system software algorithm to be able to land a rocket with the thrust @-@ to @-@ weight ratio of the vehicle greater than one , with closed @-@ loop thrust vector and throttle control 
 navigation sensor suite for precision landing 
 a large floating landing platform in order to test pinpoint landings prior to receiving permission from the US government to bring returning rocket stages into US airspace over land . In the event , SpaceX built the autonomous spaceport drone ship in 2014 , and conducted an initial flight test and landing attempt in January 2015 . 
 large @-@ surface @-@ area thermal protection system to absorb the heat load of deceleration of the second stage from orbital velocity to terminal velocity 
 lightweight , deployable landing gear for the booster stage . In May 2013 , the design was shown to be a nested , telescoping piston on an A @-@ frame . The total span of the four carbon fiber / aluminum extensible landing legs is approximately 18 meters ( 60 ft ) , and weigh less than 2 @,@ 100 kilograms ( 4 @,@ 600 lb ) . Deployment system uses high @-@ pressure Helium as the working fluid . With Flight 25 it was announced that each landing leg contained a " crush core " , to absorb the impact of landing for particularly hard landings . 
 = = Economics of rocket reuse = = 
 In order to make the Falcon 9 reusable and return to the launch site , extra propellant and landing gear must be carried on the first stage , requiring around a 30 percent reduction of the maximum payload to orbit in comparison with the expendable Falcon 9 . <unk> of a previously used stage on a subsequent flight is dependent on the condition of the landed stage , and is a technique that has seen little use outside of the Space Shuttle 's reusable solid rocket boosters . In September 2013 , SpaceX said that if all aspects of the test program were successful and if a customer is interested , the first reflight of a Falcon 9 booster stage could happen as early as late 2014 . In December 2015 , following the recovery of the first stage from the 22 December launch , SpaceX projected that the first reflight of a recovered booster would likely occur in 2016 , but that their plan was to not <unk> the 22 December recovered stage for that purpose . Musk projects that the reflight step of the program will be " straightforward , " because of the multiple full duration firings of the engines that have been done on the ground , and the multiple engine restarts that have already been demonstrated , with no significant degradation seen . Several industry analysts continue to see potential problems that could prevent economic reuse because costs to refurbish and relaunch the stage are not yet demonstrated . Moreover , the economic case for reuse will be highly dependent on launching frequently , and that is simply unknown as of 2015 . 
 If SpaceX is successful in developing the reusable technology , it is expected to significantly reduce the cost of access to space , and change the increasingly competitive market in space launch services . Michael <unk> wrote in Foreign Policy in 2013 that , at a published cost of US $ 56 @.@ 5 million per launch to low Earth orbit , " Falcon 9 rockets are already the cheapest in the industry . Reusable Falcon 9s could drop the price by an order of magnitude , sparking more space @-@ based enterprise , which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scale . " Even for military launches , which have a number of contractual requirements for additional launch services to be provided , SpaceX 's price is under US $ 100 million . 
 Space industry analyst Ajay Kothari has noted that SpaceX reusable technology could do for space transport " what jet engines did for air transportation sixty years ago when people never imagined that more than 500 million passengers would travel by airplanes every year and that the cost could be reduced to the level it is — all because of passenger volume and reliable reusability . " SpaceX said in January 2014 that if they are successful in developing the reusable technology , launch prices of around US $ 5 to 7 million for a reusable Falcon 9 were possible , and following the successful first stage recovery in December 2015 , Musk said that " the potential cost reduction over the long term is probably in excess of a factor of 100 . " 
 As of March 2014 launch service providers who compete with SpaceX were not planning to develop similar technology or offer competing reusable launcher options . Neither ILS , which markets launches of the Russian Proton rocket ; Arianespace ; nor <unk> are planning on developing and marketing reusable launch vehicle services . SpaceX was the only competitor that projected a sufficiently elastic market on the demand side to justify the costly development of reusable rocket technology and the expenditure of private capital to develop options for that theoretical market opportunity . 
 SpaceX pricing and payload specifications published for the non @-@ reusable Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket actually include about 30 percent more performance than the published price list indicates ; the additional performance is reserved for SpaceX to do reusability booster demonstration flight tests while still achieving the specified payloads for customers . 
 In order to achieve the full economic benefit of the reusable technology , it is necessary that the reuse be both rapid and complete — without the long and costly refurbishment period or partially reusable design that plagued earlier attempts at reusable launch vehicles . SpaceX has been explicit that the " huge potential to open up space flight " is dependent on achieving both complete and rapid reusability . CEO Musk stated in 2014 that success with the technology development effort could reduce " the cost of spaceflight by a factor of 100 " because the cost of the propellant / oxidizer on the Falcon 9 is only 0 @.@ 3 percent of the total cost of the vehicle . 
 Separate from the market competition brought about by SpaceX lower launch prices and the potential future of even more radically lower launch prices if the technology can be completed successfully , Aviation Week has said that " SpaceX reusable launch work is an R & D model " — " The audacity of the concept and speed of the program ’ s progress make it an exemplar . ... [ the ] breakneck pace of development has been almost Apollo @-@ like in its execution ... [ even while ] success is far from guaranteed . " 
 On 9 March 2016 SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell gave a more realistic appraisal of the potential savings of a reused launch now that attempts to reuse the second stage had been abandoned due to cost and weight issues . She said at $ 1m cost of refueling and $ 3m cost of refurbishing a used first stage could potentially allow a launch to be priced as low as $ 40m , a 30 % saving . SpaceX biggest customer SES has said it wants to be the first to ride a reused vehicle , however it wants a launch price of $ 30m or a 50 % saving to offset the risk of pioneering the process . 
 According to Elon Musk , almost every piece of the Falcon should be reused over 100 times . Heat shields and a few other items should be reused over 10 times before replacement . 
 = = Technical feasibility = = 
 Prior to the reusability program 's success in December 2015 , the return of an orbital launch system had never been accomplished . And even after this success , the rapid reuse of a rocket is still yet to be attempted . Developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to the small percentage of a rocket 's mass that can make it to orbit . Typically , a rocket 's payload is only about 3 % of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle 's re @-@ entry . 
 Elon Musk said at the beginning of the program that he believed the return , vertical landing and recovery was possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3 % margin . A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration has approximately 30 % less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an expendable configuration .

 SpaceX is currently testing reusable technologies both for its first @-@ stage booster launch vehicle designs — with three test vehicles — and for its new reusable Dragon V2 space capsule — with a low @-@ altitude test vehicle called DragonFly . 
 SpaceX has publicly disclosed a multi @-@ element , incremental test program for booster stages that includes four aspects :

 high @-@ altitude ( 91 km / 300 @,@ 000 ft ) , very @-@ high @-@ velocity ( approximately 2 @.@ 0 km / s ; 6 @,@ 500 km / h ; 4 @,@ 100 mph ; Mach 6 ) ballistic reentry , controlled @-@ deceleration and controlled @-@ descent tests of post @-@ mission ( spent ) Falcon 9 booster stages following a subset of Falcon 9 launches that began in 2013 
 Eight low @-@ altitude booster flight tests were made by Grasshopper in 2012 and 2013 . The first booster return controlled @-@ descent test from high @-@ altitude was made in September 2013 , with a second test in April , a third test flight in July and a fourth test in September 2014 . All four test flights to date were intended to be over @-@ water , simulated landings . Five low @-@ altitude booster flight tests of F9R Dev1 were flown during April – August 2014 , before the vehicle self @-@ destructed for safety reasons on the fifth flight .

 Grasshopper is a set of experimental technology @-@ demonstrator , suborbital reusable launch vehicles ( RLV ) . Two versions of the prototype reusable test vehicles was built , the 106 @-@ foot tall Grasshopper ( formerly designated as Grasshopper v1.0 ) and the 160 @-@ foot tall Falcon 9 Reusable Development Vehicle , or F9R Dev1 — formerly known as Grasshopper <unk> Grasshopper was built in 2011 @-@ 2012 for low @-@ altitude , low @-@ velocity hover testing at the SpaceX Rocket Test Facility in McGregor , Texas , that began in September 2012 and concluded in October 2013 after eight test flights . The second prototype vehicle design , F9R Dev1 , was built on the much larger Falcon 9 v1.1 booster stage was used for higher @-@ altitude and higher @-@ velocity flight testing . 
 The low @-@ altitude , low @-@ speed flights of the first test vehicle — Grasshopper — were conducted . F9R Dev1 was also tested at the Texas facility . 
 = = = = Grasshopper = = = = 
 Grasshopper , the company 's first VTVL test vehicle , consisted of a Falcon 9 v1.0 first @-@ stage tank , a single Merlin @-@ 1D engine , and four permanently attached steel landing legs . It stood 106 feet ( 32 m ) tall . SpaceX built a 0 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 20 ha ) concrete launch facility at its Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor , Texas to support the Grasshopper flight test program . Grasshopper was also known as Grasshopper version 1 @.@ 0 , or Grasshopper v1.0 , prior to 2014 during the time the <unk> Grasshopper @-@ class test vehicles were being built . 
 In addition to three test flights in 2012 , five additional tests were successfully flown by the end of October 2013 — including the fourth test overall in March 2013 — in which Grasshopper doubled its highest leap to rise to 80 @.@ 1 meters ( 263 ft ) with a 34 @-@ second flight . In the seventh test , in August 2013 , the vehicle flew to 250 meters ( 820 ft ) during a 60 @-@ second flight and executed a 100 @-@ meter ( 330 ft ) lateral maneuver before returning to the pad . Grasshopper made its eighth and final test flight on October 7 , 2013 , flying to 744 meters ( 2 @,@ 441 ft ) ( 0 @.@ 46 miles ) before making its eighth successful landing . The Grasshopper test vehicle is now retired .

 Beginning in October 2012 , SpaceX discussed development of a second @-@ generation Grasshopper test vehicle , which would have lighter landing legs that fold up on the side of the rocket , a different engine bay , and would be nearly 50 % longer than the first Grasshopper vehicle . In March 2013 , SpaceX announced that the larger Grasshopper @-@ class suborbital flight vehicle would be constructed out of the Falcon 9 v1.1 first @-@ stage tank that was used for qualification testing at the SpaceX Rocket Development and Test Facility in early 2013 . It has been rebuilt as the F9R Dev1 with extensible landing legs . 
 The second VTVL flight test vehicle — F9R Dev1 , built on the much longer Falcon 9 v1.1 first @-@ stage tank , and with retractable landing legs — made its first test flight on April 17 , 2014 . F9R Dev1 was used for low @-@ altitude test flights in the McGregor , Texas area with projected maximum altitude below 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 10 @,@ 000 ft ) . This vehicle self @-@ destructed as a safety measure during a test flight on August 22 , 2014 . 
 As of April 2014 , a third flight test vehicle — F9R <unk> — was being built and was planned to be flown at the high @-@ altitude test range available at Spaceport America in New Mexico where it was expected to be flown at altitudes up to 91 @,@ 000 meters ( 300 @,@ 000 ft ) -plus .

 DragonFly is a prototype test article for a propulsively @-@ landed version of the SpaceX Dragon space capsule , a suborbital reusable launch vehicle ( RLV ) , intended for low @-@ altitude flight testing . It will undergo a test program in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility , in 2014 – 2015 . 
 The DragonFly test vehicle is powered by eight <unk> engines , arranged in a redundant pattern to support fault @-@ tolerance in the propulsion system design . <unk> utilize a storable propellant mixture of monomethyl hydrazine ( MMH ) fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer ( <unk> ) , the same propellants used in the much smaller Draco thrusters used for attitude control and maneuvering on the first @-@ generation Dragon spacecraft . While <unk> engines are capable of 73 @,@ 000 newtons ( 16 @,@ 400 lbf ) of thrust , during use on DragonFly flight test vehicle each will be throttled to less than 68 @,@ 170 newtons ( 15 @,@ 325 lbf ) to maintain vehicle stability . 
 A test flight program of thirty flights has been proposed , including two propulsive assist ( parachutes plus thrusters ) and two propulsive landing ( no parachutes ) on flights dropped from a helicopter at an altitude of approximately 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 10 @,@ 000 ft ) . The other 26 test flights are projected to take off from a pad : eight to be propulsive assist hops ( landing with parachutes plus thrusters ) and 18 to be full propulsive hops , similar to the Grasshopper and F9R Dev booster stage test flights . 
 The DragonFly test program is not expected to start until after the completion of the F9R Dev1 booster testing at the McGregor facility .

 In an arrangement unusual for launch vehicles , some first stages of the SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets are being used for propulsive @-@ return controlled @-@ descent flight tests after they complete the boost phase of an orbital flight . These boosters would ordinarily just be discarded in the ocean after setting their payloads on their way . The over @-@ water tests take place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . The first flight test occurred on September 29 , 2013 , after the second stage with the <unk> and <unk> payloads separated from the booster . These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years , with the second flight test taking place on April 18 , 2014 , and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015 .

 Following analysis of the flight test data from the first booster @-@ controlled descent in September 2013 , SpaceX announced it had successfully tested a large amount of new technology on the flight , and that coupled with the technology advancements made on the Grasshopper low @-@ altitude landing demonstrator , they were ready to test a full recovery of the booster stage . The first flight test was successful ; SpaceX said it was " able to successfully transition from vacuum through hypersonic , through supersonic , through transonic , and light the engines all the way and control the stage all the way through [ the atmosphere ] " . Musk said , " the next attempt to recovery [ sic ] the Falcon 9 first stage will be on the fourth flight of the upgraded rocket . This would be [ the ] third commercial Dragon cargo flight to ISS . " 
 This second flight test took place during the April 2014 Dragon flight to the ISS . SpaceX attached landing legs to the first stage , decelerated it over the ocean and attempted a simulated landing over the water , following the ignition of the second stage on the third cargo resupply mission contracted to NASA . The first stage was successfully slowed down enough for a soft landing over the Atlantic Ocean . SpaceX announced in February 2014 the intent to continue the tests to land the first @-@ stage booster in the ocean until precision control from hypersonic all the way through subsonic regimes has been proven . Five additional controlled @-@ descent tests were conducted in the remainder of 2014 through April 2015 , including two attempts to land on a floating landing platform — a SpaceX @-@ built Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship — on the Atlantic Ocean east of the launch site , both of which brought the vehicle to the landing platform , but neither of which resulted in a successful landing . 
 = = = = First landing success aground = = = = 
 During the 2015 launch hiatus , SpaceX requested regulatory approval from the FAA to attempt returning their next flight to Cape Canaveral instead of targeting a floating platform in the ocean . The goal was to land the booster vertically at the leased Landing Zone 1 facility — the former Launch Complex 13 where SpaceX had recently built a large rocket landing pad . The FAA approved the safety plan for the ground landing on 18 December 2015 . The first stage landed successfully on target at 20 : 38 local time on December 21 ( 01 : 38 UTC on December 22 ) . 
 SpaceX does not plan to fly the Falcon 9 Flight 20 first stage again . Rather , the rocket was moved a few miles north to Launch pad 39A , recently refurbished by SpaceX at the adjacent Kennedy Space Center , to conduct a static fire test on 15 January 2016 . This test aimed to assess the health of the recovered booster and the capability of this rocket design to fly repeatedly in the future . The tests delivered good overall results except for one of the outer engines experiencing thrust fluctuations . Elon Musk reported that this may have been due to debris ingestion .

 Falcon 9 Flight 21 launched the Jason @-@ 3 satellite on January 17 , 2016 and attempted to land on the floating platform Just Read the Instructions , located for the first time about 200 miles ( 320 km ) out in the Pacific Ocean . Approximately 9 minutes into the flight , the live video feed from the drone ship went down due to the losing its lock on the uplink satellite . The vehicle landed smoothly onto the vessel but one of the four landing legs failed to lock properly , reportedly due to ice from the heavy pre @-@ launch fog preventing a lockout collet from latching . Consequently the booster fell over shortly after touchdown and was destroyed in a deflagration upon impact with the pad . 
 Flight 22 was carrying a heavy payload of 5 @,@ 271 kilograms ( 12 @,@ 000 lb ) to geostationary transfer orbit ( GTO ) . This was heavier than previously advertised maximum lift capacity to GTO being made possible by going slightly <unk> . Following delays caused by failure of Flight 19 SpaceX agreed to provide extra thrust to the SES @-@ 9 satellite to take it <unk> . As a result of these factors , there was little propellant left to execute a full reentry and landing test with normal margins . Consequently the Falcon 9 first stage followed a ballistic trajectory after separation and re @-@ entered the atmosphere at high velocity , making it less likely to land successfully . The atmospheric re @-@ entry and controlled descent were successful despite the higher <unk> constraints on the first stage due to extra speed . However the rocket was moving too fast and was destroyed when it collided with the drone ship . SpaceX collected valuable data on the extended flight envelope required to recover boosters from GTO missions . 
 = = = = First landings on drone ship = = = = 
 On April 8 , 2016 , Falcon 9 Flight 23 , the third flight of the full @-@ thrust version , delivered the SpaceX CRS @-@ 8 cargo on its way to the International Space Station while the first stage conducted a <unk> and re @-@ entry maneuver over the Atlantic ocean . Nine minutes after liftoff , the booster landed vertically on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You , 300 km from the Florida coastline , achieving a long @-@ sought @-@ after milestone for the SpaceX reusability development program . 
 A second successful drone ship landing occurred on May 6 , 2016 , with the next flight which launched <unk> @-@ 14 to GTO . This second landing at sea was more difficult than the previous one because the booster at separation was traveling about 8 @,@ 350 km / h ( 5 @,@ 190 mph ) compared to 6 @,@ 650 km / h ( 4 @,@ 130 mph ) on the CRS @-@ 8 launch to low Earth orbit . Pursuing their experiments to test the limits of the flight envelope , SpaceX opted for a shorter landing burn with three engines instead of the single @-@ engine burns seen in earlier attempts ; this approach consumes less fuel by leaving the stage in free fall as long as possible and decelerating more sharply , thereby minimizing the amount of energy expended to counter gravity . Elon Musk indicated this first stage may not be flown again instead being used as a life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good . 
 A third successful landing followed on May 27th , again following deceleration from the high speed required for a GTO launch . The landing crushed a " crush core " in one leg , leading to a notable tilt to the stage as it stood on the drone ship . 
 = = = = Future tests = = = = 
 SpaceX aims to return a number of first stages to both land and drone ships in 2016 to clarify the procedures needed to re @-@ use the boosters rapidly . The company hopes to begin offering pre @-@ flown Falcon 9 rocket stages commercially by the end of the year , aiming at relaunching such a stage in the near future . In January 2016 Elon Musk estimated the likelihood of success to 70 percent for all landing attempts in 2016 , hopefully rising to 90 percent in 2017 ; he also cautioned that we should expect " a few more <unk> " ( Rapid <unk> Disassembly , Musk 's euphemism to denote destruction of the vehicle on impact ) .

 Mr. Harold Hooper ( played by Will Lee ) , was one of the first four human characters to appear on the television series Sesame Street . Created by producer and writer Jon Stone , Mr. Hooper is the original proprietor of Hooper 's Store , the neighborhood variety store and combination diner / corner store that serves as a place for Muppets and humans to meet and interact . Lee , a character actor and instructor who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era , was " perfectly cast " as Mr. Hooper . Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers . Mr. Hooper , who has been described as " slightly cranky but good @-@ hearted " and " curmudgeonly " , bridges the gap between the older generation and its young audience . Hooper 's Store , " an idealized social institution " , is an extension of his personality . He had a special relationship with the Muppet Big Bird . 
 At the time of Lee 's death , instead of recasting the role , or explaining his departure by saying he had moved , quit or retired , the writers and producers of Sesame Street decided to have the character of Mr. Hooper pass away as well , in order to create an episode that taught their young audience about the difficult topic of death . Research was conducted to ascertain the messages they wanted to convey about the topic , as well as the effect the episode would have on the young children who watched it . They were advised by experts in the fields of child psychology , child development , and religion . Studies conducted after the episode was produced showed that most children understood its messages about death , and that they experienced no long @-@ term ill effects . The episode , written by head writer Norman Stiles , aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983 ; the cast and crew reported that filming it was an emotional and touching experience . The episode , which set the standard for dealing with difficult topics on children 's television , was called heartbreaking yet affirming , and one of the proudest moments in the show 's history . 
 = = Development and description = = 
 Mr. Hooper , played by Will Lee from the premiere of Sesame Street in 1969 until his death in 1982 , was one of the first four human characters that appeared on the show . Created by producer and writer Jon Stone , Lee was the first actor to be cast . Lee came to Stone 's attention through writers Bruce and Carole Hart . Mr. Hooper was inspired by the Bob Keeshan character , Captain Kangaroo ; Stone previously worked on the Captain Kangaroo program , which greatly influenced him as he developed Sesame Street . Mr. Hooper is the original proprietor of Hooper 's Store , the neighborhood variety store and combination diner / corner store that serves as a place for Muppets and humans to meet and interact . Stone 's original conception of Mr. Hooper was that he would be , like most owners of such establishments at the time , older , male , Caucasian , and Jewish . 
 Lee was a character actor and acting instructor with a range of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era . According to writer Michael Davis , Lee played Mr. Hooper , known for his bowtie and <unk> glasses , " with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief " . Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was " perfectly cast " as Mr. Hooper . According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath , who also appeared in Sesame Street 's first episode with Lee , " Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did ... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child , you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it " . Joan Ganz Cooney , Sesame Street co @-@ creator and president of the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) , said , " He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other " . The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers . 
 Davis described Mr. Hooper as " slightly cranky but good @-@ hearted " . Gikow called Mr. Hooper " curmudgeonly " . Davis stated that since Mr. Hooper 's appearance in the first episode of Sesame Street , he had become many things to many young children , " ... the guy in the apron at the far side of the generation gap , his half @-@ lens glasses slipping down his nose " . Davis also stated that Hooper 's Store , which he called " an idealized social institution " , is an extension of Mr. Hooper 's personality . Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird , who would often come into Hooper 's Store for a <unk> milkshake and a chat . A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper 's name , although most attempts ended in " <unk> , " such as " Looper " or " Cooper " . Mr. Hooper 's first name , Harold , was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school . 
 Mr. Hooper 's last appearances on Sesame Street aired in 1983 , but Lee 's last segments for the show were taped in November 1982 and Lee participated in the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade with other Sesame Street characters a few days before he died of a heart attack on December 7 , 1982 . 
 = = " Death of Mr. Hooper " = = 
 When Will Lee died on December 7 , 1982 , instead of recasting the role , or explaining Mr. Hooper 's departure by saying that he had moved away , quit or retired , the producers of Sesame Street decided have the character of Mr. Hooper pass away as well in order to create an episode that taught their young audience about the difficult topic of death . According to CTW researcher Rosemarie Truglio and her colleagues , the episode was one of the many social issues relevant to preschoolers the show has dealt with throughout its history . Executive producer Dulcy Singer stated : " if we left it unsaid , kids would notice . One way out was to avoid the issue of death entirely . " According to Big Bird 's actor Carroll Spinney , producers had considered the idea of writing Mr. Hooper out of the script : " we didn 't know what to do . We thought perhaps he could just retire , move to Florida or something , but then the producers thought that the best thing to do would be to actually deal with death . " The episode aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983 and to this day is considered one of the proudest and most groundbreaking moments in Sesame Street history . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The Sesame Street episode ( # 1839 ) in which the death of Mr. Hooper was discussed was structured as all episodes were structured at the time , with individual segments that took place on the main brownstone set ( called " street scenes " ) and interrupted by inserts , or puppet skits , short films , and animations . The episode begins with a scene between Gordon , played by Roscoe Orman , and the Muppet Forgetful Jones , played by puppeteer Richard Hunt . Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy ; as Davis states , " Later , Big Bird forgets something that makes him sad " . After several inserts , Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs ; when Gordon asks him why , he answers , " Just because " . Later , Big Bird listens to the adults conversing about a new baby who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother . 
 Two segments later , Big Bird interrupts the adults — Maria ( Sonia Manzano ) , David ( Northern Calloway ) , Bob ( Bob McGrath ) , Susan ( Loretta Long ) , Gordon , Luis ( Emilio Delgado ) and Olivia ( Alaina Reed Hall ) — discussing politics by giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them . He gets to Mr. Hooper 's picture , saying that he would give it to him when he returns . The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that if Mr. Hooper has died , to which Bird Bird simply says he 'll give him the picture when he comes back . Susan then explains to Big Bird that when people die they never come back ; Big Bird reacts by getting upset , expressing his confusion and sadness . The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store , because Mr. Hooper left it to him in his will . Big Bird asks , " Why does it have to be this way ? Give me one good reason ! " and Gordon answers , " Big Bird , it has to be this way ... just because . " Bob and Susan then tell Big Bird that even through Mr. Hooper won 't be around anymore , they still have their fond memories Looking at Mr. Hooper 's picture , Big Bird says , mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past , " I 'm going to miss you , Mr. Looper . " Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support . 
 According to Carroll Spinney , when Big Bird said the line " I 'm going to miss you , Mr. Looper " , he had started to say " Mr. Lee " before correcting himself . The filming crew decided to keep the take despite Spinney 's slip of the tongue due to the heavy emotions the cast members were feeling . 
 The episode ends with Big Bird hanging Mr. Hooper 's picture near his nest , and leaving to go see the new baby . Big Bird says , " You know , the one thing is about new babies , one day they 're not here and next day , here they are ! " He puts his head between his legs once again as the credits roll . 
 = = = Research = = = 
 Similar to what they had done with other social issues and in developing their curriculum , the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it . The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts , led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein , in the fields of child psychology , child development , and religion . The team advised the show 's writers and producers how to handle the topic , in what they called " a curriculum bath " ; Bernstein described it in this way : " We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise . We in Research bring in people to provide the information , and then the artistry of the writer takes over , as they integrate what they 've heard " . The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper 's death . They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died , since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children 's fears about death . They chose to deal with his death in a single episode , and convey simple messages like : " Mr. Hooper is dead ; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back ; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all " . Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers ' skills as educators as well as entertainers . 
 Before the episode aired , the CTW conducted a series of studies to guide the writers and producers in creating the episode . Their goal was to answer four key questions : ( 1 ) Will children understand the messages they wanted to convey about death ? ( 2 ) How attentive will they be to the storyline ? ( 3 ) How will parents respond to the treatment of such a sensitive topic ? and ( 4 ) Will children be disturbed by the messages , and if so , for how long ? The researchers broke up children into three groups : children who only watched the scenes in which the storyline was played out and who were interviewed afterwards ; children who watched the entire episode and whose attention was recorded while they viewed it ; and children who watched the episode without the inserts , with their parents , who were interviewed 9 or 10 days later . 
 The researchers found that 73 % of 4- and 5 @-@ year @-@ olds in their study understood that Mr. Hooper was dead and that 88 % of this group understood that he was not coming back , although only about one @-@ fourth of the 3 @-@ year @-@ old viewers responded correctly . Most of the 4- and 5 @-@ year @-@ olds understood that Big Bird and the adults were sad . Most children ( 80 % ) were attentive during the episode . The parents interviewed had " overwhelmingly positive " reactions to the show , and that half reported that they had discussed death with their children after viewing it . None of the parents reported negative reactions from their children , either immediately after watching the episode or at a later time . 
 = = = Development and legacy = = = 
 Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles was chosen to write the segments about Mr. Hooper 's death . The episode focused on the life cycle of birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby , and by remembering Mr. Hooper . Stiles said , " We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore , we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart , that we have our love and that it will always stay " . Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children . Instead of providing an explanation , the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper 's friend Big Bird , when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died , that there was no real reason , that it happened , as Gordon tells Big Bird , " Just because " . The show 's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open @-@ ended explanation would not be enough for children , but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement , as Gikow stated , that there is never a good explanation about why people die . 
 The episode aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983 , a year after Lee 's final appearance as Mr. Hooper at the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade . The producers chose to air it the first week of the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper 's absence as soon as possible , for maximum exposure , and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it . The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney , who performed Big Bird . Mr. Hooper 's picture remained on the set from then on , as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper . Spinney , speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out , reported , " When we finished that scene there wasn 't one of us whose face wasn 't streaked with tears " , even Spinney underneath his costume . Jon Stone , who directed the episode , wanted to do another take , although Spinney later said , " There was nothing wrong with that take . It was perfect " . Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance . 
 A book , entitled I 'll Miss You , Mr. Hooper and based upon the script for the episode , was published in 1984 . The book was also written by Stiles . According to Renée <unk> @-@ O 'Leary , Stiles and the editorial staff of the CTW 's book division worked with the show 's research staff and used the same educational content information and research the show 's producers used to create the episode . 
 = 1984 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season was the busiest since 1971 . It officially began on June 1 , 1984 , and lasted until November 30 , 1984 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . The 1984 season was an active one in terms of named storms , but most of them were weak and stayed at sea . Most of the cyclones tracked through the northwest subtropical Atlantic west of the 50th meridian to near the Eastern coast of the United States between mid @-@ August and early October . The most damaging storm was Hurricane Diana , which caused $ 65 @.@ 5 million ( 1984 dollars ) in damage in North Carolina . Diana was the first hurricane to strike a nuclear power plant without incident ; it was also the first major hurricane to strike the U.S. East Coast in nearly 20 years . Also of note was Hurricane Lili , which lasted well after the official end of the season . It was downgraded from a named storm on December 24 . Damage overall from the tropical cyclones in 1984 totaled $ 66 @.@ 4 million ( 1984 USD ) . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Six storms during the season had subtropical characteristics at some point in their track , those being Subtropical Storm One , Tropical Storm Cesar , Hurricane Hortense , Hurricane Josephine , Hurricane Klaus , and Hurricane Lili . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 84 , which is classified as " near normal " . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Although officially , subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total , the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Depression One = = = 
 By June 11 , an upper level low caused thunderstorm development off the Florida coast , which caused the formation of a tropical depression . Moving westward , the depression moved into St. Augustine , causing a total of 5 @.@ 02 inches ( 128 mm ) of rainfall at Jacksonville Beach , Florida as its main thunderstorm activity was concentrated north of the center . It dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June 14 while moving through the Florida panhandle . The small remnant low continued moving westward inland of the Gulf coast , causing occasional redevelopment of thunderstorm activity as the system moved into Louisiana , before both the thunderstorm activity and low pressure area dissipated by June 17 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Two = = = 
 An upper level low moving across the southern Gulf of Mexico spawned an area of thunderstorm activity over the Mexican isthmus on June 16 . The thunderstorm area moved northwest , pulsing in intensity , until flaring up into a larger area of deeper convection early in the morning of June 18 . A surface low formed , and the system was considered well @-@ enough organized to be a tropical depression , the second of the season , while located southeast of Brownsville , Texas . On June 19 , vertical wind shear from the west @-@ southwest halted further development , and the tropical depression began a general weakening trend which continued past its landfall point in northeast Mexico . By early morning of June 20 , the system completely dissipated .

 A tropical depression formed on July 25 and moved westward , producing rainfall up to six inches in Barbados on July 26 . The depression dissipated on July 26 . Two commercial fisherman were reported missing near St. Lucia . 
 = = = Subtropical Storm One = = = 
 A weak front generated a low pressure system that organized into a subtropical depression north of Bermuda on August 18 . The depression headed northeast and strengthened to a subtropical storm . It is believed to have merged with a front on August 21 . The history of Subtropical Storm One is not entirely certain , as satellite images were largely unavailable due to a failure of the <unk> unit on GOES EAST ( then GOES @-@ 5 ) , and this system remained at the fringe of the GOES WEST and <unk> throughout its existence . Winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) was reported on the southwest coast of Newfoundland . In addition , a weather office on the island reported rainfall at 2 @.@ 1 in ( 53 mm ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Arthur = = = 
 The 1984 season 's first named storm occurred later than usual , forming on August 28 . Arthur formed east of the Windward Islands and tracked generally northwest . It was downgraded to a depression on September 1 after being negatively impacted by vertical wind shear , and dissipated several days later . Arthur was a minimal tropical storm , and caused no significant weather on land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Bertha = = = 
 Bertha was a short @-@ lived tropical storm that formed in the mid @-@ Atlantic on August 31 , in close proximity to the east of Arthur . The storm took a parabolic path to the north and northeast before merging with a cold front on September 4 . Bertha never approached land and caused no reported damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Cesar = = = 
 A second storm formed on August 31 as a non @-@ tropical low strengthened into Tropical Storm Cesar off the East Coast of the United States . Cesar traveled east @-@ northeast and strengthened gradually until it became extratropical and merged with another system off the coast of Newfoundland on September 2 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Seven = = = 
 A tropical wave moved across Central America into the far eastern north Pacific ocean by August 28 . The system moved westward with no signs of development until September 1 , when an upper level low to its north across the Gulf of Mexico caused an area of thunderstorms to form just south of the Mexican coastline . An upper trough developed across the southern Plains of the United States , which slowly lured the northern portion of this increasingly large disturbance northward through the Mexican Isthmus . The southern portion moved westward , developing into Hurricane Marie . For a short while , Marie acted as a source of vertical wind shear from the west for this system , halting further development . 
 By September 6 , the disturbance had emerged into the southwest Gulf of Mexico and consolidated into a smaller system which had enough organization to be classified as a tropical depression , the seventh of the season . The depression moved north @-@ northwest into northeast Mexico on the afternoon of September 7 , dissipating completely on September 8 . 
 = = = Hurricane Diana = = = 
 On September 8 , an extratropical cyclone organized into Tropical Storm Diana north of the Bahamas . Diana proved difficult for meteorologists to forecast , initially moving westward towards Cape Canaveral , but then turned to the north and paralleled the coastline . On September 11 , the storm reached hurricane strength , and continued to intensify to a Category 4 hurricane . Diana moved north @-@ northeast , and performed a small anti @-@ cyclonic loop before striking near Cape Fear as a minimal Category 2 hurricane on September 13 . A weakened Tropical Storm Diana curved back out to sea and headed northeast until it became extratropical near Newfoundland on September 16 . 
 Damage estimates were set at $ 65 @.@ 5 million . Three indirect deaths were associated with Diana . Diana was the first hurricane to strike a nuclear power plant — the Carolina Power and Light Brunswick Nuclear Power Plant recorded sustained hurricane @-@ force winds , but there was no damage to the facility . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Edouard = = = 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Edouard are unclear , but an area of persistent organized storms formed in the Bay of Campeche , which strengthened into a tropical storm on September 14 . Edouard rapidly intensified , with wind speeds reaching 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) in 18 hours . Following its strengthening , Edouard dissipated even more quickly , degenerating into an area of thunderstorms the next day . The remnants of Edouard moved over land near the port of Veracruz . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Fran = = = 
 On September 14 , a well @-@ defined tropical wave exited the coast of Africa . The next day , it had rapidly organized into a tropical depression . On the afternoon of September 16 the depression attained tropical storm strength , and it was given the name Fran . It turned to the northwest , and passed very near the Cape Verde . 31 people were killed in the country . Fran continued between the northwest and west @-@ northwest on September 17 – 18 as it continued to organize . During this period satellite imagery indicated that Fran peaked with winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) and a minimum surface pressure of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 35 inHg ) . As Fran passed the Cape Verde islands weather stations reported 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) winds , which is tropical depression force . During the period of September 19 – 20 Fran turned towards westward and began to encounter strong upper level wind shear , which caused Fran to dissipate on September 20 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Gustav = = = 
 Gustav spent most of its life as a well @-@ organized tropical depression , which formed on September 16 in the open Atlantic south of Bermuda . The depression moved north , and its motion stalled over Bermuda on September 17 . A day later , the depression had strengthened to a tropical storm and was named Gustav . Tropical Storm Gustav headed northeast until it was absorbed by a front on September 19 . 
 = = = Hurricane Hortense = = = 
 A large frontal system spawned a subtropical depression early on September 23 , about 385 miles ( 620 km ) east of Bermuda . Ship and satellite data confirmed its development , and indicated the system intensified into a subtropical storm later on September 23 . Initially the cyclone moved toward the south @-@ southwest , although on September 24 it turned to the west . That day , the Hurricane Hunters reported that the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone ; as such , it was named Tropical Storm Hortense . The newly @-@ tropical storm quickly intensified while turning to the northwest , and late on September 25 Hortense attained hurricane status , about 300 miles ( 475 km ) southeast of Bermuda . 
 Twelve hours after reaching hurricane status , Hortense began a sharp weakening trend while passing east of Bermuda . By September 27 it was a minimal tropical storm , and subsequently it executed a clockwise loop to the southwest . The intensity of Hortense fluctuated slightly over the subsequent few days , although it never regained its former intensity . On September 30 , after turning to the west and later to the north , the storm passed just 7 mi ( 11 km ) west of Bermuda . As the storm was so weak , the island only reported winds of 18 mph ( 30 km / h ) . Hortense accelerated to the northeast , moving rapidly across the north Atlantic before being absorbed by a larger extratropical storm late on October 2 , northwest of the Azores . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Isidore = = = 
 A tropical depression formed on September 25 off the southeastern Bahamas . The depression headed west , and was upgraded to a tropical storm in the central Bahamas on September 26 . It struck the US coast near Jupiter , Florida . Retaining tropical storm strength , Isidore curved to the northeast , emerging over water near Jacksonville , Florida . Isidore continued northeast until it was absorbed by a front on October 1 . Total damages were estimated at over $ 750 @,@ 000 ( 1984 US dollars ) . One death from electrocution was reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Josephine = = = 
 Josephine became a named storm on October 8 while northeast of Puerto Rico . It briefly moved west then turned almost due north . While it stayed well away from the U.S. coast , Josephine was a large storm and sustained tropical storm winds were measured at the Diamond Shoals of Cape Hatteras . When it passed 36 ° N latitude ( roughly level with Norfolk , Virginia ) , Josephine curved to the southeast , then back to the northeast . It continued on this path until it made a cyclonic loop beginning on October 17 while becoming extratropical . The storm lost its identity on October 21 . The hurricane caused wave damage to coastal areas , but primarily posed a threat to the shipping lanes of the North Atlantic . 
 Offshore , a sailboat with six crewmen on it became disabled due to high waves , estimated to have exceeded 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) , produced by the hurricane . All of the people on the ship were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal by a nearby tanker vessel . In Massachusetts , one man drowned after falling off his boat on North River amidst large swells produced by the storm . In Long Island , New York and parts of New Jersey , tides between 2 and 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 and 1 @.@ 22 m ) above normal resulted in minor coastal flooding . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Seventeen = = = 
 This system was recognized as the seventeenth tropical depression of the season by the National Hurricane Center after the season ended . A <unk> upper @-@ level low spurred the development of a low east of the Bahamas on October 25 . The system tracked westward with limited shower and thunderstorm activity , crossing Florida on October 26 before moving into the Gulf of Mexico . Once the system moved into the north @-@ central Gulf , deep convection began to develop near its center , expanding in intensity and coverage near and after landfall in extreme southeast Mississippi . The small system accelerated rapidly to the north and northeast ahead of an approaching cold front , moving across the Tennessee Valley and central Appalachians before linking up with the front and becoming a weak extratropical cyclone . The nontropical cyclone then moved through coastal New England . 
 = = = Hurricane Klaus = = = 
 Forming from a broad area of low pressure on November 5 , Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path . After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico , it passed to the north of the Leeward Islands , resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas . Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13 . The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico , causing minor flooding and light damage . Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the Leeward Islands , including wrecking at least three ships . The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage , as well . Damage from the storm totaled to $ 152 million ( 1984 USD ) , and the hurricane killed two on Dominica . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Nineteen = = = 
 A low pressure system formed east of Florida on November 22 and rode up the East Coast of the United States producing heavy rain before curving back out to sea and <unk> on November 26 . The storm left one fatality and $ 7 @.@ 4 million ( 1984 USD ) in damage . There has been evidence that the November storm may have become a subtropical cyclone east of Bermuda . The remnants of the cyclone contributed to the Late November 1984 Nor 'easter . 
 = = = Hurricane Lili = = = 
 Hurricane Lili was one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones on record to reach hurricane status in the month of December . Lili developed as a subtropical cyclone which originated from a frontal trough to the south of Bermuda on December 12 . It tracked southeastward , then northward , slowly attaining tropical characteristics and becoming a hurricane on December 20 . Lili turned to the south and southwest , briefly threatening the northern Caribbean islands before weakening and dissipating near the coast of the Dominican Republic . Lili was the longest lasting tropical cyclone outside of the Atlantic hurricane season , as well as the strongest hurricane to form during the month of December . It briefly threatened to pass through the Leeward Islands as a minimal hurricane , though upon passing through the area as a dissipating tropical depression Lili produced light rainfall and no reported damage .

 = Maryland Route 318 = 
 Maryland Route 318 ( MD 318 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway runs 11 @.@ 32 miles ( 18 @.@ 22 km ) from MD 16 and MD 331 at Preston east to the Delaware state line near Federalsburg , where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 18 ( DE 18 ) . MD 318 connects Federalsburg with Preston and Bridgeville , Delaware . The state highway follows the Dorchester – Caroline county line for most of its length between Linchester and Federalsburg . The county line road is considered to be in Caroline County for maintenance purposes . Further east , MD 318 runs concurrently with MD 313 to bypass Federalsburg . The portion of MD 318 west of Federalsburg was originally numbered Maryland Route 319 and assumed by MD 318 in the mid @-@ 1950s . The MD 319 section was constructed in the late 1910s near Federalsburg and completed west to MD 331 and MD 16 in the late 1920s . MD 318 east of Federalsburg was built in the mid @-@ 1920s . MD 318 was placed on the bypass of Federalsburg in the early 1960s ; its old alignment through Federalsburg became MD 315 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 318 begins at an intersection with MD 16 and MD 331 at Linchester , just south of the Caroline – Dorchester county line . MD 16 and MD 331 head south from the intersection as East New Market Ellwood Road and west as a continuation of Preston Road toward Preston . MD 318 heads east as Preston Road , a two @-@ lane road that intersects Langrell Road and Beulah Road a short distance east of its western terminus . Langrell Road is unsigned MD <unk> , which follows the county line west to a dead end at Hunting Creek . MD 318 continues east on top of the county line through farmland between Dorchester County to the south and Caroline County to the north . The state highway intersects American Corner Road and passes Magennis Farm Airport in the hamlet of <unk> . MD 318 fully enters Caroline County shortly after passing Lovers Road , then intersects MD 313 ( Federalsburg Highway ) and MD 315 ( Bloomingdale Avenue ) . MD 315 ( Bloomingdale Avenue ) , the old alignment of MD 318 , continues straight east toward downtown Federalsburg , while MD 318 turns south and runs concurrently with MD 313 on a bypass of Federalsburg . 
 MD 313 and MD 318 intersect MD 307 ( Williamsburg Road ) at the Federalsburg Roundabout . The highway crosses the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at @-@ grade as the highway gently curves to the east . After passing Main Street , which is unsigned MD 308 , MD 313 and MD 318 cross Marshyhope Creek . East of the creek , MD 313 turns south onto Reliance Road ; the old alignment of MD 313 , heads north toward downtown Federalsburg as Reliance Avenue . MD 318 continues east through an industrial area along Federalsburg Highway , which crosses the Seaford Line track again . The state highway crosses Tanyard Branch before meeting the other end of MD 315 ( Liberty Road ) . MD 318 continues east as Bridgeville Road to the Delaware state line , where the highway heads toward Bridgeville as DE 18 ( Federalsburg Road ) .

 The portion of MD 318 between Linchester and Federalsburg was originally MD 319 , which was constructed as a state @-@ aid road from Federalsburg to about halfway to <unk> around 1919 . The state highway was completed west to U.S. Route 213 ( now MD 331 ) and MD 16 near Preston by 1930 . MD 318 from Federalsburg to the Delaware state line was built between 1924 and 1926 . MD 318 was extended west through Federalsburg and over the whole length of MD 319 in 1956 . The state highway west of Federalsburg was widened around 1958 and extended west fully into Dorchester County to its present terminus when MD 331 and MD 16 were relocated around Ellwood in 1960 . MD 318 was placed on the Federalsburg Bypass when the highway was extended south and east around the town to the present intersection with MD 315 in 1964 ; MD 318 through the town was renumbered MD 315 . The Federalsburg Roundabout was constructed in 1998 . The Federalsburg Bypass bridge over Marshyhope Creek , which was originally built in 1962 , will be rehabilitated in 2012 . During the project , which will replace the bridge 's deck , alternating one @-@ way traffic will cross the bridge directed by traffic lights at either end of the construction area .

 = SS Czar = 
 SS Czar , or <unk> in Russian , was an ocean liner for the Russian American Line before World War I. The ship was later known as Estonia for the Baltic American Line , Pułaski for the Gdynia America Line and as a British Ministry of War Transport troopship , and as Empire Penryn after World War II . The liner was built in Glasgow for the Russian American Line in 1912 and sailed on North Atlantic routes from Libau to New York . On one eastbound voyage in October 1913 , Czar was one of ten ships that came to the aid of the burning Uranium Line steamer Volturno . 
 After the Russian Revolution , the ship came under the control of the British Shipping Controller and was managed by the Wilson Line and later , the Cunard Line . Under Cunard management in 1918 as HMT Czar , she was employed as a troopship carrying United States troops to France as part of the United States Navy 's Cruiser and Transport Force . After the end of World War I , the ship was returned to the East Asiatic Company , the parent company of the Russian American Line , who placed her on their Baltic American Line sailing in roundtrip passenger service to New York under the name Estonia . She was sold to the Polish Gdynia America Line in 1930 , and renamed SS Pułaski the following year for Polish passenger service to North and South America . 
 After the outbreak of World War II , Pułaski was initially used as a French and , after the Fall of France , a British troopship . Pułaski sailed variously in the North Atlantic , between African ports , and in the Indian Ocean . In 1946 , the ship 's name was changed to Empire Penryn and continued trooping duties under the management of Lamport & Holt . She was scrapped in 1949 at Blyth . 
 = = Launching and early career = = 
 Ocean liner SS Czar was launched on 23 March 1912 by Barclay Curle & Company of Glasgow , Scotland , for the Russian American Line , a subsidiary of the Danish East Asiatic Company . Czar had a 6 @,@ 503 gross tonnage ( GT ) and measured 425 feet ( 130 m ) long by 53 @.@ 2 feet ( 16 @.@ 2 m ) abeam and had two funnels and two masts . She was driven by twin screw propellers at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ) by two steam engines . Czar had accommodations for 30 passengers in first class , 260 in second class , and 1 @,@ 086 in third class and steerage . 
 Czar sailed on her maiden voyage on 30 May 1912 from Libau ( present @-@ day Liepāja , Latvia ) to Copenhagen and New York , arriving in the latter city on 13 June . She replaced <unk> on the Libau – New York route , and sailed opposite various combinations of Kursk , Russia , <unk> , and Dwinsk through July 1914 . 
 On her 5 August 1913 sailing from Libau , Czar carried a young Mark Rothko and his family on their way to join his father in the United States ; Rothko went on to become a well @-@ known American abstract expressionist painter and printmaker . On her October 1913 eastbound crossing , Czar responded to the distress calls of the Uranium Line steamer Volturno on fire in the middle of the Atlantic The liner joined nine other ships that came to the aid of the stricken ship . Amidst stormy seas , Czar 's crew rescued 102 passengers from Volturno , more than any other of the rescue ships , apart from the SS Grosser Kurfürst which rescued 105 . In March 1914 , King George V of the United Kingdom , on recommendation of the Board of Trade , awarded 19 of Czar 's crew the Silver Sea Gallantry Medal , along with a £ 3 award each . 
 = = World War I = = 
 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Czar switched to service from Archangel to New York , but ran only sporadically through 1916 . After the Russian Revolution , the East Asiatic Company suspended service on the Russian American Line , and transferred several ships , including Czar , to British registry . The British shipping controller initially placed the liner under the management of John Ellerman 's Wilson Line , but Czar was transferred to the Cunard Line management by the end of 1917 . 
 Known by this time as HMT Czar , the ship , along with former Russian American Line ships Czaritza , Kursk , and Dwinsk , was attached to the Cruiser and Transport Force of the United States Navy , and made three trips carrying American troops to France . Czar sailed on her first voyage with American troops on 16 April 1918 , when she departed from the Hoboken Port of Embarkation , with U.S. Navy transports Maui , Calamares , Pocahontas , El Oriente , and British troopship HMT Czaritza . The convoy was joined by transport Mount Vernon and was escorted by American cruiser Seattle . The convoy arrived safely in France on 28 April . Sources do not report when Czar returned to the United States , but she had done so by early June . 
 Czar loaded troops at Newport News , Virginia , and set out on her second U.S. convoy crossing on 14 June , sailing with American transports Princess Matoika , Wilhelmina , Pastores , and Lenape . On the morning of 16 June , lookouts on Princess Matoika spotted a submarine and , soon after , a torpedo missed that ship by a few yards . Later that morning , the Newport News ships met up with the New York portion of the convoy — which included DeKalb , Finland , Kroonland , George Washington , Covington , Rijndam , Italian steamer Dante Alighieri , and British steamer <unk> — and set out for France . The convoy was escorted by American cruisers North Carolina and Frederick , and destroyers Stevens and Fairfax ; battleship Texas and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time . The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for a submarine , but otherwise uneventfully arrived at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June . 
 When she departed Newport News on 7 October , Czar began her last voyage ferrying American troops to France . Sailing in company with U.S. Navy transports Tenadores , Susquehanna , and America , she rendezvoused with American transport Kroonland , Italian steamer Caserta , and British steamer Euripides out of New York . The convoy ships were escorted by cruisers Seattle and Rochester , and destroyers Murray and Fairfax . The ships arrived safely in France on 20 October . 
 Throughout 1919 and into 1920 , HMT Czar continued transporting Commonwealth troops under Cunard management . The troopship primarily sailed between British ports and Mediterranean ports such as Trieste , Malta , Alexandria , and Constantinople . One typical voyage from Alexandria returned 1 @,@ 600 officers and men — who had been serving in Palestine , Syria , and Egypt — to Plymouth in January 1920 . Czar also played a role in the North Russia Campaign of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War when the liner departed Hull for North Russia on 28 August 1919 . <unk> Czar arrived in the Tyne , from Murmansk last Friday ( 15 August 1919 ) , with about 1 @,@ 800 British and Italian troops from the Syren Force North Russia . Amongst them were about 100 officers , <unk> 's and men of the 6th and 13th Battalions Yorkshire Regiment . 
 = = Interwar civilian service = = 
 By late 1920 , Czar had been returned to the East Asiatic Company , which placed her in service for the Baltic American Line under the new name of Estonia . For her first Baltic American trip she sailed from Glasgow on 11 January 1921 for New York , Danzig , and Libau , arriving at the latter by mid @-@ February . Departing from Libau on 23 February , she began a regular Libau – Danzig – Boston – New York service , sailing opposite <unk> and Polonia . 
 In February 1925 , Estonia was reconditioned and outfitted with accommodations for 290 cabin @-@ class and 500 third @-@ class passengers . The following March , her accommodations were altered for 110 cabin @-@ class , 180 tourist @-@ class , and 500 third @-@ class passengers . Her last voyage for the Baltic American Line began on 31 January 1930 when she sailed from Danzig to Copenhagen , Halifax , and New York . Sold to the Polish @-@ owned Gdynia America Line , she sailed 13 March for one more trip on the Danzig – New York route under the name Estonia . Before her next voyage on 25 April , she was renamed Pułaski , after Polish soldier and American Revolutionary War general Kazimierz Pułaski . SS Pułaski continued sailing the same route through August 1935 , when she was moved to Gdynia – Buenos Aires service . She began her last voyage on this route on 21 April 1939 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 With the signing of the Anglo @-@ Polish military alliance impending , Pułaski sailed from Gdynia to Falmouth on 24 August 1939 . On 26 September , the ship left Dartmouth for Gibraltar ( calling there on 2 September ) and Piraeus , where she arrived on 13 October . Picking up Polish soldiers there , she sailed five days later for Marseille , where she eventually arrived on 2 December . Until March 1940 , Pułaski underwent a refit in Marseille after which she sailed under charter to the French Fabre Line . At the end of the 1930s , the Fabre Line sailed ships on a Marseille – Dakar route with intermediate stops in other African ports . 
 On 10 March , Pułaski departed Marseille on the first of three voyages from that port . She sailed to Algiers and from there to Dakar on 13 March . Pułaski left Dakar for Freetown , Sierra Leone , and Konakry , French Guinea , returning to Dakar in early April . Sailing for Marseille on 5 April , the ship returned on 13 April as a part of convoy DF 29 . Leaving again about two weeks later , she repeated the trip and returned to Marseille on 29 May as a part of convoy DF 41 . By the time of her return , the German invasion of France had been underway for nearly three weeks . 
 Pułaski sailed on her third and final French voyage on 6 June . The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June , and sailed the next day for Freetown , where she arrived on 18 June . Likely because of the confusion surrounding the French surrender on 22 June , Pułaski 's movements over the next days are unrecorded , but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities . That evening , Pułaski 's crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor in defiance of the detainment . After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry , the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July . 
 = = = British trooping duties = = = 
 On 14 August , Pułaski , Kościuszko ( the latest name of the former Czaritza ) , and Batory were chartered by the Ministry of War Transport for trooping duties and placed under the management of Lamport & Holt of Liverpool . All three ships retained their Polish crews but also carried a Lamport & Holt liaison officer aboard . Four days later , Pułaski joined convoy SL 44 , the 44th wartime convoy from Sierra Leone to Liverpool , with nearly 30 other ships and 10 escorts . Pułaski and about half of the ships departed the convoy at Liverpool on 7 September , while the other half continued on for Methil . 
 Pułaski next made her way to the Clyde in late October . Between 10 May and 12 June 1941 , she sailed on three roundtrip trooping runs between Clyde and Iceland . In late June , Pułaski , loaded with 2 @,@ 047 troops , sailed from Clyde to join convoy WS 9B headed for Freetown . The convoy arrived at its destination on 13 July . After three days , Pułaski and four other ships sailed on to Cape Town , arriving on 27 July . Leaving behind one ship at Cape Town , Pułaski and the others sailed on 30 July to their final destination of Aden , where they arrived in mid August . 
 Over the next seven months , Pułaski operated in the Indian Ocean , primarily sailing between Middle Eastern and East African ports . Beginning in late August , Pułaski sailed between Aden and ports of Suez , Durban , Berbera , Mombasa , Massawa , Port Sudan , and Kilindini . From Kilindini , in March 1942 , the liner sailed to Colombo and back to Durban on 8 April . While at Durban , a fire gutted the bridge in what may have been sabotage . 
 The damaged Pułaski made her way to East London in South Africa on 11 April where she remained under repair until June . Departing East London on 25 June , she resumed her Middle Eastern and African runs between Aden , Suez , and Durban . In November , the transport departed Aden and called at Basra , Bandar Abbas , and Karachi , before returning to Durban in early December . After nearly a two @-@ month stay at Durban , Pułaski returned to her trooping duties in the Indian Ocean on 1 February 1943 . She made her first visits to Diego Suarez , Zanzibar , and Tamatave in March , and Djibouti in April . 
 After a return to East London from Durban on 30 May , the ship put in for another extended stay , this time for four months . Resuming her trooping runs on 29 September , Pułaski began a year of almost continuous sailing . During this span , which lasted until mid @-@ September 1944 , the ship called at Bombay twice in addition to numerous stops in Aden , Suez , Durban , and Kilindini . Putting in at Durban on 15 September , Pułaski had a general refit over the next four months . 
 Pułaski resumed her Indian Ocean service when she left Durban on 21 January 1945 , headed for Kilindini . She visited Dar es Salaam for the first time in April , and departed from her first visit to Madras on Victory in Europe Day , 8 May 1945 . Headed to Akyab , Burma , she started the first of five India – Burma roundtrips through July . Over the next months , she shuttled between Rangoon , Calcutta ( where she was docked on Victory over Japan Day ) , Chittagong , Madras , and Colombo , arriving at the latter port for the final time on 12 September . From Colombo she sailed into the Western Pacific for Singapore where she arrived for the first of several visits on 14 September , two days after the Japanese garrison there surrendered . Through the end of 1945 , Pułaski continued sailing between Singapore and India , making additional stops at Port Swettenham , Chittagong , Sourabaya , and Batavia . 
 Pułaski arrived at Calcutta on 23 December 1945 . After this time , the ship continued to sail in trooping duties in the Indian Ocean , though her specific movements are not known . In March 1946 , Pułaski was purchased by the Ministry of War Transport for £ 100 @,@ 000 . It was around this time the Polish crews of Pułaski and Kościuszko refused to be repatriated to Soviet @-@ occupied Poland . The crew members all signed British articles . On 16 April 1946 , Pułaski was formally handed over to British authorities , who renamed the vessel Empire Penryn : Empire to match the naming convention for miscellaneous British auxiliary ships ; Penryn for the port of Penryn , Cornwall . Remaining under Lamport & Holt management , Empire Penryn performed trooping duties in the Mediterranean . The ship was taken out of service in 1948 , and was scrapped at Blyth in 1949 .

 Plans for a freeway linking southeast Kansas City to Independence were first published in 1955 in a document titled General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas . The first portions of the highway that were signed I @-@ 470 were established in 1970 , between I @-@ 70 and US 40 in Independence . The north @-@ south portion of the highway , then designated US 71 Bypass had been in existence since 1970 and was renumbered to Route 291 between 1970 and 1971 . Between 1979 and 1980 , the portion of the freeway between the Grandview Triangle and the Exit 7 cloverleaf had been completed . US 50 's alignment was changed to follow I @-@ 470 west to the Grandview Triangle , and the old routing of US 50 was renumbered Route 350 . The section of freeway between US 50 and Route 291 was opened to traffic in 1983 , completing the route . Between 1980 and 1983 , the portion of the route that is concurrent with Route 291 was upgraded to freeway standards and included in the I @-@ 470 loop . 
 Since construction of the highway , three interchanges have been added or expanded . The first addition was an interchange with View High Drive , which was constructed in early 1993 costing about $ 2 million to complete . The second was an addition to the existing cloverleaf at US 50 in Lee 's Summit , adding access roads to Pryor Road and Northwest Blue Parkway . Construction on that interchange began in July 2007 , and was completed by September 2008 . The third interchange , with Strother Road was first planned to be constructed in 2008 . The road served to provide access to the industrial park west of the freeway , and to spur new development on land pending sale by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints to the east of the freeway . The interchange was opened to traffic in August 2010 at a final construction cost of around $ 18 million . 
 In July 2010 , MoDOT closed the westbound lanes of I @-@ 470 near the Grandview Triangle due to large cracks that formed in the roadway . A buildup of ground water underneath the westbound lanes caused a 42 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 13 m ) retaining wall to fail . A landslide occurred on July 17 which created a 35 @-@ by @-@ 200 @-@ foot ( 11 m × 61 m ) hole in the roadway . The eastbound lanes were not affected and were not closed .

 = Mind Games ( John Lennon album ) = 
 Mind Games is the fourth studio album by John Lennon . It was recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York in summer 1973 . The album was released in the US 29 October 1973 and the UK 16 November 1973 . The album was Lennon 's first self @-@ produced recording without help from Phil Spector . Like his previous album , the politically topical and somewhat abrasive Some Time in New York City , Mind Games was poorly received by some music critics upon release . It reached number 13 in the UK and number 9 in the US , where it was certified gold . 
 The album was recorded while Lennon was having difficulties with US immigration and at the beginning of his 18 @-@ month separation from Yoko Ono . The title track was released as a single at the same time as the album . The album itself was later reissued several times throughout the 1970s and 1980s . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the start of 1973 , John Lennon began distancing himself from the political and social issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months . It was also around this time that he and his wife , Yoko Ono , were going through marital problems . As Ono was completing her fourth album , Feeling the Space , Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album , and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono 's album . Shortly thereafter , he asked Pang to book them for his sessions . Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City , Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment . He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material . 
 Amid frequent court appearances battling to stay in the United States , Lennon became stressed , a situation that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI , due to his political activism . Lennon said " I just couldn 't function , you know ? I was so paranoid from them <unk> ' the phone and <unk> ' me . " All this combined made Lennon begin to feel emotionally withdrawn . Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games , writing all the songs for it in a week . 
 Under the moniker of " The Plastic <unk> Band " , Lennon engaged the services of session drummer Jim Keltner , guitarist David Spinozza , Gordon Edwards on bass , Arthur Jenkins on percussion , Michael Brecker on saxophone , Ken Ascher on piano and organ , and the vocal backing of a group called Something Different . Difficulties between Lennon and Ono became more and more noticeable around this time . Just as the sessions were to get under way in June at New York 's Record Plant Studios , John and Yoko separated . At Ono 's urging , Pang became Lennon 's companion and lover in what would become an 18 @-@ month relationship later renowned as Lennon 's ' lost weekend ' . 
 = = Recording and content = = 
 Mind Games was recorded between July and August 1973 in Lennon 's characteristic quick fashion , and was mixed over a two @-@ week period . Lennon produced the album by himself , following his previous three @-@ year partnership with Phil Spector . When the album was remixed in 2002 , many audio anomalies hidden in the original mixing were uncovered . Some rough mixes appear on bootlegs and on 1997 's John Lennon Anthology . 
 The album continued Lennon 's previous attempts to chronicle his life through his songs , the tone of which displays a range of mixed feelings . Among the sombre and melodic songs directed to Ono , " <unk> ( I 'm Sorry ) " was originally titled " Call My Name " , a song in which Lennon was offering to comfort someone , whereas the final version sees him asking for forgiveness . In " One Day ( At a Time ) " , Lennon sings about his devotion to Ono . " Out the Blue " also reflects Lennon 's devotion to his wife , and reflects its author 's self @-@ doubt as a result of their separation . " Out the Blue " incorporates several musical genres , starting with a gentle , melancholy acoustic guitar and moving through gospel , country and choral music portions . Another love song , " You Are Here " took its title from Lennon 's one @-@ off art exhibition at the Robert Frazer Gallery . By the time of the Mind Games sessions , the composition had gone through several different themes , before Lennon settled on the theme of love and peace . The original master take of " You Are Here " featured an extra verse , that was about Japan and England . 
 Other songs on the album are more light @-@ hearted and optimistic , marking the return of Lennon 's humour and wit after the uncompromising doctrine espoused on Some Time in New York City . These tracks include " Intuition " , in which Lennon relates how life experience has honed his instincts and how it 's good to have gotten through it . While demoing the song on piano in early 1973 , with the lyrics still incomplete , he added a few lines from two previously released tracks – " How ? " , from Imagine ( 1971 ) , and " God " , from John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band ( 1970 ) . " Only People " reflects his and Ono 's personal philosophy . Lennon later said that it failed as a song , however ; in an interview with Playboy Magazine , he remarked : " It was a good lick , but I couldn 't get the words to make sense . " 
 Also appearing on Mind Games are songs that indulged Lennon 's affinity for pure rock ' n ' roll , such as " Tight A $ " , the title of which was a pun on the expressions " tight as " and " tight ass " . The track is in the rockabilly style with a 1950s sound , along the lines of songs that inspired Lennon in his youth . Another rock track , " Meat City " contains lyrics more in keeping with Lennon 's earlier penchant for obscure imagery over the personal . The song was a boogie piece until late in 1971 , when it began to take its final form , although with improvised lyrics . By late 1972 , Lennon had rewritten the words and finished developing the melody . 
 The song " Mind Games " , with its " love is the answer " refrain and call to " make love not war " , recalls Lennon 's work with the Beatles in 1967 . He started writing the track during the band 's Get Back sessions , in early 1969 , with the title " Make Love , Not War " . Lennon finished it after reading the book Mind Games : The Guide to Inner Space . Lennon had recorded demos of the retitled " Mind Games " on 28 and 29 December 1970 , at his home studio , Ascot Sound Studios . 
 " Bring on the Lucie ( <unk> <unk> ) " dated from late 1971 , having started out as little more than a chorus , after Lennon acquired a National guitar . Once he had worked on the lyrics , the song went from a simple political slogan to a full @-@ blown statement that hints at his earlier work , such as " Imagine " and " Power to the People " . " Only People " and the three @-@ second silent " Nutopian International Anthem " were the only political tracks on the album . The latter referred to " Nutopia : The Country of Peace " , a conceptual country which the Lennons had announced at a press conference in New York City on April Fool 's Day 1973 . " I Know ( I Know ) " features lyrics in which Lennon apologises for his thoughtlessness and discusses the causes of his insecurity . On some of the rough mixes available on bootlegs , the time @-@ consuming overdubbing on the song is apparent , as Lennon gradually refined the arrangement . The final track on Mind Games , " Meat City " contains a Lennon curse , " Fuck a pig ! " , sped up and backwards , while the mix used as the B @-@ side to the " Mind Games " single gave the same treatment to the phrase " Check the album ! " 
 " Rock and Roll People " was also recorded during the album 's sessions and given to Johnny Winter for his John Dawson Winter III album . Lennon 's version remained unreleased until 1986 's posthumous Menlove Ave. album . 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 Tony King , vice @-@ president of Apple Records in Los Angeles at the time , convinced Lennon to promote Mind Games , arranging interviews for Lennon with Billboard and Record World . He also persuaded Lennon to do a television commercial in which King dressed up as the Queen of England and waltzed with Lennon ( the commercial session can be seen in the 1988 film Imagine : John Lennon ) . King reprised his role as the Queen for two radio spots promoting the album . 
 Lennon created the Mind Games album cover himself , hand @-@ cutting the photos . The front and back covers are similar ; on the back sleeve Lennon is more toward the foreground , representing his symbolic walking away from Ono and her apparent mountainous influence on him . 
 Mind Games was released on 29 October in America and 16 November in Britain , around the same time as Ono 's Feeling the Space . Apple Records issued the title track as a single , with the release dates matching those of the album in the US and UK . The single reached number 26 in the UK , and peaked at number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US . The album charted at number 13 in the UK and peaked at number 9 on Billboard 's Top LP 's listings . Although Mind Games sold better than Some Time in New York City , its release " came and went with barely a ripple " , according to Beatles biographer Chris Ingham . Author Peter Doggett similarly writes that the album " did nothing to alter [ Lennon 's ] status as the least commercially successful Beatle " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Jon Landau of Rolling Stone magazine assessed the songs on Mind Games as " his worst writing yet " and considered that Lennon was " helplessly trying to impose his own gargantuan ego upon an audience … [ that ] is waiting hopefully for him to chart a new course " . While finding the music " listenable " , Landau identified the album 's lyrics as " misguided in so underrating his audience 's intelligence " and added : " But then , perhaps Lennon 's didacticism , preaching and banality are part of the mind game of the album 's title … " More impressed , Melody Maker 's Ray Coleman found that " The raw nerves of a Lennon battered by America 's curious logic and sheer hard @-@ heartedness seem to have spurred him to write incisively … " Coleman concluded of Mind Games : " Musically or melodically this may not be a stand @-@ out album , but if you warm to the rasping voice of Lennon and , like me , regard him as the true fulcrum of much of what came from his old group , then like any new Lennon album , it will be enjoyable and even important . " In a mixed review , Robert Christgau described the album as " A step in the right direction , but only a step " . He complimented " Mind Games " as well as the songs " One Day ( At a Time ) " and " You Are Here " , but criticised Lennon for " falling back on ideas that have lost their freshness for him " . 
 Writing in their 1975 book The Beatles : An Illustrated Record , NME journalists Roy Carr and Tony Tyler opined that Mind Games " bears all the hallmarks of being made without any definite objective in mind – other than to redeem the unpleasantness of Some Time In New York City " . While noting the singer 's attempts to re @-@ create " the lyricism and melodic inventiveness " of Imagine , Carr and Tyler continued : " The reason the total album is not more effective can be laid at the door of Lennon 's personal situation , and on his tendency to react to events , instead of initiating them . " In The Beatles Apart ( 1981 ) , Bob Woffinden considered that , aside from the " excellent " title track and " Bring on the Lucie " , Mind Games " consisted of so @-@ so songs that hardly lodged in the memory " , and that " The best one can say of the album is that it 's exceptionally well produced . " 
 In a more recent review , for AllMusic , critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that " confusion … lies at the heart of the album . Lennon doesn 't know which way to go , so he tries everything . " Erlewine adds : " While the best numbers are among Lennon 's finest , there 's only a handful of them , and the remainder of the record is simply pleasant . "

 One South Broad , also known as the Lincoln @-@ Liberty Building or PNB Building , is a 28 @-@ story 472 @-@ foot ( 144 m ) office tower in Center City , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States . The art deco tower , designed by architect John Torrey <unk> as an annex for Wanamaker 's department store , was completed in 1932 . Wanamaker 's Men 's Store opened in the first seven floors of the building , which is located a block from Wanamaker 's main store , and was intended to rival European department stores with its size and selection . In 1952 , the Philadelphia National Bank ( PNB ) bought the building and converted it into offices and banking space . Until 2014 , the building 's bell tower was decorated on all four sides with PNB 's initials in stainless steel 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) tall . Wells Fargo is the main tenant , occupying almost half the building . The former banking space at street level was converted to retail and restaurant space in 2000 . 
 Containing 465 @,@ 000 square feet ( 43 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space , One South Broad features a three @-@ story gallery lobby that connects to the Widener Building , adjacent to the south . The 24th and 25th floors originally featured a luxurious penthouse designed for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife ; it was converted to office use in 2000 by independent advertising agency Red Tettemer O 'Connell + Partners . The tower houses the 17 @-@ ton Founder 's Bell , one of the largest in the world , a tribute to John Wanamaker by his son Rodman ; listed on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places by the Philadelphia Historical Commission , the bell is rung hourly , except for Sundays . 
 = = History = = 
 In the late 1920s , numerous high @-@ rises were being built in Center City Philadelphia . Among the businesses constructing their own skyscrapers was Wanamaker 's department store . Under direction of Wanamaker President William L. Nevin , Wanamaker 's decided to expand its Philadelphia store by constructing a new building that would contain a store catering to the " Philadelphia gentleman " . Nevin directed Wanamaker 's to buy property on South Broad Street across the street from Philadelphia City Hall . The land was the site of two late @-@ 19th @-@ century 13 @-@ story high @-@ rises . On the corner of Broad and Penn Square stood the Lincoln Building , originally called the Betz Building . South of that stood the Liberty Building on the corner of Broad and Chestnut Streets . Both buildings were demolished in 1926 to make way for the Lincoln @-@ Liberty Building . 
 The Lincoln @-@ Liberty Building , completed in 1932 , was intended to partly house a large men 's department store and offices . The building 's cornerstone was set on October 1 , 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City , Paris and London . The Wanamaker Men 's Store opened on October 12 , 1932 , with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and the ringing of the building 's Founders Bell . Opening during the Great Depression , Nevin said the new building was a sign of the store 's faith that the economy would improve . Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection , the men 's store ordered US $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store of its kind in the world . As early as 1939 there were rumors the men 's store would close , but Wanamaker 's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space . When a new tenant was ready to take the store 's place in the 1950s , the men 's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street . 
 In the early 1950s , the Philadelphia National Bank ( PNB ) needed to expand into a larger space than it currently occupied . On November 3 , 1952 , the bank bought the Lincoln @-@ Liberty Building for US $ 8 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 . PNB president Frederic A. Potts said , " The purchase of this building will enable the Philadelphia National Bank more adequately and efficiently to support the large @-@ scale industrial and commercial expansion under way in this city . " The bank spent millions of dollars modernizing the building and converting the former department store floors to banking space . Among the changes was the addition of a sign with the bank 's initials in 1955 . The bank officially opened in what was now called the PNB Building on January 16 , 1956 . The opening included turning on a rooftop weather indicator and celebration of the 250th anniversary of Benjamin Franklin 's birth . 
 The building was owned by the PNB and later its parent company CoreStates until it was sold to the JPMorgan Strategic Property Fund in 1996 for almost US $ 28 @.@ 5 million . In 1998 the building 's second @-@ largest tenant , law firm Drinker Biddle & <unk> , left for One Logan Square . The resulting vacancy prompted the owners to renovate the building , renamed One South Broad , at a cost of US $ 10 million . Renovations included modernizing the elevators , security and safety systems and converting the lower floors to retail and restaurant space . The renovations took eighteen months and One South Broad was officially rededicated on May 3 , 2000 . 
 In April 2003 JPMorgan sold One South Broad to real @-@ estate investor David Werner for US $ 48 million . Ninety @-@ percent occupied in 2003 , One Broad Street 's largest tenant was Wachovia . Wachovia had gained office space in the tower after merging with First Union Corporation , which had merged with CoreStates in 1998 . In 2006 Wachovia re @-@ negotiated its lease , which was set to expire in 2010 . After looking at other potential space in Center City , Wachovia made a deal to stay in One South Broad and three nearby properties , the Witherspoon Building , Wells Fargo Building , and the neighboring Widener Building , until the 2020s .

 One South Broad is a 28 @-@ story 472 feet ( 144 m ) art deco office tower on south Broad Street in Center City Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Designed by architect John Torrey <unk> , the skyscraper contains 465 @,@ 000 square feet ( 43 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space . One South Broad originally had an ornate lower facade with a lot of detail and fluting that was removed in the 1950s renovation . Philadelphia National Bank 's renovations included the addition of granite black slabs on the street level facade . These were removed in the 2000 renovation and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the skyscraper 's original architecture . The 2000 renovation also created a new entrance on the building 's Broad Street front , which leads to a three @-@ story gallery lobby . The lobby was expanded by demolishing a wall and connecting it to the lobby of the neighboring Widener Building . 
 Containing 9 @,@ 000 square feet ( 840 m2 ) each , the 24th and 25th floors were used as a penthouse apartment for Rodman Wanamaker , consisting of five bedrooms , six baths , and outdoor terraces . The rooms featured hardwood floors , marble fireplaces , and detailed cast @-@ plaster crown molding . Originally the penthouse apartment was to be for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife but Wanamaker died in 1928 before the building was completed . Rodman Wanamaker 's wife lived there only briefly , as she did not like the ringing bell in the tower overhead . The penthouse floors were converted to office use in 2000 by creative agency Red Tettemer + Partners . The firm <unk> / <unk> Architects modernized the basic office space on the 24th floor while preserving the ornate molding and materials that decorate the rest of the former penthouse space . 
 The Philadelphia National Bank 's initials adorned the top of the building , surrounding the top of the structure 's bell tower , until 2014 . The letters , which were made of 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) stainless steel , each weighed 3 @,@ 000 pounds ( 1 @,@ 400 kg ) . Until the 1970s , PNB used the sign to forecast weather by lighting the letters in red to indicate a warming trend , or green to predict the opposite . Wachovia considered removing the PNB sign in 2003 to replace it with its own signage , but , in response , some Philadelphians expressed nostalgia for the name of the former Philadelphia institution and hoped the sign would stay . The Philadelphia Historical Commission stated that the sign was not an integral part of the building 's design or as significant to the city as the nearby PSFS Building 's sign . On August 17 , 2014 , three of the PNB letters were removed from the building by helicopter , and the remaining nine were removed the following November 16 .

 Within the bell tower is the 17 @-@ ton Founder 's Bell . The bell was cast in 1925 under a commission by Rodman Wanamaker to honor his father John Wanamaker , founder of the department store . Cast by Gillett & Johnston in the United Kingdom , the bell is 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 90 m ) at the rim and 7 feet 9 inches ( 2 @.@ 36 m ) high and is one of the largest bells in the world . The bell was brought in 1926 by the Cunard liner <unk> to New York City , from which it was conveyed to Philadelphia by rail . The bell was carried on a flatcar and had clearance of only 2 inches ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) in some of the tunnels the train passed through . 
 Tuned to a low D bass clef , the bell 's original home was the Wanamaker Building , a block from One South Broad . It hung 325 feet ( 99 m ) above the street in a specially built tower on the building 's roof . Hung on December 23 , 1926 , the bell was first rung on New Year 's Eve of that year . The bell is rung every hour , except on Sundays . The bell was originally intended to swing in the tower on top of One South Broad , but when it was it shook the building . A hammer driven by a 230 @-@ volt electric motor was later installed and currently rings the bell . The ringing of the bell , which can be heard for 25 miles ( 40 km ) , is often mistakenly assumed to come from City Hall 's clock tower across the street . 
 Philadelphia Orchestra conductor Leopold Stokowski wrote in 1962 that the bell had " one of the finest sounds I have heard anywhere in America , Europe or Russia " . In June 2000 the Founder 's Bell was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places by the Philadelphia Historical Commission .

 The Wanamaker 's Men 's Store occupied the first seven floors of the skyscraper until 1952 when the Philadelphia National Bank moved into the building . Over the years PNB became CoreStates , First Union Corp , Wachovia and finally Wells Fargo . Wells Fargo , which bought Wachovia in 2008 , is One Broad Street 's main tenant , occupying about half the building . Other tenants include various law firms , advertising firm Nitrogen US , public relations firm Tonic Life Communications , consulting company Electronic Ink , and the advertising agency Red Tettemer O 'Connell + Partners . Past tenants have included Sylvania Electric Products , law firm Drinker Biddle & <unk> , and advertising and public relations firm Earle Palmer Brown . 
 The street @-@ level space was converted into a bank once PNB bought the building . The bank branch closed in the 1990s and was converted into two roughly 8 @,@ 000 square feet ( 740 m2 ) areas intended for retail or restaurant use . A McCormick & <unk> 's restaurant opened in the Broad @-@ Street – Penn @-@ Square corner in 2001 . In late 2002 , the Broad and Chestnut Streets corner was occupied by a Borders bookstore , which moved into the two @-@ story @-@ plus @-@ mezzanine 27 @,@ 000 square feet ( 2 @,@ 500 m2 ) space after vacating the 1727 Walnut Street location it had occupied since 1990 . Borders closed its store in 2011 . A three @-@ story Walgreens presently occupies the site ( 2014 ) and areas of the exceptionally beautiful Wanamaker Men 's Store plasterwork ceiling are visible at the upper stories . 
 = U.S. Route 13 in Maryland = 
 U.S. Route 13 ( US 13 ) is a U.S. Highway running from Fayetteville , North Carolina north to Morrisville , Pennsylvania . In the U.S. state of Maryland , the route runs 42 @.@ 48 mi ( 68 @.@ 36 km ) from the Virginia border south of Pocomoke City in Worcester County north to the Delaware border in Delmar , Wicomico County , where the route intersects Route 54 , which runs along the state line . The majority of the route within Maryland is a four @-@ lane divided highway that passes through rural areas of woodland and farmland . The route also runs through a few municipalities including Pocomoke City and Princess Anne and it bypasses Salisbury and Fruitland to the east on the Salisbury Bypass , which is a freeway . US 13 intersects many major roads including the southern terminus of US 113 in Pocomoke City , Maryland Route 413 ( MD 413 ) in Westover , and MD 12 and US 50 where the route is on the Salisbury Bypass . The route shares a concurrency with US 50 along a portion of the Salisbury Bypass . 
 US 13 was designated through Maryland when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926 , running along existing roads . It formed a part of the Ocean Highway , a road that connected the New York City area to Florida , and still carries that name for much of its route in Maryland . Many realignments of the route occurred over the years . The route was realigned between Princess Anne and Fruitland in 1933 and between Westover and Princess Anne in 1935 . Between 1938 and 1942 , Salisbury Boulevard was built to carry US 13 through Salisbury ; the route previously followed Camden Avenue and Division Street . In the 1950s , portions of the route were widened to a divided highway and a bypass of Delmar was built . US 13 was rerouted to bypass Princess Anne in 1959 and Pocomoke City in 1963 . The remainder of US 13 in Maryland was widened into a divided highway in the 1960s . In 1973 , construction began to build the limited @-@ access Salisbury Bypass to the east of the city . US 13 was moved onto the completed Salisbury Bypass in 1981 .

 Entering the state from Virginia , US 13 heads north on Ocean Highway , a four @-@ lane divided highway that runs a short distance to the east of the Bay Coast Railroad line . Upon entering Maryland , US 13 features a welcome center in the northbound direction . It continues north through wooded areas before heading into a mix of farmland and woodland with some residences and businesses along the road . As the road approaches Pocomoke City , more businesses start to line the road . Before entering Pocomoke City , US 13 Business ( US 13 Bus . ) heads northwest from US 13 on Market Street into the downtown area . Past this intersection , the road enters Pocomoke City . The route crosses MD 366 ( Stockton Road ) , which itself has its western terminus at US 13 Bus . , and continues north past a shopping center , meeting the southern terminus of US 113 , as well as MD 250A ( Old Virginia Road ) , along the eastern edge of town . Continuing around the northern edge of the town , the route passes residential areas to the southwest and rural areas to the northeast before heading into a commercial district and intersecting MD 756 ( Old Snow Hill Road ) . US 13 turns west into wooded areas before crossing the Pocomoke River upstream of US 13 Bus .. 
 = = = Somerset County = = = 
 Upon crossing the Pocomoke River , US 13 heads into Somerset County and intersects the northern terminus of US 13 Bus. and the southern terminus of MD 364 ( Dividing Creek Road ) . From here , the route curves to the northwest and runs through rural countryside . It features an intersection with the eastern terminus of MD 667 ( <unk> Road ) , and the route continues from farmland into heavy woodland . US 13 heads back into agricultural areas where it intersects many unsigned suffixed segments of MD 920 which are mostly short , dead @-@ end roads . The route continues west and northwest before it intersects MD 673 ( Sam Barnes Road ) , which provides a connection to southbound MD 413 and Crisfield . Past MD 673 , US 13 turns north and meets the northern terminus of MD 413 ( Crisfield Highway ) , with access to that route only in the southbound direction . 
 Now running north @-@ northeast , the highway heads through heavy woodland , with trees in the median . US 13 intersects MD 640 ( <unk> Neck Road ) , which heads west to serve the Eastern Correctional Institution . From here , the road heads north through a mix of woods and farms , running a short distance to the west of a Norfolk Southern rail line . It is eventually paralleled to the west by the main segment of unsigned MD 920 ( Market Lane ) , which serves as a frontage road . Along this stretch , more development starts to line the road as it approaches Princess Anne . After the northern terminus of MD 920 , MD 675 heads north from US 13 into downtown Princess Anne on Somerset Avenue ( US 13 's original alignment through Princess Anne ) . The route curves northwest again as it bypasses the town . 
 Skirting the western edge of the town , the route intersects MD 363 ( Deal Island Road / Manokin Avenue ) next to Manokin River Park . Continuing north , the route soon intersects MD 362 and passes by some businesses past that intersection . The next intersection is for MD 822 ( <unk> Boulevard ) , which heads east to provide access to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore campus . US 13 curves northeast and exits the town , intersecting the northern terminus of MD 675 in the town 's outskirts . It continues through wooded areas , again closely paralleling the Norfolk Southern rail line . US 13 intersects the northern terminus of MD 529 , a rural route that heads south back to Princess Anne on Loretto Road . Past MD 529 , the road continues northeast , intersecting Peggy Neck Road . From here , the highway heads through more woodland before passing through the community of Eden and continuing into open farmland . 
 = = = Wicomico County = = = 
 US 13 crosses the <unk> Creek into Wicomico County , where it continues northeast as South Fruitland Boulevard through a mix of woods and farms . Shortly after entering Wicomico County , the route diverges from US 13 Bus. at a semi @-@ directional wye junction . US 13 Bus. continues towards Fruitland and downtown Salisbury on South Fruitland Boulevard while US 13 turns northeast and upgrades into the Salisbury Bypass , a four @-@ lane freeway . 
 Bypassing the Salisbury area to the east , the route heads through farmland and meets MD 513 ( St. Lukes Road ) at a diamond interchange . MD 513 provides access from the US 13 bypass into Fruitland . Continuing northeast through a mix of farmland and woodland , with some housing developments nearby , US 13 meets MD 12 ( Snow Hill Road ) at a partial cloverleaf interchange . MD 12 serves as a direct link between Salisbury and Snow Hill , connecting with US 113 in Snow Hill . Turning north near Parker Pond the highway crosses over MD 350 ( Mt . Hermon Road ) with no interchange between the routes , and continues north to another partial interchange with US 50 and US 50 Bus. to the east of Salisbury . 
 The interchange between US 13 , US 50 , and US 50 Bus . , modified from a full cloverleaf with the completion of the Salisbury Bypass west of US 13 to US 50 , is the site of the eastern terminus of US 50 Bus . , US 50 's original route through Salisbury . US 50 joins US 13 at this interchange , and the two routes run concurrent along 3 miles ( 5 km ) of the Salisbury Bypass . Just beyond the interchange , the road passes over MD 346 ( Old Ocean City Road ) with no interchange . The Salisbury Bypass turns to the west and meets the northern terminus of US 13 Bus . ( North Salisbury Boulevard ) at the original northern terminus of the bypass . US 13 separates from US 50 at this interchange and rejoins its original northward route , while US 50 continues west on the Salisbury Bypass to rejoin its original route northwest of Salisbury . 
 US 13 , now known as North Salisbury Boulevard , continues north into a commercial area on a six @-@ lane divided highway , immediately passing by The Centre at Salisbury shopping mall . The road passes numerous businesses before crossing Leonard Pond , as the road narrows to five lanes ( with two lanes southbound and three lanes northbound ) , and becomes Ocean Highway again . It passes by a set of weigh stations located on both sides of the road and intersects the southern terminus of a separate MD 675 , which follows US 13 's original route through Delmar on Bi State Boulevard . US 13 continues north as a four @-@ lane highway ( with two lanes in each direction ) , through a mix of farms and woods with some businesses , skirting Delmar to the east . The route intersects DE / MD 54 ( Maryland Delaware Line Road ) , which runs along the Delaware @-@ Maryland border , and US 13 continues north into Delaware .

 The original north – south highway through Fruitland and Salisbury followed Allen Road north from Allen on Wicomico County 's border with Somerset County to near the present intersection of Division Street and Camden Avenue on the west side of Fruitland . Division Street continued east to pass through the center of Fruitland before heading north to Salisbury , while Camden Avenue bypassed Fruitland to the west and headed directly toward Salisbury . The two roads reunited in downtown Salisbury just south of Main Street . Division Street continued north out of Salisbury toward Delmar . When the Maryland State Roads Commission ( SRC ) designated a state road system in 1909 , the highway between Allen and Salisbury using Camden Avenue was designated a state road . In 1911 , the road between Westover and Princess Anne was completed as a state highway while the portion between Salisbury and south of Delmar was completed as a state @-@ aid road . At this time , the road between Pocomoke City and Salisbury was proposed as a state road . The state road was completed from the southern limit of Salisbury to Main Street in Fruitland in 1912 and from there to Allen in 1913 . In 1914 , the state highway between Princess Anne and Allen was completed . The highway between the Virginia border through Pocomoke City to Westover and between Salisbury and Delmar was completed by 1921 . 
 With the creation of the U.S. Highway System on November 11 , 1926 , US 13 was designated through Maryland from the Virginia border south of Pocomoke City north to the Delaware border in Delmar . The route headed north to Pocomoke City , northwest to Westover , north to Princess Anne , northeast to Fruitland and Salisbury , and north to Delmar . The entire route of US 13 in Maryland became part of the Ocean Highway , an Atlantic coastal highway stretching from Jacksonville , Florida to New Brunswick , New Jersey that served as the quickest route between the New York City area and Florida before the introduction of the Interstate Highway System . US 13 is one of only four U.S. Routes that form the highway and Maryland was one of the states that participated in the highway 's formation . 
 In 1930 , US 13 along Division Street north of downtown Salisbury was placed on an overpass over the New York , Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad . US 13 was relocated between Princess Anne and Fruitland in 1933 to bypass the circuitous route via Loretto Road and Allen Road and to eliminate two railroad crossings , running parallel to the Pennsylvania Railroad on a straight alignment . The former alignment became MD 529 in 1939 . US 13 was relocated between Princess Anne and Westover in 1935 , bypassing what is now known as Old Princess Anne Road . This former alignment became MD 598 in 1939 , and was removed from the state highway system by 1961 . The first portion of the first Salisbury Bypass , now named Salisbury Boulevard , was completed in 1938 between College Avenue and Main Street in Salisbury . The second segment , between the present intersection of US 13 Bus. and Camden Avenue south of Fruitland and College Avenue , was completed in 1939 . Upon completion of the first two sections , US 13 was moved to the bypass and Camden Avenue was designated MD 663 . The third and final section , from Main Street to Zion Road on the north side of Salisbury , was completed by 1942 . After US 13 moved to the new highway , Division Street north of Main Street was designated MD 475 . By 1946 , US 13 was realigned to a straighter alignment to the south of Pocomoke City , with the former alignment along Old Virginia Road becoming MD 250 . In 1949 , US 13 was rerouted to bypass Costen on a straight alignment to the southwest , with the former route through Costen becoming MD 673 . 
 In 1951 , a second bridge over the railroad was completed in north Salisbury and US 13 north of Zion Road was relocated and expanded to a divided highway . US 13 's present divided highway bypass of Delmar was completed in 1954 concurrent with the adjacent section of the route in Delaware bypassing Laurel and Seaford . The former alignment through Delmar was designated as US 13 Alt. between 1954 and 1957 and became MD 675 by 1983 . US 13 from Princess Anne to College Avenue in Salisbury was also dualized between 1954 and 1956 . In 1957 , US 13 was widened into a divided highway between the Virginia border and Pocomoke City . US 13 's bypass of Princess Anne was constructed between 1957 and 1959 . MD 675 was marked on the former alignment through Princess Anne by 1978 . In 1963 , US 13 was rerouted to bypass Pocomoke City to the northeast , with the former alignment through Pocomoke City becoming MD 675 , which was replaced by US 13 Bus. in 1994 . US 13 was expanded to a divided highway from the southern end of the Princess Anne bypass south past Kings Creek in 1962 , south through Westover in 1963 , and south to about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of MD 667 in 1964 . The Princess Anne bypass was expanded to a divided highway in 1965 . US 13 's expansion to a four @-@ lane highway in Maryland was completed in 1966 when the federal highway was expanded to a divided highway from north of MD 667 south past West Pocomoke to the southern end of the Pocomoke City bypass . 
 The next major upgrade to US 13 was the construction of the limited @-@ access Salisbury Bypass beginning from the northern end around 1973 . The Salisbury Bypass was completed south to MD 12 , including the interchange with US 50 , in 1975 . The US 13 portion of the bypass was completed in 1981 ; US 13 Bus. was assigned to the bypassed highway through Fruitland and Salisbury by 1983 . The interchange at the northern end of US 13 's part of the Salisbury Bypass had several ramps added during the extension of the bypass west to US 50 between 2000 and 2002 , which was completed on October 19 , 2002 , six months before it was originally planned to open . The extension of the bypass resulted in US 50 running concurrent with US 13 to the northeast of the city . This concurrent section features separate mile markers for both US 13 and US 50 , with shields on the mile markers to differentiate between the two routes .

 = French battleship Jauréguiberry = 
 Jauréguiberry was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the French Navy ( French : Marine Nationale ) , launched in 1893 . She was one of the class of five roughly similar battleships built in the 1890s , including Masséna , Bouvet , Carnot , and Charles Martel ; Jauréguiberry and the latter two are sometimes erroneously referenced as a single class . She was named after Admiral Bernard Jauréguiberry . 
 Jauréguiberry was in the Mediterranean when World War I began and she spent most of 1914 escorting troop convoys from North Africa and India to France . She supported French troops during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 before she became guardship at Port Said from 1916 for the rest of the war . Upon her return to France in 1919 she became an accommodation hulk until 1932 . She was sold for scrapping in 1934 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Charles Martel group of battleships all shared the same layout for their main and secondary armament — a design that minimised the cramped upper decks produced by the pronounced tumblehome favoured by French designers , and capitalised on the bulging sides of the vessels . The bow and stern turrets had only a single gun and were placed uncomfortably close to the extremities of the ship in Jauréguiberry because she was some 7 metres ( 23 ft ) shorter than the other ships in the group . The single turrets of the secondary armament were mounted on the ship 's beam , while the 138 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns were mounted in four twin turrets sited symmetrically behind and outboard of the main gun turrets .

 Jauréguiberry was 111 @.@ 9 metres ( 367 ft 2 in ) long overall . She had a maximum beam of 23 metres ( 75 ft 6 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 45 metres ( 27 ft 9 in ) . She displaced 11 @,@ 818 tonnes ( 11 @,@ 631 long tons ) at normal load and 12 @,@ 229 tonnes ( 12 @,@ 040 long tons ) at full load . In 1905 her captain described her as an excellent sea @-@ boat and a good fighting ship , although her secondary armament was too light . He also said that she was stable and well laid @-@ out with good living conditions .

Each engine drove a 5 @.@ 7 @-@ metre ( 18 ft 8 in ) propeller . Twenty @-@ four <unk> d 'Allest water @-@ tube boilers provided steam for the engines at a pressure of 15 kg / cm2 ( 1 @,@ 471 kPa ; 213 psi ) . She normally carried 750 tonnes ( 738 long tons ) of coal , but could carry a maximum of 1 @,@ 080 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 063 long tons ) . This gave her a radius of action of 3 @,@ 920 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 260 km ; 4 @,@ 510 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

 Jauréguiberry 's main armament consisted of two 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1887 guns in two single @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . Each turret had an arc of fire of 250 ° . The guns could probably be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 15 ° . They fired 340 @-@ kilogram ( 750 lb ) projectiles at the rate of 1 round per minute at a muzzle velocity of 780 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) which gave a range of 12 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 yd ) at maximum elevation . 
 Her secondary armament consisted of two 274 @-@ millimetre ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1887 guns in two single @-@ gun turrets , one amidships on each side , sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the ship 's sides . Eight 45 @-@ calibre 138 mm Canon de 138 @.@ 6 mm Modèle 1891 guns were mounted in manually operated twin turrets at the corners of the superstructure with 160 ° arcs of fire . The guns could depress to -10 ° and elevate to + 25 ° . They fired 36 @.@ 5 @-@ kilogram ( 80 lb ) armour @-@ piercing shells at a muzzle velocity of 725 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 380 ft / s ) which gave a range of 15 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) at maximum elevation . Their rate of fire was about 4 rounds per minute . 
 Defense against torpedo boats was provided by a variety of light @-@ caliber weapons . Sources disagree on the number and types , possibly indicating changes over the ship 's lifetime . All sources agree on four 50 @-@ calibre 65 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) ( 9 @-@ pounder ) guns . These fired a 4 @.@ 1 @-@ kilogram ( 9 @.@ 0 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 715 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 350 ft / s ) . Gibbons and Gardiner agree on twelve , later eighteen , although d <unk> lists fourteen , 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 40 @-@ calibre Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns that were mounted in the fighting tops and on the superstructure . They fired a 1 @.@ 49 @-@ kilogram ( 3 @.@ 3 lb ) projectile at 610 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute , but only seven rounds per minute sustained . Gibbons and Gardiner agree that eight 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns were mounted on the fore and aft superstructures , although none are listed by d <unk> . They fired a shell weighing about 1 @.@ 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of about 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ( 610 m / s ) at a rate of 30 rounds per minute to a range about 3 @,@ 500 yards ( 3 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 Six 450 @-@ millimetre ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes were initially fitted . Two each were above water in the bow and stern and one was on each broadside underwater . The above @-@ water tubes were removed during a refit in 1906 .

 Jauréguiberry was ordered on 8 April 1891 and laid down that November at Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . She was launched on 27 October 1893 and was complete enough to begin her trials on 30 January 1896 . A tube in one of her boilers burst on 10 June during a 24 @-@ hour engine trial , killing six and wounding three . Two months later she suffered an accident during firing trials of her main armament . She was finally commissioned on 16 February 1897 , although the explosion of a torpedo 's air chamber on 30 March delayed her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet until 17 May . 
 On 20 January 1902 the air chamber of another torpedo exploded , killing one sailor and wounding three . In September she transported the Minister of the Navy to Bizerte . Jauréguiberry was transferred to the Northern Squadron in 1904 and arrived at Brest on 25 March . She was lightly damaged when she touched a rock while entering Brest in fog on 18 July and in another incident her steering compartment was flooded when a torpedo air flask burst between her screws during a torpedo @-@ launching exercise on 18 May 1905 . While visiting Portsmouth on 14 August Jauréguiberry ran aground for a short time in the outer harbour . She returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1907 where she was assigned to the Reserve Division , and the following year was reassigned to the Third Division . In 1909 the 3rd and 4th Divisions were reformed into the 2nd Independent Squadron and transferred to the Atlantic in 1910 . Beginning on 29 September 1910 her boiler tubes were renewed at Cherbourg . In October 1912 the Squadron was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and a year later , in October 1913 , Jauréguiberry was transferred to the Training Division of which she became the flagship in April 1914 . 
 After the start of World War I Jauréguiberry was assigned to escort troop convoys between North Africa and France . She also escorted a convoy of Indian troops in September 1914 . She was stationed at Bizerte from December 1914 to February 1915 when she sailed to Port Said to become flagship of the Syrian Division . Jauréguiberry departed Port Said on 25 March for the Dardanelles to replace the pre @-@ dreadnoughts Suffren and Bouvet and upon her arrival became the flagship of Admiral Guépratte during the subsequent operations . She provided gunfire support to the troops during the initial landings on 25 April and subsequently until 26 May . She was lightly damaged by Turkish artillery on 30 April and 5 May , but continued to fire her guns as needed . 
 Jauréguiberry was recalled to Port Said on 19 July and bombarded Turkish @-@ owned Haifa on 13 August . She resumed her role as flagship of the Syrian Division on 19 August . She participated in the occupation of Ile <unk> on 1 September and other missions off the Syrian coast until she was transferred to Ismailia in January 1916 to assist in the defense of the Suez Canal , although she returned to Port Said shortly afterward . Jauréguiberry was refitted at Malta between 25 November and 26 December 1916 , returning to Port Said . She landed some of her guns to help defend the Canal in 1917 and was reduced to reserve in 1918 . 
 She arrived at Toulon on 6 March 1919 where she was decommissioned and transferred to the Engineer 's Training School on 30 March for use as an accommodation hulk . She was stricken from the Navy List on 20 June 1920 , but remained assigned to the Engineer 's School until 1932 . Jauréguiberry was sold for scrapping on 23 June 1934 for the price of 1 @,@ 147 @,@ 000 F. 
 = Italian cruiser Fiume = 
 Fiume was a Zara @-@ class heavy cruiser of the Italian Regia Marina . She was the second of four ships in the class , and was built between April 1929 and November 1931 . Armed with a main battery of eight 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns , she was nominally within the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty , though in reality she significantly exceeded this figure . 
 Fiume saw extensive service during World War II , having participated in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean . She was present during the Battle of Calabria in July 1940 , Battle of Cape Spartivento in November , and ultimately the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 . In the last engagement , Fiume and her sister ships Zara and Pola were sunk in a close @-@ range night engagement with three British battleships . 
 = = Design = = 
 Fiume was 182 @.@ 8 meters ( 600 ft ) long overall , with a beam of 20 @.@ 62 m ( 67 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 2 m ( 24 ft ) . She displaced 13 @,@ 944 long tons ( 14 @,@ 168 t ) at full load , though her displacement was nominally within the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) restriction set in place by the Washington Naval Treaty . Her power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil @-@ fired Yarrow boilers , which were trunked into two funnels amidships . Her engines were rated at 95 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 71 @,@ 000 kW ) and produced a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . She had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men . 
 She was protected with a armored belt that was 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships . Her armor deck was 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship and reduced to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) at either end . The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick . The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides . 
 She was armed with a main battery of eight 203 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) Mod 29 53 @-@ caliber guns in four gun turrets . The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft . Anti @-@ aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) 47 @-@ cal. guns in twin mounts , four 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) guns in single mounts and eight 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) guns in twin mounts . She carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance ; the hangar was located in under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow . 
 Fiume 's secondary battery was revised several times during her career . Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm and 12 @.@ 7 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 54 @-@ cal. guns and eight 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) guns were installed in their place . Two 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) 15 @-@ cal. starshell guns were added in 1940 .

 Built in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste , Fiume was laid down on 29 April 1929 , the first member of the class to be laid down . She was launched nearly a year later on 27 April 1930 , the same day as her sister ship Zara . Fitting @-@ out work lasted another year and a half , and the new cruiser was commissioned into the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) on 23 November 1931 . In January 1935 , tests with autogyros were conducted aboard Fiume ; a wooden platform was built on the stern of the ship to support the aircraft . The experiments proved to be successful , although the autogyros themselves had very limited range and were unreliable . Fiume took part in a lavish ceremony held for the visit of Adolf Hitler , the dictator of Nazi Germany , in May 1938 . She and Zara conducted a gunnery demonstration while Hitler and the dictator of Italy , Benito Mussolini , observed from the battleship Conte di Cavour . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 When Italy formally joined the Second World War by declaring war on France and Britain on 10 June 1940 , Fiume was assigned to the 1st Division with Zara and the four destroyers of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla . The unit was assigned to the 1st Squadron , under the command of Admiral Inigo Campioni . Two days later , Fiume and the rest of the 1st Division , along with the 9th Division , sortied in response to British attacks on Italian positions in Libya . While they were at sea , the British submarine HMS Odin unsuccessfully attacked Fiume and her sister Gorizia . On 6 July , a convoy left Naples , bound for North Africa ; the following day , Italian reconnaissance reported a British cruiser squadron to have arrived in Malta . The Italian naval high command therefore ordered the 1st Division and several other cruisers and destroyers to join the escort for the convoy . The battleships Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare provide distant support . Two days later , the Italian fleet briefly clashed with the British Mediterranean Fleet in an inconclusive action off Calabria . 
 In late September , the Italian fleet , including Fiume , made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta , but it made no contact with the British ships . Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto on the night of 11 – 12 November , but she was not attacked in the raid . Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento . The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day , in an engagement that lasted for about an hour . Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force , the result of poor aerial reconnaissance . The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203 mm rounds during the engagement , either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola . 
 = = = = Battle of Cape Matapan = = = = 
 The Italian fleet , now commanded by Admiral Angelo Iachino , made another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late March 1941 . The fleet was supported by the Regia Aeronautica and the German Fliegerkorps X ( 10th Air Corps ) . This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan ; early in the battle , Fiume and the rest of the 1st Division were to the northeast of the rest of the Italian fleet , which had encountered the British to the southwest . The battleship Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by British aircraft and forced to withdraw during this phase of the battle . The 1st Division remained on the port side of the Italian fleet as it began its return to port to screen against another possible British attack . A second British airstrike later in the day failed to locate the retiring Vittorio Veneto and instead torpedoed Pola , which left the cruiser immobilized . Fiume , Zara , and four destroyers were detached to protect Pola . The British fleet , centered on the battleships Valiant , Warspite , and Barham , was at this point only 50 nmi ( 93 km ; 58 mi ) away . 
 Guided by radar , the British fleet closed in on the crippled Pola in the darkness while Fiume , Zara , and the destroyers approached from the opposite direction . At 10 : 27 , the searchlights aboard Warspite , the leading British battleship , illuminated Fiume at a range of 2 @,@ 900 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) , followed immediately by a salvo of six 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) shells from her main battery ; five struck Fiume and caused serious damage . Her superfiring rear turret was blown overboard before a second salvo from Warspite struck the ship . Shortly thereafter , Valiant fired four 15 @-@ inch shells into Fiume , causing further devastation . Fiume , now a burning wreck , was spared further destruction as the British battleships turned their attention to Zara . Fiume fell out of line , listing badly to starboard , as Zara was similarly hammered by 15 @-@ inch broadsides . Fiume remained afloat for about 45 minutes before she capsized and sank stern first at 23 : 15 . Two of the destroyers , Alfieri and Carducci , were also sunk , as were Zara and Pola . The action had lasted a mere three minutes . 812 men were lost with Fiume , among them her commanding officer Capt. Giorgio <unk> ; the survivors were picked up by British destroyers on the following morning , Greek destroyers in the evening of 29 March and the Italian hospital ship Gradisca between 31 March and 3 April . 
 = Antonin Scalia = 
 Antonin Gregory Scalia ( / <unk> / ; March 11 , 1936 – February 13 , 2016 ) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1986 until his death in 2016 . Appointed to the Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 , Scalia was described as the intellectual anchor for the originalist and textualist position in the Court 's conservative wing . 
 Scalia was born in Trenton , New Jersey . He attended public grade school , Xavier High School in Manhattan , and then college at Georgetown University in Washington , D.C. He obtained his law degree from Harvard Law School and spent six years in a Cleveland law firm , before he became a law school professor at the University of Virginia . In the early 1970s , he served in the Nixon and Ford administrations , eventually as an Assistant Attorney General . He spent most of the Carter years teaching at the University of Chicago , where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling Federalist Society . In 1982 , Ronald Reagan appointed him as judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit . In 1986 , Reagan appointed him to the Supreme Court . Scalia was unanimously confirmed by the Senate , becoming the first Italian @-@ American justice . 
 Scalia served on the Court for nearly thirty years , during which time he espoused a conservative jurisprudence and ideology , advocating textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation . He was a strong defender of the powers of the executive branch , believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas . He opposed affirmative action and other policies that treated minorities as special groups . He filed separate opinions in many cases and often castigated the Court 's majority in his minority opinions using scathing language . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Antonin Scalia was born on March 11 , 1936 , in Trenton , New Jersey , and was an only child . His father , Salvatore Eugene Scalia ( 1903 – 1986 ) , an Italian immigrant from <unk> , Sicily , was a graduate student at Columbia University and clerk at the time of his son 's birth . The elder Scalia would become a professor of Romance languages at Brooklyn College , where he was an adherent to the formalist New Criticism school of literary theory . His mother , Catherine Louise ( née <unk> ) Scalia ( 1905 – 1985 ) , was born in Trenton to Italian immigrant parents and worked as an elementary school teacher . 
 In 1939 , Scalia and his family moved to the Elmhurst section of Queens , New York , where he attended P.S. 13 . After completing eighth grade in public school , he obtained an academic scholarship to Xavier High School , a Jesuit military school in Manhattan , where he graduated first in the class of 1953 and served as the valedictorian . He later stated that he spent much of his time on schoolwork , and admitted , " I was never cool . " While a youth , he was also active as a Boy Scout and was part of Scouting 's national honor society the Order of the Arrow . 
 Classmate and future New York State official William Stern remembered Scalia in his high school days : 
 This kid was a conservative when he was 17 years old . An <unk> Catholic . He could have been a member of the Curia . He was the top student in the class . He was brilliant , way above everybody else . 
 In 1953 , Scalia enrolled at Georgetown University , where he graduated valedictorian and summa cum laude in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history . While in college , he was a champion collegiate debater in Georgetown 's Philodemic Society and a critically praised thespian . He took his junior year abroad at the University of Fribourg , Switzerland . Scalia studied law at Harvard Law School , where he was a Notes Editor for the Harvard Law Review . He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in 1960 , becoming a Sheldon Fellow of Harvard University . The fellowship allowed him to travel throughout Europe during 1960 – 1961 . 
 = = Early legal career ( 1961 – 1982 ) = = 
 Scalia began his legal career at the international law firm Jones , Day , <unk> and Reavis in Cleveland , Ohio , where he worked from 1961 to 1967 . He was highly regarded at the law firm and would most likely have been made a partner , but later stated he had long intended to teach . He became a Professor of Law at the University of Virginia in 1967 , moving his family to Charlottesville . 
 After four years in Charlottesville , Scalia entered public service in 1971 . President Richard Nixon appointed him as the General Counsel for the Office of Telecommunications Policy , where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television . From 1972 to 1974 , he was the chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States , a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy . In mid @-@ 1974 , Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel . After Nixon 's resignation , the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford , and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22 , 1974 . 
 In the aftermath of Watergate , the Ford administration was engaged in a number of conflicts with Congress . Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees , defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal to turn over documents . Within the administration , Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act , greatly increasing its scope . Scalia 's view prevailed and Ford vetoed the bill , but Congress overrode it . In early 1976 , Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court , Alfred Dunhill of London , Inc. v. Republic of Cuba . Scalia , on behalf of the U.S. government , argued in support of Dunhill , and that position was successful . Following Ford 's defeat by President Jimmy Carter , Scalia worked for several months at the American Enterprise Institute . He then returned to academia , taking up residence at the University of Chicago Law School from 1977 to 1982 , though he spent one year as a visiting professor at Stanford Law School . In 1981 , he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago 's chapter of the newly founded Federalist Society . 
 = = D.C. Circuit Court Judge and nomination to the Supreme Court ( 1982 – 1986 ) = = 
 When Ronald Reagan was elected President in November 1980 , Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration . He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor General of the United States , but the position went to Rex E. Lee , to Scalia 's great disappointment . Scalia was offered a seat on the Chicago @-@ based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 , but declined it , hoping to be appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( D.C. Circuit ) . Later that year , Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit , which Scalia accepted . He was confirmed by the US Senate on August 5 , 1982 , and was sworn in on August 17 , 1982 . 
 On the D.C. Circuit , Scalia built a conservative record , while winning applause in legal circles for powerful , witty legal writing , which was often critical of the Supreme Court precedents he felt bound as a lower @-@ court judge to follow . Scalia 's opinions drew the attention of Reagan administration officials , who , according to The New York Times , " liked virtually everything they saw and ... listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect . " In 1985 , though there was then no vacancy on the Court , Reagan administration officials put Scalia on a short list with fellow D.C. Circuit Judge Robert Bork , to be considered if a justice left the Court . In 1986 , Chief Justice Warren Burger informed the White House of his intent to retire . Reagan first decided to nominate Associate Justice William Rehnquist to become Chief Justice . This choice meant that Reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill Rehnquist 's seat as associate justice . Attorney General Edwin Meese , who advised Reagan on the choice , seriously considered only Bork and Scalia . Feeling that this might well be Reagan 's last opportunity to pick a Supreme Court justice , the President and his advisers chose Scalia over Bork . Many factors influenced this decision . Reagan wanted to appoint the first Italian @-@ American justice . In addition , Scalia was ten years younger , and would likely serve longer on the Court . Scalia also had the advantage of not having Bork 's " paper trail " ; the elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights . Scalia was called to the White House , and accepted Reagan 's nomination . 
 When Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Scalia 's nomination opened in August 1986 , he faced a committee that had just argued <unk> over the Rehnquist nomination . Witnesses and Democratic senators contended that , before becoming a judge , Rehnquist had engaged in activities designed to discourage minorities from voting . Committee members had little taste for a second battle over Scalia and were in any event reluctant to oppose the first Italian @-@ American Supreme Court nominee . The judge was not pressed heavily on controversial issues such as abortion or civil rights . Scalia , who attended the hearing with his wife and nine children seated behind him , found time for a humorous exchange with Democratic Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum , whom he had defeated in a tennis match in , as the nominee put it , " a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment " . 
 Scalia met no opposition from the committee . The full Senate debated Scalia 's nomination only briefly , and confirmed him 98 – 0 on September 17 , 1986 , creating the first Italian @-@ American Justice . This vote followed Rehnquist 's confirmation as Chief Justice by a vote of 65 – 33 on the same day . He took his seat on September 26 , 1986 . One committee member , Democratic Delaware Senator Joe Biden , later stated that he regretted not having opposed Scalia " because he was so effective " . 
 = = Jurisprudence ( 1986 – 2016 ) = = 
 = = = Governmental structure and powers = = = 
 = = = = Separation of powers = = = = 
 It was Scalia 's view that clear lines of separation among the legislative , executive , and judicial branches follow directly from the Constitution , with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch . In his early days on the Court , he authored a powerful — and solitary — dissent in 1988 's Morrison v. Olson , in which the Court 's majority upheld the Independent Counsel law . Scalia 's thirty @-@ page draft dissent surprised Justice Harry Blackmun for its emotional content ; Blackmun felt " it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming " . Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the Executive Branch by the Legislative . He warned , " Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad , so to speak , in sheep 's clothing ... But this wolf comes as a wolf . " 
 The 1989 case of <unk> v. United States challenged the United States Sentencing Commission , an independent body within the judicial branch whose members ( some of whom were federal judges ) were removable only for good cause . The petitioner argued that the arrangement violated separation of powers , and that the United States Sentencing Guidelines promulgated by the Commission were invalid . Eight justices joined in the majority opinion written by Blackmun , upholding the Guidelines as constitutional . Scalia dissented , stating that the issuance of the Guidelines was a lawmaking function that Congress could not delegate , and dubbed the Commission " a sort of junior @-@ varsity Congress " . 
 In 1996 , Congress passed the Line Item Veto Act which allowed the President to cancel items from an appropriations bill ( a bill authorizing spending ) once passed into law . The statute was challenged the following year . The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court , which struck down the law as violating the <unk> Clause of the Constitution , which governs what the President may do with a bill once it has passed both Houses of Congress . Scalia dissented , seeing no <unk> Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers . Scalia indicated that he felt that authorizing the President to cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion , which had long been accepted as constitutional . 
 = = = = Detainee cases = = = = 
 In 2004 , in Rasul v. Bush , the Court held that federal courts had jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions brought by detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp . Scalia accused the majority of " spring [ ing ] a trap on the Executive " by ruling that it could hear cases involving persons at Guantanamo when no federal court had ever ruled that it had the authority to hear cases involving people there . 
 Scalia ( joined by Justice John Paul Stevens ) also dissented in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , involving <unk> Hamdi , an American citizen detained in the United States on the allegation he was an enemy combatant . The Court held that although Congress authorized Hamdi 's detention , Fifth Amendment due process guarantees give a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant [ Hamdi ] the right to contest that detention before a neutral decision maker . Scalia wrote that the AUMF could not be read to suspend habeas corpus and that the Court , faced with legislation by Congress which did not grant the President power to detain Hamdi , was trying to " Make Everything Come Out Right " . 
 In March 2006 , Scalia gave a talk at the University of Fribourg , in Switzerland , where he was asked about detainee rights . He responded , " Give me a break ... I had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son , and I 'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial . I mean it 's crazy . " Though Scalia was not referring to any particular individual , the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , supposed driver to Osama bin Laden , who was challenging the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay . A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan 's position asked Scalia to recuse himself , or step aside from hearing the case , which he declined to do . The Court held , 5 – 3 , in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan 's claims ; Scalia , in dissent , contended that any ability by the Court to consider Hamdan 's petition had been eliminated by the jurisdiction stripping Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 . 
 = = = = Federalism = = = = 
 In federalism cases , pitting the powers of the federal government against those of the states , Scalia often took the states ' positions . In 1997 , the Supreme Court considered the case of Printz v. United States , a challenge to certain provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act which required chief law enforcement officers of localities in states to perform certain duties . In Printz , Scalia wrote the Court 's majority decision . The Supreme Court ruled the provision which imposed those duties unconstitutional as violating the Tenth Amendment , which reserves to the states and to the people those powers not granted to the federal government . In 2005 , Scalia concurred in Gonzales v. Raich , which read the Commerce Clause to hold that Congress could ban the use of marijuana even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes . Scalia opined that the Commerce Clause , together with the Necessary and Proper Clause , permitted the regulation . In addition , Scalia felt that Congress may regulate intrastate activities if doing so is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce . He based this decision on Wickard v. <unk> , which he now writes " expanded the Commerce Clause beyond all reason . " 
 Scalia rejected the existence of the negative Commerce Clause doctrine , calling it " a judicial fraud " . 
 Scalia took a broad view of the Eleventh Amendment , which bars certain lawsuits against states in the federal courts . In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co . , Scalia stated that there was no intent on the part of the Framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity , and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment , Chisholm v. Georgia , came as a surprise to them . Professor Ralph Rossum , who wrote a survey of Scalia 's constitutional views , suggests that the justice 's view of the Eleventh Amendment is actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment . 
 = = = Individual rights = = = 
 = = = = Abortion = = = = 
 Scalia argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion , and that if the people desire legalized abortion , a law should be passed to accomplish it . Scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey , 
 The States may , if they wish , permit abortion on demand , but the Constitution does not require them to do so . The permissibility of abortion , and the limitations upon it , are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy : by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting . 
 Scalia repeatedly called upon his colleagues to strike down Roe v. Wade . Scalia hoped to find five votes to strike down Roe in the 1989 case of Webster v. Reproductive Health Services , but was not successful in doing so . Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor authored the decision of the Court , allowing the abortion regulations at issue in the case to stand , but not overriding Roe . Scalia concurred only in part . Scalia wrote that , " Justice O 'Connor 's assertion , that a ' fundamental rule of judicial restraint ' requires us to avoid reconsidering Roe , cannot be taken seriously . " He noted , " We can now look forward to at least another Term of carts full of mail from the public , and the streets full of demonstrators . " 
 The Court returned to the issue of abortion in the 2000 case of Stenberg v. Carhart , in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial @-@ birth abortion . Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional as it did not allow an exception for the health of the mother . Scalia dissented , comparing the Stenberg case with two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history : " I am optimistic enough to believe that , one day , Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court 's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott . The method of killing a human child ... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion . " 
 In 2007 , the Court upheld a federal statute banning partial @-@ birth abortion in Gonzales v. Carhart . University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone , a former colleague of Scalia 's , criticized Gonzales , stating that religion had influenced the outcome as all five justices in the majority were Catholic , whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish . This angered Scalia to such an extent that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone is there . 
 = = = = Race , gender , and sexual orientation = = = = 
 Scalia generally voted to strike down laws that make distinctions by race , gender , or sexual orientation . In 1989 , he concurred with the Court 's judgment in City of Richmond v. J.A. <unk> Co . , in which the Court applied strict scrutiny to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities , and struck down the program . Scalia did not join the majority opinion , however . He disagreed with O 'Connor 's opinion , for the Court , that states and localities could institute race @-@ based programs , if they identified past discrimination , and if the program was designed to remedy the past racism . Five years later , in <unk> Constructors , Inc. v. Peña he concurred in the Court 's judgment and in part with the opinion which extended strict scrutiny to federal programs . Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences , 
 To pursue the concept of racial entitlement — even for the most admirable and benign of purposes — is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery , race privilege and race hatred . In the eyes of government , we are just one race here . It is American . 
 In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger , involving racial preferences in the University of Michigan 's law school , Scalia mocked the Court majority 's finding that the school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions to promote diversity , and to increase " cross @-@ racial understanding " . Scalia noted , 
 This is not , of course , an " educational benefit " on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript ( Works and Plays Well with Others : B + ) or tested by the bar examiners ( Q : <unk> in 500 words or less your cross @-@ racial understanding ) . For it is a lesson of life rather than law — essentially the same lesson taught to ( or rather learned by , for it cannot be " taught " in the usual sense ) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full @-@ grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School , in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public @-@ school kindergartens . 
 Scalia argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to intermediate scrutiny , requiring that the gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives . When , in 1996 , the Court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter the Virginia Military Institute in the case of United States v. Virginia , Scalia filed a lone , lengthy dissent . Scalia felt that the Court , in requiring Virginia to show an " extremely persuasive justification " for the single @-@ sex admissions policy , had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way " that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny " . 
 In one of the final decisions of the Burger Court , the Court ruled in 1986 in Bowers v. Hardwick that homosexual sodomy was not protected by the right of privacy and could be criminally prosecuted by the states . In 1995 , however , that ruling was effectively gutted by Romer v. Evans , which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment , passed by popular vote , which forbade anti @-@ discrimination laws being extended to sexual orientation . Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy , believing that Bowers had protected the right of the states to pass such measures , and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory , but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law . Scalia later said of Romer , " And the Supreme Court said , ' Yes , it is unconstitutional . ' On the basis of — I don 't know , the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights , presumably . And the liberals loved it , and the conservatives gnashed their teeth . " 
 In 2003 , Bowers was formally overruled by Lawrence v. Texas , from which Scalia dissented . According to Mark V. Tushnet in his survey of the Rehnquist Court , during the oral argument in the case , Scalia seemed so intent on making the state 's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened . According to his biographer , Joan <unk> , Scalia " ridiculed " the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside Bowers when many of the same justices had refused to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey . In March 2009 , openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a " <unk> " . Maureen Dowd described Scalia in a 2003 column as " Archie Bunker in a high @-@ backed chair " . In an op @-@ ed for The New York Times , federal appeals judge Richard Posner and Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall described as radical Scalia 's positions on homosexuality , reflecting an apparent belief that the religious stances supposedly held by the majority of US citizens should take precedence over the Constitution and characterizing Scalia 's " political ideal as <unk> [ ing ] on majoritarian theocracy . " 
 = = = = Criminal law = = = = 
 Scalia believed that the death penalty is constitutional . He dissented in decisions that hold the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups , such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense . In Thompson v. Oklahoma ( 1988 ) , he dissented from the Court 's ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 at the time of the offense , and the following year authored the Court 's opinion in Stanford v. Kentucky sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16 . However , in 2005 , the Court overturned Stanford in Roper v. Simmons and Scalia again dissented , mocking the majority 's claims that a national consensus had emerged against the execution of those who killed while underage , and noted that less than half of the states that permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers . He castigated the majority for including in their count states that had abolished the death penalty entirely , stating that doing so was " rather like including old @-@ order <unk> in a consumer @-@ preference poll on the electric car . Of course they don 't like it , but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue . " In 2002 , in Atkins v. Virginia , the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to the mentally retarded . Scalia dissented , stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute the mildly mentally retarded at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights , and that the Court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against the practice . 
 Scalia strongly disfavored the Court 's ruling in Miranda v. Arizona , which held that a confession by an arrested suspect who had not been advised of his rights was inadmissible in court , and voted to overrule Miranda in the 2000 case of Dickerson v. United States , but was in a minority of two with Justice Clarence Thomas . Calling the Miranda decision a " milestone of judicial overreaching " , Scalia stated that the Court should not fear to correct its mistakes . 
 Although , in many areas , Scalia 's approach was unfavorable to criminal defendants , he took the side of defendants in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment , which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers . In multiple cases , Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed @-@ circuit television . In a 2009 case , Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez @-@ Diaz v. Massachusetts , holding that defendants must have the opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases ; a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was drugs . 
 Scalia maintained that every element of an offense that helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment 's jury guarantee . In the 2000 case of <unk> v. New Jersey , Scalia wrote the Court 's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if he found the offense was a hate crime . Scalia found the procedure impermissible because whether it was a hate crime had not been decided by the jury . In 2004 , he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington , striking down Washington state 's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds . The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines ( which he had failed to strike down in <unk> ) , and they proved correct , as Scalia led a five @-@ member majority in United States v. Booker , which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow ( they remained advisory ) . 
 In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States , Scalia wrote the Court 's opinion in a 5 – 4 decision that cut across ideological lines . That decision found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment . The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted , which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the rest of the house because of indoor growing lights . Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest , Scalia dissented from the Court 's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin , allowing a 48 @-@ hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate , on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment , an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable . In a 1990 First Amendment case , <unk> v. St. Paul , Scalia wrote the Court 's opinion striking down a St. Paul , Minnesota , hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross . Scalia noted , " Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone 's front yard is reprehensible . But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire . " 
 = = = = Litigation and " Standing " = = = = 
 Following the death of Scalia , Paul Barrett writing for Bloomberg News Weekly , reported that : " Translating into liberal argot : Scalia changed the rules for who could sue . " The issue elevated the recognition of Scalia as a notable influence on establishing and determining the conditions under which cases could be brought to trial and for litigation , and by whom such litigation could take place . David Rivkin , from the conservative standpoint , stated that : " He ( Scalia ) did more to clarify and limit the bounds and scope of judicial power than any Supreme Court Justice in history , particularly in the area of standing and class actions . " Scalia indicated his long held position from the time his 1983 law review article titled " The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers " . As summarized by Barrett , " He ( Scalia ) wrote that courts had misappropriated authority from other branches of government by allowing too many people to sue corporations and government agencies , especially in environmental cases . " In a practical sense , Scalia brought to the attention of the Court the ability to restrict " standing " in class action suits in which the litigants may be defined in descriptive terms rather than as well @-@ defined and unambiguous litigants . 
 = = = Other cases = = = 
 Scalia concurred in the 1990 case of Cruzan v. Director , Missouri Department of Health in which the family of a woman in a vegetative state sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die , believing that to have been her wish . The Court found for the State of Missouri , requiring clear and convincing evidence of such a desire . Scalia stated that the Court should have remained away from the dispute , and that the issues " are [ not ] better known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory " . 
 Scalia joined the majority per curiam opinion in the 2000 case of Bush v. Gore , which effectively ended recounts of ballots in Florida following the 2000 US Presidential election , and also both concurred separately and joined Rehnquist 's concurrence . In 2007 , he said of the case , " I and my court owe no apology whatever for Bush v. Gore . We did the right thing . So there ! ... get over it . It 's so old by now . " During an interview on the Charlie Rose show , he defended the Court 's action : 
 The decision was not close , it was 7 – 2 on the principal issue of whether there had been a constitutional violation ... But what if it was unconstitutional to have that recount ? You 're going to let it continue and come to a conclusion ? And then overturn it ? The reason to stop it sooner was not , " Ooh , we 're worried that it 's going to come out the wrong way . " ... you forget what was going on at the time . We were the laughingstock of the world . The world 's greatest democracy that couldn 't conduct an election . We didn 't know who our next president was going to be . The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn 't know who the new president was going to be . It was becoming a very serious problem . The issue before the United States Supreme Court is : having decided the case , having decided this is unconstitutional , should we nonetheless let the election go on ? Or is it time cut it off and let 's move on ? 
 In 2008 , the Court considered a challenge to the gun laws in the District of Columbia . Scalia wrote the majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller , which found an individual right to own a firearm under the Second Amendment . Scalia traced the word " militia " , found in the Second Amendment , as it would have been understood at the time of its ratification , and stated that it then meant " the body of all citizens " . The Court upheld Heller 's claim to own a firearm in the District . 
 Scalia 's opinion for the Heller Court was widely criticized by liberals , and applauded by conservatives . However , Seventh Circuit judge Richard Posner disagreed with Scalia 's opinion , stating that the Second Amendment " creates no right to the private possession of guns " . Posner called Scalia 's opinion " faux originalism " and a " <unk> glaze on personal values and policy preferences " . In October 2008 Scalia stated that the court 's originalists only needed to show that at the time the Second Amendment was ratified , the right to bear arms did not have an exclusively military context , and that they were successful in so showing .

 During oral argument before the Court , Scalia asked more questions and made more comments than any other justice — and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often than any of his colleagues . His goal during oral arguments was to get across his position to the other justices . University of Kansas social psychologist Lawrence Wrightsman wrote of Scalia 's style , " he communicates a sense of urgency on the bench , and his style is forever forceful " . Since Chief Justice John Roberts joined the Court in 2005 , he has taken to questioning counsel in a manner similar to Scalia 's and sometimes the two questioned counsel in seeming coordination . Dahlia Lithwick of Slate described Scalia 's technique : 
 Scalia doesn 't come into oral argument all secretive and <unk> , feigning indecision on the nuances of the case before him . He comes in like a medieval knight , girded for battle . He knows what the law is . He knows what the opinion should say . And he uses the hour allocated for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement . 
 Scalia wrote numerous opinions from the start of his career on the Supreme Court . During his tenure , he wrote more concurring opinions than any other justice , and only two justices have written more dissents . According to Kevin Ring , who compiled a book of Scalia 's dissenting and concurring opinions , " His opinions are ... highly readable . His entertaining writing style can make even the most mundane areas of the law interesting . " Conor Clarke of Slate comments on Scalia 's written opinions , especially his dissents : 
 His writing style is best described as equal parts anger , confidence , and pageantry . Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions — often very funny ones — and he speaks in no uncertain terms . He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon . But most of all , Scalia 's opinions read like they 're about to catch fire for pure outrage . He does not , in short , write like a happy man . 
 At the Supreme Court , justices meet after the case is briefed and argued , and vote on the result . The task of writing the opinion is assigned by the Chief Justice , or if they are in the minority or not participating , by the senior justice in the majority . After the assignment , the justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to each other 's chambers . In the give and take of opinion writing , Scalia did not compromise his views in order to attract five votes for a majority ( unlike the late Justice William J. Brennan , Jr. who would accept less than he wanted in order to gain a partial victory ) . Scalia , known to his friends and colleagues as " Nino " , attempted to influence his colleagues by sending them " <unk> " — short memoranda aimed at trying to get them to include his views in their opinions . 
 In an October 2013 issue of New York magazine , Scalia revealed that he scanned the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Times , got most of his news from talk radio and did not read The New York Times or The Washington Post . The latter he described as " shrilly liberal . " 
 = = = Statutory and constitutional interpretation = = = 
 Scalia was a textualist in statutory interpretation , believing that the ordinary meaning of the statute should govern . In 1998 , Scalia vociferously had opposed the idea of a living constitution , or the power of the judiciary to modify the meaning of constitutional provisions to adapt them to changing times . Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society , " the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one 's own views . " He compared the Constitution with statutes , which he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time . Constitutional amendments , such as the 1868 Fourteenth Amendment , according to Scalia , were to be interpreted based on their meaning at the time of ratification . Scalia was often asked how this approach justified the result in the 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education , which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional , and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result . 
 In interpreting statutes , Scalia did not look to legislative history . In the 2006 case of <unk> v. United States , he joined the majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito — all except one paragraph of the opinion , in which Alito cited legislative history . In a concurring opinion in that case , Scalia noted , " The use of legislative history is illegitimate and ill advised in the interpretation of any statute . " His dislike of legislative history may have been a reason why other justices have become more cautious in its use . Gregory Maggs wrote in the Public Interest Law Review in 1995 that by the early 1990s , legislative history was being cited in only about forty percent of Supreme Court cases involving the interpretation of statutes , and no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome . Maggs suggested , 
 With Justice Scalia breathing down the necks of anyone who peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports , the other members of the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs . It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically . No one likes an unnecessary fight , especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia . 
 Scalia described himself as an originalist , meaning that he interpreted the United States Constitution as it would have been understood when it was adopted . According to Scalia in 2008 , " It 's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution . " In 2006 , before George W. Bush appointees Roberts and Alito had time to make an impact , Rossum , wrote that Scalia had failed to win converts among his conservative colleagues for his use of originalism , whereas Roberts and Alito , as younger men with an originalist approach greatly admired Scalia battling for what he believed in . 
 In a 2009 public conversation , Justice Stephen Breyer questioned Scalia , indicating that those who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to end school segregation . Scalia called this argument " waving the bloody shirt of Brown " , and indicated that he would have joined the first Justice Harlan 's solitary dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson , the 1896 case that Brown overruled . 
 Scalia 's originalist approach came under attack from critics , who viewed it as " a cover for what they see as Scalia 's real intention : to turn back some pivotal court decisions of the 1960s and 70s " , reached by the Warren and Burger Courts . Ralph Nader argued in 2008 that Scalia 's originalist philosophy was inconsistent with the justice 's acceptance of the extension of certain constitutional rights to corporations when at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment 's ratification , corporations were not commonly understood to possess constitutional rights . Nader 's view preceded the Court 's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission . Scalia , in his concurrence in that case , traced his understanding of the rights of groups of individuals at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights . His argument was based on the lack of an exception for groups such as corporations in the free speech guarantee in the Bill of Rights , and on several examples of corporate political speech from the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights . Professor Thomas Colby of The George Washington University National Law Center argued that Scalia 's votes in Establishment Clause cases do not stem from originalist views , but simply from conservative political convictions . Scalia responded to his critics that his originalism " has occasionally led him to decisions he deplores , like his upholding the constitutionality of flag burning " , which according to Scalia was protected by the First Amendment . 
 In 2009 , after nearly a quarter century on the Court , Scalia characterized his victories as " damn few " . 
 Writing in The Jewish Daily Forward in 2009 , J.J. Goldberg described Scalia as " the intellectual anchor of the court 's conservative majority " . He traveled to the nation 's law schools , giving talks on law and democracy . His appearances on college campuses were often standing room only . Ginsburg indicated that Scalia was " very much in tune with the current generation of law students ... Students now put ' Federalist Society ' on their resumes . " John Paul Stevens , who served throughout Scalia 's tenure until his 2010 retirement , said of Scalia 's influence , " He 's made a huge difference . Some of it constructive , some of it unfortunate . " Of the nine sitting justices , Scalia was most often the subject of law review articles .

 Scalia recused himself from Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow ( 2004 ) , a claim brought by atheist Michael Newdow alleging that the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance ( including the words " under God " ) in school classrooms violated the rights of his daughter , who he said was also an atheist . Shortly after the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Newdow 's favor , but before the case came before the Supreme Court , Scalia spoke at a Knights of Columbus event in Fredericksburg , Virginia , stating that the Ninth Circuit decision was an example of how the courts were trying to excise God from public life . The school district requested that the Supreme Court review the case , and Newdow asked that Scalia recuse himself because of this prior statement , which he did without comment . 
 Scalia declined to recuse himself from Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia ( 2005 ) , a case concerning whether Vice President Dick Cheney could keep secret the membership of an advisory task force on energy policy . Scalia was asked to recuse himself because he had gone on a hunting trip with various persons including Cheney , during which he traveled one way on Air Force Two . Scalia issued a lengthy in @-@ chambers opinion refusing to recuse himself , stating that though Cheney was a longtime friend , he was merely being sued in his official capacity , and that were justices to step aside in the cases of officials who are parties because of official capacity , the Supreme Court would cease to function . Scalia indicated that it was far from unusual for justices to socialize with other government officials , recalling that the late Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson played poker with President Harry Truman , and that Justice Byron White went skiing with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy . Scalia stated that he was never alone with Cheney during the trip , the two had not discussed the case , and the justice had saved no money since he had bought round @-@ trip tickets , the cheapest available . Scalia was part of the 7 – 2 majority once the case was heard which generally upheld Cheney 's position . 
 = = = Religious views = = = 
 Scalia was a devout Roman Catholic , and his son Paul entered the priesthood . Uncomfortable with the changes brought about following Vatican II , Scalia drove long distances to parishes that he felt were more in accord with his beliefs , such as the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington and also the Latin version of the Mass of Paul VI at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls , Virginia . In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for New York magazine , Scalia was asked if his beliefs extended to the Devil , and he stated , " Of course ! Yeah , he 's a real person . Hey , c 'mon , that 's standard Catholic doctrine ! Every Catholic believes that " . When asked if he had seen recent evidence of the Devil , Scalia replied , " You know , it is curious . In the Gospels , the Devil is doing all sorts of things . He 's making pigs run off cliffs , he 's possessing people and whatnot ... What he 's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God . He 's much more successful that way " . In another 2013 interview , Scalia stated that " In order for capitalism to work , in order for it to produce a good and stable society , traditional Christian virtues are essential " . 
 In 2006 , Scalia was asked by a reporter upon leaving church , if being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him and responded by asking , " You know what I say to those people ? " , and with a gesture , cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out . The gesture , which was captured by a photographer , was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene . Scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush @-@ off . Roger Axtell , an expert on body language , described the gesture as possibly meaning " I 've had enough , go away " and noted , " It 's a fairly strong gesture " . The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner later that year , with the justice in attendance : cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert 's jokes that evening , Scalia was laughing .

 According to John Boehner , as chairman of the House Republican Conference , he sought to persuade Scalia to run for election as vice president with Bob Dole in 1996 . As related by Boehner , Scalia listened to the proposal and dictated the same reply Justice Charles Evans Hughes had once given to a similar query : " The possibility is too remote to comment upon , given my position . " Dole did put Scalia on his list of potential running mates , but eventually settled on Jack Kemp . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 On September 10 , 1960 , Scalia married Maureen McCarthy at St. Pius X church in Yarmouth , Massachusetts . The two had met on a blind date while he was at Harvard Law School . Maureen was an undergraduate student at Radcliffe College when they met and subsequently obtained a degree in English from the school . 
 The couple raised nine children , five boys and four girls . Two of the sons , Eugene Scalia and John Scalia , are attorneys . Paul Scalia is a Catholic priest , Matthew had a career in the Army , and Christopher is a writer . All four daughters , Catherine , Ann , Margaret and Mary , have families . According to Scalia , Maureen raised all nine children " with very little assistance from me . " 
 He resided in McLean , Virginia , a suburb of Washington , D.C. 
 Scalia enjoyed a warm relationship with fellow Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , considered a member of the court 's liberal wing , with the two attending the opera together , and even appearing together onstage as supernumeraries in Washington National Opera 's 1994 production of Ariadne auf Naxos . Ginsburg was a colleague of Scalia 's on the D.C. Circuit , and the <unk> and <unk> had dinner together every New Year 's Eve . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Scalia died in his sleep on the night of February 12 or the morning of February 13 , 2016 , following an afternoon of quail hunting and dining at the Cibolo Creek Ranch in Shafter , Texas . He was pronounced dead of apparent natural causes . His physician , Rear Admiral Brian P. Monahan , said that Scalia had a history of heart trouble , including high blood pressure , and had recently been deemed too weak to undergo surgery for a torn rotator cuff . 
 For the month following Scalia 's death , his chair in the Supreme Court chamber and the front of the bench where he sat were draped with black wool crêpe , with more over the court 's entrance , a tradition dating from the death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase in 1873 . Flags on the Court 's front plaza were flown at half @-@ staff for 30 days . Scalia 's body lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court of the United States on February 19 , 2016 . His son , Rev. Paul Scalia , delivered the homily at a Catholic funeral Mass the next day at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington , D.C. The interment was private , at Fairfax Memorial Park , Fairfax , Virginia . 
 = = Succession = = 
 Scalia 's death – only the second death of a serving justice in a span of sixty years – left eight justices remaining on the Supreme Court , split 4 – 4 between being fairly conservative and fairly liberal , during a presidential election year . Cases that were not decided before Scalia 's death will be decided by the remaining eight members of the Court . When the Court issues a split 4 – 4 ruling , the ruling of the lower court will be upheld , but the Supreme Court 's decision will have no <unk> effect and the Court will not publish a written opinion with respect to the merits of the case . Citing the Court 's practices following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1954 , Tom Goldstein wrote that the Court is more likely to rehear evenly @-@ divided cases after a new justice is appointed to the Court . 
 In a 2012 interview , Scalia said that he would prefer Judge Frank H. Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals as his successor . President Barack Obama said at the time of Scalia 's death that he would nominate his successor in " due time " . On March 16 , 2016 , he nominated Merrick Garland , Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , to fill Scalia 's seat on the Court . 
 = Australia and the American Civil War = 
 Despite being across the world from the conflict , the Australian colonies were affected by the American Civil War both economically and by immigration . The Australian cotton crop became more important to England , which had lost its American sources , and it served as a supply base for Confederate blockade runners . Immigrants from Europe seeking a better life also found Australia preferable to war @-@ torn North America . 
 The Australian public was shocked by the revelation by a turncoat Russian officer , who claimed that a direct engagement was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised by Britain . The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation for launching attacks . Fear of a possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship . 
 Australia became directly involved when the Confederate navy visited in order to repair one of their warships . This led to protests from the Union representative at Melbourne , while the citizenry of nearby Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew . Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally favored the Union or the Confederacy , as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney when news arrived of Abraham Lincoln 's assassination . 
 = = Economics = = 
 Together , 140 Australians and New Zealanders were veterans of the American Civil War , 100 of whom were native @-@ born . Some of these were originally Americans who came to Australia during the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s . Officers during the war included one who gave Tasmania its first telegraph service , and another officer who mined for gold in Ballarat . 
 Confederate blockade runners occasionally obtained supplies there , despite a historic fear of possible naval attack by Americans , a fear rooted in the actions of American privateers during the War of 1812 . 
 The war also caused the Lancashire Cotton Famine . As a result , Queensland saw a rise in its cotton industry , while the National Colonial Emigration Society in Britain was founded , although it had little ongoing relevance . This came about as a result of so many individuals from northern England being affected by the inability of the Southern United States to ship cotton during the war . Once the war ended , little cotton from Southern Australia was imported to England . However , in the aftermath of the war some Australians were interested in acquiring the Fiji Islands and their cotton fields . 
 Another impact was the competition with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration . The increasing Irish immigration was seen as an economic boon by these antipodean countries . One of the reasons for the increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America . 
 = = Imperial Russian Navy = = 
 During the Civil War , the Union and Russia were allies against what they saw as their potential enemy , Britain . The Russian blue @-@ water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York — with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain . This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy . 
 The flagship of the Russian Pacific squadron , Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov , officially made a friendly visit to Melbourne in early 1863 . According to information passed on to Australian authorities in June 1864 , Rear Admiral A.A. Popov had in the first half of the year 1863 received orders and a plan of attack on the British naval ships positioned near the Australian shore . The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne , Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries . The information was attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr , who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia , and found his way to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising . This information about Popov 's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole , a certain S. <unk> . Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral <unk> , that was sent to New York at the same time . 
 = = CSS Shenandoah = = 
 The CSS Shenandoah arrived in Australian waters on January 17 , 1865 . Off the coast of South Australia at 39 ° 32 ' 14 " S and 122 ° 16 ' 52 " E , her crew spotted an American @-@ made sailing ship named the Nimrod and boarded it . Having ascertained it was an English ship , the Shenandoah left it alone . 
 On January 25 , 1865 the Shenandoah made harbor at Williamstown , Victoria , near Melbourne , in order to repair damage received while capturing Union whaling ships . At seven o 'clock in the evening , Waddell sent a Lieutenant <unk> to gain approval from local authorities to repair their ship , with <unk> returning three hours later saying they were granted permission . The United States consul , William Blanchard , insisted that the Victorian government arrest the Confederates as pirates , but his pleas were ignored by Victoria 's governor , Sir Charles Henry Darling , who was satisfied with the Shenandoah ’ s pleading of neutrality when requesting to be allowed to undertake repairs . Aside from a few fist fights between Americans , there was no direct conflict between the two warring sides . However , there were eighteen desertions while ashore , and there were constant threats of Northern sympathisers joining the crew in order to capture the ship when it was at sea . 
 The local citizenry was very interested in the Confederate ship being in Port Phillip Bay . While at Williamstown , James Iredell Waddell , the captain of the Shenandoah and his men participated in several " official functions " the local citizens arranged in their honour , including a gala ball with the " cream of society " at Craig 's Royal Hotel in Ballarat and at the Melbourne Club . Thousands of tourists came to see the ship every day , requiring special trains to accommodate them . After being treated as " little lions " , the officers of the Shenandoah later reflected that the best time of their lives was given to them by the women of Melbourne . 
 After leaving Australia , the Shenandoah captured twenty @-@ five additional Union whaling ships before finally surrendering at Liverpool , England in November , 1865 . Those surrendering included 42 Australians who had joined the crew at Williamstown ; sources differ as to whether the Australians were stowaways or illegally recruited . Waddell did refuse Australian authorities to see if Australians were aboard the ship prior to sailing from Williamstown on February 18 . Four Australians were arrested to prevent them from joining the Confederate ships , and Governor Darling allowed the Shenandoah to sail away , instead of firing upon it . Waddell 's official report said that on February 18 they " found on board " the 42 men , and made 36 sailors and enlisted six as marines . One of the original Confederate crewmen , midshipman John Thomson Mason , stated that they just happened to find the stowaways , of various nationalities , and enlisted them outside of Australian waters . He further said one of the stowaways was the captain of an English steamer that was at Melbourne at the time ; the Englishman became the captain 's clerk . 
 = = Assassination of Abraham Lincoln = = 
 The news of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on 15 April , 1865 caused demonstrations of sorrow in Sydney . An editorial in Melbourne 's " The Age " newspaper on June 27 , 1865 reported that in Sydney the assassination of Lincoln had caused great indignation . There were many Australian sympathisers that wanted to put an end to slavery , a central issue with Lincoln and his Emancipation Proclamation . A memorial service was held in Sydney 's Prince of Wales Opera House on Sunday afternoon July 9 , 1865 . There were strong feelings of anger at public meetings against the killer of Lincoln , a person so dedicated to his country . They figured he was a genius who rose " from a log cabin to the White House . " 
 A public meeting was held in Sydney to express sympathy for Lincoln 's death and a meeting of American citizens held on June 26 , 1865 had decided to forward a letter of condolence to Mrs. Lincoln , to contribute for a monumental tablet , and wear mourning for a month . There was a letter of sympathy sent to Lincoln 's wife from the mayor of the city of Sydney expressing the city 's condolences . 
 News of Lincoln 's assassination was reported in the Melbourne 's " The Age " on June 24 , 1865 . In the Melbourne newspapers , editorials were prominent . There was mention in the Melbourne Herald for June 26 , 1865 that many of the American houses in town carried their national ensign at half @-@ mast as a mark of respect to the memory of the late President . William Blanchard , the U.S. Consul in Melbourne at the time , on finding out the news of Lincoln 's death , caused the consular flag to be kept at half @-@ mast until July 4 , 1865 . The City Council of Melbourne passed a resolution " expressive of its horror and detestation of the atrocious murder of the late Chief Magistrate . " 
 There were other letters of sympathy from Australia . They came from the Polish and Hungarian Refugees in Melbourne dated July 4 , 1865 ; Citizens of the Swiss Republic Residents in New South Wales ; Sydney Irish National League , NSW Branch , dated July 22 , 1865 ; and from the mayor of Sydney Municipal Council dated July 17 , 1865 . Another letter of sympathy came from the town of Geelong in Victoria , addressed to " Mrs. Lincoln , Washington , America " dated August 22 , 1865 .

 The residents of Melbourne , realising they were vulnerable to attack by others , especially the Russians due to the events during the war , hurried to build coastal defence forts . This included the government of Victoria requesting an ironclad ship to be sent to protect the colony , after the values of ironclads were demonstrated during the American Civil War 's Battle of Hampton Roads . The monitor HMVS Cerberus was constructed during the late 1860s , and duly arrived in Victoria in 1871 . 
 In 1872 the British government paid the United States $ 3 @,@ 875 @,@ 000 as a result of the assistance provided to CSS Shenandoah and other Confederate ships in Victoria and other ports controlled by Great Britain , after an international jury ruled on the case in Geneva , Switzerland .

 When the six colonies of the Australian continent federated to form a self @-@ governing nation in 1901 , Australia favoured the British model of government as they had misgivings about America 's powerful postwar " monarchical " presidency . Australians also opposed the importation of " coloured labour " , in part due to fears of a similar civil war breaking out in Australia . A further precautionary measure was evident in the addition of the word " indissoluble " to the Federal Constitution of 1897 – 1898 in Adelaide , to prevent the " political heresy " of secession as engaged in by the Confederacy . 
 = Fossil Creek = 
 Fossil Creek ( Yavapai : <unk> or <unk> ) is a perennial stream near the community of Strawberry in the U.S. state of Arizona . A tributary of the Verde River , Fossil Creek flows from its headwaters on the Mogollon Rim to meet the larger stream near the former Childs Power Plant . 
 Fossil Springs , near the headwaters , emits upwards of 20 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 76 m3 ) per minute that flow into the creek year @-@ round . Calcium carbonate , precipitating from the 72 ° F ( 22 ° C ) water from the springs , creates travertine dams and deposits for several miles downstream . The Fossil Creek system is the fourth largest producer of travertine in the United States . 
 Fossil Creek is one of only two streams in Arizona included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System . The creek and its riparian corridor provide habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna , some listed as endangered or otherwise imperiled . Its former power @-@ plant complex is listed as a National Historic District . Since restoration of the stream 's natural flow in 2008 , an increase in recreational visits has raised concerns about overuse and has led to road closings and other restrictions . 
 = = Course = = 
 Fossil Creek arises at an elevation of 6 @,@ 510 feet ( 1 @,@ 980 m ) above sea level on the Mogollon Rim in Coconino County north of Strawberry . For about the first 3 miles ( 5 km ) , the creek 's flow is intermittent . 
 From high on the rim , the creek runs generally north , entering Gila County almost immediately . It continues north through the wilderness to the confluence of an intermittent stream in Calf Pen Canyon , which enters from the right . Turning west , the creek receives another intermittent stream from the right in <unk> Canyon , at the head of Fossil Creek Canyon . Before it reaches Fossil Springs , the creek becomes the boundary between Gila County on the stream 's left and Yavapai County on its right , and it remains the boundary all the way to the Verde River . 
 The perennial stretches of the stream begin at Fossil Springs , at river mile ( RM ) 14 or river kilometer ( RK ) 23 , in the Fossil Springs Wilderness of the Coconino National Forest at an elevation of about 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) . Below the springs , the creek flows west and southwest , passing the remnants of a former dam . Unnamed intermittent streams enter from left and right . Before Fossil Creek reaches the former Irving Power Plant , it leaves the Fossil Springs Wilderness , and below the plant , it enters the Mazatzal Wilderness of the Tonto National Forest . Forest Road 708 ( Fossil Creek Road ) follows the creek for 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) along this stretch , crossing the creek once at Fossil Creek Bridge . 
 After Cimarron Creek Wash enters from the right , Fossil Creek turns sharply south . In the next stretch , Stehr Lake is to the right and Deadman Mesa to the left . Hardscrabble Creek enters from the left just before Fossil Creek turns west again and enters the Verde River . 
 = = = Discharge = = = 
 The flow of water from Fossil Springs has been estimated to range from 43 to 56 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 6 m3 / s ) ( 320 – 420 gal / s ) year @-@ round , and it emerges from underground at a constant 72 ° F ( 22 ° C ) . The United States Geological Survey installed a stream gauge at the Fossil Creek Bridge in 2010 . The maximum daily discharge at that station was 885 cubic feet per second ( 25 @.@ 1 m3 / s ) on February 19 , 2011 , and the minimum was 39 cubic feet per second ( 1 @.@ 1 m3 / s ) on August 6 , 2011 . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Fossil Creek Canyon is about 1 @,@ 600 feet ( 490 m ) deep and varies in width from 2 miles ( 3 km ) at Fossil Springs to less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in places further downstream . Rocks in the canyon vary in age from the Precambrian through the Cenozoic . North of the springs the canyon cuts through Paleozoic sedimentary rocks including the Redwall Limestone , <unk> Group , Supai Group , and <unk> Hill Formations ; Coconino Sandstone , and Kaibab Formation . South of the springs , the canyon 's rocks are Tertiary volcanic , mostly dark @-@ gray basalt and yellow @-@ gray tuff . 
 Fossil Springs , the source of about 80 percent of the water in Fossil Creek , issues from several vents in close proximity to one another at the base of the Mogollon Rim . The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau . Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate . When the water emerges at the springs , it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine , a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park . The release , affected by stream turbulence and other factors , does not occur all at once but continues downstream . 
 Nineteenth @-@ century observers of the creek reported seeing many naturally occurring travertine dams with deep pools behind them . A study conducted in 1996 identified the eroded remnants of at least 80 such dams . After the creek 's natural flow was restored in 2008 , hundreds of new travertine dams began to form along a 6 @-@ mile ( 10 km ) stretch below Fossil Springs . About 13 short tons ( 12 t ) of travertine per day are deposited along the stream . This rate of deposition makes Fossil Creek the fourth largest travertine system in the United States ; the three larger systems are Mammoth Hot Springs , Havasu Creek , and Blue Springs of the Little Colorado River . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early = = = 
 Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric use of the Fossil Creek watershed , and it is possible that people lived here as long as 10 @,@ 000 years ago . More recently , Yavapai and Apache peoples have lived in the area , also used by 19th @-@ century cattlemen and shepherds . 
 Fossil Creek first appeared on maps in Arizona in the 1860s , when Arizona Territory 's first governor , John Noble Goodwin , passed through the region . Members of the Goodwin group noted " <unk> " , travertine @-@ encased rocks and twigs that looked like fossils , hence the name Fossil Creek . 
 = = = Hydroelectric plants = = = 
 Few streams in Arizona have a flow as large and steady as Fossil Creek 's . Although remote , the stream was seen in the early 20th century as a good place to produce electricity for the copper mines of Jerome and the gold and silver mines of the Bradshaw Mountains . In 1908 , construction began on a hydropower plant on the Verde River at Childs under the authority of the Arizona Power Company , later part of the Arizona Public Service Company ( APS ) . The project included creating a diversion dam , 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) high , across the creek . About 8 @,@ 800 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) of concrete flumes carried water from the dam to the Childs plant . An artificial reservoir , Stehr Lake , held enough water to keep the plant operating at normal capacity for up to 3 @.@ 5 days when the flume system was closed for maintenance . In 1916 , the company constructed a second plant , the Irving Power Plant , along Fossil Creek . 
 Childs @-@ Irving was the first hydroelectric power plant built in Arizona , and in 1920 it was supplying as much as 70 percent of the power used by Phoenix . The complex was named an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1976 and a National Historic District in 1991 . 
 = = = Stream restoration = = = 
 In 2004 invasive species were removed from the creek to maximize native fish survival . A fish barrier 5 miles ( 8 km ) from the mouth prevents invasive species from swimming further upstream . In 2005 , after assessing costs , the plants ' low output , and the goodwill to be generated from stream restoration , APS closed both power plants , and in 2008 APS removed the diversion dam . 
 In 2009 President Barack Obama signed legislation designating Fossil Creek as a National Wild and Scenic River , after a long campaign by the Arizona Nature Conservancy . The legislation , passed by Congress , protects 16 @.@ 8 miles ( 27 @.@ 0 km ) of stream . The 2 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 3 km ) segment from the confluence of Sand Rock and Calf Pen canyons to where the stream leaves the Fossil Spring Wilderness is " wild " . The 7 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) stretch from there to the Mazatzal Wilderness boundary is " recreational " , and the remaining 6 @.@ 6 miles ( 10 @.@ 6 km ) of the stream is " wild " . Fossil Creek is one of only two streams in Arizona with Wild and Scenic segments ; the other is the Verde River . 
 = = Fauna and flora = = 
 The creek and its riparian zone support about 200 species of birds , mammals , reptiles , and amphibians . The list includes many special @-@ status species such as the southwestern willow flycatcher and Chiricahua leopard frog . The watershed supports 27 species of neotropical migratory birds such as the sage sparrow and 20 species such as the common black hawk that are rated sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service . Mammals found in or near Fossil Creek include otter and beaver , Merriam 's shrew , a variety of bats , and other species . Among the reptiles and amphibians are the Arizona toad , and the reticulated Gila monster . 
 Native fish in Fossil Creek include headwater chub , <unk> chub , speckled dace , longfin dace , Sonora sucker , and desert sucker . Between 2007 and 2010 , the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native <unk> , loach minnows , Gila <unk> , and razorback suckers as well as more longfin dace above the barrier . All except speckled dace are special @-@ status fish listed as endangered , threatened , or sensitive by federal or state agencies . In addition , more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed . One , the fossil springsnail , is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service . 
 Fossil Creek 's riparian zones provide high @-@ quality habitat for plant species native to the area . These include deciduous trees such as the Arizona alder and Fremont cottonwood as well as a wide variety of shrubs , grasses , ferns , and other understory plants . Species diversity is higher above the site of the former power @-@ plant dam , especially near Fossil Springs . In 1987 , a 26 @-@ acre ( 11 ha ) plot above the dam was set aside as the Fossil Springs Botanical Area . Plant inventories taken between 2003 and 2005 identified 166 plant species in the botanical area and 314 species of flowering plants and ferns in the larger Fossil Creek area . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Fossil Creek 's steady flow , warmth , deep pools , and small waterfalls attract visitors who wade , swim , float , kayak , and snorkel in its waters . Four named hiking paths intersect the Fossil Creek corridor : the Flume – Irving , Fossil Springs , Mail , and Deadman Mesa trails . The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping in some parts of the area but has made other parts , such as riparian zones , off @-@ limits to overnight stays . Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing , photography , fishing , and visits to the remains of the Childs @-@ Irving infrastructure . 
 Restoring the stream has made the area , a two @-@ hour drive from Phoenix , highly popular . As recreational use of Fossil Creek increased after 2008 , accumulations of trash and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic . The Forest Service at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 ( Fossil Creek Road ) to limit danger from traffic jams . <unk> are prohibited between the Fossil Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake , and other restrictions apply . Since 2009 , the Forest Service has been working on a comprehensive management plan for Fossil Creek . 
 = Borneo shark = 
 The Borneo shark ( Carcharhinus borneensis ) is a species of requiem shark , and part of the family Carcharhinidae . Extremely rare , it is known only from inshore waters around Mukah in northwestern Borneo , though it may once have been more widely distributed . A small , gray shark reaching 65 cm ( 26 in ) in length , this species is the only member of its genus with a row of enlarged pores above the corners of its mouth . It has a slender body with a long , pointed snout and a low second dorsal fin placed posterior to the anal fin origin . 
 Almost nothing is known about the natural history of the Borneo shark . It is viviparous like other requiem sharks ; the females bear litters of six pups , which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection . The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered , at which time it had not been seen since 1937 . While an extant population has since been found , the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker originally described the Borneo shark as Carcharias ( Prionodon ) borneensis in an 1858 issue of the scientific journal Acta Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Indo @-@ <unk> . He based his account on a newborn male 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) long , caught off Singkawang in western Kalimantan , Borneo . Later authors have recognized this species as belonging to the genus Carcharhinus . Before 2004 , only five specimens of the Borneo shark were known , all of them immature and collected before 1937 . In April and May 2004 , researchers from Universiti Malaysia Sabah discovered a number of additional specimens while surveying the fishery resources of Sabah and Sarawak . 
 The evolutionary relationships of the Borneo shark are uncertain . Jack Garrick , in his 1982 morphological study , did not place it close to any other member of the genus . Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped it with the smalltail shark ( C. porosus ) , blackspot shark ( C. sealei ) , spottail shark ( C. sorrah ) , creek whaler ( C. fitzroyensis ) , whitecheek shark ( C. dussumieri ) , hardnose shark ( C. macloti ) , and Pondicherry shark ( C. hemiodon ) . The Borneo shark resembles the sharpnose sharks ( Rhizoprionodon ) in certain traits , for example the enlarged pores by its mouth . Nevertheless , other aspects of its morphology firmly place it within Carcharhinus . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Borneo shark is slim @-@ bodied , with a long , pointed snout and oblique , slit @-@ like nostrils preceded by narrow , nipple @-@ shaped flaps of skin . The eyes are rather large and circular , and equipped with nictitating membranes . The corners of the sizable mouth bear short , indistinct furrows , and immediately above are a series of enlarged pores that are unique within the genus . There are 25 – 26 upper and 23 – 25 lower tooth rows . The upper teeth have a single , narrow , oblique cusp with strongly serrated edges , and large cusplets on the trailing side . The lower teeth are similar , but tend to be more slender and finely serrated . The five pairs of gill slits are short . 
 The pectoral fins are short , pointed , and falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) , while the pelvic fins are small and triangular with a nearly straight trailing margin . The first dorsal fin is fairly large and triangular , with a blunt apex sloping down to a sinuous trailing margin ; its origin lies over the free rear tips of the pectoral fins . The second dorsal fin is small and low , and originates over the middle of the anal fin base . There is no ridge between the dorsal fins . The caudal peduncle bears a deep , crescent @-@ shaped pit at the origin of the upper caudal fin lobe . The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well @-@ developed lower lobe and a longer , narrow upper lobe with a strong ventral notch near the tip . The dermal denticles are small and overlapping , each with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . This species is slate @-@ gray above , darkening towards the tips of the dorsal fins and upper caudal fin lobe ; some specimens have irregular rows of small , white blotches , which may be an artifact of handling . The underside is white , which extends onto the flanks as a vague pale band . There are faint , lighter edges on the pectoral , pelvic , and anal fin trailing margins . The largest known specimen measures 65 cm ( 26 in ) long . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 All recent specimens of the Borneo shark have been collected solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak , despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo ( including at the locality of the type specimen ) . Thus , its range may now be restricted to shallow , inshore waters in northwestern Borneo . Of the five earlier specimens , four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China , hinting at a wider historical distribution . This species was also recorded from <unk> in the Philippines in 1895 , and Java in 1933 ; these records cannot be substantiated and there have been no subsequent sightings from these areas . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Bony fishes are probably the main food of the Borneo shark . It is viviparous like other requiem sharks , with the developing embryos provisioned by the mother through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac . The litter size is six , and the pups are born at close to 24 – 28 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 – 11 @.@ 0 in ) long . From the available specimens , the length at sexual maturity can be surmised to be under 55 – 58 cm ( 22 – 23 in ) in males and under 61 – 65 cm ( 24 – 26 in ) in females . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed the Borneo shark as Endangered , based on 2005 data that do not include the recent specimens from Mukah . Previously , several fishery surveys within its supposed historical range had failed to find it . The Borneo shark 's conservation status remains precarious given its very small range in waters subjected to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing . It is caught by line gear and used for meat , though it has minimal commercial significance . 
 = Gone Too Soon = 
 " Gone Too Soon " is a ballad recorded and popularized by American musician Michael Jackson . It was written and composed by Larry Grossman and Buz Kohan . Dionne Warwick first performed the song in 1983 as a dedication to Janis Joplin and Karen Carpenter . 
 Jackson 's version of " Gone Too Soon " was dedicated to the memory of Jackson 's friend Ryan White , a teenager from Kokomo , Indiana who came to national attention , after being expelled from his school for having HIV / AIDS . This version was produced by Jackson and co @-@ produced by Bruce Swedien for Jackson 's eighth studio album , Dangerous ( 1991 ) . The song was also mixed by Swedien , and featured instrumentation by artists such as David Paich , Steve Porcaro , Michael Boddicker , Abraham Laboriel and Paulinho Da Costa . 
 The song was released on December 1 , 1993 , as the ninth and final single from the Dangerous album . Following its release — on World AIDS Day of 1993 — " Gone Too Soon " became a moderate chart success in several countries : France , Germany , The Netherlands , New Zealand , Switzerland and the UK . The song was released as a cassette single in the US , and became a hit in Zimbabwe , where it charted at number 3 . " Gone Too Soon " was not a significant critical success , as it received mixed reviews from music critics . 
 " Gone Too Soon " was promoted with a music video directed by Bill DiCicco , which showed footage of Jackson and White together , as well as scenes from the latter 's funeral . A live performance by Jackson at Bill Clinton 's inaugural celebration also served as a promotional platform , for both the song and AIDS @-@ related funding . " Gone Too Soon " later received more exposure , following the deaths of both Diana , Princess of Wales , and Jackson himself .

 Ryan White was an American teenager from Kokomo , Indiana who became a national poster child for HIV / AIDS in the United States after being expelled from school because of his infection . A hemophiliac , he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and , when diagnosed in 1984 , was given six months to live . Though doctors said he posed no risk to other students , AIDS was poorly understood at the time , and when White tried to return to school , many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied against his attendance . A lengthy legal battle with the school system ensued , and media coverage of the struggle made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education . 
 During this time , White was befriended by singer Michael Jackson . White 's mother Jeanne commented on the friendship , " It 's a really good relationship . They have a good time . [ Michael Jackson ] treats [ Ryan White ] like he 's not sick . And Ryan treats Michael like he 's not a celebrity . " The pop star bought the teenager a red Ford Mustang , and invited White and his mother to spend time at his Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County , California . Surprising his doctors , White lived five years longer than initially predicted and died in April 1990 , shortly before he would have completed high school . His funeral was attended by Jackson , as well as English musician Elton John , media personality Phil Donahue , First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush , and 1000 other mourners . 
 " Gone Too Soon " was written and composed by Larry Grossman and Buz Kohan and was originally performed by Dionne Warwick in February 1983 on a TV special as a tribute to many performers , including Janis Joplin and Karen Carpenter who had died days earlier . Later on the same day , Jackson called Kohan explaining he had wept while watching the performance and that he felt he wanted to record it some day . 
 Other projects took precedence for years , but Jackson ended up recording the song for his Dangerous album , in memory of White . The prelude to the song was composed , arranged and conducted by American musician Marty Paich . Bruce Swedien , who had worked extensively on Jackson 's Thriller , was drafted to record and mix the ballad . The music engineer also served as the co @-@ producer for " Gone Too Soon " , with Jackson producing the song . Prior to the production of the finalized version of " Gone Too Soon " , Jackson had recorded a demo version of the song , which featured different vocals and a " perfect sunflower " lyric . To date , the demo has not received an official release , but that lyric was used in the song by Jackson when he sung it at the 1993 Presidential Gala for then President @-@ Elect Bill Clinton .

 " Gone Too Soon " was released on December 1 , 1993 — World AIDS Day — as the ninth and final single from the Dangerous album . It charted in numerous countries outside of the US . In the UK singles chart , " Gone Too Soon " — which featured an instrumental version on its B @-@ side — reached number 33 , becoming Jackson 's ninth Top 40 hit from the one album ( Dangerous ) . He thus equalled his own record , set with Bad and its accompanying singles . Outside of the UK , in the African country of Zimbabwe , " Gone Too Soon " became a hit , charting at number 3 on their singles chart . The song reached number three in The Netherlands , number 32 in France , and number 33 in Switzerland . In Germany , " Gone Too Soon " peaked at number 45 . 
 The Toronto Star 's Peter Howell described the song as a " simply beautiful ode to youthful AIDS victim Ryan White " . The staff of the Kansas City Star alleged that " Gone Too Soon " made syrup seem " tart in comparison " . The Miami Herald noted that Jackson " rediscover [ ed ] " his falsetto voice on the track , while the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel compared his tenor to that featured on a Broadway ballad . Edna Gundersen of USA Today , reviewing the songs on Dangerous , offered the opinion that Jackson 's " heartfelt " delivery redeemed the " fairy @-@ tale cliches " of " Gone Too Soon " . She felt that the song was " shamelessly Disneyesque " . The Worcester Telegram Gazette added to the reviews , stating that " Gone Too Soon " was a " orchestra @-@ drenched ballad full of insipid little boy innocence " . Journalist David Browne , writing for Entertainment Weekly , claimed that the song " recasts the equally melodramatic Off the Wall hit " She 's Out of My Life " ; he noted that Jackson sobs during the finale of both songs .

 " Gone Too Soon " was promoted with a short music video directed by Bill DiCicco . The footage in the music video featured scenes of Jackson and White together , as well as brief coverage from White 's funeral . Home movies , donated by White 's mother Jeanne , were also shown in the short film . At the time of its creation , Jeanne White revealed that the video for " Gone Too Soon " would demonstrate how much Jackson cared for her ill son . The music video was later featured on Jackson 's 1993 VHS Dangerous - The Short Films . An alternate video was released a few months after Michael 's death , and was later released on Michael Jackson 's Vision . 
 The song was further promoted with a live performance of " Gone Too Soon " at President @-@ elect Bill Clinton 's inauguration celebration , An American Reunion : The 52nd Presidential Inaugural Gala . The pop star dedicated his performance to White , and used the occasion to plead with the incoming president for funding toward AIDS @-@ related research : 
 I would like to take a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal . It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us . His name is Ryan White . He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven . He died shortly after turning eighteen , the very time most young people are beginning to explore life 's wonderful possibilities . My friend Ryan was a very bright , very brave , and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease . Over the years , I 've shared many silly , happy , and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him at the end of his brief but eventful journey . Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS , I miss him deeply and constantly . He is gone , but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing . It is my hope , President @-@ elect Clinton , that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend , and ended so many promising lives before their time .

 Off the Deep End is the seventh studio album by " Weird Al " Yankovic , released in 1992 . This album was the first album self @-@ produced by Yankovic , after six albums with Rick Derringer . Recorded between June 1990 and January 1992 , the album was a follow @-@ up to the unsuccessful soundtrack to Yankovic 's 1989 film UHF . Off the Deep End and its lead single " Smells Like Nirvana " helped to revitalize Yankovic 's career after a lull in the late 80s . 
 The musical styles on Off the Deep End are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the late 1980s and early 1990s , including the newly arisen grunge movement . Half of the album is made up of parodies of Nirvana , MC Hammer , New Kids on the Block , Gerardo , and Milli Vanilli . The other half of the album is original material , featuring many " style parodies , " or musical imitations of existing artists . These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like The Beach Boys and Jan and Dean . 
 Off the Deep End was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200 . The album also produced one of Yankovic 's most famous singles , " Smells Like Nirvana , " a parody of Nirvana 's major rock hit " Smells Like Teen Spirit , " which peaked at number thirty @-@ five on the Billboard Hot 100 . This song was Yankovic 's second @-@ highest charting single , after " Eat It , " which was released in 1984 . The cover also parodies the cover of Nirvana 's album , Nevermind . The original had a naked baby in the water with a dollar bill cast by a fishing rod , Yankovic 's replaced the baby with himself , and the dollar bill by a doughnut . Off the Deep End was Yankovic 's fourth Gold record , and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States . In addition , the album was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1993 .

 In 1989 , Yankovic starred in a full @-@ length feature film , co @-@ written by himself and manager Jay Levey , and filmed in Tulsa , Oklahoma called UHF . A satire of the television and film industries , also starring Michael Richards , Fran Drescher , and Victoria Jackson , it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the movie RoboCop . Although the movie made a little over six million domestically – out of a budget of five million – it was considered unsuccessful . 
 Yankovic also released a quasi @-@ soundtrack for the film in late 1989 , entitled UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff , which featured songs ( and commercials ) from the movie as well as new unrelated studio material from Yankovic . The album failed to be successful , charting at only 146 on the Billboard 200 and quickly falling off . After the release of UHF , Yankovic returned to the studio to record his follow @-@ up album .

 On June 6 , 1990 , recording for Off the Deep End officially began at Santa Monica Sound Records , in Santa Monica , California . The first recording session started with " Airline Amy " . These recording sessions marked the first time Yankovic self @-@ produced his songs , after six albums with Rick Derringer . By late 1990 five originals — " Airline Amy , " " Trigger Happy " , " When I Was Your Age " , " You Don 't Love Me Anymore , " and " Waffle King " — were recorded . 
 " You Don 't Love Me Anymore " was one of the last original songs recorded during the 1990 sessions . The song is written as a soft acoustic ballad . However , the lyrics are of a — literally — destructive relationship between Yankovic and an unnamed girl . Although they were formerly in love , the " flames died down " and they are no longer passionate - in fact the girl hates Yankovic to such an extent that she repeatedly attempts to kill him . In 1992 , when the album was finally released , Yankovic desired to release the song as a single . His record label , Scotti Brothers , allowed it under the stipulation that the music video be a parody of another music video . " You Don 't Love Me Anymore " was subsequently released to radio on June 19 , 1992 . While the song was an original composition , the video was a parody of " More Than Words " by Extreme . Yankovic later explained that when the song was released , many people erroneously believed it was a parody of " More Than Words " , and thus , Yankovic crafted the music video to be a parody of " More Than Words . " The single received moderate radio attention , which surprised Yankovic , because he had always thought that radio stations " usually just go for the parodies . " 
 One of the original songs recorded in the 1990 sessions was " Waffle King . " However , when Yankovic resumed recording in 1992 , he recorded a new original called " I Was Only Kidding . " Originally , " Waffle King " was supposed to appear on Off the Deep End . However , by the time the recording of the parodies for this album began , Al had written all the original songs that were to appear on his next album , Alapalooza . Because he was concerned that one of the jokes from the song " I Was Only Kidding " might be dated by the time his next album would finally be released — a line that references the movie Wayne 's World : " I really love you ... not ! " — Yankovic included " I Was Only Kidding " on Off the Deep End in place of " Waffle King " . " Waffle King " was instead used as the b @-@ side of the " Smells Like Nirvana " single and would later resurface on Alapalooza . 
 The album also contains a hidden track at the end called " Bite Me . " The " song " , which consists of several seconds of loud music and Yankovic screaming , appears after 10 minutes of silence following " You Don 't Love Me Anymore " . According to Yankovic , the song was supposed to " come on [ ... ] and scare you to death . " Later pressings of Off the Deep End by Volcano and pressings outside the USA took away the hidden track and silence . The track is a nod to Nirvana ; certain pressings of Nevermind featured a hidden track entitled " Endless , Nameless " .

 After recording the first batch of originals in 1990 , Yankovic focused his attention on parodies . By early 1991 , only three parodies had been recorded . Two of them , the cookie @-@ inspired New Kids on the Block parody " The White Stuff " and the television @-@ centric MC Hammer parody " I Can 't Watch This , " were slated to be released as singles . In fact , several cartons of promo singles were pressed , but they were deleted by the record company at the last second . These CDs were later discovered by Yankovic and his drummer , Jon " Bermuda " Schwartz , and have since become collector 's items . " The Plumbing Song , " a double parody of Milli Vanilli 's hit singles " Baby Don 't Forget My Number " and " Blame It on the Rain " was also recorded . Yankovic later described the parody as " redundant , " a reference to lip @-@ synching scandal that effectively destroyed the band . 
 Yankovic waited for almost two years for the next " big thing " to emerge . " I don 't have any really good reason why it took so long other than the fact that I was waiting for Michael Jackson 's new album to come out , " Yankovic explained . Unfortunately for Yankovic , the new album hit several snags . On November 26 , 1991 , Michael Jackson 's new album , Dangerous was released . After hearing the hit single " Black or White , " Yankovic approached Jackson about a potential parody entitled " Snack All Night . " Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic 's work , he felt that a parody might damage the song 's message . Jackson told Yankovic that he could , if he wanted to , parody another song off his album , but just not " Black or White " . 
 Yankovic soon turned his attention in another direction . Guns N ' Roses had just released a version of Wings 's 70 's hit " Live and Let Die " . Yankovic approached Paul McCartney , leader of Wings , about a parody idea entitled " Chicken Pot Pie . " Although McCartney was a supporter of Yankovic 's work and he wanted to give Yankovic the chance to parody one of his songs , he begrudgingly turned him down due to the fact that , as a vegetarian , he could not condone the eating of animal flesh . Yankovic , a fellow vegetarian , has stated that he respects McCartney 's decision . 
 It was around this time that Nirvana 's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene . As the popularity of 80 's pop gave way to alternative rock , Yankovic decided it was time to record a parody of the Seattle @-@ based band 's huge hit single " Smells Like Teen Spirit " . Yankovic later said , " I wanted to make sure that when I came back after that long hiatus , it was with something strong , and it wasn 't until Nirvana that I felt I had a real contender . " To secure permission for the parody , Yankovic wanted to approve it with Kurt Cobain . After learning that Nirvana was to perform on Saturday Night Live , Yankovic called up his UHF co @-@ star , Victoria Jackson , who was , at the time , a regular cast member on the show . Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request . Cobain agreed , although he asked if the new parody was " going to be a song about food " . Yankovic reassured him that it would actually be about how " no one can understand [ the ] lyrics " to the original , which Cobain thought was funny . After receiving permission , Yankovic wrote and recorded " Smells Like Nirvana " on January 27 , 1992 . 
 After " Smells Like Nirvana , " Yankovic recorded " Taco Grande , " a Mexican food @-@ themed parody of Gerardo 's " Rico Suave . " The latter features a cameo appearance from comedian Cheech Marin . Originally , Yankovic had wanted Marin to rap in Spanish , but it turned out that Marin knew only some basic Spanish . However , a bilingual secretary translated what Yankovic wanted him to say from English to Spanish and Marin read the resulting rap phonetically . One of the last songs to be recorded for the album was the obligatory polka medley , " Polka Your Eyes Out . " Yankovic had already performed the medley at Dr. Demento 's 20th Anniversary Special on Comedy Central before the album had been released .

 The cover for Off the Deep End parodies the famous cover of Nirvana 's album Nevermind , which depicts an infant in the deep end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a hook and line . The Off the Deep End cover shows Yankovic in the baby 's place apparently chasing after a doughnut on a string . While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby , Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit in a way that his body position hid it , as he jokingly explained , " I never really anticipated going full @-@ frontal on any of my album covers . " The CD , liner notes , and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana 's album , borrowing the same blue , wave @-@ light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind .
