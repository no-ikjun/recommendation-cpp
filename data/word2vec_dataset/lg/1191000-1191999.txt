 The Bears preseason schedule was released on April 9 . The team opened the preseason at home against the Miami Dolphins , who had defeated the Bears in their meeting in 2014 , followed by visiting two 2014 playoff teams in the Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati ; the Bears had last faced the two teams in the season openers of 2012 and 2013 , respectively . Chicago ended the preseason hosting annual preseason opponent Cleveland Browns , who the Bears had lost to in the 2014 preseason game .

 The Bears struggled early in the preseason @-@ opening game , starting with the Dolphins scoring on the opening drive with Ryan Tannehill 's two @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jarvis Landry , concluding a 14 @-@ play , 85 @-@ yard drive . On the first offensive play , tackle Jordan Mills was penalized for a false start , and after four plays , the Bears punted ; Chicago would not score until early in the second quarter with Robbie Gould 's 48 @-@ yard field goal . The Dolphins responded to the field goal with Caleb Sturgis ' 31 @-@ yard field goal later in the quarter . With 1 : 02 left in the first half , backup quarterback Jimmy Clausen attempted to lead a two @-@ minute drill , and the offense reached the Dolphins ' 16 @-@ yard line , but with no timeouts and wide receiver Josh Bellamy being unable to get out of bounds , the clock ran out . Early in the second half , cornerback Sherrick McManis pulled the ball away from Mike <unk> , and recovered at the Dolphins ' 37 , which led to Gould 's 23 @-@ yard field goal ; after Miami punted , Gould narrowed the margin by one point with a 21 @-@ yard kick . On the Dolphins ' next play , McLeod Bethel @-@ Thompson was intercepted by linebacker John Timu ; seven plays later , runningback Ka 'Deem Carey scored on a one @-@ yard touchdown run to give the Bears the lead , followed by Clausen 's two @-@ point conversion pass to wide receiver A. J. Cruz . In the fourth quarter , Bethel @-@ Thompson was intercepted by linebacker Sam Acho on the Miami 13 , which led to Gould kicking a 27 @-@ yard field goal ; later in the quarter , the Bears increased their lead with runningback <unk> Perry 's 54 @-@ yard touchdown run , making the score 27 – 10 . After the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Bears punted , the game concluded with Miami 's Josh Freeman being intercepted by defensive back Malcolm Bronson . 
 Against the Colts , the Bears led early with Gould 's 50 @-@ yard and 38 @-@ yard field goals , and both teams traded the lead with each of their next scores in the half : Indianapolis scored on Andrew Luck 's 5 @-@ yard touchdown run and eventual two @-@ point conversion pass to Andre Johnson , which Chicago responded with Gould 's 25 @-@ yarder , though the Colts ended the half with the 11 – 9 lead via Adam Vinatieri 's 25 @-@ yard kick . During the first half , the Bears had a first quarter 12 @-@ yard touchdown scramble by Cutler nullified by lineman Kyle Long 's holding penalty . The game 's lone two interceptions occurred during the second quarter on consecutive drives : Indianapolis quarterback Matt Hasselbeck 's pass for Donte Moncrief was intercepted by Terrance Mitchell , and Clausen 's pass for tight end Dante Rosario was <unk> , being intercepted by Sheldon Prince . The Bears reclaimed the lead on their first possession of the second half with Clausen 's 12 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Bellamy , which was established after Jeremy Langford 's 46 @-@ yard run . On the Colts ' next driver , Hasselbeck was sacked by Acho , leading to defensive tackle Eddie Goldman recovering the ensuing fumble . The margin was increased on the fifth play of the Bears ' next drive , with Langford scoring on a two @-@ yard run . 
 Chicago 's top four receivers , Alshon Jeffery , Eddie Royal , Marquess Wilson and Kevin White , were not active for the game in Cincinnati . During the game , Perry , Clausen , cornerback Tracy Porter , wide receiver John Chiles and linebacker Jon Bostic also suffered injuries . Penalties were a concern for the Bears , who committed 12 for 117 yards ; the offense also struggled on converting third downs , with only two of eleven successful . On defense , the Bears allowed the Bengals to score three unanswered touchdowns : in the first quarter with Andy Dalton 's one @-@ yard run , and in the second with A. J. McCarron 's touchdown pass to Marvin Jones and Jeremy Hill 's one @-@ yard run . It would not be until the final six seconds of the half that the Bears scored , with Gould 's 34 @-@ yard field goal . The first @-@ team offense left the game during the third quarter , with all but one drive having ended in a punt , and on four of those drives , the unit failed to record a first down . Halfway through the final quarter , the Bears were able to make the score 21 – 10 after <unk> <unk> blocked Kevin Huber 's punt and returned it for an eight @-@ yard touchdown . 
 Chicago scored first in the second quarter of the preseason @-@ ending game against Cleveland with David Fales ' 19 @-@ yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marc Mariani , after capitalizing on linebacker Lamarr Houston forcing Darius Jennings to fumble and Mitchell recovered . On the Browns ' next drive , the Bears ' linebacker Jonathan Anderson sacked Thad Lewis , leading to another fumble , this time recovered by defensive lineman Cornelius Washington ; however , Gould missed a 43 @-@ yard field goal . In the third quarter , Fales was able to throw an 11 @-@ yard touchdown pass to <unk> after escaping Tank <unk> 's blitz . Later in the quarter , Sherrod Martin intercepted Lewis and scored on the ensuing 25 @-@ yard return . With 5 : 35 remaining in the game , Gould scored the final points of the game with a 28 @-@ yard field goal , as the Bears recorded the team 's first preseason shutout since 1994 . By the end of the game , the defense excelled , with seven sacks , three turnovers forced and limiting the Browns to 2 @.@ 7 yards per play . The Bears concluded the preseason with a 3 – 1 record , while also not allowing a score in the second half across the four games ; turnover @-@ wise , the Bears forced ten , while allowing only one .

 The regular season schedule was released on April 21 . Aside from the standard six games against NFC North teams , the Bears also played the AFC West and NFC West teams , along with the two last @-@ place finishing NFC East ( Washington ) and NFC South ( Tampa Bay ) teams . The Bears ' opponents had a combined record of 136 – 120 ( .531 ) , making their schedule the 13th @-@ strongest in the league .

 = = = = Week 1 : vs. Green Bay Packers = = = = 
 The Bears opened the season hosting rival Green Bay Packers , the 191st meeting in the two teams ' history and the third season opener in which both teams played each other in Chicago ; the Bears held a 93 – 91 – 6 all @-@ time lead , and also led the series in season opener record with 17 – 12 – 2 . However , the Packers had won nine of the last ten games between the two , including the last game , a 55 – 14 victory at Lambeau Field . WBBM @-@ TV analyst Jeff Joniak believed the Bears would have to run to gain an advantage against the Packers ; when Chicago played Green Bay in week four last season , the latter had the 30th @-@ ranked run defense , and allowed 235 rushing yards in that game . Additionally , the offense had to avoid drives that required long yardage , as the Bears had scored 74 points outside of the red zone ( the 29th @-@ best in the league ) , while also protecting quarterback Jay Cutler from linebackers Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews III . On defense , the new 3 – 4 defense faced a fast @-@ paced Green Bay offense featuring quarterback Aaron Rodgers and tailback Eddie Lacy . The Rodgers @-@ led Packers , who led the NFC North in touchdowns with 58 , along with having the highest average yards per play ( 6 @.@ 17 ) in the NFL in 2014 , also provided a challenge for the Bears defensive backs ; blitzing Rodgers was also a liability , as he had a league @-@ best 130 @.@ 4 rating with 15 touchdowns and one interception against the blitz . However , the Packers did not have receiver Jordy Nelson , who had caught 13 touchdowns in 2014 , as he had suffered an ACL tear during the <unk> <unk> David Fales , cornerback Tracy Porter , runningback Ka 'Deem Carey , linebacker Jon Bostic , center Hroniss Grasu , tackle Tayo Fabuluje and receiver Cameron Meredith were inactive for the game . 
 The Packers won the coin toss , and elected to defer , meaning the Bears started the game with the ball . On the first possession of the game , the Bears offense reached as far as the Packers ' eight @-@ yard line , but ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 28 @-@ yard field goal . After the Packers punted , the Bears came close to allowing a turnover when Cutler was sacked by Peppers and fumbled , though the call was reversed . The next four drives of the game ended in scores for both teams : the Packers scored with Rodgers ' 13 @-@ yard touchdown pass to James Jones , followed by the Bears reclaiming the lead in the second quarter with Matt Forte 's one @-@ yard touchdown run ; the next two possessions concluded with field goals : Mason Crosby tied the game with a 37 @-@ yarder , though the Bears ended the first half with the 13 – 10 lead with Gould 's 50 @-@ yarder . Prior to Forte 's touchdown run , Gould had kicked a 27 @-@ yard field goal , but Sam Shields was offsides on the play , giving the Bears a 4th and 1 , which the Bears capitalized with via Forte 's one @-@ yard run . The Bears then had two potential touchdowns nullified by Forte dropping a pass , and receiver Alshon Jeffery 's touchdown was canceled by tackle Jermon Bushrod 's holding penalty . The Packers also had a potential touchdown hurt by a penalty , as Rodgers had an eight @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jones voided by holding penalties . In the second half , the Packers scored quickly with Jones ' one @-@ yard touchdown catch . The Bears responded with Gould 's 44 @-@ yard field goal , but the Packers eventually scored again via Randall Cobb 's five @-@ yard touchdown catch . On Chicago 's following drive , the offense drove to Green Bay 's six @-@ yard line to set up a first and goal situation . While Forte 's four @-@ yard run brought the Bears to the two , Cutler 's passes to Eddie Royal , Jeffery and Royal again fell incomplete , leading to the Bears turning the ball over on downs . The Packers punted again , but the Bears failed to score when Cutler was intercepted by Matthews ; the turnover set up Lacy 's two @-@ yard touchdown run to increase the score to 31 – 16 with 1 : 55 left in the game . With 34 seconds left , the Bears scored with Cutler 's 24 @-@ yard touchdown pass to tight end Martellus Bennett , narrowing the margin to eight points . However , Green Bay 's Davante Adams recovered the onside kick , and the Packers ran out the clock to end the game . 
 Gould 's first field goal of the game allowed him to set the franchise record for the most field goals with 244 , breaking a tie with Kevin Butler . Forte recorded 184 rushing yards in the game , the most by a Bears running back in a loss since Walter Payton 's 175 yards in a 1984 loss to the Packers . 
 = = = = Week 2 : vs. Arizona Cardinals = = = = 
 Chicago hosted Arizona in week two , the 92nd meeting all @-@ time ; the Bears , who possessed a 58 – 27 – 6 record against the Cardinals entering the game , won the most recent meeting in 2012 28 – 13 , though Arizona won the last game at Soldier Field in 2009 41 – 21 . The Bears faced a 3 – 4 defense for the second consecutive week , and the Cardinals had a blitz @-@ heavy defense . To attack it , Jeff Joniak wrote Matt Forte would have to be utilized . When passing , the Bears had to be wary of left @-@ side cornerback Patrick Peterson ; in 2014 , Arizona 's opponents only threw passes of at least ten yards to that side 29 times , the fifth @-@ lowest in the NFL . As a result , teams attempted to throw ti the right , with 51 deep passes , though only 29 @.@ 4 percent were completed , the sixth @-@ lowest in the league . Defensively , the Bears had to provide pressure to Carson Palmer , who had excelled in the season opener against the Saints with a three @-@ touchdown game , against a line that allowed no sacks in week one , while also focusing on challenging the speed of the Arizona <unk> lineman Ego Ferguson , Ka 'Deem Carey , Hroniss Grasu , Jon Bostic , Tayo Fabuluje were inactive for the game . 
 The Cardinals won the toss and decided to receive . On the opening kickoff , David Johnson returned it 108 yards for a touchdown . After both teams exchanged punts , receiver Josh Bellamy caught a 48 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Cutler , his first career touchdown reception . On the Cardinals ' ensuing drive , the Bears forced fourth down after Palmer 's pass to Johnson went out of bounds , but was reversed after it was determined he had a knee and elbow inbounds . Two plays later , Arizona gained 42 yards on Palmer 's pass to John Brown , added with a defensive pass interference penalty on corner Kyle Fuller , placing the offense at the Bears ' 11 @-@ yard line . After two plays , Palmer threw a six @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jaron Brown . On Chicago 's next drive , runningback Jeremy Langford scored on a one @-@ yard dive . However , the Cardinals scored two touchdowns in 52 seconds : after Larry Fitzgerald 's eight @-@ yard touchdown reception , Tony Jefferson intercepted Cutler , scoring on the 26 @-@ yard return . Cutler tried to dive to tackle Jefferson , but landed on his right shoulder and suffered a hamstring injury ; Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler for the rest of the game . Despite losing Cutler , the Bears were able to score three points with Robbie Gould 's 40 @-@ yard field goal , and got the ball back on the next drive with linebacker Jared Allen intercepting Palmer 's pass intended for J. J. Nelson on the first play ; however , the Bears had to settle for Gould 's 23 @-@ yard field goal . In the third quarter , Clausen 's pass for Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Patrick Peterson , with the Cardinals capitalizing on the turnover with Palmer 's 28 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald . After the Bears punted , Arizona increased the score with Johnson 's 13 @-@ yard touchdown run . Gould eventually kicked a 51 @-@ yard field goal to make the score 42 – 23 , but Fitzgerald caught another touchdown pass , this time of nine yards , to widen the margin by 25 points , though Chandler <unk> 's extra point was wide left . 
 The Bears fell to 0 – 2 for the first time since 2003 , while the 48 points allowed were the most at home in team history . 
 = = = = Week 3 : at Seattle Seahawks = = = = 
 The Bears ' first away game of the season occurred in Seattle , who led the all @-@ time series 10 – 6 , including the last three regular season games . However , the Bears had won the last game in Seattle in 2009 25 – 19 . The Bears offense , not featuring Jay Cutler nor Alshon Jeffery , faced a defense led by Kam Chancellor , who returned to the Seahawks after a holdout . Without Chancellor for the first two games of the season , the defense had allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116 @.@ 4 . Jeff Joniak believed that to counter the Legion of Boom , the Bears had to balance the rushing and passing attacks , while watching for a blitz that pressured Aaron Rodgers 19 times in week two . On defense , the Bears had to watch for quarterback Russell Wilson , though he had struggled with pressure in the first two games , being sacked a total of eight times . Additionally , the run defense had to be aware of a running game led by Marshawn Lynch ; the corps had averaged 121 @.@ 5 yards per game . On special teams , the Bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver Tyler Lockett , who had scored on a punt return earlier in the season . Asides from Cutler and Jeffery , Jon Bostic , defensive tackle Brandon Dunn , Tayo Fabuluje , Hroniss Grasu and linebacker Willie Young were inactive . 
 The Seahawks won the coin toss and kicked off . Before the Bears ' first offensive play , they were penalized for delay of game , and eventually punted . After both teams each traded punts once , Seattle 's Richard Sherman utilized a trick punt return , similar to one the Bears had utilized with Devin Hester and Johnny Knox in the past , to record a 64 @-@ yard return to the Bears ' 19 @-@ yard line . Seattle eventually scored first with Steven Hauschka 's 31 @-@ yard field goal . Five drives ( all of which ended in punts for both teams ) later , the Seahawks ended the first half with Hauschka 's 21 @-@ yarder . Prior to the Seahawks ' last drive , controversy over the Bears ' last punt arose : after Pat O 'Donnell punted , the ball started to bounce out of bounds , but it hit Seahawks linebacker Brock Coyle in the leg , making it available to recover , with defensive back Sherrick McManis taking advantage . However , the officials ruled the punt as downed by McManis , which led to John Fox challenging the call , though it stood . The Bears special teams struggles continued in the second half , when Lockett returned the opening kickoff 105 yards for the touchdown . The Seahawks increased the score with another touchdown later in the third quarter via Jimmy Graham 's 30 @-@ yard touchdown catch from Wilson , followed by <unk> and 48 @-@ yard field goals by Hauschka in the fourth quarter to make the final score 26 – 0 . 
 The Bears were shutout for the first time in 194 games ( a 15 – 0 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in week 17 , 2002 ) , which was then the sixth @-@ longest streak in the league . After three games , the Bears had allowed 105 total points , the most since the 2003 season , when they allowed 111 . Additionally , the Bears punted on all ten drives in the game , the first time since the data was first compiled in 1980 . Despite the hardships , the defense improved , allowing only one touchdown after allowing five against the Cardinals ; additionally , having the game as one of two teams without a sack , the Bears recorded four against Seattle , two each by defensive end Jarvis Jenkins and linebacker Pernell McPhee . 
 = = = = Week 4 : vs. Oakland Raiders = = = = 
 Returning to Soldier Field for week four , the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders , who held a 7 – 6 all @-@ time lead entering the game . This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003 , where the Bears won 24 – 21 , and the first since 2011 , when the Raiders won 25 – 20 in Oakland . The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack , while the secondary is guided by 39 @-@ year old Charles Woodson , who possessed 61 career interceptions , and had sealed the Raiders ' win the previous week against the Browns . However , the Raiders had struggled against tight ends , allowing five catches of at least 25 yards , with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games . On defense , Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr , who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games , along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper , who had 20 receptions entering the game , while also recording a 68 @-@ yard touchdown in week two . Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball ; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch , while <unk> Murray – who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three , was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4 @.@ 8 – ranked fifth in yards after contact . Cooper had 177 yards after the catch , the second @-@ most in the league among wide receivers , while 53 @.@ 7 percent of Carr 's passing yards occurred due to these plays . In comparison , the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact . David Fales , punter Patrick O ’ Donnell , Alshon Jeffery , Ka ’ <unk> Carey , Hroniss Grasu , tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive . 
 The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half . The Bears managed to record an 80 @-@ yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler 's seven @-@ yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal . During the drive , lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery 's leg , injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him . Robbie Gould 's extra point was blocked , and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds . After the game 's four next drives culminated with punts , the Raiders scored on Carr 's 26 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Cooper ; despite initially being ruled out of bounds , the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned . On the Bears ' next series , Slauson botched the snap to Cutler , and the Raiders ' Dan Williams recovered . Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four @-@ yard touchdown reception , though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five @-@ yard touchdown . On Oakland 's next drive , Carr 's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee , intercepting the pass ; Gould eventually kicked a 19 @-@ yard field goal . In the second half , the Raiders punted on the first drive , though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte 's fumble . Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski 's 29 @-@ yard field goal . Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould 's 54 @-@ yard kick , and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered . However , the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler 's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson , leading to Janikowski 's 41 @-@ yard field goal . 
 With 2 : 05 left in the game , Cutler began leading a two @-@ minute drill : after a six @-@ yard run by Forte , followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down , Cutler successfully converted with a seven @-@ yard pass to Bennett , who beat Keenan Lambert . Cutler 's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete , and Forte 's seven @-@ yard run led to another third @-@ down situation , which led to Cutler 's first @-@ down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left . On the next set of downs , Cutler 's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown , though a 12 @-@ yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory , where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining . The offense entered field goal range with Cutler 's nine @-@ yard pass to Wilson , followed by a two @-@ yard run by Forte . With seven seconds left , the Bears used another timeout , and allowed Gould to attempt the 49 @-@ yard field goal ; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22 – 20 lead . In an last @-@ second attempt to score , the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return , but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play , and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win . 
 Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week , his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history . The field goal was Gould 's eleventh career game @-@ winner . Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8 @,@ 071 , becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 500 career rushing and receiving yards , respectively , while becoming the second @-@ fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games . The win would be the only home win for the Bears all season , finishing the year with a horrific 1 – 7 home record . The Bears would finish 3 – 13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined . 
 = = = = Week 5 : at Kansas City Chiefs = = = = 
 For the fifth game of the season , the Bears visited Kansas City , who trailed the Bears 5 – 6 in the all @-@ time series ; the game was the first in Kansas City since 2003 , which the Chiefs won 31 – 3 . Entering the game , the Bears were plagued by injuries , with 16 players listed on the injury report : Jermon Bushrod ( concussion ) was ruled out , safety Antrel Rolle ( ankle ) was doubtful , and 13 others were questionable . Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be cautious of Bob Sutton 's 3 – 4 defense , particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston . However , the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015 . To combat the defense , the Chiefs ' cornerbacks had to be targeted , particularly <unk> Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters , who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns , respectively . Additionally , the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns , the most in the NFL , and in the red zone , was ranked the worst in the league . Also , the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295 @.@ 5 passing yards per game ( ranked 28th in the league ) , while recording only two interceptions . The Bears defense , which had recorded six sacks in the last two games , faced an offensive line that allowed a league @-@ high 19 sacks . Despite the struggles on the OL , Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin , who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game , though Smith had a 49 @.@ 5 completion percentage to receivers , one of the worst in the league . In the rushing attack , the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles , who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven ; however , Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career , including twice in 2015 . On special teams , facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub , the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis ( kickoffs ) and De <unk> Thomas ( punts ) ; Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards , while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards . The Bears ' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt , who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average , while allowing only 51 yards on the return , along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals . Bushrod , Rolle , Alshon Jeffery , Eddie Royal , David Fales , guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive . 
 The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half . After the Bears and Chiefs ' first drives ended with punts , the Bears ' next possession started at their own nine @-@ yard line after an 18 @-@ yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford 's holding penalty . Three plays into the drive , Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone , leading to a fumble that was recovered by <unk> Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown . After getting the ball back , the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould 's 44 @-@ yard field goal . The Chiefs eventually punted again , and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five @-@ yard line ; the drive stalled , and Pat O 'Donnell punted from the endzone . Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles , the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs ' next drive , and once they did on third down , Smith threw a pass to Thomas , who scored on the 19 @-@ yard play . Kansas City increased the margin to 17 – 3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter , with Santos ' 35 @-@ yard field goal ; Cutler kneeled to end the first half . On the Chiefs ' first drive of the second half , the offense reached the Bears ' nine @-@ yard line , but Santos ' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee , allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17 . The first play of the Bears ' drive was a ten @-@ yard run by Forte for a first down , marking the Bears ' first since the opening quarter , and the series concluded with Gould 's 30 @-@ yard field goal . The next four drives of the game ended with punts , while one of the series , held by the Bears , concluded with a turnover on downs . 
 With 7 : 51 left in the game and down 17 – 6 , Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game . The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards , concluding with Cutler throwing a 22 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone . The Bears attempted to go for two , but Cutler 's pass for Mariani was ruled out ; after a challenge , the ruling was upheld . The Chiefs eventually punted again , with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33 . Cutler led the offense on an eight @-@ play , 67 @-@ yard drive , concluding with a seven @-@ yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap . However , the Bears failed the two @-@ point conversion . The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game . Smith reached the Bears ' 48 with a pass to Maclin , and on the next play , threw a nine @-@ yard pass to Maclin . However , Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds . As a result , with two seconds left , the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66 @-@ yard field goal . However , Santos ' kick fell short , giving the Bears the 18 – 17 win . 
 This was Chicago 's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 18 – 17 . Two team records were set during the game . After converting his second field goal of the game , Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1 @,@ 168 points , surpassing Kevin Butler . The win was Cutler 's 46th with the Bears , tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history . 
 = = = = Week 6 : at Detroit Lions = = = = 
 The second NFC North game of the season took place in Detroit , when the Bears played the winless Lions . Although the Bears led the all @-@ time series 96 – 69 – 5 , the Lions had won the last four meetings . The Bears ' offensive players had success against Detroit in the past : in 12 career games against the Lions , Jay Cutler threw for 2 @,@ 669 yards , 17 touchdowns , seven interceptions and an 89 @.@ 9 passer rating , while Matt Forte ( in 14 games ) had 1 @,@ 066 rushing yards , six rushing touchdowns and four touchdown receptions , his most against any opponent . A potential weakness that Forte and the Bears rushing attack could exploit was the Lions ' run defense ; with the departures of defensive linemen Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley , the run defense , which had allowed a league @-@ low 69 @.@ 3 rushing yards per game in 2014 , regressed in 2015 , allowing 126 @.@ 6 yards per game ( ranked 27th in the league ) . The Lions pass defense also suffered during the season : the Lions allowed quarterbacks to complete 78 percent of passes and a league @-@ high combined 128 @.@ 7 passer rating , while also allowing the second @-@ most plays of 20 yards or more , with 25 . To take advantage of this , the Bears saw the returns of Alshon Jeffery , Eddie Royal and Martellus Bennett from injuries . As for the Bears defense , they faced an offense that recorded 4 @.@ 9 yards per play , ranked 29th in the NFL . Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford had also struggled , having an average of 6 @.@ 2 yards per pass , the worst in his six @-@ year career , and had been benched in the Lions ' week five game against Arizona . Detroit running backs also struggled , averaging only 2 @.@ 8 yards per carry . As a whole , the Lions offense led the league in turnovers with 15 . On special teams , the Lions led the league in kickoff returns of at least 20 yards , with running back Ameer Abdullah leading the NFL in the same category with nine . Terrence Mitchell , Antrel Rolle , runningback Antone Smith , linebacker Shea McClellin , tackle Nick Becton , Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Bruce Gaston were inactive . 
 The Bears won the toss and deferred . The Lions ' opening drive concluded with a touchdown when Lance Moore beat Sherrick McManis to score on a 20 @-@ yard touchdown . Chicago retaliated with ten unanswered points via Robbie Gould 's 27 @-@ yard field goal and Jeremy Langford 's one @-@ yard touchdown run , the latter occurring in the second quarter . The Lions reclaimed the lead with Stafford 's eight @-@ yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright , though the Bears managed to score three points with Gould 's 23 @-@ yard kick . Late in the first half , the Lions reached the Bears ' two @-@ yard line , where Stafford threw a pass to Golden Tate ; as he crossed the goal line , he was stripped by Kyle Fuller , with the pass being intercepted by Jonathan Anderson and ruled a touchback . However , referee Walt Coleman ruled the play as a touchdown , stating that Tate " took three steps and broke the plane . " On Chicago 's first drive of the second half , the offense , aided by Cutler 's 46 @-@ yard pass to Marquess Wilson , reached the Detroit five , but Cutler 's pass for Jeffery in the endzone was intercepted by Rashean Mathis . The Bears nearly regained the ball on the Lions ' ensuing possession when Sam Acho stripped Abdullah , but Abdullah managed to recover . Eventually , the Lions punted , and when the Bears also punted on the next possession , T. J. Jones muffed it , and Josh Bellamy recovered . Gould later kicked a 38 @-@ yard field goal . On the Lions ' next series , the Bears defense struggled , allowing Stafford to complete passes of 42 and 16 yards to Tate and Theo Riddick , respectively , followed by a 22 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Tate , though it was nullified by Calvin Johnson 's holding penalty . The Bears were forced to punt again , but Pat O 'Donnell 's punt hit Corey Fuller in the leg and safety Chris Prosinski recovered . In the fourth quarter , the Bears scored on Cutler 's 11 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jeffery , and regained possession quickly when Stafford 's toss to Riddick deflected off of his hand and Anderson intercepted it . The Bears gained the lead with Forte 's two @-@ yard run , followed by Cutler 's two @-@ point conversion pass to Forte . However , the Lions took the lead with their next two scores : Matt Prater 's 32 @-@ yard field goal and Stafford 's six @-@ yard touchdown pass to Johnson . With 21 seconds left in the fourth quarter , the Bears drove 69 yards to the Lions ' 11 , where Gould tied the game with a 29 @-@ yard kick . In overtime , the first four drives ended with punts , and on the fifth , Prater kicked a 27 @-@ yard field goal to claim the 37 – 34 win . 
 The game featured three controversial officiating calls . Regarding the second quarter Tate touchdown , Fox NFL commentator Ronde Barber and Fox rules analyst Mike Pereira believed Tate had not controlled the ball while falling to the turf . On the contrary , NFL Vice President of Officiating Dean <unk> stated that Tate " controlled the pass right at the goal line . This is not a receiver who is going to the ground . He is taking his third step , he had demonstrated possession , had become a runner . " Late in the fourth quarter , Pernell McPhee was penalized for roughing the passer when it appeared that he had been pushed into Stafford . During the Lions ' game @-@ winning drive in overtime , Willie Young was held , but no penalty was called . Due to the NFL 's policies on criticizing officials , Cutler did not comment , while John Fox stated , " We ’ re not allowed to talk about officials . " 
 = = = = Week 7 : Bye week = = = = 
 The Bears entered the bye week with a 2 – 4 record , third in the division . To comply with the NFL 's collective bargaining agreement , which required at least four straight off @-@ days off for players on byes , the Bears only held practices on Tuesday and Wednesday . 
 Entering the bye , the Bears had the seventh @-@ best third down conversion percentage with 43 @.@ 68 , while having 118 first downs converted , one more than that of teams that the Bears had played . 
 On October 22 , Jeremiah Ratliff , who had been suspended for the first three games of the 2015 season , was released . Outside the Bears ' training facility , he and Ryan Pace had " an animated exchange " , forcing security to escort Ratliff out and Lake Forest police to report to the area ; no police intervention occurred . Ratliff had reported to Halas Hall in poor condition , and when he was requested to leave and a relative to pick him up , he was " belligerent and insubordinate " . To replace Ratliff , the Bears signed Jaguar Ziggy Hood later in the day . 
 = = = = Week 8 : vs. Minnesota Vikings = = = = 
 The Bears returned from the bye week by hosting the 4 – 2 Minnesota Vikings . In their rivalry , the Vikings led the all @-@ time series 55 – 51 – 2 , the Vikings winning the last game 13 – 9 , though the Vikings had not beaten the Bears at Soldier Field since 2007 . Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to protect Jay Cutler ; the Vikings defense sacked Matthew Stafford seven times in week seven , with a total of 17 in 2015 . In eleven career games against Minnesota , Cutler excelled , throwing 23 touchdowns and 13 interceptions , with an 8 @-@ 3 record . A player that Joniak believed Cutler could attack is cornerback Xavier Rhodes , who allowed four passing touchdowns and a league @-@ worst ten penalties . Additionally , the running backs could target a defense that allowed six yards per carry , one of the worst in the NFL . On defense , the Bears had to watch for Adrian Peterson , who averaged 88 rushing yards per game , including two consecutive games with at least 120 yards in each . Another player was quarterback Teddy Bridgewater , who completed 25 passes to eleven players in week seven , while watching for the speed of the Minnesota receiving corps . Despite such successes , as a whole , the Vikings offense was averaging 325 @.@ 5 yards per game , the third @-@ least in the league . In the red zone , the Vikings scored touchdowns on 42 @.@ 11 percent of their drives , among the worst in the NFL . Terrance Mitchell , Shea McClellin , Hroniss Grasu , Jermon Bushrod , Bruce Gaston , Ka 'Deem Carey and Cameron Meredith were inactive . 
 The Bears won the coin toss and deferred until the second half . The Bears special teams unit struggled , with returner Marc Mariani <unk> the return on both of the Vikings ' first two punts . Despite this , the Bears took the lead with Robbie Gould 's 55 @-@ yard field goal . However , Minnesota scored on Marcus <unk> 's 65 @-@ yard punt return touchdown , the third return touchdown allowed by the Bears in 2015 . Despite this , <unk> muffed his return on the ensuing punt ; Blair Walsh eventually kicked a 43 @-@ yard field goal in the second quarter to make the score 10 – 3 . After the game 's next three drives ended in punts ( twice by the Bears ) , the first turnover of the game occurred when Kyle Fuller intercepted Bridgewater 's pass for Stefon Diggs . The Bears capitalized on the takeaway with Cutler 's 21 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery , who jumped over Rhodes to make the catch in the left corner of the endzone . In the third quarter , the Bears reclaimed the lead with Gould 's 33 @-@ yard field goal , and after the Vikings punted , had the chance to increase the margin to six points on Gould 's 51 @-@ yard attempt . However , Gould 's kick went wide left , his first miss of the season and ending a 17 @-@ kick streak . Minnesota took advantage by tying the game via Walsh 's 48 @-@ yard field goal . The game 's next two possessions ended with touchdowns for both teams : the Bears scored with Cutler , whose targets ( Jeffery and Mariani ) were unavailable , running four yards and colliding with safety Harrison Smith at the goal line for the touchdown . Afterwards , the Vikings tied the score with Bridgewater throwing a pass to Diggs , who escaped Sherrick McManis to score on the 40 @-@ yard play . With 1 : 49 left in the game , the Bears ' next drive ended with a punt to the Vikings ' 22 @-@ yard line . However , aided by Bridgewater 's 35 @-@ yard pass to Charles Johnson , Walsh kicked a 36 @-@ yard field goal as time expired to seal the win . 
 On Cutler 's touchdown pass to Jeffery , he tied Sid Luckman for the most touchdown passes in Bears history with 137 . Defensively , Pernell McPhee recorded his fifth sack during the game , and he became the first Bears player since Brian Urlacher in 2000 to have at least five sacks and one interception in the first seven games . During the second half , Matt Forte suffered a knee injury , and along with Eddie Royal , were missed the following week 's game . The loss of Forte had been crucial for the Bears , as he had been responsible for 32 percent of yards gained in 2015 , the most among running backs . 
 = = = = Week 9 : at San Diego Chargers = = = = 
 On Monday Night Football , the Bears traveled west to face the 2 – 6 San Diego Chargers . The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field , the Bears winning 31 – 20 , though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007 , which the Chargers won 14 – 3 , and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20 – 7 victory in 1984 ; in eleven games , the Bears led the series 6 – 5 . Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL . Additionally , offenses often started drives at 32 @-@ yard line , ranked 31st in the league , while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven . The Chargers were also allowing 6 @.@ 34 yards per play , the second @-@ worst in the NFL . To attack , the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver / cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford , who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out . Defensively , the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries , particularly at the line : of the five positions , four have seen two or more players starting . However , quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries , having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7 @.@ 9 yards per pass , both of which were among the highest in the NFL ; Rivers ' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning 's single @-@ season passing yards record . The Chargers had the top @-@ ranked offense in the NFL , and also ranked first in yardage after the catch . Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates , who led the league in career touchdowns with 101 . However , the San Diego running game was struggling , with 3 @.@ 6 rushing yards per play , which ranked 30th in the league . Special teams @-@ wise , both teams were among the worst in the NFL : the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed , while the Bears were 31st ; the former also allowed a league @-@ high ten returns of 30 – 39 yards . For the Chargers ' punt return unit , they had only one yard in 2015 . San Diego also had league @-@ worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19 @.@ 3 yards , drives starting within their own 20 @-@ yard line ( 11 ) and average starting area ( 21 ) . Forte , receiver Eddie Royal , safety Harold Jones @-@ Quartey , Shea McClellin , Hroniss Grasu , Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive . 
 The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off . Despite reaching the Chargers ' 28 @-@ yard line , two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler 's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould 's field goal sailing wide left . Afterwards , the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead 's 14 @-@ yard touchdown catch from Rivers . On the Bears ' next possession , the offense entered Charger territory again , reaching as far as the 10 @-@ yard line , where Cutler was sack @-@ stripped by Melvin Ingram , with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle , though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted . After the Bears punted as well , they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered . However , after two plays , Verrett intercepted Cutler 's pass for Jeffery , returning it 68 yards for the touchdown ; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point , making the score 13 – 0 . On the next drive , Cutler threw a one @-@ yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett . After both teams exchanged punts , the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo 's 31 @-@ yard field goal . In the second half , after the Chargers punted , Gould 's 34 @-@ yard field goal attempt hit the left upright . San Diego punted again , and the Bears engineered a 93 @-@ yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one @-@ yard run . The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22 @-@ yard field goal . Guiding an 80 @-@ yard drive , Cutler threw a 25 @-@ yard pass to tight end Zach Miller , who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go @-@ ahead touchdown . Afterwards , Langford scored on the two @-@ point conversion . The Chargers ' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston 's two sacks , and on 4th down and 23 , Rivers ' deep pass fell incomplete . With 1 : 09 left in the game , Cutler kneeled three times to end the game . 
 With Cutler 's touchdown to Bennett , he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138 . Additionally , his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown , the most in the league . Miller 's touchdown catch was his first since the 2011 season . 
 = = = = Week 10 : at St. Louis Rams = = = = 
 Week 10 's game was on the road in St. Louis , where the Bears played the 4 – 4 Rams . Historically , the two teams have played each other often , with the Rams joining the Cardinals as the most common opponent outside of the NFC North ; the Bears held the series lead 52 – 36 – 3 , though the Rams won the last game in 2013 42 – 21 . Chicago 's offense faced a defense with a stingy pass rush that featured 14 players with at least .5 sacks and eight with at least two . The rush had the second @-@ most sacks in the league with 27 , while Robert Quinn , despite missing the previous week 's game with a knee injury , led the Rams with five . The Rams blitzed often , with six sacks on first down and five on second and third , with the combined 16 sacks on blitzes being the most in the league . The St. Louis secondary starred <unk> Jenkins and <unk> Johnson , who broke up a combined 18 passes and allowed only two touchdowns in 2015 . As a unit , the Rams defense allowed no touchdowns in the last ten quarters , while also having the second @-@ best scoring defense in the NFL with 13 @.@ 8 points per game , while also being one of three teams to force at least 70 negative plays . Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to excel on third down ; the Bears ' 30th @-@ ranked third down offense took on a defense that was ranked fifth in the category . For the Bears defense , rookie running back Todd Gurley was a target ; in his first four games , he averaged 141 rushing yards on 22 attempts , and by week ten , had the fourth @-@ most rushing yards in the league and a league @-@ high 5 @.@ 6 yards per carry . Additionally , the defense had to pressure quarterback Nick Foles : in the red zone , he completed only 47 percent of his passes with two interceptions ; on third down situations , he completed only 46 percent with four interceptions ; when blitzed , he completed 54 percent with five sacks , though he also has five touchdowns . Like the Bears , the Rams ' third @-@ down offense struggled , being ranked last in third down conversions with 23 @.@ 8 percent . Special teams @-@ wise , the punt unit had to stop Tavon Austin , who scored one of the NFL 's eight punt return touchdowns in 2015 . To get to Austin , punter Pat O 'Donnell 's hang time of 4 @.@ 56 seconds ( third @-@ best in the NFL ) could allow the unit 's gunners to reach him . In contrast , the Rams kick return team was struggling , being ranked 30th with nine starts after kickoffs within their own 20 @-@ yard line , while also ranking 23rd in kick return yards with 22 @.@ 4 . Rams kicker / punter duo of Greg Zuerlein and Johnny Hekker are among the best in the NFL : Hekker had a gross punt average of 48 yards , one of seven punters to do so , while also being ranked fourth in net average with 43 @.@ 3 ; Zuerlein had kicked a 61 @-@ yard field goal against the Vikings in week nine , but was missing a league @-@ high seven field goals , including two that were blocked . Eddie Royal , Matt Forte , return man Deonte Thompson , Harold Jones @-@ Quartey , Hroniss Grasu , Ziggy Hood and Pernell McPhee were inactive . 
 The Bears won the coin toss and elected to kick off . The Rams scored on the opening possession with Gurley 's six @-@ yard touchdown run , but the Bears tied the score on a two @-@ play drive ; after Jeremy Langford was stopped for a one @-@ yard loss , Jay Cutler threw a short pass to Zach Miller , who managed to break free and score on the 87 @-@ yard play . The next drive for the Rams saw the offense go three @-@ and @-@ out , but on the punt return , Marc Mariani was quickly hit by Bradley Marquez and fumbled , with the ball being recovered by St. Louis ' Maurice Alexander . On the first play since the turnover , Austin scored on a 17 @-@ yard reverse , but the touchdown was nullified by Greg Robinson 's holding penalty ; the Rams eventually had to settle for Zuerlein 's 26 @-@ yard field goal . After the Bears punted , they regained possession on the first play of the Rams ' next drive , when Shea McClellin stripped Tre Mason and recovered the ball . Robbie Gould eventually kicked a 35 @-@ yard field goal to tie the score at the end of the first quarter . The Rams punted on their next drive , and the Bears took the lead with Cutler throwing a two @-@ yard touchdown pass to Miller . St. Louis later punted again , and Chicago 's next series started at their own 14 @-@ yard line due to cornerback Alan Ball 's holding penalty on the punt return . After Langford 's three @-@ yard run , Cutler held off a blitzing defense to throw a screen pass to Langford , who scored on the 83 @-@ yard play . The two teams exchanged punts for the remainder of the half ; the first three drives of the second half also ended in punts . Afterwards , the two teams traded field goals , Zuerlein 's being 38 yards and Gould 's being 33 yards . On St. Louis ' next drive , the team elected to try a fake punt , but Hekker 's pass to Cody Davis fell short . The Bears increased the lead to 17 points with Gould 's 36 @-@ yard field goal , and after the Rams ' turned the ball over on downs again , scored on Langford 's six @-@ yard touchdown run . The next two drives ended with turnovers for both teams : Willie Young intercepted Foles , but runningback Ka 'Deem Carey fumbled after being hit by Rodney McLeod , with the fumble being recovered by Aaron Donald . With 2 : 23 left in the game , the Rams reached the Bears ' 28 @-@ yard line before time expired . 
 Miller 's first touchdown was the longest catch by a tight end since Byron Chamberlain 's 88 @-@ yard play in 1999 and the longest touchdown reception by a Bear since Matt Forte 's 89 @-@ yard score in 2010 . With the score and Langford 's 83 @-@ yard touchdown , the Bears became the first team since the 2006 Buffalo Bills to score multiple touchdowns of at least 80 yards in a game . 
 = = = = Week 11 : vs. Denver Broncos = = = = 
 John Fox , joined by coordinators Adam Gase and Jeff Rodgers and quarterback Jay Cutler , faced their former team in the Denver Broncos for week eleven . It would also be the coldest game the Bears would play in 2015 . In 14 games , the two teams split the series , though the Broncos won the most recent game in 2011 13 – 10 . In the last game at Soldier Field , the Bears won 37 – 34 . The offense took on one of the league 's top defenses , Denver 's pass rush leading the NFL in sacks with 32 , with twelve players with at least .5 sacks . The Broncos defense was allowing the fewest average yards with 277 @.@ 3 , while also allowing the third @-@ least points per game with 18 @.@ 7 . Despite DeMarcus Ware being out with a back injury , the Broncos still had Von Miller , who had more than five sacks in 2015 . For the Bears , despite Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal 's injuries , Martellus Bennett and Zach Miller could still play a role . If passing , Cutler had to watch for defensive lineman Malik Jackson , who had four pass breakups in the previous four games . When the Bears decide to run , they faced a run defense that led the league in multiple categories , including sack percentage . The Broncos offense was without Peyton Manning , and in his place was Brock Osweiler . Osweiler , who had 305 career passing yards , had only played in garbage time during his NFL career , but fits Gary Kubiak 's West Coast offense . Jeff Joniak believed with Osweiler , the Broncos ' plays , which consisted of 64 percent passes , would decrease , though tight ends Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis could be targeted more often . Meanwhile , Denver 's rushing attack was struggling during the season , with an average of 86 rushing yards per game , 29th @-@ ranked in the NFL . 
 The Broncos won the coin toss and deferred until the second half . After the Bears punted , Osweiler threw a pass to Demaryius Thomas , who escaped Chris Prosinski to score on the 48 @-@ yard play . After both teams exchanged punts , the Bears scored their first points of the game in the second quarter with Robbie Gould 's 46 @-@ yard field goal , and narrowed the margin to one point when Gould scored on a 37 @-@ yard kick . Denver and Chicago traded punts again , but the former scored with Brandon McManus ' 24 @-@ yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter to make the score 10 – 6 . The first three drives of the second half ended with punts , though the first turnover of the game occurred on the next series , when Cutler 's pass for receiver Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Danny <unk> . However , the Broncos failed to capitalize when Ronnie Hillman was tripped by Osweiler 's feet on fourth down . Afterwards , aided by two consecutive 29 @-@ yard plays ( via Brandon Marshall 's defensive pass interference , followed by Wilson 's 29 @-@ yard catch ) , the Bears reached the Broncos ' 19 @-@ yard line , where Gould eventually kicked a 37 @-@ yard field goal . The Broncos later increased their lead by eight when Osweiler threw a ten @-@ yard touchdown pass to Cody Latimer . On the Bears ' next series , Cutler capitalized on a late hit by T. J. Ward and a 40 @-@ yard pass to Wilson to reach the Broncos ' seven @-@ yard line . Despite reaching as far as the four , the Bears turned the ball over on downs with three consecutive incomplete passes . Although Denver punted again and the Chicago offense reaching the Broncos ' 33 @-@ yard line , Cutler was hit from behind by Marshall while throwing , and the ball was intercepted by Malik Jackson . The Broncos were forced to punt again , and with 1 : 25 left in the game , the Bears drove 65 yards , where Jeremy Langford scored on a two @-@ yard run . However , Langford was stopped short on the two @-@ point conversion , and on the onside kick , Thomas recovered . Osweiler kneeled once to end the game . 
 The Bears ended the game with no penalties for the first time since 1995 against the Philadelphia Eagles and becoming the 24th team to do so in the last 15 years ; the Bears also became the first team to accomplish the feat in a loss since the 2013 Packers ' loss to the Bears in week nine . The defense recorded five sacks , the team 's most in 2015 .

 Thanksgiving Day game 
 The second game of 2015 against the Packers was held on Thanksgiving Day in Green Bay . The two teams , in their 190th meeting , had never played each other on the holiday ; in Thanksgiving games , the Bears were 16 – 15 – 2 , while the Packers were 14 – 19 – 2 . Chicago 's offense took on a defense that ranked second in the league in first quarter points allowed with 1 @.@ 9 , along with a defense that recorded six sacks in week eleven against Minnesota . Jeff Joniak added that the offense had to improve its red zone performance ; against Denver , the Bears failed to score on three of the four trips to the red zone , leading to a 41 @.@ 2 percent touchdown efficiency in 2015 ; in ten games , the Bears were only able to score 14 touchdowns within the 20 @-@ yard line . On the other side , Joniak stated the defense had to stop the Packers offense early ; since 2014 , the Packers had outscored opponents 151 – 27 at Lambeau , while also leading the league in first quarter points with an average of 7 @.@ 6 . Aaron Rodgers had thrown eight first quarter touchdown passes ( the most in the NFL ) in 2015 , while the Packers had a league @-@ best + 57 scoring differential . Meanwhile , the Bears defense had allowed nine touchdowns in the first , though the defense had not given up a touchdown in the third quarter .

Eddie Royal , Ka 'Deem Carey , Martellus Bennett , Antrel Rolle , cornerback Jacoby Glenn , Nick Becton and Will Sutton were inactive . 
 The Bears won the toss and deferred . The first four drives of the game ended without scores , as the Packers turned the ball over on downs during their first drive and the ensuing series were punts . On the next drive , Tracy Porter intercepted Rodgers , but was penalized for illegal contact , and the play was nullified . Afterwards , Rodgers threw a 25 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Lacy . The Bears ' woes continued with the following kickoff , when Marc Mariani and Deonte Thompson collided while attempting to catch the kick and the latter had to kneel in the endzone for the touchback . The next four possessions led to punts ; on Green Bay 's next drive , Lacy recorded a 15 @-@ yard run , but was hit from behind by Chris Prosinski and fumbled , with the ball being recovered by Lamarr Houston . Chicago took advantage of the takeaway when Jay Cutler threw a three @-@ yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller . However , on the next kickoff , <unk> Bryce Callahan missed a tackle and allowed Jeff Janis to record a 64 @-@ yard return ; the Packers eventually converted it into a 22 @-@ yard field goal . Assisted by a 37 @-@ yard kickoff return by Thompson , the Bears offense scored with Cutler 's 20 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson , but the play was overturned after he was downed at the one . Afterwards , Jeremy Langford 's one @-@ yard run gave the Bears the 14 – 10 lead . Mason Crosby kicked a 50 @-@ yard field goal to end the half . The third quarter featured no scores , though the Bears ' last drive of the quarter ( which lasted into the final quarter ) ended with Robbie Gould 's 21 @-@ yard field goal to extend the lead by four points . After two further punts , Rodgers ' slant pass for Davante Adams was intercepted by Porter . However , the Bears were unable to capitalize , and punted . With 2 : 23 left in the game , the Packers drove from their own 20 @-@ yard line to the Bears ' eight . Rodgers ' passes to James Jones , Richard Rodgers and Adams all fell incomplete , and Cutler kneeled once to seal the win . 
 With the win , the Bears won their third consecutive away game for the first time since 2012 . Over the last four games , the Bears allowed less than 20 points in each , also last accomplished in 2012 .

The Bears offense took on a defense featuring linebackers <unk> Bowman , Aaron Lynch and Ahmad Brooks , who had a combined 12 @.@ 5 sacks in 2015 , including 6 @.@ 5 by Lynch . Alshon Jeffery provided a size advantage over cornerbacks <unk> Brock and Kenneth Acker , the duo having a combined 90 tackles , six interceptions , and 14 pass breakups .

Despite these troubles , the 49ers had held the Cardinals , who had the league 's best scoring offense , to just 19 points in week twelve . As for the Bears defense , the 29th @-@ ranked rushing defense took on a running attack without Carlos Hyde . 49ers quarterback Blaine Gabbert had been improving , throwing for 318 yards against Arizona , while his top receiver Anquan Boldin had recorded 44 catches for 558 yards , 28 of which resulted in first downs .

 The fourteenth week of the season featured a game between 5 – 7 teams as the Washington Redskins visited Soldier Field . In 48 games , the Redskins led the series 24 – 23 – 1 and had won the last five meetings . The Chicago offense took on a Washington defense that excelled against passers , being ranked tenth in the category ; <unk> Goldson led all defensive backs in tackles with 95 , while <unk> <unk> led the team in passes defended with 13 . The Redskins defensive rush , which had 20 sacks in 2015 , was led by Ryan Kerrigan , who has 6 @.@ 5 . Despite such performances , the Redskins rush defense was ranked 29th in yards per carry with 4 @.@ 64 and 25th in average rushing yards at 124 @.@ 2 . Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears could exploit this with the three @-@ man rushing attack of Matt Forte , Jeremy Langford , and Ka 'Deem Carey . On defense , the Bears faced a Kirk Cousins @-@ led offense that focuses on quick passes ; Cousins completed a league @-@ high 68 @.@ 6 percent of his passes , with 7 @.@ 1 yards per pass . One of Cousins ' main targets was tight end Jordan Reed , who scored six touchdowns and led the Redskins in yards after the catch . Rankings @-@ wise , the pass attack was ranked 17th in the league in passing yards per game and 16th for yards per play . Joniak states that the Bears had to force turnovers , and an area was on third down , as five of Cousins ' interceptions had been on third down . 
 The Bears won the coin toss and elected to defer . Washington recorded a 15 @-@ play , 80 @-@ yard drive en route to scoring on Alfred Morris ' one @-@ yard touchdown run . After the Bears punted , the Redskins scored again with Cousins ' fake read option leading to a three @-@ yard touchdown run in the second quarter . Chicago 's woes continued when the offense began the next drive on their own seven @-@ yard line , and despite reaching the Washington 49 , Jay Cutler was strip @-@ sacked by Trent Murphy , who recovered the fumble .

 The second game of the Bears @-@ Vikings rivalry took place in Minneapolis and was the third game at TCF Bank Stadium ; the Bears won the first game in 2010 while the Vikings won in 2014 . To succeed against the Vikings , Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears had to excel at the start of the game ; offensively , the Bears had a first quarter scoring differential of <unk> , 31st in the league , while scoring only twice on game @-@ opening possessions . In the third quarter , the Bears scored a league @-@ worst 32 points ; in comparison , the Vikings defense had allowed only one touchdown on opening drives and a league @-@ low 37 points in the third quarter . The defense took on a Vikings offense spearheaded by Adrian Peterson , whose 1 @,@ 251 yards led the league . On special teams , the Vikings led the league in post @-@ kickoff starting position , while being ranked third in returns of at least 20 yards with 26 and first in returns of at least 40 yards with five . Additionally , kickoff returner Cordarrelle Patterson led the league in return average with 31 @.@ 1 yards . Christian Jones , Cameron Meredith , Bryce Callahan , Nick Becton , Tayo Fabuluje , Jacoby Glenn and Antone Smith were inactive . 
 The Vikings won the toss and deferred . Despite a 49 @-@ yard kick return by Deonte Thompson , the Bears ' struggles began quickly , with the drive stalling after a holding penalty on Hroniss Grasu and a sack . Afterwards , the Vikings scored on their first drive when Stefon Diggs beat Tracy Porter to score on a 15 @-@ yard touchdown . The Vikings increased the score with Blair Walsh 's 53 @-@ yard field goal in the second quarter . After the next two drives ended with punts , Alshon Jeffery caught a ten @-@ yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to draw the Bears within three points .

Jeff Joniak writes that the offense , taking on a defense guided by former Bears head coach Lovie Smith , had to " be patient " , a philosophy that teams had used during Smith 's tenure in Chicago ; Smith 's defenses force offenses to work with long series , followed by forcing a turnover . In 2015 , the Bucs defense recorded 22 fumbles , 11 interceptions and 33 sacks , 7 @.@ 5 of which are by defensive tackle Gerald McCoy . Another player that the Bucs defense featured was linebacker <unk> David , who recorded 12 pass breakups , three interceptions , two sacks and a forced fumble in 2015 . Tampa 's defense also excelled in the run and passing games ; in the former , the Bucs allowed the second @-@ fewest average yards per carry with 3 @.@ 3 , while being ranked fifth in yards allowed after the catch . The Bucs also ranked eighth in yards per play . However , opposing quarterbacks were completing a league @-@ high 69 @.@ 2 percent of passes , while also throwing for a total of 28 touchdowns . The Bucs defense was also without linebacker Kwon Alexander , who ranked second in the team in tackles with 93 , as he was suspended for drug use . On defense , the Bears took on rookie Jameis Winston , who recorded 3 @,@ 422 passing yards and 20 touchdown passes in 2015 . However , the Bucs receiving corps had 29 drops and a 7 @.@ 9 drop percentage , the second @-@ highest in the NFL . Chicago 's run defense faced Doug Martin , who had averaged 5 @.@ 1 yards per carry , 1 @,@ 305 rushing yards and a league @-@ best 2 @.@ 4 yards per carry after contact . Alshon Jeffery , Bryce Callahan , Jacoby Glenn , Shea McClellin , Nick Becton , Tayo Fabuluje and Bruce Gaston were inactive . 
 The Bucs won the coin toss and deferred . The Bears opened the game with a hurry @-@ up offense and gained a first down , but were eventually forced to punt . Tampa Bay also later punted , but regained the ball at the Bears ' four @-@ yard line after a blocked punt ; Jeremiah George escaped <unk> Reynolds to block Pat O 'Donnell 's punt and Howard Jones recovered . The Bucs converted the play into a four @-@ yard touchdown run by Martin . Both teams later punted on their next drives , Jay Cutler 's screen pass was deflected and intercepted by William Gholston , who returned the pick to the Bears ' 15 @-@ yard line , but <unk> Smith 's facemask penalty nullified the play . Afterwards , Ka 'Deem Carey scored on a one @-@ yard touchdown run to tie the score . On Tampa 's next drive , Martin was stripped by Harold Jones @-@ Quartey , and the fumble was recovered by John Timu ; the takeaway led to Robbie Gould 's 26 @-@ yard field goal . The Bucs were later forced to punt again with two minutes left in the first half , and the Bears offense drove 40 yards to the nine , where Gould kicked a 27 @-@ yard field goal with eight seconds left . Winston kneeled to end the half . On the first drive of the second half , the Bucs scored when Winston threw a 50 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Charles Sims , who took advantage of Tracy Porter to score . Although the Bears punted on their next drive , they regained possession after Christian Jones and Lamarr Houston 's blitz forced Winston to throw to Charles Sims , where Jones @-@ Quartey pulled the ball <unk> Bears eventually punted , but got the ball back when Pernell McPhee stripped Martin , with the fumble being recovered by Timu . On the first play of the fourth quarter , Cutler 's play @-@ action pass to Carey resulted in a one @-@ yard touchdown . The Bucs punted on their next series , and Gould kicked a 50 @-@ yard field goal to increase the score to 23 – 14 ; Connor Barth later missed a 52 @-@ yard field goal wide left , leading to Gould 's 39 @-@ yard field goal . With one second left in the game , Winston threw a 43 @-@ yard touchdown pas to Austin <unk> @-@ Jenkins , and on the ensuing onside kick , Cameron Meredith recovered as time expired . 
 With the win , the Bears officially improved upon their 5 – 11 record from 2014 . The three turnovers forced in the game was a best for the defense , while also tying the total in the last five games .

In comparison , the Bears had the fewest negative plays in the league . Despite the frequency to blitz , the Lions only had eight sacks when doing so . Through the air , the Lions pass defense struggled , allowing a 30th @-@ ranked passer rating of 101 @.@ 7 and 30 touchdown passes while recording only interceptions . To excel , the Bears had to maintain the ball , as they were ranked sixth in the NFL in time of possession . On defense , the Bears took on a Lions offense that had improved under offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter after Joe Lombardi 's firing , going from 18 @.@ 6 points per game to 26 @.@ 4 under Cooter . With Matthew Stafford , the Lions were one of eleven teams with over 4 @,@ 000 yards , while also being ranked in the top ten with 30 touchdown passes .

On the first drive of the game , the Lions scored first when Harold Jones @-@ Quartey slipped while covering and Stafford threw a nine @-@ yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright . The Bears offense reached the Lions ' five @-@ yard line on their first possession , but Jay Cutler 's pass to Cameron Meredith deflected off Nevin Lawson 's helmet and was intercepted by James <unk> . However , two consecutive sacks forced the Lions to punt . In the second quarter , after the Bears punted , Matt Prater attempted a 54 @-@ yard field goal , but missed wide right . The Bears eventually punted again , and the Lions reached the Bears ' 35 @-@ yard line , but on 4th and 3 , Stafford 's pass for Calvin Johnson fell incomplete . Three plays later , the Lions regained possession of the ball when Ansah hit Cutler 's arm as he threw to Marc Mariani , the pass being intercepted by Tahir Whitehead . Detroit converted the turnover into Prater 's 59 @-@ yard field goal to end the first half . The Bears scored on their first drive of the second half with Robbie Gould 's 49 @-@ yard field goal , and after Detroit punted , tied the score with Cutler 's 34 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy .

 In comparison to their 2014 counterpart , the 2015 Bears were more competitive in games ; in 2014 , three of the worst losses were by 48 , 28 and 21 points , while six of the 2015 team 's losses were by less than a touchdown , two of which ended in overtime . The Bears ended the season 5 – 3 in away games , but won only once at home , the worst home record in team history .

 Guido Karl Anton List , better known as Guido von List ( October 5 , 1848 – May 17 , 1919 ) , was an Austrian occultist , journalist , playwright , and novelist . He expounded a modern Pagan new religious movement known as Wotanism , which he claimed was the revival of the religion of the ancient German race , and which included an inner set of Ariosophical teachings that he termed Armanism . 
 Born to a wealthy middle @-@ class family in Vienna , List claimed that he abandoned his family 's Roman Catholic faith in childhood , instead devoting himself to the pre @-@ Christian god Wotan . Spending much time in the Austrian countryside , he engaged in rowing , hiking , and sketching the landscape . From 1877 he began a career as a journalist , primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines . In these he placed a völkisch emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people , believing that many of them were survivals of pre @-@ Christian , pagan religion . He published three novels , Carnuntum ( 1888 ) , Jung <unk> Heimkehr ( 1894 ) , and <unk> ( 1895 ) , each set among the German tribes of the Iron Age , as well as authoring several plays . During the 1890s he continued writing völkisch articles , now largely for the nationalist Ostdeutsche Rundschau newspaper , with his works taking on an anti @-@ semitic dimension half @-@ way through that decade . In 1893 , he co @-@ founded the <unk> <unk> literary society , and involved himself in Austria 's Pan @-@ German nationalist movement , a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the German Empire . 
 During an 11 @-@ month period of blindness in 1902 , List became increasingly interested in occultism , in particular coming under the influence of the Theosophical Society , resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate <unk> and the Armanen <unk> . The popularity of his work among the völkisch and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908 ; attracting significant middle and upper @-@ class support , the Society published List 's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group , the High Armanen Order , over whom List presided as Grand Master . Through these ventures he promoted the millenarian view that modern society was degenerate , but that it would be cleansed through an apocalyptic event resulting in the establishment of a new Pan @-@ German Empire that would embrace Wotanism . Having erroneously prophesied that this empire would be established by victory for the Central Powers in World War I , List died on a visit to Berlin in 1919 . 
 During his lifetime , List became a well known figure among the nationalist and völkisch subcultures of Austria and Germany , influencing the work of many others operating in this milieu . His work , propagated through the List Society , influenced later völkisch groups such as the Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden , and through those exerted an influence on both the burgeoning Nazi Party and the SS . After World War II his work continued to influence an array of Ariosophic and Heathen practitioners in Europe , Australia , and North America .

 = = = Early life : 1848 – 77 = = = 
 Guido Karl Anton List was born on 5 October 1848 in Vienna , then part of the Austrian Empire . Born to a prosperous middle @-@ class family , he was the eldest son of Karl Anton List , a leather goods dealer who was the son of Karl List , a publican and vintner . Guido 's mother , Marian List , was the daughter of builder 's merchant Franz Anton Killian . List was raised in the city 's second <unk> , on the eastern side of the Danube canal . Like most Austrians at the time , his family were members of the Roman Catholic denomination of Christianity , with List being christened into this faith at St Peter 's Church in Vienna . Reflecting the family 's wealth and bourgeoisie status , in 1851 a watercolour portrait of List was painted by the artist Anton von <unk> . 
 Accounts suggest that List had a happy childhood . Developing a preference for rural areas rather than urban ones , he enjoyed family visits to the countryside of Lower Austria and Moravia , and – encouraged by his father – he began to sketch and paint the castles , prehistoric monuments , and natural scenery of these areas . According to his later account , he developed an early interest in the pre @-@ Christian religions of Austria , coming to believe that the catacombs beneath St. Stephen 's Cathedral in Vienna had once been a shrine devoted to a pagan deity . He claimed that on an 1862 visit to the catacombs with his father , he knelt before a ruined altar and swore that when an adult he would construct a temple to the ancient god Wotan . 
 Although List wanted to become an artist and scholar , he reluctantly agreed to his father 's insistence that he enter the family 's leather goods business . During his leisure time he devoted himself to writing and sketching as well as rambling , riding , or rowing in the countryside , becoming both a member of the Viennese rowing club <unk> and the secretary of the Austrian Alpine Association ( Österreichischer <unk> ) . He was involved in both solitary and group expeditions into the Austrian Alps , and it was on one of the latter journeys that he left his mountaineering group to spend Midsummer night alone atop the <unk> hillfort . On 24 June 1875 he and four friends rowed down the Danube before camping for the night at the site of the ancient Roman fortification of Carnuntum to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the Battle of Carnuntum , in which Germanic tribes defeated the Roman Army . List later claimed that while his friends <unk> , he celebrated the event with a fire and by burying eight bottles of wine in the shape of a swastika beneath the arch of the monument 's Pagan Gate . 
 = = = Early literary endeavours : 1877 – 1902 = = = 
 In 1877 , List 's father died . List soon abandoned the leather goods business that he inherited , intent on devoting himself to literary endeavours as a journalist , even if this meant a significant reduction in his income . On 26 September 1878 he married his first wife , Helene Förster @-@ Peters . From 1877 to 1887 he wrote for the nationalist magazines Neue Welt ( " New World " ) , Heimat ( " Homeland " ) , Deutsche Zeitung ( " German Newspaper " ) , and the Neue Deutsche <unk> ( " New German Alpine Newspaper " ) , with his articles being devoted to the Austrian countryside and the folk customs of its inhabitants . His interpretations emphasised what he believed were the pagan origins of Austrian place @-@ names , customs , and legends , describing the landscape as being embodied by genius loci , and expressing clear German nationalist and völkisch sentiment . 
 In 1888 , he published his first novel , Carnuntum , in two volumes . Set in the late fourth century CE , the narrative focused on a romance set against the background of the conflict between Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire around the area of the eponymous Roman fort . The novel established List as a recognised figure within Austria 's Pan @-@ German community , a movement of individuals unified in their belief that the majority German @-@ speaking areas of the multi @-@ linguistic and multi @-@ ethnic Austro @-@ Hungarian state should cede and join with the newly established German Empire . The book also brought him to the attention of Friedrich Wannieck , a wealthy industrialist who was the chairman of both the Prague Iron Company and the First Brno Engineering Company . Wannieck was also president of the Verein ' Deutsches Haus ' ( " ' German House ' Association " ) , a nationalist organisation of linguistically German inhabitants of Brno who felt encircled by the largely Czech population of South Moravia . List and Wannieck began corresponding , resulting in a lifelong friendship between the two men . The Verein ' Deutsches Haus ' subsequently published three of List 's works in its series on German nationalist studies of history and literature . 
 List began regularly writing for a weekly newspaper , the Ostdeutsche Rundschau ( " East German Review " ) , which had been established in 1890 by the Austrian Pan @-@ German parliamentary deputy Karl Wolf . In 1891 , List anthologised many of the magazine articles that he had written over the previous decades in his book Deutsch @-@ <unk> <unk> ( " German Mythological Landscape Scenes " ) , extracts of which were then published in the Ostdeutsche Rundschau . Further völkisch articles on various topics pertaining to Austria 's folk culture and to its ancient Germanic tribes followed during the 1890s , although mid @-@ way through that decade his work took on an explicitly anti @-@ semitic nature with articles such as " Die Juden als Staat und Nation " . Other Austrian German nationalist newspapers which published his articles during this period included the Bote aus dem <unk> ( " The <unk> Herald " ) and <unk> . 
 List began lecturing on these subjects ; for instance , in February 1893 he spoke to the nationalist Verein ' Deutsches Geschichte ' ( " ' German History ' Association ) on the ancient priesthood of Wotan . He also worked as a playwright , and in December 1894 his play Der Wala <unk> ( " The Wala 's Awakening " ) was premiered at an event organised by the Bund der Germanen ( Germanic League ) which was devoted to the German nationalist cause , with Jews being explicitly banned from attending the event . Alongside his affiliation with the Bund , List was also a member of the Deutscher <unk> ( Germanic <unk> League ) , a strongly nationalistic group to whom he contributed literary works for their events . 
 In 1893 , List and Fanny <unk> founded a belletristic society devoted to encouraging German nationalist and neo @-@ romantic literature in Vienna , the <unk> <unk> ( " Danubian Literary Society " ) . The group was partly based upon the 15th @-@ century <unk> <unk> <unk> created by the Viennese humanist Conrad <unk> , about whom List authored a brief biography in 1893 . He also authored two further novels during the 1890s , both of which were historical romances set in Iron Age Germany . The first appeared in 1894 as Jung <unk> Heimkehr ( " Young Diether 's Homecoming " ) , which told the story of a young <unk> living in the fifth century who has been forcefully converted to Christianity but who returns to his original solar cult . The second was <unk> , a two @-@ volume story published in 1895 which told the story of an eponymous Quadi maiden who escaped captivity from the Romans to become an empress . In 1898 , he then authored a catechism exhibiting a form of pagan deism titled Der <unk> ( " The Invincible " ) . 
 List 's activities had made him a celebrity within the Austrian Pan @-@ German movement , with the editors of the Ostdeutsche Rundschau convening a Guido List evening in April 1895 and South Vienna 's Wieden Singers ' Club holding a List festival in April 1897 . Having divorced his previous wife , in August 1899 List married Anna <unk> , who was from <unk> in Bohemia . Despite List 's modern Pagan faith , the wedding was held in an evangelical Protestant church , reflecting the growing popularity of Protestantism among Austria 's Pan @-@ German community , who perceived it as a more authentically German form of Christianity than the Catholicism that was popular among Austria @-@ Hungary 's other ethnic and linguistic communities . <unk> had previously appeared in a performance of List 's Der Wala <unk> and had publicly recited some of his poetry . Following their marriage , List devoted himself fully to drama , authoring the plays König Vannius ( " King Vannius " ) in 1899 , Sommer @-@ <unk> @-@ Feuerzauber ( " Summer Solstice Fire Magic " ) in 1901 and Das <unk> ( " The Gold Coin " ) in 1903 . He also authored a pamphlet titled Der <unk> von Carnuntum ( " The Reconstruction of Carnuntum " ) in 1900 , in which he called for the reconstruction of the ancient Roman amphitheatre at Carnuntum as an open @-@ air stage through which Wotanism could be promoted . 
 = = = Later life : 1902 – 19 = = = 
 According to the historian Nicholas Goodrick @-@ Clarke , 1902 marked " a fundamental change in the character of [ List 's ] ideas : occult ideas now entered his fantasy of the ancient Germanic faith . " This began when he received an operation to remove a cataract from his eye , after which he was left blind for eleven months . During this period of rest and recuperation , he contemplated questions surrounding the origins of the German language and the use of runes . He subsequently produced a manuscript detailing what he deemed to be a proto @-@ language of the Aryan race , in which he claimed that occult insight had enabled him to interpret the letters and sounds of both runes and emblems and glyphs found on ancient inscriptions . Terming it " a monumental pseudo @-@ science " , Goodrick @-@ Clarke also noted that it constituted " the masterpiece of his occult @-@ nationalist researches " . List sent a copy to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna , but they declined to publish it . In 1903 List published an article in Die Gnosis magazine , which reflected a clear influence from the ideas of the Theosophical Society . 
 List had occasionally used the title of von in his name from 1903 onward , but began using it permanently in 1907 . The term was used to denote that an individual was a member of the nobility , and when the nobility archive ordered an official enquiry into List 's use of the term , he was called before magistrates in October 1907 . He defended his usage of the term with the claim that he was the descendant of aristocrats from Lower Austria and Styria , and that his great @-@ grandfather had abandoned the title to become an inn keeper . Goodrick @-@ Clarke noted that whatever the legitimacy of List 's unproven claims , claiming the title of von was " an integral part of [ List 's ] religious fantasy " because in his mind it connected him to the ancient <unk> priesthood , from whom he believed Austria 's aristocrats were descended . It is possible that List decided to adopt the usage of the term after his friend , the fellow prominent Ariosophist Lanz von Liebenfels , had done so in 1903 . 
 List 's popularity among the Pan @-@ Germanist movement resulted in suggestions that a society devoted to the promotion of List 's work be established . This materialised as the Guido @-@ von @-@ List @-@ Gesellschaft in March 1908 , which was largely funded by the Wannieck family but which also included many prominent figures from middle and upper @-@ class Austrian and German society . At Midsummer 1911 , List founded the High Armanen Order ( <unk> Armanen @-@ Ordem ) , or <unk> , as an inner group of Armanist practitioners within the List Society with whom he went on pilgrimages to various places that he believed had been ancient cultic sites associated with the worship of Wotan . He operated as leader of this group , using the title of Grand Master . The List Society also produced six booklets authored by List himself between 1908 and 1911 . Titled " Ario @-@ Germanic research reports " , they covered List 's opinions on the meaning and magical power of runes , the ancient Wotanic priesthood , Austrian folklore and place @-@ names , and the secret messages within heraldic devices . In 1914 , the Society then published List 's work on runes and language that the Imperial Academy had turned down . The first three of these publications furthered List 's reputation across both the völkisch and nationalist subcultures within both Austria and Germany . Many other writers were inspired by List , with a number of works being specifically dedicated to him . The editor of Prana , Johannes <unk> , authored a biography of List that was published in 1917 . 
 During World War I , List erroneously proclaimed that there would be victory for the Central Powers of Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary , claiming to have learned this information from a vision that he experienced in 1917 . By 1918 , List was in declining health , furthered by the food shortages experienced in Vienna as a result of the war . In the spring of 1919 , at the age of 71 , List and his wife set off to recuperate and meet followers at the manor house of Eberhard von <unk> , a List Society patron who lived at Langen in Brandenburg , Germany . On arrival at the Anhalter Station at Berlin , List felt too exhausted to continue the journey . After a doctor had diagnosed a lung inflammation his health deteriorated quickly , and he died in a Berlin guesthouse on the morning of 17 May 1919 . He was cremated in Leipzig and his ashes laid in an urn and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery , Zentralfriedhof . An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist Philipp <unk> then appeared in the Münchener Beobachter . 
 = = Ideology = = 
 List promoted a religion termed " Wotanism " , which he saw as the <unk> , outer form of pre @-@ Christian Germanic religion , while " Armanism " was the term he applied to what he believed were the esoteric , secret teachings of this ancient belief system . He believed that while Wotanism expounded polytheism for the wider population , those who were members of the Armanist elite were aware of the reality of monotheism . List 's Armanism would later be classified as a form of " Ariosophy " , a term which was coined by Lanz von Liebenfels in 1915 . Goodrick @-@ Clarke considered List 's ideas to be a " unique amalgam of nationalist mythology and esotericism " . Religious studies scholar Olav Hammer noted that List 's Wotanism " increasingly came to consist of an original synthesis of his reading of Germanic mythology with Theosophy " . List 's early Theosophical influence came largely from the writings of German Theosophist Max Ferdinand <unk> von Werth , who had combined Theosophical ideas with his own interpretations of Germanic mythology and emphasis on racial doctrines , thus anticipating Ariosophy . In later work , this Theosophical influence over List 's thinking grew , and he began referencing works such as Helena Blavatsky 's Die <unk> and William Scott Elliot 's The Lost Lemuria in his publications . He expressed the view that Norse mythology accorded with – and thus proved – the <unk> teachings of Theosophy . 
 Much of List 's understanding of the ancient past was based not on empirical research into historical , archaeological , and folkloric sources , but rather on ideas that he claimed to have received as a result of clairvoyant illumination . Later writer Richard Rudgley thus characterised List 's understanding of the " pagan past " as an " imaginative reconstruction " . List 's Wotanism was constructed largely on the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda , two Old Norse textual sources which had been composed in Iceland during the late Middle Ages ; he nevertheless believed that they accurately reflected the belief systems of Germany , having been authored by " <unk> " refugees fleeing Christianity . He believed that prior to the spread of Christianity into Northern Europe , there had once been a culturally unified German civilisation that had been spread across much of Europe , which came to be degraded and divided under the impact of Christianity . He believed that the Danubian region of modern Austria had thus been part of this unified German civilisation before the growth of the Roman Empire , an idea in contrast to the view accepted by historians of the time that linguistically German communities only settled in the area during the reign of the Frankish king Charlemagne in the ninth century CE , pushing out the pre @-@ existing linguistically Celtic groups . 
 = = = Runes and the Armanenschaft = = = 
 List believed that the basic teachings of Wotanism were found in the runic alphabet , believing that they could be deciphered by linking these letters with particular runic spells which appear in the Old Norse <unk> . He claimed to have deciphered these secret meanings himself , translating them as statements such as " Know yourself , then you know everything " , " Do not fear death , he cannot kill you " , " Marriage is the root of the Aryan race ! " , and " Man is one with God ! " List emphasised the importance of a mystical union between humans and the universe , viewing divinity as being immanent in nature , with all life being an emanation of it . Connected to this , he believed in a close identification between the racial group – the volk or folk – and the natural world . List believed that human beings had an immortal soul , and that it would be reincarnated according to the laws of karma until eventually uniting with divinity . 
 In the 1890s , List initially devised the idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates , the Armanenschaft , an idea which had developed into a key part of his thinking by 1908 . List 's image of the Armanenschaft 's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry . He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees , each with their own secret signs , grips , and passwords . He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people , acting as teachers , priests , and judges . In List 's interpretation of history , the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft , resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland . He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings , known as kala . 
 List claimed that after the Christianisation of Northern Europe , the Armanist teachings were passed down in secret , thus resulting in their transmission through later esoteric traditions such as Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism . He also claimed that the Medieval Knights Templar had been keepers of these Armanist secrets , and that they had been persecuted by the Christian establishment as a result of this ; he believed that the deity they were accused of worshiping , Baphomet , was actually a sigil of the Maltese Cross representing Armanist teachings . According to List , a number of prominent Renaissance humanists – including Giovanni Pico della Mirandola , Giordano Bruno , Johannes <unk> , Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa , and Johann Reuchlin – were also aware of this ancient Armanist teaching , with List claiming that he was actually the reincarnation of Reuchlin . In addition , List claimed that in the eighth century , <unk> had imparted their secret teachings to the Jewish rabbis of Cologne in the hope of preserving them from Christian persecution ; he believed that these teachings became the Kabbalah , which he therefore reasoned was an ancient German and not Jewish innovation , thus legitimising its usage in his own teachings . Rudgley stated that this " tortuous argument " was used to support List 's anti @-@ semitic agenda . 
 = = = Millenarian views = = = 
 List generally saw the world in which he was living as one of degeneration , comparing it with the societies of the Late Roman and Byzantine Empires . He bemoaned the decline of the rural peasantry through urbanisation , having witnessed how Vienna 's population tripled between 1870 and 1890 , resulting in overcrowding , a growth in diseases like tuberculosis , and a severe strain on the city 's resources . A staunch monarchist , he opposed all forms of democracy , feminism , and modern trends in the arts , such as those of the Vienna <unk> . Influenced by the Pan @-@ Germanist politician Georg Ritter von Schönerer and his Away from Rome ! movement , List decried the growing influence of linguistically Slavic communities within the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . He was opposed to laissez @-@ faire capitalism and large @-@ scale enterprise , instead favouring an economic system based on small @-@ scale artisans and craftsmen , being particularly unhappy with the decline in tradesmen 's guilds . He was similarly opposed to the modern banking sector and financial institutions , deeming it to be dominated by Jews ; in criticising these institutions , he expressed anti @-@ semitic sentiments . Such views of the country 's economic situation were not uncommon in Austria at the time , having become particularly widespread following the Panic of 1873 . The later Heathen and runologist Edred Thorsson noted that List 's " theories were to some degree based on the anti @-@ semitic dogmas of the day " , while Hammer stated that the Ariosophic tradition promulgated by List and others was " unambiguously racist and anti @-@ semitic " . 
 List believed that the degradation of modern Western society was as a result of a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party , an idea influenced by anti @-@ semitic conspiracy theories . Adopting a <unk> perspective , he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario @-@ German race . In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany 's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario @-@ German Empire . Toward the war 's end , he believed that the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new , better society . For List , this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past , reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time , something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy . Reflecting his monarchist beliefs , he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of <unk> , with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man 's eldest son . In List 's opinion , this new empire would be highly hierarchical , with non @-@ Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure . He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted . 
 = = Influence and legacy = = 
 Writing in 2003 , the historian of religion Mattias Gardell believed that List had become the " revered guru of Ariosophic paganism " . Gardell considered the Austrian esotericist to have been " a legend in his lifetime " , with List 's ideas being embraced by many völkisch groups in Germany . German members of the List Society included Philipp <unk> , Karl Hellwig , Georg <unk> , Bernhard Koerner , and Eberhard von <unk> , who were founding members of the Reichshammerbund and Germanenorden ; through the Germanenorden 's Munich offshoot , the Thule Society , a lineage can be drawn between the List Society and the early Nazi Party as it was established after World War I. Goodrick @-@ Clarke opined that " this channel of influence certainly carries most weight in any assessment of List 's historical importance . " The scholar of Western esotericism Joscelyn Godwin expressed the view that List was one of the " three godfathers of Nazi Thule " alongside Liebenfels and Rudolf von <unk> , while Rudgley went further by claiming that List 's vision of a future German Empire constituted " a blueprint for the Nazi regime " . 
 Other German völkisch figures promoted <unk> ideas to the wider public during and after the First World War . Further individuals – notably Rudolf John <unk> , Werner von Bülow , Friedrich Bernhard <unk> , Herbert Reichstein , and <unk> <unk> <unk> – took List 's Ariosophical ideas alongside those of Liebenfels and built upon them further , resulting in a flourishing Ariosophical movement in the late 1920s and 1930s , with some of these individuals being within the coterie of prominent Nazi Heinrich Himmler and influencing the symbolism and rituals of the SS . His was also exerted an influence on the Australian Odinist and Ariosophist Alexander Rud Mills . 
 Both Goodrick @-@ Clarke and later the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein described List as " the pioneer of völkisch rune occultism " , with the latter adding that " the roots of modern esoteric <unk> are found in Guido List 's visions . " In 1984 , Thorsson expressed the view that List 's impact was such that he was " able to shape the runic theories of German magicians ( although not necessarily their political ones ) from that time to the present day . " In 1976 , two longstanding activists in the völkisch and far @-@ right milieu , Adolf and Sigrun <unk> , established the Armanen @-@ Order in order to revive List 's ideas , adopting a strong anti @-@ modernist stance and a desire to revive pre @-@ Christian religion . It was through the Armanen @-@ Order that Thorsson , who joined it , learned about List 's work . Thorsson then spearheaded " the post @-@ war runic revival " , founding an initiatory organisation known as the Rune <unk> in 1980 . Thorsson was responsible for translating a number of List 's works into English , alongside those of other völkisch mystics like Siegfried Adolf Kummer . These publications brought awareness of List to an English @-@ speaking readership , with his 1988 translation of List 's The Secret of the Runes initiating a surge of interest in Ariosophy among the Heathen community of the United States . List 's <unk> also made an appearance in Stephan Grundy 's 1990 book Teutonic Magic . List 's Armanist ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the American Odinist militant David Lane , with Wotansvolk , a group that List was involved in establishing , viewing their own activism as a continuation of that begun by List . List was also of interest to the Heathen Michael Moynihan , who spent time visiting the places in Austria that are associated with List 's life . 
 = Big Two @-@ Hearted River = 
 " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " is a two @-@ part short story written by American author Ernest Hemingway , published in the 1925 Boni & Liveright edition of In Our Time , the first American volume of Hemingway 's short stories . It features a single protagonist , Hemingway 's recurrent autobiographical character Nick Adams , whose speaking voice is heard just three times . The story explores the destructive qualities of war which is countered by the healing and regenerative powers of nature . When it was published , critics praised Hemingway 's sparse writing style and it became an important work in his canon . 
 The story is one of Hemingway 's earliest pieces to employ his Iceberg Theory of writing ; a modernist approach to prose in which the underlying meaning is hinted at , rather than explicitly stated . " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " is almost exclusively descriptive and intentionally devoid of plot . Hemingway was influenced by the visual innovations of Cézanne 's paintings and adapted the painter 's idea of presenting background minutiae in lower focus than the main image . In this story , the small details of a fishing trip are explored in great depth , while the landscape setting , and most obviously the swamp , are given cursory attention . 
 = = Background and publication = = 
 In 1922 , Hemingway moved with his wife Hadley to Paris , where he worked as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star . He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald , Ford Madox Ford , James Joyce , Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein . The year 1923 saw his first published work , a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems , followed the next year by another collection of short vignettes , in our time ( without capitals ) . Hoping to have in our time published in New York , in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume with " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " planned as the final piece . He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review . 
 " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " has strong autobiographical elements . During World War I , Hemingway signed on as a member of the Red Cross at age 19 , and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an ambulance driver . On his first day there , he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion , about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon : " I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments " . A few days later , on July 8 , 1918 , he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs . He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months ; after his return home , he went on a week @-@ long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula — a trip that became the inspiration for " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " . The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns , suggesting that in an early version more characters were included , but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed — leaving Nick alone in the woods . 
 When Hemingway asked her opinion of the draft in October 1925 , Stein advised him to cut an 11 @-@ page section of stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness reminiscences written from Nick 's point of view . Hemingway took her advice , reworked the ending , and wrote to his editor : " I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap " . Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self @-@ reflections in his writing ; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a " tour @-@ de @-@ force " had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway 's development . 
 In January 1925 , while wintering in Schruns , Austria , waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America , Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh 's newly established literary magazine This Quarter . Walsh bought it for 1 @,@ 000 French francs , the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction . On October 5 , 1925 , the expanded edition of In Our Time ( with conventional capitalization in the title ) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York . The last story in the volume was the two @-@ part " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " . The piece was later included in Hemingway 's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty @-@ Nine Stories published in October 1938 , and in two collections of short stories published after his death , The Nick Adams Stories ( 1972 ) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway : The Finca Vigía Edition ( 1987 ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Part one 
 The story opens with Nick arriving by train at Seney , Michigan , to find that a fire has devastated the town , leaving " nothing but the rails and the burned @-@ over country . " While following a road leading away from the town , he stops on a bridge where he observes trout in the river below . After , he hikes up a hill and rests at a burned stump . While smoking a cigarette , he discovers an ash @-@ blackened grasshopper crawling on his sock , and detaches it . His first spoken words in the story are " Go on , hopper .... Fly away somewhere . " 
 Later in the day he relaxes in a glade of tall pines and falls asleep . When he wakes , he hikes the last mile to the edge of the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light " making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were starting to rain . " He pitches his tent , unpacks his supplies , cooks his dinner , fills his water bucket , heats a pot of coffee , and kills a mosquito before falling asleep . 
 Part two 
 Early the next morning , Nick fills a jar with 50 dew @-@ heavy grasshoppers found under a log he names a " grasshopper lodging @-@ house " , eats breakfast , drinks sweetened coffee and makes a sliced onion sandwich . After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line , he walks to the river with a net hanging from his belt , a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck . Wading in the water , he fishes the shallows ; he lands a trout that " was mottled with clear , water @-@ over @-@ gravel color " that he releases . Moving into a pool of deeper water , he hooks a large trout , " as broad as a salmon " , which he loses . After a rest , he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack . Sitting on a log , smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich , he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp , but decides to wait for another day . At the log in the river , he kills , guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp .

 Hemingway saw World War I as the " central fact of our time " . " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " hints at both widespread physical devastation and Nick 's personal war and post @-@ war experience , but neither of these central facts are directly mentioned . Hemingway scholar Joseph Flora makes the observation that Hemingway portrays Nick 's character coping " more meaningfully than he had ever done before , with the issues of life and death " . Biographer Phillip Young sees the story as basically concerned with a description of a young man " trying desperately to keep from going out of his mind . " Nick returns wounded , and introduces a character type Hemingway used again in his later stories and novels . The theme of an unspecified wound is introduced , a device that was to culminate in Jake Barnes ' character in The Sun Also Rises . Hemingway scholar William Adair suggests that Nick 's war experience was different , and perhaps more traumatic than Hemingway 's own , writing that Nick 's unspecified wound should not be confused or automatically identified with Hemingway 's wound . 
 Although Hemingway 's best fiction such as " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " perhaps originated from the " dark thoughts " about the wounding , Jackson Benson believes that autobiographical details are employed as framing devices to make observations on life in general and not just Nick 's own experiences . He writes that Hemingway created " what if " scenarios from real situations in his early fiction , which he projected onto a fictional character — " What if I were wounded and made crazy ? " the character asks himself . Benson goes on to write that " much of Hemingway 's fiction is dream @-@ like — his early fiction , his best , has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare , as in the recurring imagery of In Our Time . " 
 Adair views the river setting as a fictional representation of the Piave River near Fossalta , the site of Hemingway 's mortar wound . Hemingway may have taken the idea of the swamp from the terrain in the battle of <unk> — a battle that Hemingway wrote about in a 1922 newspaper story , saying of it : " Austrians and Italians attacked and counter @-@ attacked waist deep in swamp water " . Furthermore , Adair suggests that Hemingway 's own wounding is reflected in the scene where Nick loses a fish — the " biggest one I ever had " — with descriptive imagery such as shoes " squelchy " with water , suggestive of Hemingway 's recollection of " feeling as if his boots were filled with warm water ( blood ) after his wounding . " 
 Writing in A Moveable Feast , Hemingway remembered " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , recalling when he " sat in a corner with the afternoon light coming in over my shoulder and wrote in the notebook .... When I stopped writing I did not want to leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool , its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log @-@ driven piles of the bridge . The story was about coming back from the war but there was no mention of the war in it . " 
 = = = Nature = = = 
 Hemingway 's stories typically position nature as a source of refuge and rebirth . His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration . Nature acts as the setting for hunters ' or fishermen 's existential moment of transcendence — especially at the moment when prey is killed . In Big Two @-@ Hearted River , Nick walks away from a ruined town , and enters the woods to hike toward the river , unharmed by the fire . His journey is motivated by absolution ; the river is described as two @-@ hearted because it gives life in the form of food ( fish ) and offers redemption . In the woods , Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel @-@ like , a description that echoes Stephen Crane 's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel @-@ like grove of trees . In the grove Nick sleeps well for the first time since the war , and there he begins the healing process . The next morning he goes to the river , wading into the water to fish . At first the strength of the current frightens him , and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself . 
 Hemingway 's descriptions of the Michigan landscape , which would have been familiar to him as in his youth he summered at the family 's Walloon Lake cottage in Northern Michigan , are presented in a vague and dreamlike manner . Ronald Berman sees Hemingway 's treatment of landscape as like a painter 's canvas on which he presents Nick 's state of mind . The descriptions of the river 's water have been compared to American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau 's descriptions of the pond in Walden . Biographer Meyers sees the story as a blend of American primitivism and sophistication ; Nick evidences a sense of loss which is " not simply grace under pressure — but under siege " . Nature is perceived as good and civilization as bad — a pervasive theme in American literature , found in such American classics as Mark Twain 's 19th @-@ century Huckleberry Finn and in William Faulkner 's 20th @-@ century Go Down , Moses . 
 According to Hemingway scholar Susan Beegel , Hemingway is fundamentally an American nature writer . She attributes it to his upbringing : his mother believed avidly in the early 20th @-@ century " back to nature " movement , and his father was a physician who taught science to his son , taking him to Agassiz Movement meetings as a young boy . Hemingway 's affinity with nature is reflected most strongly in " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , in broad strokes whereby he has Nick traveling deep into the American back @-@ country to find solace , and in small details such as his Agassiz " object oriented " descriptions of the grasshoppers . 
 = = Style = = 
 = = = Iceberg theory = = = 
 Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound 's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work . Pound 's influence can be seen in the stripped @-@ down , minimalist style characteristic in Hemingway 's early fiction . <unk> his admiration for the older writer , he admitted that Pound " taught [ me ] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive " . He also learned from James Joyce , who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose . Hemingway 's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound 's tight definition of imagism ; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to " get the most from the least , [ to ] prune language , [ to ] multiply intensities , [ to ] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth " . Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory : as Baker describes it , the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure , including the symbolism , operates out of sight . 
 The iceberg theory has been termed the " theory of omission " . Hemingway believed a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about something entirely different . In " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries out . The story is filled with seemingly trivial detail : Nick gathers grasshoppers , brews coffee , catches and loses a large trout . In this climactic event , however , the excitement and tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break . 
 While Hemingway painstakingly describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick 's fishing trip , he avoids or barely hints at the driving force of the work : the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war . Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute , writing " ' Big Two @-@ Hearted River ' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war .... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat , since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence . So the war , all mention of the war , anything about the war is omitted . " Flora believes that in " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any other piece written by Hemingway . 
 Paul Smith believes Hemingway was still only experimenting stylistically during In Our Time . He maintains that Hemingway 's later minimalist style can be seen here , but not so much from tight editing as from Hemingway 's first approach , his desire to emulate his influences . Hemingway 's sentences " began life as scrawny little things , and then grew to their proper size through a process of accretion . " He avoided complicated syntax to reflect Nick 's wish that the fishing trip be uncomplicated . An analysis of the text shows that about 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences — a childlike syntax without subordination — and that repetition is often substituted for subordinate thoughts . Furthermore , the repetition creates prose with a " rhythmic , ritualistic effect " that emphasizes important points . The length of the paragraphs varies with short paragraphs intensifying the action . Benson writes that in " Indian Camp " and " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " Hemingway 's prose was sharper and more abstract than in other stories , and that by employing simple sentences and diction — techniques he learned writing for newspapers — the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality . 
 = = = Cézanne = = = 
 Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne and early in his career crafted his prose in a way that would resonate with that painter 's work . He said in a 1949 interview that " Cézanne is my painter after the early painters .... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne , I learned how ... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times . " Hemingway wanted the structure of " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " to resemble a Cézanne — with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background . In a letter to Stein from August 1924 , he wrote , " I have finished two long stories ... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit . It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell . I made it all up " . 
 His description of the river and the countryside betray the influence of the Post @-@ Impressionist style . Hemingway was heavily influenced by the modernists . He often visited the Musée du Luxembourg , where he saw the three Cézanne paintings L <unk> , Cour d 'une ferme and Les <unk> . A series of Cézanne watercolors were exhibited at <unk> @-@ Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story . Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that he had been " learning something from the painting of Cézanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them . " 
 Comparing " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " to Cézanne 's paintings , Berman observes that Hemingway established a " representation of form , space and light " , and that the dense descriptive passages give " light and form .... overwhelmingly visual , intensely concerned with spatiality " , while in the middle ground , " We sense [ the trees ] through vertical forms and dark colors only " . Like Cézanne paintings , Hemingway 's landscapes are vague and do not represent any specific place : Seney burned in 1891 , not in 1919 ; the hill Nick climbs does not exist ; and the east branch of the Fox River , where he camps , is not a day 's hike from the town . 
 Kenneth Johnston believes Hemingway 's use of symbolism is a substitute for paint and brushstrokes . He views the description of the town after the fire , and the railroad tracks , as words " slash [ ed ] across the landscape " , with a physicality similar to a Cézanne landscape . The minutely detailed passages of the campsite and Nick 's mundane activities fill the story 's foreground , while the forest and menacing swamp , relegated to the background , are described vaguely and only in passing . The river acts as a barrier between the foreground and background , and is present as deep in places , shallow in others , with currents that are either slow or fast . Berman says Nick is shown as a figure in a painting — seen in the foreground at the campsite and at a distance from the murky background of the swamp . 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 Nick is incapable of self @-@ reflection and unable to cope with pain . Hemingway conveys this through symbolism and a series of objective correlatives ( tangible objects ) , which allow the reader insight to the character 's motivations . For example , on his arrival in Seney he literally falls off the train , shocked at the sight of the burned town , but on a deeper level in shock from his war experience . Leaving behind the burnt landscape , Nick climbs a hill in the heat , and surveys the town 's damage . The burning and heat symbolize his memory of war @-@ torn Italy , but he hopes for regrowth : " It could not all be burned . He knew that " . At the top of the hill , he takes a break , smokes a cigarette , and speaks for the first time . Flora suggests that speaking symbolizes his humanity , lost in the war , which he is beginning to regain . 
 Beyond the town the bridge over the river still exists and the river symbolizes time and timelessness , healing and the natural cycle of life and death . Nick is on a journey , perhaps he sees it as a religious quest given the Christian symbolism of the fish . From the town , a road leads into pristine back @-@ country . It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current , just as Nick needs to hold steady . From the bridge he glimpses a kingfisher taking wing , a bird Johnston points out symbolizes " halcyon days , peace and tranquility " . A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war , and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully so as not to damage its protective slime coat . The campsite symbolizes safety , set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens ; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture . 
 His tent is portrayed as a less dark place than the emptiness outside , and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary . Conversely , the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night , and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about . When he wakes in the morning , regenerated by sleep , he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In our time was published as part of Pound 's modernist series by Three Mountains Press , Paris in 1924 . The work was well received by critics ; Edmund Wilson described the writing as " of the first distinction " , and in the 1940s he again wrote of " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , " along with the mottled trout ... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece . " When the story was published in the United States , critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style . In 1952 , reviewing The Old Man and the Sea — for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature — The New York Times said of " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " that it was one of the " best and happiest of his early short stories " . 
 Carlos Baker views the stories of In Our Time as a remarkable achievement for a young writer . Joseph Flora described " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " as " unquestionably the most brilliant of the collection In Our Time " . The piece has become one of Hemingway 's most anthologized stories , and one of a handful subject to serious literary criticism since its publication , and belongs in the canon of 20th @-@ century American literature . Beegel writes that it is considered " among the best " American short stories , along with Stephen Crane 's " The Open Boat " , Nathaniel Hawthorne 's " Young Goodman Brown " and Edgar Allan Poe 's " The Fall of the House of Usher " . 
 According to Benson , despite Pound and Joyce 's influence , Hemingway " carried the new form into the position of dominant influence " for much of the 20th century . Unlike other modernist writers , who wrote of man cut off from the past , Hemingway placed his narratives in the present and hence became " the true modernist " . 
 = The Heart of a Woman = 
 The Heart of a Woman ( 1981 ) is an autobiography by American writer Maya Angelou . The book is the fourth installment in Angelou 's series of seven autobiographies . The Heart of a Woman recounts events in Angelou 's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to California , New York City , Cairo , and Ghana as she raises her teenage son , becomes a published author , becomes active in the US civil rights movement , and becomes romantically involved with a South African freedom fighter . One of the most important themes of The Heart of a Woman is motherhood , as Angelou continues to raise her teenage son . The book ends with Angelou 's son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom . 
 Like Angelou 's previous volumes , the book has been described as autobiographical fiction , though most critics , as well as Angelou , have characterized it as autobiography . Although most critics consider Angelou 's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings more favorably , The Heart of a Woman has received positive reviews . It was chosen as an Oprah 's Book Club selection in 1997 . 
 Critic Mary Jane Lupton says it has " a narrative structure unsurpassed in American autobiography " and that it is Angelou 's " most introspective " autobiography . The title is taken from a poem by Harlem Renaissance poet Georgia Douglas Johnson , which connects Angelou with other female African @-@ American writers . African @-@ American literature critic Lyman B. Hagen states , " Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival , sense of self , and continuing education , The Heart of a Woman moves its central figures to a point of full personhood " . The book follows Angelou to several places in the US and Africa , but the most important journey she describes is " a voyage into the self " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Heart of a Woman , published in 1981 , is the fourth installment of Maya Angelou 's series of seven autobiographies . The success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou a considerable amount of fame by 1981 . And Still I Rise , her third volume of poetry , was published in 1978 and reinforced Angelou 's success as a writer . Her first volume of poetry , Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ( 1971 ) , was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . 
 Writer Julian Mayfield states that Angelou 's work set a precedent not only for other Black women writers , but for the genre of autobiography as a whole . Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women through the writing of her life stories . It made her , as scholar Joanne Braxton stated , " without a doubt ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " . Angelou was one of the first African @-@ American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life , and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books . Writer Hilton Als calls her a pioneer of self @-@ exposure , willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices . While Angelou was composing her second autobiography , Gather Together in My Name , she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute . Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to " tell the truth as a writer " and to " be honest about it " . 
 In 1957 , the year The Heart of a Woman opens , Angelou had appeared in an off @-@ Broadway revue that inspired her first film , Calypso Heat Wave , in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions , something she does not mention in the book . Also in 1957 and not discussed in the book , her first album , Miss Calypso , was released ; it was reissued as a CD in 1995 . According to Als , Angelou sang and performed calypso music because it was popular at the time , and not to develop as an artist . As described in The Heart of a Woman , Angelou eventually gave up performing in favor of a career as a writer and poet . According to Chuck Foster , who wrote the liner notes in Miss Calypso 's 1995 reissue , her calypso music career is " given short shrift " and dismissed in the book .

 The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn , 
 As a lone bird , soft winging , so restlessly on , 
 Afar o 'er life 's turrets and vales does it roam 
 In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home . 
 The heart of a woman falls back with the night , 
 And enters some alien cage in its plight , 
 And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars 
 While it breaks , breaks , breaks on the sheltering bars . 
 - — " The Heart of a Woman " , by Georgia Douglas Johnson 
 Angelou takes the title of her fourth autobiography from a poem by Georgia Douglas Johnson , a Harlem Renaissance writer . Critic Lyman B. Hagan states that although the title is " less striking or oblique than titles of her preceding books " , it is appropriate because Johnson 's poem mentions a caged bird and provides a connection to Angelou 's first autobiography , whose title was taken from a poem by Paul Lawrence Dunbar . The title suggests Angelou 's painful loneliness and exposes a spiritual dilemma also present in her first volume . Johnson 's use of the metaphor is different from Dunbar 's because her bird is a female whose isolation is sexual rather than racial . The caged bird may also refer to Angelou after her failed marriage , but writer Mary Jane Lupton says that " the Maya Angelou of The Heart of a Woman is too strong and too self @-@ determined to be kept in a cage " . 
 The Heart of a Woman is the first time Angelou identifies with another female African @-@ American writer . Her early literary influences were men , including James Weldon Johnson , Paul Lawrence Dunbar , and Shakespeare . Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like Anne Spencer , Jessie Fauset , Nella Larsen , and Zora Neale Hurston . Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The events described in The Heart of a Woman take place between 1957 and 1962 , beginning shortly after the end of Angelou 's previous autobiography , Singin ' and Swingin ' and Gettin ' Merry Like Christmas . Angelou and her teenage son Guy have moved into a houseboat commune in Sausalito . After a year , they move to a rented house near San Francisco . Singer Billie Holiday visits Angelou and her son there and Holiday sings " Strange Fruit " , her famous song about the lynching of Black men , to Guy . Holiday tells Angelou , " You 're going to be famous . But it won 't be for singing . " In 1959 , Angelou and Guy move to New York City . The transition is difficult for Guy , and Angelou is forced to protect him from a gang leader . No longer satisfied with performing in nightclubs , she dedicates herself to acting , writing , political organizing , and her son . Her friend , novelist John Killens , invites her to join the Harlem Writers Guild . She meets other important African @-@ American artists and writers , including James Baldwin , who would become her mentor . She becomes a published writer for the first time . 
 Angelou becomes more politically active and participates in African @-@ American and African protest rallies , including helping to organize a sit @-@ in at the United Nations following the death of Zaire 's prime minister , Patrice Lumumba . She meets Malcolm X and is struck by his good looks and magnetism . After hearing Martin Luther King , Jr. speak , she and her friend activist Godfrey Cambridge are inspired to produce a successful fundraising event for King 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) called Cabaret For Freedom . King names her coordinator of SCLC 's office in New York . She performs in Jean Genet 's play , The Blacks , with Roscoe Lee Brown , James Earl Jones , and Cicely Tyson . 
 In 1961 , Angelou meets South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make . Angelou and Make never marry , but she and Guy move with Make to London and Cairo , where she acts as his political wife while he was in exile . Their relationship is full of cultural conflicts ; he expects her to be a subservient African wife , and she yearns for the freedom of a working woman . She learns that Make is too friendly with other women and is irresponsible with money , so she accepts a position as assistant editor at the Arab Observer . Their relationship is examined by their community of friends , and Angelou and Make eventually separate . Angelou accepts a job in Liberia , and she and Guy travel to Accra , where he has been accepted to attend college . Guy is seriously injured in an automobile accident , so she begins working at the University of Ghana and remains there while he recuperates . The Heart of a Woman ends with Guy leaving for college and Angelou remarking to herself , " At last , I 'll be able to eat the whole breast of a roast chicken by myself . " 
 = = Genre = = 
 All seven of Angelou 's installments of her life story are in the tradition of African @-@ American autobiography . Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing , changing , and expanding the genre . Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself , but she reports not one person 's story , but the collective 's . Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African @-@ American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people . Her use of devices common in fictional writing , such as dialog , characterization and thematic development has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction . 
 All of Angelou 's autobiographies conform to the autobiography 's standard structure : they are written by a single author , they are chronological , and they contain elements of character , technique , and theme . In a 1983 interview with literature critic Claudia Tate , Angelou calls her books autobiographies , and later acknowledges that she follows the slave narrative tradition of " speaking in the first @-@ person singular talking about the first @-@ person plural , always saying ' I ' meaning ' we ' " . Lupton compares The Heart of a Woman with other autobiographies , and states that for the first time in Angelou 's series , she is able to present herself as a model for successful living . However , Angelou 's " woman 's heart " — her perspective as a woman with concerns about her self @-@ esteem and the conflicts with her lovers and her son — is what makes her autobiography different . Angelou 's feelings as described in The Heart of a Woman , which Lupton calls Angelou 's " most introspective " book , are what dictates the book 's form . 
 Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to all her books , which differentiate her work from more traditional " truthful " autobiographies . Her approach parallels the conventions of many African @-@ American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US , when truth was often censored for purposes of self @-@ protection . Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the tradition of African @-@ American autobiography , but insists that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form . In a 1998 interview with journalist George Plimpton , Angelou discusses her writing process , and " the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction " and memoirs . When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story , she states , " Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people , because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about . " Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories . Hagen states , " One can assume that ' the essence of the data ' is present in Angelou 's work " , and that Angelou uses aspects of fiction writing to make her depictions of events and people more interesting . Angelou 's long @-@ time editor , Robert Loomis said that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader . 
 The Heart of a Woman is similar to Angelou 's previous volumes because it is narrated from the intimate point of view of a woman and a mother , but by this time , she is able to refer to events that occurred in her past books . Angelou has become a serial autobiographer , something Lupton calls " a narrative structure unsurpassed in American autobiography " . Angelou successfully draws upon her previous works , and is able to build upon the themes she has already explored ; for example , Angelou threatens the gang leader who has been threatening her son , a powerful incident when considered in light of Angelou 's rape in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings . Lupton calls Angelou 's violent behavior an " unconscious effort to rewrite her own history " . 
 = = Style = = 
 Angelou does not begin to create her own narrative until The Heart of a Woman , which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books . For example , there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes . The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou 's resolution of her conflict between her duties as a mother and her success as a performer . 
 Angelou perfects the use of the vignette in The Heart of a Woman to present her acquaintances and close associates . Two of her most developed vignettes in this book are of Billie Holiday and Malcolm X. The vignettes of those she knew well , like <unk> Make , also present her interactions and relationships . Hagen writes that although " frank talk seemed to be almost requisite for a commercially successful book " in the early 1980s , Angelou values monogamy , fidelity , and commitment in her relationships . 
 For the only time in this series , Angelou describes her son 's accident in detail at both the end of this book and the beginning of her next one , All God 's Children Need Traveling Shoes , a technique that centralizes the two books , connects them with each other , creates a strong , emotional link between them , and repeats Angelou 's pattern of ending each book on a positive note . In this book , Angelou ends with a hopeful look to the future as her son attains his independence and she looks forward to hers . Hagen writes , " Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival , sense of self , and continuing education , The Heart of a Woman moves its central figures to a point of full personhood . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Race = = = 
 Race , like in the rest of the series , is a central theme in The Heart of a Woman . The book opens with Angelou and Guy living in an experimental commune with white people , trying to participate in the new openness between Blacks and whites . She is not completely comfortable with the arrangement ; Angelou never names her roommates , even though " naming " has been an important theme in her books thus far . For the most part , Angelou is able to get along well with whites , but she occasionally encounters prejudice , as when she needs help from white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood . Hagen calls Angelou 's descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book " optimistic " . Angelou continues her indictment of white power structure and her protests against racial injustice . 
 Angelou becomes more politicized and develops a new sense of Black identity . Even Angelou 's decision to leave show business is political . She sees herself as a social and cultural historian of her time , and of the civil rights and Black literary movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s . She becomes more attracted to the causes of Black militants in the US and in Africa , to the point of entering into a relationship with a significant militant , and becomes more committed to activism . During this time , she becomes an active political protester , but she does not think of herself in that way . She places the focus upon herself and uses the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the civil rights movement influenced her . According to Hagen , Angelou 's contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and " eminently effective " . 
 = = = Journey = = = 
 Travel is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole ; McPherson writes that it is something of a national myth to Americans as a people . This is also the case for African @-@ American autobiography , which has its roots in the slave narrative . The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings — the San Francisco Bay Area , New York , and Egypt — and two secondary ones — London and Accra . 
 Like all of Angelou 's books , the structure of The Heart of a Woman is based on a journey . Angelou emphasizes the theme of movement by opening her book with a spiritual ( " The ole ark 's a <unk> ' " ) , which McPherson calls " the theme song of the United States in 1957 " . This spiritual , which contains a reference to Noah 's ark , presents Angelou as a type of Noah and demonstrates her spirituality . Angelou mentions Alan Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac 's 1951 novel On the Road , thus connecting her own journey and uncertainty about the future with the journeys of literary figures . Even though Angelou travels to Africa for a relationship , she makes a connection with the continent . Lupton states , " Africa is the site of her growth " . Angelou 's time in Africa makes her more aware of her African roots as she searches for the past of her ancestors . Although Angelou journeys to many places in the book , the most important journey she describes is " a voyage into the self " . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Angelou 's primary role in Singin ' and Swingin ' and Gettin ' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer , but in The Heart of a Woman she changes from someone who uses others ' method of expression — the songs and dances of the African , Caribbean , and African American oral tradition — to a writer . Angelou makes this decision for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement , and so that she can care for her son . For the first time in Angelou 's autobiographies , she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development . Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers for the first time in The Heart of a Woman . She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood , but this is the first time she mentions female authors . Up to this point , her identification has been with male writers ; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism . 
 Angelou 's concept of herself as an artist changed after her encounter with Billie Holiday . Up to that point , Angelou 's career was more about fame than about art ; Als states , " Developing her artistry was not the point " . Als also says that Angelou 's busy career , instead of revealing her ambition , shows " a woman who is only moderately talented and perpetually unable to understand who she is " . Angelou , in spite of the mistakes of her youth , needed the approval and acceptance of others , and observes that Holiday was able to perceive this . Holiday tells her , " You 're going to be famous . But it won 't be for singing . " 
 Angelou had begun to write sketches , songs and short stories , and shows her work to her friend John Killens , who invites her to New York City to develop her writing skills . She joins the Harlem Writers Guild , and receives feedback from other African @-@ American authors such as Killens , Rosa Guy , and Caribbean writer Paule Marshall , who would eventually make significant contributions to African @-@ American literature . Angelou dedicates herself to improving her craft , forcing herself to understand the technical aspects of writing . Lupton writes , " Readers can actually envision in this volume the distinguished artist who becomes the Maya Angelou of the 1990s " .

 Motherhood , a theme throughout Angelou 's autobiographies , becomes more complex in The Heart of a Woman . Although Guy struggles with the developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother , they remain close . Many years of experience as a mother , and her success as a writer , actress , and activist , enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity , professionally and as a mother . Her self @-@ assurance becomes a major part of her personality . Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved , and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him at the end of her previous autobiography that they would never be separated again . Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child 's . 
 Lupton also writes that motherhood is important in Angelou 's books , as is " the motif of the responsible mother " . Angelou 's commitment to care for her son is revealed in her confrontation with the street gang leader who has threatened Guy . In this episode , which Lupton considers the most dramatic in the book , Angelou has become a powerful mother . Angelou is no longer torn by self @-@ doubt , but is now a strong and aggressive Black mother . Angelou has become what Joanne M. Braxton calls the " outraged mother " , which represents the Black mother 's strength and dedication found throughout slave narratives . Lupton also writes that Angelou has become a reincarnation of her grandmother , a central figure in Caged Bird . 
 By the end of The Heart of a Woman , Angelou is alone ; for example , after Guy recuperates from the car accident , he leaves her to attend college . The final word in the book is the negative " myself " , a word that signifies Angelou 's new @-@ found freedom and independence . Angelou has become truly herself and is no longer defined as someone 's wife or mother . Scholar Wallis <unk> calls this moment one of " illusive transcendence " and " a scene of hope and completion " . For the first time in many years , Angelou will be able to eat a chicken breast alone , something that is valued throughout her books . Lupton calls this thought " perfectly formed " . <unk> states that The Heart of a Woman 's " lonely aching " hearkens back to the poem that inspired the book 's title . 
 = = Critical reception and sales = = 
 Critics gave The Heart of a Woman positive reviews , praising its professional qualities . The American Library Association 's Choice Magazine says that although Caged Bird was the best of Angelou 's autobiographies , " every book since has been very much worth the reading and pondering " . Janet B. Blundell writes that the book was " lively , revealing , and worth the reading " , but also found it " too chatty and anecdotal " . Hagen responded to this criticism by stating that all of Angelou 's books consist of episodes connected by theme and character . Sheree <unk> , writing for Ms. , appreciated the episodic nature of Angelou 's writing and praised her for her " wonderfully unaffected story telling skills " . Cudjoe called it " the most political segment of Angelou 's autobiographical statement " . 
 In 1993 , Angelou recited her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " at President Bill Clinton 's inauguration ; in the following week , sales of her works , including The Heart of a Woman , rose by 300 – 600 percent . Bantam Books printed 400 @,@ 000 copies of her books to meet demand . Random House , which published Angelou 's hardcover books and the poem later that year , reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992 , marking a 1 @,@ 200 percent increase . In 1997 , Angelou 's friend Oprah Winfrey named The Heart of a Woman as a selection in her book club , making it a bestseller and increasing its total printing to over one million copies , sixteen years after its publication .

 In September 2011 , Warner Bros. Movie World announced that Batman Adventure – The Ride 2 would be closed on 15 October 2011 and would be replaced by a new attraction . On 3 October 2011 , the chairman and CEO of Sally Corporation , John Wood , stated the following in an interview for <unk> : 
 Wood 's statement led to speculation that the new ride might be manufactured by Sally Corporation . On 22 February 2012 , Warner Bros. Movie World officially announced via their Facebook page that it would be launching two DC Comics @-@ based attractions in 2012 . The following day , a billboard advertising the ride was installed outside the defunct Batman ride . This was followed in May 2012 with a recruitment poster featuring Superman . Justice League : Alien Invasion 3D was officially announced by Warner Bros. Movie World on 25 May 2012 . On 5 June 2012 , the Gold Coast Bulletin reported that the ride would be manufactured by Sally Corporation and would cost A $ 9 million .

 The queue for the ride begins outside the Hall of Justice area . Inside the entrance , several portable television screens inform guests that an alien attack on the Earth is underway and that they are required to defeat the alien threat . Riders pass under a scanning device as they enter the Cyborg 's test lab , which also serves as the load and unload station . Riders are provided with a pair of RealD 3D glasses before boarding their tactical assault vehicle and entering the battle . 
 The main section of the ride consists of guests using the laser blasters ( mounted to the vehicles ) to shoot at over 250 Starro spores . Riders earn points for shooting the aliens and the scores are shown on a panel situated on the vehicles , as well as on a leaderboard at the completion of the ride . The 20 themed cars are guided along a 197 @-@ metre ( 646 ft ) guide rail track . Eight 3D screens and 16 animatronic characters complete the ride .

 Justice League : Alien Invasion 3D has been well received . Prior to the opening of the attraction , Tanya <unk> of the Gold Coast Bulletin experienced a preview of the ride and stated afterwards that " the unbelievably real 3D effects and sound , wind and heat blasts and falling walls made for an extremely immersive experience " . Richard Wilson of <unk> commended the ride for its engaging theming and immersive storyline , but described <unk> 's ride system as the biggest disappointment . Wilson concluded by stating , " Justice League adds a new dimension to Warner Bros. Movie World that has been sorely missing " . 
 Based on the reception of the ride at Warner Bros. Movie World , Sally Corporation have expressed interest in transferring the concept to other parks around the world including those in the United States . It wasn 't until 2014 when Six Flags officially announced Justice League : Battle for Metropolis would be added in 2015 to Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags St. Louis . Noticeable differences between Justice League : Alien Invasion 3D and Justice League : Battle for Metropolis include a motion @-@ based ride system by Oceaneering International and the involvement of additional DC Comics villains including Lex Luthor and The Joker . 
 = Grotrian @-@ Steinweg = 
 Grotrian @-@ Steinweg , known as Grotrian in the US , is a German manufacturer of luxury pianos . The company is based in Braunschweig , Germany , commonly known as Brunswick in English . Grotrian @-@ Steinweg makes premium grand pianos and upright pianos . 
 Grotrian @-@ Steinweg 's history dates back to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg ( later known as Henry Steinway after his emigration to the US where he founded Steinway & Sons ) . In 1856 , Friedrich Grotrian became a partner ; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory and the right to market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand . Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company to become one of the finest piano manufacturers in Germany . Grotrian @-@ Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists , and they received accolades at the World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago . Grotrian @-@ Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall , and established sales rooms in a half dozen major cities in Germany , and by 1920 , in London as well . At its peak in the late 1920s , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg employed 1 @,@ 000 people and made 3 @,@ 000 pianos per year . 
 Economic depression in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian @-@ Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely . The family rebuilt the factory and re @-@ established its reputation for quality work . In the 1950s , an annual piano @-@ playing competition was founded by the company , to identify promising young piano students . 
 Grotrian @-@ Steinweg sought to expand into the US in the mid @-@ 1960s . Steinway & Sons sued to prevent them from using the Steinweg name , resulting in a 1975 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit . The case set a precedent in describing " initial interest confusion " : that the brand Grotrian @-@ Steinweg could cause piano buyers to temporarily confuse its brand with the brand Steinway & Sons . The court ordered Grotrian @-@ Steinweg to stop selling pianos in the US under the " Steinweg " name . Afterward , the company formed a business entity named Grotrian Piano Company , through which it sells pianos in North America . 
 = = 19th century = = 
 On 13 January 1803 , Georg Friedrich Karl Grotrian , called Friedrich , was born in <unk> , Germany . He settled in Moscow to sell pianos , beginning around 1830 . He joined a partnership in a small piano making firm based in Saint Petersburg , and included these pianos among the various instruments he sold in his successful Moscow music shop . 
 In Germany , Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg ( 1797 – 1871 ) started making pianos in 1835 from his house in <unk> at the edge of the Harz mountains ; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments . Among the pianos that Steinweg produced in his first year was a square piano designed by and built for <unk> Grotrian . ( This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum . ) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839 , two of them square pianos , but his grand piano brought wide notice . In 1850 , H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City , leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg ( 1825 – 1889 ) who stayed behind to run it under his own name . Meanwhile , in New York City , the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons . 
 Soon after taking ownership of his father 's old factory , C.F. Theodor Steinweg moved it to Wolfenbüttel near Braunschweig . Here he met Friedrich Grotrian who was traveling for business . In 1854 , Friedrich Grotrian received the Müller @-@ <unk> pharmacy as an inheritance from an uncle , so he moved back to Germany to manage it . He joined C.F. Theodor Steinweg 's piano company as a partner in 1856 . 
 In 1857 , C.F. Theodor Steinweg and Grotrian moved the piano factory to Braunschweig , setting up shop in a former mayor 's mansion at 48 <unk> Street in the inner , medieval part of the city . The company employed about 25 people at this time . Friedrich Grotrian died on 11 December 1860 , leaving his share of the company to his son Wilhelm ( 1843 – 1917 ) . In 1865 , C.F. Theodor Steinweg was needed by his family in New York to help manage Steinway & Sons after his brothers Henry and Charles died . Wilhelm Grotrian joined with two of the piano workmen — Adolph Helfferich and <unk> Schulz — to buy out C.F. Theodor Steinweg 's share of the building . The new partnership paid for the right to use the trademark " C.F. Th . Steinweg <unk> . " , meaning " successor to C.F. Theodor Steinweg " . ( <unk> is an abbreviation for <unk> which is German for successor . ) The company name became " Grotrian , Helfferich , Schulz , Th . Steinweg <unk> . " Wilhelm Grotrian raised two sons in the 1870s : Wilhelm " Willi " Grotrian Jr ( 1868 – 1931 ) and Kurt Grotrian ( 1870 – 1929 ) . 
 In New York City , C.F. Theodor Steinweg ( H.E. Steinweg 's son ) changed his name to C.F. Theodore Steinway , and served as the leader and chief technician of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years . He did not like living in the US , so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed . In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg , competing with his father 's old firm , now called Grotrian @-@ Steinweg , in making pianos for European customers . After establishing the business , Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years . He died in 1889 , leaving his collection of pianos to the city 's museum . The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian @-@ Steinweg — both companies were known for producing premium pianos . 
 In the 1880s , Willi Grotrian studied piano making with Wm . Knabe & Co. in Baltimore , Maryland , and with Pleyel , Wolff et Cie in Paris , France . Kurt Grotrian also studied with piano makers in other countries . Their father Wilhelm Grotrian Sr took Willi with him to Chicago in 1893 ; there , at the World 's Columbian Exposition , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg won an award for fine quality . Pianists Eugen d 'Albert , Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Clara Schumann expressed a preference for Grotrian @-@ Steinweg pianos . Grotrian @-@ Steinweg was counted among the top German piano manufacturers along with Bechstein , <unk> , <unk> , Ibach , Lipp and the Hamburg division of Steinway . In 1895 , Wilhelm Grotrian Sr made his two sons partners in the business . He told them : " Lads , build good pianos and the rest will take care of itself . " Willi Grotrian methodically set about to improve the systems and standards by which the Grotrian @-@ Steinweg company produced pianos . The Grotrian @-@ Steinweg brand was well known for being of the highest quality : the company was named purveyor to some 30 " Kaisers , Kings and royal houses " . The owners Franz Wilhelm Grotrian , Willi Grotrian and Kurt Grotrian were awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria @-@ Hungary . 
 = = 20th century = = 
 In Braunschweig , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg grew to a workforce of 550 by 1913 , producing about 1 @,@ 600 pianos annually . The Grotrian @-@ Steinweg Orchestra was active in Leipzig under the baton of young conductor Hermann <unk> . Grotrian @-@ dedicated <unk> were operating in Leipzig , Hanover , Königsberg , Düsseldorf and Berlin . 
 During World War I , Kurt Grotrian left the factory to serve in the German Army . He was soon wounded and taken prisoner of war . The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917 . Willi Grotrian , his son , led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and in orders for pianos . After the war , the company resumed as before , expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under the brand name Grotrian @-@ Steinweg . The workforce increased to 1 @,@ 000 . In 1924 , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg built an unusual piano for microtonal music composer Ivan <unk> . The piano had three manuals , and strings tuned a quarter tone apart . By 1927 , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg was making about 3 @,@ 000 pianos annually . This number dropped significantly in the 1930s during the Great Depression ; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931 , and the workforce was reduced to less than 200 . 
 Kurt Grotrian had become seriously ill in the late 1920s , and in 1928 he made his two sons Erwin ( 1899 – 1990 ) and Helmut ( 1900 – 1977 ) shareholders . In 1929 , Kurt Grotrian died of complications from his old war wound . Willi Grotrian died in 1931 . 
 In World War II , the Grotrian @-@ Steinweg factory ( like many others in Germany ) was ordered to switch to fabricating parts for aircraft . The factory was destroyed in 1944 by the bombing of Braunschweig , as was the founder 's mansion in the center of town . Afterward , Erwin and Helmut rebuilt the factory . By 1948 , production had resumed ; composer and pianist Wilhelm Kempff went on record as an admirer of the " sonority and exquisite execution " of the post @-@ war work . 
 = = = Piano performance competition = = = 
 In 1954 , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg initiated a piano @-@ playing competition known as Grotrian @-@ Steinweg <unk> , featuring young pianists from music schools . The competition took place in the Braunschweig location of the <unk> department store , with audience applause used as the gauge to determine the winner . In 1968 , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg entered into talks with the German National Music Council and the Hannover University of Music to increase the scale of the competition . It increased in odd years to encompass a national and international scope . Pianists such as Ragna Schirmer and Lars Vogt gained notice as winners of the competition . 
 = = = Trademark conflict = = = 
 The first trademark friction between the two piano manufacturers occurred in 1895 when Steinway & Sons sued to stop Grotrian @-@ Steinweg from using the name " Steinweg " on its pianos . Steinway lost the case , but in January 1919 , Willi and Kurt Grotrian decided to change the family surname to Grotrian @-@ Steinweg in order to protect the trademark of the family business , in the hope of preventing further lawsuits . In 1925 , the company established a sales presence in the US as a Delaware corporation called Grotrian @-@ Steinweg Company . Over the next three years , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg sold only 15 pianos in the US , in addition to a few sold by an independent dealer in New York City . Upon discovering the sales in 1928 , Steinway & Sons complained to the distributor and to Grotrian @-@ Steinweg , but in 1929 Grotrian @-@ Steinweg sent 47 pianos to the US . A family representative of Steinway went to Germany to discuss the problem directly with the Grotrian @-@ Steinweg family . Arriving at a private agreement , the two family leaders smoked a " peace cigar " and Grotrian @-@ Steinweg subsequently stopped using the names " Steinweg " and " Grotrian @-@ Steinweg " in the US . In 1930 the Delaware corporation was dissolved , and in the next three years exports from Grotrian @-@ Steinweg to the US decreased then halted completely . In 1950 , Grotrian @-@ Steinweg relinquished its old 1926 trademark application , which had never been published . 
 In 1961 , Knut Grotrian @-@ Steinweg ( b . 1935 ) joined the company . In 1966 , the company formed a contract with Wurlitzer to sell Grotrian @-@ Steinweg pianos in the US , and the Steinway company brought suit in New York . The case lasted nine years , winding its way through trial courts and district courts , presenting the litigants ' counterclaims and appeals . In 1975 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard the arguments in Grotrian , Helfferich , Schulz , Th . Steinweg <unk> v. <unk> & Sons . Grotrian @-@ Steinweg , the plaintiff , argued that their brand was long established , predating Steinway 's in Germany . Steinway & Sons , defendant , <unk> that their brand , well known and strongly positive in the US , was weakened by consumers ' confusion as to whether the pianos were related . The court affirmed the lower court 's ruling in favor of the defendant that piano buyers would be misled in their " initial interest " in the two piano brands ; " a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian @-@ Steinweg is at least as good , if not better , than a Steinway . " The court felt that Grotrian @-@ Steinweg — a brand not very well known in the US — was unfairly given an extra measure of credibility based on the strong reputation that Steinway & Sons had built up . Even though premium piano buyers were understood to be sophisticated and knowledgeable , and would not be confused at the time of purchase about which manufacturer produced which piano , the court held that a " subliminal confusion " might be present at the initial attraction to the Grotrian @-@ Steinweg brand . The company was forbidden to sell pianos in the US under the name " Steinweg " after 1977 . Accordingly , in 1976 Grotrian @-@ Steinweg formed a subsidiary brand for selling pianos in North America : Grotrian Piano Company GmbH . 
 The case was the first instance of a court defining the concept now known as " initial interest confusion " . District Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon wrote : " Misled into an initial interest , a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian @-@ Steinweg is at least as good , if not better , than a Steinway . " MacMahon 's idea about the " initial interest " confusion was confirmed by Appeals Court Judge William H. Timbers , writing , " such initial confusion works an injury to Steinway . " 
 The English @-@ language section of Grotrian 's website does not have any reference to the surname " Steinweg " , unlike the French- , German- and Russian @-@ language versions . This is likely a result of the lawsuit and a wish to minimize liability .

 In 1974 , the Grotrian @-@ Steinweg family built a new factory in northwest Braunschweig on Grotrian @-@ Steinweg Street , very near <unk> 2 , a major east – west highway . After Helmut and Erwin Grotrian @-@ Steinweg supervised the construction they retired , leaving Helmut 's son Knut in charge . This factory is the current location of Grotrian @-@ Steinweg production . In 1999 , Knut Grotrian @-@ Steinweg stepped down from active supervision of the company , and put day @-@ to @-@ day control in the hands of Burkhard Stein , an industrial manager and piano builder . As of 2012 , the Grotrian @-@ Steinweg company is owned by the daughters of Erwin Grotrian , with sixth @-@ generation Jobst Grotrian ( b . 1969 ) , Knut 's son , a shareholder . Annually , the company produces about 500 upright pianos in six sizes and 100 grand pianos in five sizes . Some 20 concert grands are made per year — each one requiring 8 months of manufacture .

 = Ramones = 
 The Ramones were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills , Queens , in 1974 . They are often cited as the first band to define the punk rock sound . Despite achieving only limited commercial success , the band was a major influence on the 1970s punk movement in both the United States and United Kingdom . 
 All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname " Ramone " , although none of them were related . They performed 2 @,@ 263 concerts , touring virtually nonstop for 22 years . In 1996 , after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival , the band played a farewell concert and disbanded . By 2014 , all four of the band 's original members — lead singer Joey Ramone ( 1951 – 2001 ) , guitarist Johnny Ramone ( 1948 – 2004 ) , bassist Dee Dee Ramone ( 1951 – 2002 ) and drummer Tommy Ramone ( 1949 – 2014 ) — had died . 
 Recognition of the band 's importance built over the years , and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all @-@ time great rock music , such as the Rolling Stone list of the " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " and VH1 's " 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock " . In 2002 , the Ramones were ranked the second @-@ greatest band of all time by Spin magazine , trailing only the Beatles . On March 18 , 2002 , the original four members and Tommy 's replacement on drums , Marky Ramone , were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . In 2011 , the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .

 = = = Formation : 1974 – 75 = = = 
 The original members of the band met in and around the middle @-@ class neighborhood of Forest Hills in the New York City borough of Queens . John Cummings and Thomas Erdelyi had both been in a high @-@ school garage band from 1965 to 1967 known as the Tangerine Puppets . They became friends with Douglas Colvin , who had recently moved to the area from Germany , and Jeffrey Hyman , who was the initial lead singer of the glam rock band Sniper , founded in 1972 . 
 The Ramones began taking shape in early 1974 when Cummings and Colvin invited Hyman to join them in a band . The initial line @-@ up featured Colvin on lead vocals , rhythm and bass guitars , Cummings on lead guitar , and Hyman on drums . Hyman soon switched from drums to vocals . Colvin was the first to adopt the name " Ramone " , calling himself Dee Dee Ramone . He was inspired by Paul McCartney 's use of the pseudonym Paul Ramon during his Silver Beetles days . Dee Dee convinced the other members to take on the name and came up with the idea of calling the band the Ramones . Hyman and Cummings became Joey and Johnny Ramone , respectively . 
 A friend of the band , Monte A. Melnick ( later their tour manager ) , helped to arrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan 's Performance Studios , where he worked . Johnny 's former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager . Soon after the band was formed , Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously ; with Erdelyi 's encouragement , Joey became the band 's new lead singer . Dee Dee would continue , however , to count off each song 's tempo with his signature rapid @-@ fire shout of " 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 ! " Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer . While auditioning prospective replacements , Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs . It became apparent that he was able to perform the group 's music better than anyone else , and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone . 
 The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30 , 1974 , at Performance Studios . The songs they played were very fast and very short ; most clocked in at under two minutes . Around this time , a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan — Max 's Kansas City and , more famously , CBGB ( usually referred to as CBGB 's ) . The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16 , 1974 . Legs McNeil , who cofounded Punk magazine the following year , later described the impact of that performance : " They were all wearing these black leather jackets . And they counted off this song ... and it was just this wall of noise ... They looked so striking . These guys were not hippies . This was something completely new . " 
 The band swiftly became regulars at the club , playing there seventy @-@ four times by the end of the year . After garnering considerable attention for their performances — which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end — the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by Seymour Stein of Sire Records . After they were seen by Sire A & R man Craig Leon he brought the band to the attention of the label . Stein 's wife , Linda Stein , saw the band play at Mothers ; she would later co @-@ manage them along with Danny Fields . By this time , the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as " punk " . The group 's unusual frontman had a lot to do with their impact . As Dee Dee explained , " All the other singers [ in New York ] were copying David Johansen [ of the New York Dolls ] , who was copying Mick Jagger ... But Joey was unique , totally unique . "

 The Ramones recorded their debut album , Ramones , in April 1976 . Of the fourteen songs on the album , the longest , " I Don 't Wanna Go Down to the Basement " , barely surpassed two and a half minutes . While the songwriting credits were shared by the entire band , Dee Dee was the primary writer . The Ramones album was produced by Sire 's Craig Leon , with Tommy as associate producer , on an extremely low budget of about $ 6 @,@ 400 and released in April . The now iconic front cover photograph of the band was taken by Roberta Bayley , a photographer for Punk magazine . Punk , which was largely responsible for codifying the term for the scene emerging around CBGB , ran a cover story on the Ramones in its third issue , the same month as the record 's release . 
 The Ramones ' debut LP was greeted by rock critics with glowing reviews . The Village Voice 's Robert Christgau wrote , " I love this record — love it — even though I know these boys flirt with images of brutality ( Nazi especially ) ... For me , it blows everything else off the radio " . In Rolling Stone , Paul Nelson described it as " constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days . " <unk> the band as " authentic American primitives whose work has to be heard to be understood " , he declared , " It is time popular music followed the other arts in honoring its primitives . " Newsday 's Wayne Robbins simply anointed the Ramones as " the best young rock ' n ' roll band in the known universe . " 
 However , despite Sire 's high hopes for it , Ramones was not a commercial success , reaching only number 111 on the Billboard album chart . The two singles issued from the album , " Blitzkrieg Bop " and " I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend " , failed to chart . At the band 's first major performance outside of New York , a June date in Youngstown , Ohio , approximately ten people showed up . It wasn 't until they made a brief tour of England that they began to see the fruits of their labor ; a performance at the Roundhouse in London on 4 July 1976 , second @-@ billed to the Flamin ' Groovies , organized by Linda Stein , was a resounding success . T @-@ Rex leader Marc Bolan was in attendance at the Roundhouse show and was invited on stage . Their Roundhouse appearance and a club date the following night — where the band met members of the Sex Pistols and the Clash — helped galvanize the burgeoning UK punk rock scene . The Flamin ' Groovies / Ramones double bill was successfully reprised at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles the following month , fueling the punk scene there as well . The Ramones were becoming an increasingly popular live act — a Toronto performance in September energized yet another growing punk scene . 
 Their next two albums , Leave Home and Rocket to Russia , were released in 1977 . Both were produced by Tommy and Tony Bongiovi , the second cousin of Jon Bon Jovi . Leave Home met with even less chart success than Ramones , though it did include " Pinhead " , which became one of the band 's signature songs with its chanted refrain of " Gabba <unk> hey ! " Leave Home also included a fast @-@ paced cover of the oldie " California Sun " , written by Henry Glover & Morris Levy , and originally recorded by Joe Jones . Rocket to Russia was the band 's highest @-@ charting album to date , reaching number 49 on the Billboard 200 . In Rolling Stone , critic Dave Marsh called it " the best American rock & roll of the year " . The album also featured the first Ramones single to enter the Billboard charts ( albeit only as high as number 81 ) : " Sheena Is a Punk Rocker " . The follow @-@ up single , " Rockaway Beach " , reached number 66 — the highest any Ramones single would ever reach in America . On December 31 , 1977 the Ramones recorded It 's Alive , a live concert double album , at the Rainbow Theatre , London , which was released in April 1979 ( the title is a reference to the 1974 horror film of the same name ) .

 Tommy , tired of touring , left the band in early 1978 . He continued as the Ramones ' record producer under his birth name of Erdelyi . His position as drummer was filled by Marc Bell , who had been a member of the early 1970s hard rock band Dust , Wayne County and the Backstreet Boys , and the pioneering punk group Richard Hell & the Voidoids . Bell became Marky Ramone . Later that year , the band released their fourth studio album , and first with Marky , Road to Ruin . The album , co @-@ produced by Tommy with Ed Stasium , included some new sounds such as acoustic guitar , several ballads , and the band 's first two recorded songs longer than three minutes . It failed to reach the Billboard Top 100 . However , " I Wanna Be Sedated " , which appeared both on the album and as a single , would become one of the band 's best @-@ known songs . The artwork on the album 's cover was done by Punk magazine cofounder John Holmstrom . 
 After the band 's movie debut in Roger Corman 's Rock ' n ' Roll High School ( 1979 ) , renowned producer Phil Spector became interested in the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century . During the recording sessions in Los Angeles , Spector held Johnny at gunpoint , forcing him to repeatedly play a riff . Though it was to be the highest @-@ charting album in the band 's history — reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain — Johnny made clear that he favored the band 's more aggressive punk material : " End of the Century was just watered @-@ down Ramones . It 's not the real Ramones . " This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw , Loud , Fast Ramones : Their Toughest Hits . Despite these reservations , Johnny did concede that some of Spector 's work with the band had merit , saying " It really worked when he got to a slower song like ' Danny Says ' — the production really worked tremendously . ' Rock ' N ' Roll Radio ' is really good . For the harder stuff , it didn 't work as well . " The syrupy , string @-@ laden Ronettes cover " Baby , I Love You " released as a single , became the band 's biggest hit in Great Britain , reaching number 8 on the charts . 
 Pleasant Dreams , the band 's sixth album , was released in 1981 . It continued the trend established by End of the Century , taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records . As described by Trouser Press , the album , produced by Graham Gouldman of UK pop act 10cc , moved the Ramones " away from their pioneering minimalism into heavy metal territory " . Johnny would contend in retrospect that this direction was a record company decision , a continued futile attempt to get airplay on American radio . While Pleasant Dreams reached number 58 on the U.S. chart , its two singles failed to register at all . 
 Subterranean Jungle , produced by Ritchie Cordell and Glen <unk> , was released in 1983 . According to Trouser Press , it brought the band " back to where they once belonged : junky ' 60s pop adjusted for current tastes " , which among other things meant " easing off the breakneck rhythm that was once Ramones dogma . " Billy Rogers , who had performed with Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers , played drums on the album 's second single , a cover of the Chambers Brothers ' " Time Has Come Today " . Subterranean Jungle peaked at number 83 in the United States — it would be the last album by the band to crack the Billboard Top 100 . In 2002 , Rhino Records released a new version of it with seven bonus tracks .

 After the release of Subterranean Jungle , Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism . He was replaced by Richard Reinhardt , who adopted the name Richie Ramone . Joey Ramone remarked that " [ Richie ] saved the band as far as I 'm concerned . He 's the greatest thing to happen to the Ramones . He put the spirit back in the band . " Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs , including " ( You ) Can 't Say Anything Nice " as well as the unreleased " Elevator Operator " . Joey Ramone commented , " Richie 's very talented and he 's very diverse ... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks , he sings lead , and he sings with Dee Dee 's stuff . In the past , it was always just me singing for the most part . " Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit " Somebody Put Something in My Drink " as well as " Smash You " , " Humankind " , " I 'm Not Jesus " , " I Know Better Now " and " ( You ) Can 't Say Anything Nice " . Joey Ramone supported Richie 's songwriting contributions : " I encouraged Richie to write songs . I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group , because we never let anybody else write our songs . " Richie 's composition , " Somebody Put Something in My Drink " , remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud , Fast Ramones : Their Toughest Hits . The eight song bonus disc , The Ramones Smash You : Live ' 85 , is also named after Richie 's composition " Smash You " . 
 The first album the Ramones recorded with Richie was Too Tough to Die in 1984 , with Tommy Erdelyi and Ed Stasium returning as producers . The album marked a shift to something like the band 's original sound . In the description of Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine , the " rhythms are back up to jackhammer speed and the songs are down to short , terse statements . " 
 The band 's main release of 1985 was the British single " Bonzo Goes to Bitburg " ; though it was available in the United States only as an import , it was played widely on American college radio . The song was written , primarily by Joey , in protest of Ronald Reagan 's visit to a German military cemetery , which included graves of Waffen SS soldiers . Retitled " My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down ( Bonzo Goes to Bitburg ) " , the song appeared on the band 's ninth studio album , Animal Boy ( 1986 ) . Produced by Jean Beauvoir , formerly a member of the <unk> , the album was characterized by a Rolling Stone reviewer as " nonstop primal fuzz pop " . Making it his pick for " album of the week " , New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote that the Ramones " speak up for outcasts and disturbed individuals " . 
 The following year the band recorded their last album with Richie , Halfway to Sanity , produced by Daniel Rey . Richie left in August 1987 , upset that after being in the band for five years , the other members would still not give him a share of the money they made selling T @-@ shirts . Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie , which was disbanded at the time . According to Johnny , the performances with Burke — who adopted the name Elvis Ramone — were a disaster . He was fired after two performances because his drumming could not keep up with the rest of the band . Marky , now clean and sober , returned . 
 Dee Dee left the band as they began recording their eleventh studio album , 1989 's Brain Drain ; the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators ' Andy <unk> ; co @-@ produced by Beauvoir , Rey , and Bill Laswell . He was replaced by Christopher Joseph Ward ( C.J. Ramone ) , who performed with the band until they disbanded . Dee Dee initially pursued a brief career as a rapper under the name Dee Dee King . He quickly returned to punk rock and formed several bands , in much the same vein as the Ramones , for whom he also continued to write songs . 
 = = = Final years : 1990 – 96 = = = 
 After more than a decade and a half at Sire Records , the Ramones moved to a new label , Radioactive Records . Their first album for the label was 1992 's Mondo Bizarro , which reunited them with producer Ed Stasium . Acid Eaters , consisting entirely of cover songs , came out the following year . In 1993 the Ramones were featured in the animated television series The Simpsons , providing music and voices for animated versions of themselves in the episode " Rosebud " . Executive producer David Mirkin described the Ramones as " gigantic , obsessive Simpsons fans . " 
 In 1995 the Ramones released ¡ Adios Amigos ! , their fourteenth studio album , and announced that they planned to disband if it was not successful . Its sales were unremarkable , garnering it just two weeks on the lower end of the Billboard chart . The band spent late 1995 on what was promoted as a farewell tour . However , they accepted an offer to appear in the sixth Lollapalooza festival , which toured around the United States during the following summer . After the Lollapalooza tour 's conclusion , the Ramones played their final show on August 6 , 1996 , at the Palace in Hollywood . A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD as We 're Outta Here ! In addition to a reappearance by Dee Dee , the show featured several guests including Motörhead 's Lemmy , Pearl Jam 's Eddie Vedder , Soundgarden 's Chris Cornell , and Rancid 's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen .

 On July 20 , 1999 Dee Dee , Johnny , Joey , Tommy , Marky , and C.J. appeared together at the Virgin Megastore in New York City for an autograph signing . This was the last occasion on which the original four members of the group appeared together . Joey , who had been diagnosed with lymphoma in 1995 , died of the illness on 15 April 2001 , in New York . 
 Session drummer Billy Rogers , who performed on " Time Has Come Today " from Subterranean Jungle , died from complications due to pneumonia on August 7 , 2001 . 
 On March 18 , 2002 the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , which specifically named Dee Dee , Johnny , Joey , Tommy , and Marky . At the ceremony , the surviving inductees spoke on behalf of the band . Johnny spoke first , thanking the band 's fans and blessing George W. Bush and his presidency . Tommy spoke next , saying how honored the band felt , but how much it would have meant for Joey . Dee Dee humorously congratulated and thanked himself , while Marky thanked Tommy for influencing his drum style . Green Day played " Teenage Lobotomy " , " Rockaway Beach " , and " Blitzkrieg Bop " as a tribute , demonstrating the Ramones ' continuing influence on later rock musicians . The ceremony was one of Dee Dee 's last public appearances ; on 5 June 2002 , two months later , he was found at his Hollywood home , dead from a heroin overdose . 
 On November 30 , 2003 New York City unveiled a sign designating East 2nd Street at the corner of Bowery as Joey Ramone Place . The singer lived on East 2nd for a time , and the sign is near the former Bowery site of CBGB . The documentary film End of the Century : The Story of the Ramones came out in 2004 . Johnny , who had been privately suffering from prostate cancer , died on 15 September 2004 in Los Angeles , shortly after the film 's release . On the same day as Johnny 's death , the world 's first Ramones Museum opened its doors to the public . Located in Berlin , Germany , the museum features more than 300 items of memorabilia , including a pair of stage @-@ worn jeans from Johnny , a stage @-@ worn glove from Joey , Marky 's sneakers , and C.J. ' s stage @-@ worn bass strap . 
 The Ramones were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2007 . That October saw the release of a DVD set containing concert footage of the band : It 's Alive 1974 @-@ 1996 includes 118 songs from 33 performances over the span of the group 's career . In February 2011 the group was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . Drummers Tommy , Marky , and Richie attended the ceremony . Marky declared , " This is amazing . I never expected this . I 'm sure Johnny , Joey , and Dee Dee would never have expected this . " Richie noted that it was the first time ever that all three drummers were under the same roof , and mused that he couldn 't " help thinking that [ Joey ] is watching us right now with a little smile on his face behind his rose @-@ colored glasses . " 
 Arturo Vega , creative director from their formation in 1974 until their disbanding in 1996 and often considered the fifth Ramone , died on June 8 , 2013 , at the age of 65 . The final original member , Tommy Ramone , died on July 11 , 2014 after a battle with bile duct cancer . 
 = = Conflicts between members = = 
 There were strong tensions between Joey and Johnny , which colored much of the Ramones ' career . The pair were politically antagonistic , Joey being a liberal and Johnny a conservative . Their personalities also clashed : Johnny , who spent two years in military school , lived by a strict code of self @-@ discipline , while Joey struggled with obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder and alcoholism . In the early 1980s , Johnny " stole " Joey 's girlfriend Linda Daniele ( who later became Linda Ramone ) , whom he later married . As a consequence , despite performing together for years afterward , Joey and Johnny stopped speaking to each other . Johnny did not call Joey before the latter 's death in 2001 , but said in the documentary End of the Century that he was depressed for " the whole week " after the singer died . 
 Despite this central conflict , Dee Dee 's bipolar disorder and repeated relapses into drug addiction also caused significant strains . Tommy left the band partly in reaction to being " physically threatened by Johnny , treated with contempt by Dee Dee , and all but ignored by Joey " . As new members joined over the years payment methods and image representation became matters of serious dispute . In 1997 , Marky and Joey got into a fight about their respective drinking habits on the Howard Stern radio show . 
 = = Style = = 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 The Ramones ' loud , fast , straightforward musical style was influenced by pop music that the band members grew up listening to in the 1950s and 1960s , including classic rock groups such as the Beach Boys , the Who , the Beatles , the Kinks , Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones ; bubblegum acts like the 1910 <unk> Company and Ohio Express ; and girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri @-@ Las . They also drew on the harder rock sound of the MC5 , Black Sabbath , the Stooges and the New York Dolls , both now known as seminal protopunk bands . The Ramones ' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced , often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s . " We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard , " Joey once explained . " In 1974 everything was tenth @-@ generation Elton John , or overproduced , or just junk . Everything was long jams , long guitar solos ... . We missed music like it used to be . " Ira Robbins and Scott Isler of Trouser Press describe the result : 
 With just four chords and one manic tempo , New York 's Ramones blasted open the clogged arteries of mid- ' 70s rock , reanimating the music . Their genius was to recapture the short / simple aesthetic from which pop had strayed , adding a caustic sense of trash @-@ culture humor and minimalist rhythm guitar sound . 
 As leaders in the punk rock scene , the Ramones ' music has usually been identified with that label , while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop . In the 1980s , the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory , as can be heard on Too Tough to Die . 
 On stage , the band adopted a focused approach directly intended to increase the audience 's concert experience . Johnny 's instructions to C.J. when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the audience , to stand with the bass slung low between spread legs , and to walk forward to the front of stage at the same time as he did . Johnny was not a fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer , amplifier , or other band members . 
 = = = Visual imagery = = = 
 The Ramones ' art and visual imagery complemented the themes of their music and performance . The band members adopted a uniform look of long hair , leather jackets , T @-@ shirts , torn jeans , and sneakers . This fashion emphasized minimalism , which was a powerful influence on the New York punk scene of the 1970s and reflected the band 's short , simple songs . Tommy Ramone recalled that , both musically and visually , " we were influenced by comic books , movies , the Andy Warhol scene , and avant @-@ garde films . I was a big Mad Magazine fan myself . " 
 The band 's logo was created by New York City artist Arturo Vega together with the Ramones . Vega was a longtime friend who had allowed Joey and Dee Dee to move into his loft . Vega produced the band 's T @-@ shirts , their main source of income , basing most of the images on a black @-@ and @-@ white self @-@ portrait photograph he had taken of his American bald eagle belt buckle which had appeared on the back sleeve of the Ramones ' first album . He was inspired to create the band 's logo after a trip to Washington , D.C. : 
 I saw them as the ultimate all @-@ American band . To me , they reflected the American character in general — an almost childish innocent aggression ... . I thought , ' The Great Seal of the President of the United States ' would be perfect for the Ramones , with the eagle holding arrows — to symbolize strength and the aggression that would be used against whomever dares to attack us — and an olive branch , offered to those who want to be friendly . But we decided to change it a little bit . Instead of the olive branch , we had an apple tree branch , since the Ramones were American as apple pie . And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic , we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the [ Great Seal ] ' s arrows . 
 The scroll in the eagle 's beak originally read " Look out below " , but this was soon changed to " Hey ho let 's go " after the opening lyrics of the band 's first single , " Blitzkrieg Bop " . The arrowheads on the shield came from a design on a polyester shirt Vega had bought . The name " Ramones " was spelled out in block capitals above the logo using plastic stick @-@ on letters . Where the presidential emblem read " Seal of the President of the United States " clockwise in the border around the eagle , Vega instead placed the pseudonyms of the four band members : Johnny , Joey , Dee Dee , and Tommy . Over the years the names in the border would change as the band 's line @-@ up fluctuated . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of popular music . Music historian Jon Savage writes of their debut album that " it remains one of the few records that changed pop forever . " As described by Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine , " The band 's first four albums set the blueprint for punk , especially American punk and hardcore , for the next two decades . " Trouser Press 's Robbins and Isler similarly wrote that the Ramones " not only spearheaded the original new wave / punk movement , but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands " . Punk journalist Phil Strongman writes , " In purely musical terms , the Ramones , in attempting to re @-@ create the excitement of pre @-@ Dolby rock , were to cast a huge shadow — they had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future . " Writing for Slate in 2001 , Douglas Wolk described the Ramones as " easily the most influential group of the last 30 years . " 
 The Ramones ' debut album had an outsized effect relative to its modest sales . According to Generation X bassist Tony James , " Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album . Punk rock — that rama @-@ lama super fast stuff — is totally down to the Ramones . Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then . " The Ramones ' two July 1976 shows , like their debut album , are seen as having a significant impact on the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts — as one observer put it , " instantly nearly every band speeded up " . The Ramones ' first British concert , at London 's Roundhouse concert hall , was held on 4 July 1976 , the United States Bicentennial . The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening , supported by the Clash , making their public debut . The next night , members of both bands attended the Ramones ' gig at the Dingwall 's club . Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon ( which he <unk> at the Roundhouse ) : " Johnny asked him , ' What do you do ? Are you in a band ? ' Paul said , ' Well , we just rehearse . We call ourselves the Clash but we 're not good enough . ' Johnny said , ' Wait till you see us — we stink , we 're lousy , we can 't play . Just get out there and do it . ' " Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform , the Damned , played their first show two days later . The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene , Sniffin ' Glue , was named after the song " Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue " , which appeared on the debut LP . 
 Ramones concerts and recordings influenced many musicians central to the development of California punk as well , including Greg Ginn of Black Flag , Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys , Al Jourgensen of Ministry , Mike Ness of Social Distortion , Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion , and members of the Descendents . Canada 's first major punk scenes — in Toronto and in British Columbia 's Victoria and Vancouver — were also heavily influenced by the Ramones . In the late 1970s , many bands emerged with musical styles deeply indebted to the band 's . There were the Lurkers from England , the Undertones from Ireland , Teenage Head from Canada , and the Zeros and the Dickies from southern California . The seminal hardcore band Bad Brains took its name from a Ramones song . The <unk> emulated the sound of the Ramones throughout their career . Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong named his son Joey in homage to Joey Ramone , and drummer Tré Cool named his daughter Ramona . 
 New Jersey 's horror punk / hardcore punk band the Misfits ( whose bassist Jerry Only was a longtime friend of the band ) were influenced by the " Blitzkrieg " tempo of the Ramones , infusing it into their already medium @-@ fast tempo , R & B style of punk rock . 
 The Ramones also influenced musicians associated with other genres , such as heavy metal . Their influence on metal gave birth to the punk @-@ metal " fusion " genre of thrash . Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett , one of the originators of thrash guitar , has described the importance of Johnny 's rapid @-@ fire guitar playing style to his own musical development . Motörhead lead singer Lemmy , a friend of the Ramones since the late 1970s , mixed the band 's " Go Home Ann " in 1985 . The members of Motörhead later composed the song " <unk> " as a tribute , and Lemmy performed at the final Ramones concert in 1996 . In the realm of alternative rock , the song " 53rd and 3rd " lent its name to a British indie pop label cofounded by Stephen Pastel of the Scottish band the <unk> . Evan Dando of the Lemonheads , Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters , Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater , Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam ( who introduced the band members at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ) and the Strokes are among the many alternative rock and metal musicians who have credited the Ramones with inspiring them . 
 The band members were also individually influential . Johnny Ramone was named Time 's " 10 Greatest Electric @-@ Guitar Players " in 2003 . That same year , he was number 16 on the " 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time " list in Rolling Stone . 
 " We think of the Ramones as a classic , iconic band , " observed Gene Simmons . " They have one gold record to their name . They never played arenas ; couldn 't sell them out . It was a failed band . It doesn 't mean they weren 't great . It means the masses didn 't care . " 
 = = = Tribute albums = = = 
 In April 2009 , Spin writer Mark Prindle observed that the Ramones had to date " inspired a jaw @-@ dropping 48 ( at least ! ) full @-@ length tribute records . " The first Ramones tribute album featuring multiple performers was released in 1991 : Gabba Gabba Hey : A Tribute to the Ramones includes tracks by such acts as the Flesh Eaters , L7 , Mojo Nixon , and Bad Religion . In 2001 , Dee Dee made a guest appearance on one track of Ramones Maniacs , a multi @-@ artist cover of the entire Ramones Mania compilation album . The Song Ramones the Same , which came out the following year , includes performances by the Dictators , who were part of the early New York punk scene , and Wayne Kramer , guitarist for the influential protopunk band MC5 . We 're a Happy Family : A Tribute to Ramones , released in 2003 , features performers such as Rancid , Green Day , Metallica , Kiss , the Offspring , Red Hot Chili Peppers , U2 , and Rob Zombie ( who also did the album cover artwork ) . Also some other famous bands recorded tribute songs . Motörhead 's Phil Campbell tells in Jari @-@ Pekka <unk> @-@ Ramone 's book Ramones : Soundtrack Of Our Lives : " We did a cover of Rockaway Beach with me on backing vocals , which was quite enjoyable . When Johnny Ramone heard it , he refused to put it on the tribute album . Lemmy and I thought we did a good version . " 
 Punk bands such as Screeching Weasel , the <unk> , the Queers , Parasites , the Mr. T Experience , Boris the <unk> , Beatnik Termites , Tip Toppers , Jon Cougar Concentration Camp , <unk> , and <unk> have recorded cover versions of entire Ramones albums — Ramones , Leave Home , Rocket to Russia , It 's Alive , Road to Ruin , End of the Century , Pleasant Dreams , Subterranean Jungle , two versions of Too Tough to Die , and Halfway To Sanity respectively . The <unk> ' File Under Ramones consists of Ramones covers from across the band 's history . 
 Shonen Knife , an all @-@ woman trio band from Osaka , Japan , was formed in 1981 as a direct result of founder @-@ lead singer @-@ guitarist Naoko Yamano 's instant infatuation with the music of the Ramones . In 2012 , to observe the band 's 30th anniversary , Shonen Knife released Osaka Ramones , which featured thirteen Ramones songs covered by the band . 
 There are also many other tribute albums listed on Jari @-@ Pekka <unk> @-@ Ramone 's site . [ 1 ]

 = V for Vendetta ( film ) = 
 V for Vendetta is a 2006 dystopian political thriller film directed by James McTeigue and written by The Wachowski Brothers , based on the 1988 Vertigo Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd . The film is set in an alternate future where a neo @-@ fascist regime has subjugated the United Kingdom . Hugo Weaving portrays V , an anarchist freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts and Natalie Portman plays Evey , a young , working @-@ class woman caught up in V 's mission , while Stephen Rea portrays the detective leading a desperate quest to stop V. 
 The film was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. on Friday , November 4 , 2005 ( a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night ) , but was delayed ; it opened on March 17 , 2006 , to positive reviews . Alan Moore , having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works From Hell ( 2001 ) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( 2003 ) , declined to watch the film and asked not to be credited or paid royalties . 
 V for Vendetta has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government ; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs . David Lloyd stated : " The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny – and I 'm happy with people using it , it seems quite unique , an icon of popular culture being used this way . " 
 The film is the final project cinematographer Adrian Biddle worked on before his death in 2005 . The film is dedicated to his memory . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the late 2020s the world is in turmoil , with the United States fractured as a result of prolonged civil war and a pandemic of the " St. Mary 's Virus " ravaging Europe . The United Kingdom is ruled as a fascist police state by the Norsefire Party . Political opponents , immigrants , Muslims , homosexuals and other " undesirables " are imprisoned in concentration camps . On November 4 , a Guy Fawkes @-@ masked vigilante identifying himself as " V " ( Hugo Weaving ) rescues Evey Hammond ( Natalie Portman ) , an employee of the state @-@ run British Television Network ( BTN ) , from members of the " <unk> " secret police while she is out past curfew . From a rooftop , they watch his demolition of the Old Bailey criminal court building , accompanied by fireworks and the 1812 Overture . Inspector Finch ( Stephen Rea ) , Scotland Yard 's Chief of Police , is tasked with investigating V 's activities while BTN declares the incident an " emergency demolition " . V interrupts the broadcast to claim responsibility and encourage the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him on November 5 ( Guy Fawkes Night ) , outside the Houses of Parliament . During the broadcast , the police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape but is knocked unconscious . 
 V takes Evey to his home , where she is told she must remain for one year . V then kills Lewis Prothero ( Roger Allam ) , Norsefire 's chief propagandist , and Anthony Lilliman ( John Standing ) , the Bishop of London . Evey offers to help , and uses the opportunity to escape to the home of her boss , comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich ( Stephen Fry ) . In return for Evey trusting him with her safety , Gordon reveals prohibited materials including subversive paintings , an antique Quran , and homoerotic photographs . After Gordon performs a satire of the government on his show , his home is raided and Evey is captured . She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V , with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page ( Natasha Wightman ) , a former prisoner . 
 Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V 's location . When she says she would rather die , she is released and finds herself in V 's home . It turns out that V was the one who had " captured " her at Gordon 's home , and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears . The note was real , passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned . He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home . While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her , she realises she has become a stronger person . She leaves him , promising to return before November 5 . 
 Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is murdering the people who detained him . Finch searches for the true identity of V , tracing him to a bioweapons program at a detention centre for " social deviants " and political dissidents in Larkhill concentration camp . Finch meets William Rookwood , who tells him that the program , directed by then @-@ Undersecretary Adam Sutler ( John Hurt ) , resulted in the creation of the " St. Mary 's Virus " and its release in a false flag terrorist attack . The deaths of over 100 @,@ 000 people and the resulting fear enabled the Norsefire Party to win the next election and turn the country into a totalitarian state under Sutler 's rule as High Chancellor . Finch later discovers the man he met was V in disguise , and Finch initially disbelieves his story . 
 As November 5 nears , V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks and the population questions Party rule . On the eve of November 5 , Evey visits V , who shows her an explosive @-@ laden train in the abandoned London Underground , set to destroy Parliament . He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it . V meets Party Leader Creedy ( Tim Pigott @-@ Smith ) , with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler 's execution . After Creedy executes Sutler , V reneges on his deal and kills Creedy and his men . Mortally wounded , he returns to Evey and tells her he loves her before dying . 
 As Evey places V 's body aboard the train she is found by Finch . Disillusioned by the Party 's regime , Finch allows Evey to send the train . Thousands of unarmed Londoners wearing Guy Fawkes masks march towards Parliament . As Creedy and Sutler are both dead , the military receives no orders , and allows the crowd to pass . Parliament is destroyed as Finch asks Evey for V 's identity , to which she replies , " He was all of us . " 
 = = Cast = = 
 Hugo Weaving as V : 
 A charismatic and skilled freedom fighter who was the unwilling subject of experimentation by Norsefire . James Purefoy was originally cast as V , but left six weeks into filming , citing difficulties wearing the mask for the entire film . He was replaced by Weaving , who had previously worked with Joel Silver and the Wachowskis on the Matrix series . 
 Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond : 
 Director James McTeigue first met Portman on the set of Star Wars : Episode II – Attack of the Clones , where he worked as assistant director . In preparing for the role , Portman worked with <unk> Barbara <unk> in order to perform with an English accent . She also studied films such as The Weather Underground and read the autobiography of Menachem Begin . Portman received top billing for the film . Portman 's role in the film has parallels to her role as Mathilda Lando in the film Léon . According to Portman : " the relationship between V and Evey has a complication [ like ] the relationship in that film . " Portman also had her head shaved on screen during a scene where her character is tortured . 
 Stephen Rea as Eric Finch : 
 Finch is the lead inspector in the V investigation , who , during his investigation , uncovers an unspeakable government crime . When asked whether the politics attracted him to the film , Rea replied " Well , I don 't think it would be very interesting if it was just comic @-@ book stuff . The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum , and of course I was interested in the politics . Why wouldn 't I be ? " 
 John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler : 
 A former Conservative Member of Parliament and Under @-@ Secretary for Defence , Chancellor Sutler is the founder of Norsefire and is Britain 's dictator . Hurt played a contrary role in another dystopian film : Winston Smith , a victim of the state in the film adaptation of Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four . 
 Stephen Fry portrays Gordon Deitrich , a closeted homosexual and talk / comedy show host . When asked in an interview what he liked about the role , Fry replied " Being beaten up ! I hadn 't been beaten up in a movie before and I was very excited by the idea of being clubbed to death . " 
 Also included in the cast are Tim Pigott @-@ Smith as Peter Creedy , Norsefire 's Party leader and the head of Britain 's secret police ( the " Finger " ) ; Rupert Graves as Dominic Stone , Inspector Finch 's lieutenant ; Roger Allam as Lewis Prothero , a propagandist for Norsefire ; John Standing as Anthony James Lilliman , a corrupt bishop at Westminster Abbey ; and Sinéad Cusack as Dr. Delia Surridge , the former head physician at the Larkhill Detention Centre , now a coroner . Natasha Wightman portrays Valerie Page , a lesbian imprisoned for her sexuality . Imogen Poots portrays Valerie as a child .

 The filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience . According to the Los Angeles Times , " With a wealth of new , real @-@ life parallels to draw from in the areas of government surveillance , torture , fear mongering and media manipulation , not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy , you can 't really blame the filmmakers for having a field day referencing current events . " There are also references to an avian flu pandemic , as well as pervasive use of biometric identification and signal @-@ intelligence gathering and analysis by the regime . 
 Film critics , political commentators and other members of the media have also noted the film 's numerous references to events surrounding the George W. Bush administration in the United States . These include the hoods and sacks worn by the prisoners in Larkhill that have been seen as a reference to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse . The Homeland Security Advisory System and rendition are also referenced . One of the forbidden items in Gordon 's secret basement is a protest poster with a mixed U.S. – U.K. flag with a swastika and the title " Coalition of the Willing , To Power " which combines the " Coalition of the Willing " with Friedrich Nietzsche 's concept of Will to Power . 
 Despite the America @-@ specific references , the filmmakers have always referred to the film as adding dialogue to a set of issues much broader than the U.S. administration . When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on Fox News Channel , McTeigue replied , " Yes . But not just Fox . Everyone is complicit in this kind of stuff . It could just as well been the Britain 's Sky News Channel , also a part of News Corp. "

 The film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in The Matrix series . In 1988 , producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore 's works : V for Vendetta and Watchmen . After the release and relative success of Road House , writer Hilary <unk> was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little , if any , relation to the finished product , with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel , as well as the removal of much of the novel 's ambiguity , especially in regard to V 's identity . The Wachowskis were fans of V for Vendetta and in the mid @-@ 1990s , before working on The Matrix , wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel . During the post @-@ production of the second and third The Matrix films , they revisited the screenplay and offered the director 's role to James McTeigue . All three were intrigued by the original story 's themes and found them to be relevant to the current political landscape . Upon revisiting the screenplay , the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story , while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes . James McTeigue cites the film The Battle of Algiers as his principal influence in preparing to film V for Vendetta . 
 Moore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing , as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work . He ended cooperation with his publisher , DC Comics , after its corporate parent , Warner Bros. , failed to retract statements about Moore 's supposed endorsement of the film . Moore said that the script contained plot holes and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work , which was to place two political extremes ( fascism and anarchism ) against one another . He argues his work had been recast as a story about " current American neo @-@ conservatism vs. current American liberalism " . Per his wishes , Moore 's name does not appear in the film 's closing credits . Co @-@ creator and illustrator David Lloyd supports the film adaptation , commenting that the script is very good but that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book @-@ to @-@ screen adaptation . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 V for Vendetta was filmed in London , United Kingdom , and in Potsdam , Germany , at Babelsberg Studios . Much of the film was shot on sound stages and indoor sets , with location work done in Berlin for three scenes : the Norsefire rally flashback , Larkhill , and Bishop Lilliman 's bedroom . The scenes that took place in the abandoned London Underground were filmed at the disused Aldwych tube station . Filming began in early March 2005 and principal photography officially wrapped in early June 2005 . V for Vendetta is the final film shot by cinematographer Adrian Biddle , who died of a heart attack on December 7 , 2005 . 
 To film the final scene at Westminster , the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and Big Ben had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5 am . This was the first time the security @-@ sensitive area ( home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence ) had ever been closed to accommodate filming . Prime Minister ( at the time of filming ) Tony Blair 's son , Euan , worked on the film 's production and is said ( according to an interview with Stephen Fry ) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access . This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film 's content . However , the filmmakers denied Euan Blair 's involvement in the deal , stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies .

 The film was designed to have a future @-@ retro look , with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary , stagnant feel to totalitarian London . The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery , which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an undercroft . The Gallery is V 's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government . Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck , Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian , a Mildred Pierce poster , St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna , The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti . One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask . Thus , considerable effort was made to bring together lighting , acting , and Weaving 's voice to create the proper mood for the situation . Since the mask muffled Weaving 's voice , his entire dialogue was re @-@ recorded in post @-@ production . 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 The cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film , including its authenticity , Alan Moore 's reaction to it and its intended political message . The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore 's original themes . In the words of Hugo Weaving : " Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago . It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today . So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities . " Regarding the film 's controversial political content , the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society , rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think .

 The film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot , in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England . The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of November 5 , 2005 , the Plot 's 400th anniversary , with the tag line " Remember , remember the 5th of November " , taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event . However , the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to March 17 , 2006 . Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the July 7 and the failed July 21 bombing . The filmmakers have denied this , saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production . V for Vendetta had its first major premiere on February 13 at the Berlin Film Festival . It opened for general release on March 17 , 2006 in 3 @,@ 365 cinemas in the United States , the United Kingdom and six other countries .

 Ebert and Roeper gave the film a " two thumbs up " rating . Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta " almost always has something going on that is actually interesting , inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will " . Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving 's face , there was good acting and an interesting plot , adding that the film is also disturbing , with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany . Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film , calling it a " woeful , depressing failure " and stating that the " cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings ' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue . " Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a ' D ' , criticizing the film 's treatment of its political message as being " fairly dim , adolescent stuff , " as well as expressing dislike for the " barely decorated sets with television @-@ standard overlit shadow @-@ free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle . The film is a visual insult . " On Alan Moore removing his name from the project , Burns says " it 's not hard to see why , " as well as criticising Portman 's performance : " Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance . " Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film " works as a political thriller , adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any / all of the three " . He added that the film will become " a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age . " Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five , remarking that it is " a bit of a mess ... it rarely thrills or engages as a story . " 
 V for Vendetta received few awards , although at the 2007 Saturn Awards Natalie Portman won the Best Actress award . Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 73 % " Certified Fresh " approval rating . The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Long Form in 2007 . V was included on <unk> 's list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters . Empire magazine ( in 2008 ) named the film the <unk> greatest movie of all time .

 V for Vendetta deals with issues of homosexuality , criticism of religion , totalitarianism , Islamophobia and terrorism . Its controversial story line and themes have been the target of both criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups . 
 On April 17 , 2006 the New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists organised a protest against DC Comics and Time Warner , accusing it of watering down the story 's original message in favour of violence and special effects . David Graeber , an anarchist scholar and former professor at Yale University , was not upset by the film . " I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood . " However , Graeber went on to state : " Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making . That 's what is absent from Hollywood 's interpretation . " 
 Film critic Richard Roeper dismissed right @-@ wing Christian criticism of the film on the television show Ebert and Roeper , saying that V 's terrorist label is applied in the film " by someone who 's essentially Hitler , a dictator . " 
 LGBT commentators have praised the film for its positive depiction of homosexuals . Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com called the film " one of the most pro @-@ gay ever " . Warn went on to praise the central role of the character Valerie " not just because it is beautifully acted and well @-@ written , but because it is so utterly unexpected [ in a Hollywood film ] . " 
 David Walsh from the World Socialist Web Site criticises V 's actions as " <unk> , " calling the film an example of " the bankruptcy of anarcho @-@ terrorist ideology ; " Walsh writes that because the people have not played any part in the revolution , they will be unable to produce a " new , liberated society . " 
 Clay Duke , the perpetrator of the 2010 Panama City school board shootings , was reportedly obsessed with the film V for Vendetta . Prior to the shootings and his eventual suicide , Duke spray @-@ painted a red V inside a red circle , a supposed allusion to his fascination with the graphic novel . 
 The film was broadcast on China 's national TV station , China Central Television ( CCTV ) on December 16 , 2012 completely uncensored , surprising many viewers . While many believed that the government had banned the film , the State Administration of Radio , Film and Television stated that it was not aware of a ban ; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films . Liu <unk> , a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV , speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship might be loosened . 
 = = Differences between the film and graphic novel = = 
 The film 's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd 's graphic novel V for Vendetta ; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology Warrior , and then reprinted and completed by DC . Moore 's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC 's Vertigo imprint and in the United Kingdom under Titan Books . 
 There are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material . For example , the comic is set in the 1990s , while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038 : Alan Moore 's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early ' 80s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism , while the film 's story has been changed by the Wachowski Brothers to fit a modern political context . Alan Moore , however , charged that , in doing so , the story has turned into an American @-@ centric conflict between liberalism and neo @-@ conservatism , and abandons the original anarchist @-@ fascist themes . Moore states " There wasn 't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see . The fascism had been completely <unk> . I mean , I think that any references to racial purity had been excised , whereas actually , fascists are quite big on racial purity . " Furthermore , in the original story , Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity , and not to portray the fascists as caricatures , but as realistic , rounded characters . The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters , details , and plotlines from the original story . Chiefly , the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public , whereas the film introduces the " St. Mary 's virus " , a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country . 
 Many of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film . V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life . However , in the graphic novel , he is portrayed as ruthless , willing to kill anyone who gets in his way . Evey Hammond 's transformation as V 's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film . At the beginning of the film , she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her ; in the graphic novel , she starts off as an insecure , desperate young woman forced into prostitution . V and Evey 's relationship , though not as obvious in the book , ends in the film with pledges of love . In the graphic novel 's finale , she not only carries out V 's plans as she does in the film , but also clearly takes on V 's identity . In the film , Inspector Finch sympathizes with V , but , in the graphic novel , he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal 's state of mind . Gordon , a very minor character in both adaptations , is also drastically changed . In the novel , Gordon is a small @-@ time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street . The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang . In the film , however , Gordon is a well @-@ mannered colleague of Evey 's , and is later revealed to be gay . He is arrested by <unk> for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program , and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession .

As mentioned in the film , these songs are samples of the 872 blacklisted tracks on V 's Wurlitzer jukebox that V " reclaimed " from the Ministry of <unk> Materials . The climax of Tchaikovsky 's 1812 Overture appears at the end of the track " Knives and Bullets ( and Cannons too ) " . The Overture 's finale is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film . 
 Three songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the V for Vendetta soundtrack . The first was " Street Fighting Man " by the Rolling Stones . The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller 's " <unk> " . In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film , excerpts from " On Black Power " ( also in " A Declaration of Independence " ) by black nationalist leader Malcolm X , and from " Address to the Women of America " by feminist writer Gloria Steinem were added to the song . Gloria Steinem can be heard saying : " This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution . Sex and race , because they are easy and visible differences , have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends . " The final song was " Out of Sight " by <unk> . 
 Also in the film were segments from two of Antonio Carlos Jobim 's classic bossa nova songs , " The Girl From Ipanema " and " Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars " . These songs were played during the " breakfast scenes " with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together . Beethoven 's Symphony No.5 also plays an important role in the film , with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter " V " in Morse code . Gordon Deitrich 's Benny Hill @-@ styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the " Yakety Sax " theme . Inspector Finch 's alarm clock begins the morning of November 4 with the song " Long Black Train " by Richard Hawley , which contains the foreshadowing lyrics " Ride the long black train ... take me home black train . "

 The original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re @-@ released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film 's original release date of November 5 , 2005 . The film renewed interest in Alan Moore 's original story , and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States . 
 A novelisation of the film , written by Steve Moore and based on the Wachowski Brothers ' script , was published by Pocket Star on January 31 , 2006 .

 Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II : The Sith Lords is a role @-@ playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts . It is the sequel to BioWare 's Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic and was released for the Xbox on December 6 , 2004 , for Microsoft Windows on February 8 , 2005 , and for OS X and Linux on July 21 , 2015 . Like its predecessor , it is set in the Star Wars universe 4 @,@ 000 years before the events of the film Episode I : The Phantom Menace and is based on the d20 System developed by Wizards of the Coast . The game uses the Odyssey Engine , which was originally used in Knights of the Old Republic . The plot first started being written before the original Knights of the Old Republic was released , and development began in October 2003 , after BioWare offered Obsidian their Star Wars license due to being confident in their previous work . 
 Knights of the Old Republic II starts five years after the events of the first game , and follows the story of The Exile , a Jedi Knight who was exiled from the Jedi Order . During this time , the Jedi Order has been almost completely wiped out by the Sith . The game begins with the protagonist waking up from unconsciousness on a Republic cruiser . After he or she escapes with the help of their party members , they find the person who exiled them ten years ago , who sends the protagonist on a mission to seek out the remaining Jedi to fight against the Sith . 
 The game 's critical reception upon its release was generally positive ; praise was given to the story , characters and writing , which were noted to be more grey than the original Knights of the Old Republic . However , the game received criticism for being too similar to its predecessor in terms of graphics and gameplay systems . GameSpy named one of the game 's party members , Kreia , the best video game character of 2005 , and the game was included in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Knights of the Old Republic II is a role @-@ playing video game played from a third @-@ person view that features pausable real @-@ time combat . Combat and interactions with the environment and non @-@ player characters in Knights of the Old Republic II are based on the d20 System as in Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic . The game starts with a character creation screen with several choices to make , and there is also an option of letting the game do it automatically . There are 30 new Force powers , which are manifestations of the Force , in Knights of the Old Republic II . Like its predecessor , the game has several minigames , including swoop bike racing and a card game called <unk> . The interface has been streamlined from the original game and party management was made easier ; for example , the player can now switch between two selected weapon sets in the menu . As in the first game , the player can choose to align with either the light side or the dark side . Choosing dialogue options that are respectful and empathetic give the protagonist light side points , while options that are egotistic and evil result in dark side points . 
 The combat of Knights of the Old Republic II is identical to its predecessor . Several new lightsaber crystals were added to the game . Each of them is useful for a different situation . For example , one is best for enemies using blaster weapons , while another would be good for recovering from using Force powers . The player can use a variety of melee and ranged weapons , including swords and firearms . Fighting unarmed is also an option . A new addition to the game are " prestige classes " . These are add @-@ ons to the Jedi classes that were established in Knights of the Old Republic . They let the player character practice in lightsaber combat or Force powers , depending on player choice . 
 The player can travel with up to two party members at a time , which gain experience points at the same rate as the player character . Equipment and perks for party characters can be selected for different statistical effects or abilities . Players can loot corpses and various environmental objects . The protagonist also has the ability to " influence " their party members ; by doing things that impress them , the player increases their influence with them . Depending on the level of influence , party members may support the player character unconditionally or turn on the protagonist . The player can also exploit high influence by drawing party members to either the light side or the dark side .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 The game takes place five years after the events of Knights of the Old Republic and 4 @,@ 000 years before Episode I : The Phantom Menace , in a time when the Jedi have been nearly exterminated by the Sith . The player 's character , a former Jedi Knight exiled from the Jedi Order , is referred to as " The Exile " or " Jedi Exile " . Throughout the game , the Exile restores their connection to the Force while , with the help of non @-@ playable companions , sets out to stop the Sith . The player makes choices that turn the Exile to either the light side or the dark side of the Force , and travels to six planets to either help or hinder the Republic 's efforts to bring peace and stability to the galaxy . 
 New playable locations in Knights of the Old Republic II include war @-@ ravaged Telos , a Telos bunker and the orbiting Citadel Station , the port <unk> , <unk> and its jungle moon <unk> , Nar Shaddaa and Goto 's orbiting yacht , <unk> , the starships Harbinger and Ravager . Malachor V , Korriban and <unk> from the original game are revisited , which are both now with ravaged buildings and intensified problems . The Ebon Hawk , the main character 's ship in the first game , is also the player 's transportation in Knights of the Old Republic II . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The Exile 's back story reveals that the character served under Revan during the Mandalorian Wars and ordered the activation of a devastating weapon at the climactic battle over Malachor V. The deaths that ensued created such a substantial " wound " in the Force that the character was forced to sever all connections to the Force , and the Jedi Council ordered the character exiled from the Jedi Order . As the game progresses , the Jedi Exile rebuilds a connection to the Force and creates unusually strong Force Bonds with other characters and places , while unknowingly sapping Force powers . 
 Among the characters who join the Jedi Exile are Kreia , who can act as the Exile 's mentor ; pilot and former Sith assassin Atton Rand ; technician and Mandalorian War veteran Bao @-@ Dur and his droid remote ; the criminal droid G0 @-@ T0 ; and the Sith apprentice Visas Marr . T3 @-@ M4 and <unk> Ordo ( now identified as " <unk> " ) , both featured in the first game , also join the Exile 's team . Other characters join the Exile 's party under certain conditions . HK @-@ 47 , who appears in the first game , joins the quest if the Exile collects and uses the parts necessary to reactivate it . A Wookiee known as Hanharr , a bounty hunter , joins if the Exile is aligned with the dark side of the Force ; Hanharr 's competitor , Mira , joins if the Exile is light @-@ aligned or neutral . If the player 's character is male , Brianna the Handmaiden can join the player 's quest , while <unk> the Disciple joins a female Exile . 
 The game features three main antagonists : Darth Traya , a mysterious assailant who remains in the dark through most of the game ; Darth Sion , an undead Sith Lord with a murderous hatred for Jedi ; and Darth Nihilus , a Sith Lord whose physical being was destroyed due to his immense affinity to the Force . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 While hiding on the Harbinger , a Republic cruiser , the Exile is sedated by HK @-@ 50 , an assassin droid , to be delivered to a crime syndicate called the Exchange , who have put out a bounty on live Jedi . They are rescued by Kreia , with whom they form a Force Bond , and the droid T3 @-@ M4 on the Ebon Hawk , and flee the Harbinger as it is hijacked by a squad of Sith assassins . However , their ship is damaged by the Harbinger 's gunfire during escape , and they eventually arrive at the <unk> mining facility . Teaming up with smuggler Atton Rand , the group escapes to the planet Telos IV . While hiding out on Telos , they encounter Atris , a surviving member of the Jedi Council who sentenced the protagonist to exile ten years prior . After settling a dispute regarding the Exile 's past sentence , Atris forms an uneasy alliance with them , instructing them to seek out other surviving Jedi to combat the Sith . The Exile then travels to four worlds to find reclusive Jedi Masters and either begs their aid or kills them in revenge over their treatment , depending on player choice . As the Exile continues their journey , they meet several individuals that join them in their quest . 
 After finding all the Masters , the Exile travels back to <unk> and learns that the countless deaths at Malachor V resulted in the Exile unconsciously giving up their connection to the Force , which then became the teachings of the new Sith . As the Masters feared that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force , they prepare to strip the Exile of their Force connection permanently , but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution . Tracking Kreia to Telos , the Exile fights and defeats a corrupted Atris , from whom they learn that Kreia plans to destroy the Force by strengthening a massive wound that the Exile had caused ten years ago during the Mandalorian Wars ; when the Exile ordered the activation of the superweapon that ended the battle , thousands of simultaneous deaths ensued and subsequently caused a wound in the Force . Before following her to Malachor V , where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya , the Exile stops a Sith invasion of Telos , defeating one of Traya 's former apprentices , the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus . On Malachor V , the Exile is separated from their companions and fights their way through the hordes of monsters that inhabit the planet 's surface , then through the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm . On the final floor of the academy , the Exile kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet 's core . 
 The Exile defeats Traya who , before dying , delivers a prophetic vision of the future pertaining to the player 's companions and the worlds that were visited over the course of the story . Depending on the Exile 's alignment , they either order the destruction of Malachor V , escaping before it is destroyed , and travel into the Unknown Regions in search of Revan ( light side ) or remain on Malachor V as the new Dark Lord of the Sith ( dark side ) . 
 = = Development = = 
 Knights of the Old Republic II was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts . It is the sequel to BioWare 's Knights of the Old Republic . The game uses the same Odyssey Engine from the original Knights of the Old Republic . BioWare offered Obsidian the Knights of the Old Republic license due to them being familiar with Obsidian 's past work and their good relationship with them . The PC version of the game was developed along with the Xbox version , but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version , the latter received multiple bug fixes . 
 Development of the game started in October 2003 . The overview of the game 's story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released , after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts . To help him write Knights of the Old Republic II , Chris Avellone , the game 's lead designer , tried to read as much about the Star Wars universe as possible , including books , guides , modules , and graphic novels , and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration . Avellone said that Obsidian recognized one of the things that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions , and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them . 
 When Obsidian were preparing to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004 , they tried to fit as much information as they could , saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at ; however , due to the limited time frame , they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten @-@ minute presentation . During this time , none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown , so they picked three levels , and put them through a schedule to finish them on time . The demo was finished a few days before the event , and the game was presented in May 2004 . The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004 . 
 Knights of the Old Republic II uses the same d20 System as the first Knights of the Old Republic with some changes , and the level cap has also been removed . Obsidian put much work into the game 's graphics , including the appearances of non @-@ player characters , and they also increased the sizes of areas . Knights of the Old Republic II 's lead artist was Aaron Meyers ; he decided which people would join the art team after looking through " tons of applications , resumes , and demo reels " , and he said that he was pleased with the amount of people who wanted to work for Obsidian . Meyers also complained about the short deadline the development team had to deal with . Obsidian 's COO , Chris Parker , said that the schedule set for the development team was " extremely aggressive " , and that the team felt a lot of pressure because they were " making a sequel to the game of the year for 2003 " . 
 For the music , the development team felt that symphony orchestra would work best for Knights of the Old Republic II . The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey , who developed music and themes for characters and places , including the Jedi 's theme , Darth Sion 's theme and Darth Malak 's theme ( which both have many similarities with the Emperor 's theme from The Return of the Jedi ) . He also created a theme for the main character , which is heard occasionally when he or she experiences internal conflict . The 70 @-@ minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle . The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams ' main Star Wars theme that was re @-@ recorded for the prequel trilogy . 
 When looking back at Knights of the Old Republic II in a 2013 interview , Avellone said that LucasArts forced Obsidian to finish the game in a 14 to 16 months time frame that ended up in the game being in an " unfinished " state . However , Avellone said that Obsidian was at fault for this due to not cutting out enough things ; he noted that all minigames should have been removed , and also said that there were too many in @-@ engine cutscenes . Obsidian 's co @-@ founder , Feargus Urquhart , said that the game was originally going to be released in 2005 , but it was later moved up to December 2004 after E3 ; according to him , Obsidian had to choose between " get [ ting ] in trouble or get [ ting ] it done " . 
 Knights of the Old Republic II went gold on November 23 , 2004 ; it was later released on the Xbox on December 6 , 2004 , and the PC version was released on February 8 , 2005 . The game was later re @-@ released in August 2012 on the digital distribution platform , Steam , and in January 2015 on GOG.com. On July 21 , 2015 , OS X and Linux versions were released along with new support for Steam Workshop and other Steamworks features , controller input , and modern widescreen resolutions up to 5K . 
 Along with several official patches , a fan @-@ released unofficial patch by a modding community fixed around 500 remaining bugs , along with restoring most of the content that was cut from the game . There were also methods found by the community for improving compatibility on modern PC operating systems .

 Knights of the Old Republic II was met with positive reception upon its release ; on Metacritic , it has an aggregate score of 85 / 100 and 86 / 100 on the PC and Xbox versions respectively , indicating " generally favorable reviews " according to the site . IGN said that there is a bulk of pressure involved with developing the sequel to a game from a different developer which won several " Game of the Year " awards , and that Obsidian delivered . The review also said that it won 't disappoint fans of the original game and that it is mostly similar to it in terms of the model . GamePro praised both the first and second Knights of the Old Republic and said that the second game continues the series ' tradition of not fixing what is not broken . GameSpot echoed this statement , also saying that both the good things and the shortcomings from the first game are present in Knights of the Old Republic II . 
 GameSpy compared the game to The Empire Strikes Back from the original Star Wars film trilogy in that it is the best of the series in terms of story , and also said that the game has the best story in a video game since Planescape : Torment . 1UP.com wrote that Obsidian surpassed the original Knights of the Old Republic in terms of the writing , saying that the plot is more consistent , the dialogue is edgier and the moral choices are more significant . Eurogamer said that compared to the original game , Knights of the Old Republic II 's plot is " far more grey " . The review also said that planets are " better developed and paced " . GameZone wrote that the game is a " Must Buy " for people who like well @-@ written characters and story . 
 The combat was generally well @-@ received , with some reviewers noting that it is mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic . GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second , saying that it isn 't well @-@ balanced in both ; however , the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous . GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second , but that this is a good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable . IGN praised the game 's AI , saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members . GameSpy 's reviewer , on the other hand , said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic . 
 GameSpot criticized Knights of the Old Republic II 's graphics , calling them " lackluster " . GameSpy 's reviewer felt that the game 's graphics were disappointing , calling them " a little dated " and " half @-@ baked " . The reviewer further criticized the graphics for looking the same as they were in the first game of the series , saying that they could only be considered " good " during the release of that game . GameZone said that the game looks exactly the same as the original Knights of the Old Republic , and that it doesn 't compare to the majority of mainstream games released at the time . GameSpy called the music in the game " excellent " ; however , the reviewer noted that some of it is re @-@ used from the first game of the series . The GameSpy reviewer also said that while the majority of the voice @-@ acting is good , there are " a few more examples of bad voice @-@ acting " than in the first Knights of the Old Republic . GameZone said that the " top @-@ notch " voice acting complements the game 's very well @-@ written dialogue , and also praised the game 's sound effects . 
 The game was criticized for its glitches ; several players reported having problems with pathfinding bugs . 1UP.com 's reviewer condemned Knights of the Old Republic II for having the same bugs and technical issues as in the first game , saying that his party " still had a tendency to warp and skip around the map at times " , and he also criticized the pathfinding in the game . GameSpy said that the game 's bugs are " hard to forgive " , and that these issues didn 't occur in the first Knights of the Old Republic . In a different article , GameSpy said that the game is incomplete , and attributed this to its rushed deadline . 
 GameSpy called Kreia the best video game character of 2005 , saying that she was " easily the most intriguing , complicated , enigmatic , well @-@ designed and nuanced character in a video game this year " . In 2010 , the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die . 
 = Group Representation Constituency = 
 A Group Representation Constituency ( GRC ) is a type of electoral division or constituency in Singapore in which teams of candidates , instead of individual candidates , compete to be elected into Parliament as the Members of Parliament ( MPs ) for the constituency . The Government stated that the GRC scheme was primarily implemented to enshrine minority representation in Parliament : at least one of the MPs in a GRC must be a member of the Malay , Indian or another minority community of Singapore . In addition , it was economical for town councils , which manage public housing estates , to handle larger constituencies . 
 The GRC scheme came into effect on 1 June 1988 . Prior to that date , all constituencies were Single Member Constituencies ( SMCs ) . Now , the Parliamentary Elections Act ( Cap . 218 , 2008 Rev. Ed . ) ( " PEA " ) states that there must be at least eight SMCs , and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs . Within those parameters the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed but are decided by the Cabinet , taking into consideration the recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee . 
 According to the Constitution and the PEA , there must be between three and six MPs in a GRC . The precise number of MPs in each GRC is declared by the President at the Cabinet 's direction prior to a general election . For the purposes of the 2015 general election , there were 13 SMCs and 16 GRCs , and each GRC had between four and six MPs . 
 Critics disagree with the government 's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme , noting that the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five @-@ member and six @-@ member GRCs . By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians , the ruling People 's Action Party has also used GRCs as a means for bringing first @-@ time candidates into Parliament . Moreover , the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs . Furthermore , it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power , weakens the relationship between electors and MPs , and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics . 
 = = Introduction of the scheme = = 
 There are two types of electoral division or constituency in Singapore : the Single Member Constituency ( SMC ) and the Group Representation Constituency ( GRC ) . In a GRC , a number of candidates comes together to stand for elections to Parliament as a group . Each voter of a GRC casts a ballot for a team of candidates , and not for individual candidates . The GRC scheme was brought into existence on 1 June 1988 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1988 and the Parliamentary Elections ( Amendment ) Act 1988 . 
 The original stated purpose of GRCs was to guarantee a minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that there would always be a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race . Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced , First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982 . Then , Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans , who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates . He was also worried about more Singaporeans voting along racial lines , which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament . 
 He had also proposed to twin constituencies and have Members of Parliament ( MPs ) contest as a pair , one of whom had to be from a minority community . However , Malay MPs were upset that this implied they were not electable on their own merits . Feeling that the twinning of constituencies would lead to Malay MPs losing confidence and self @-@ respect , the Government dropped the proposal . 
 Therefore , the Government felt that the best way to ensure minority representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme . In addition , it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates , as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies . Subsequently , in 1991 , the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had grown too big for the MPs serving them , and , in 1996 , GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective . 
 Three proposals for minority representation in Parliament had been considered by a 1966 Constitutional Commission chaired by the Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin . The first was to have a committee of representatives of minorities that would elect three persons from amongst its members to represent minorities in Parliament . However , this was rejected as the Commission felt that it would be an inappropriate and retrogressive move in that unelected members should not be allowed to dilute the elected chamber . The second proposal , which was to have proportional representation , was also rejected on the grounds that it would intensify party politics along racial lines and eventually " perpetuate and accentuate racial differences " . This would then make it increasingly difficult , if not impossible , to achieve a single homogeneous community out of the many races that form the population of the Republic . The third proposal was to have an upper house in Parliament composed of members elected or nominated to represent the racial , linguistic and religious minorities in Singapore . However , this was rejected as being backward @-@ looking since politicians should attain a seat in Parliament through taking part in elections .

 = = = Number and boundaries of electoral divisions = = = 
 Apart from the requirement that there must be at least eight SMCs , the total number of SMCs and GRCs in Singapore and their boundaries are not fixed . The number of electoral divisions and their names and boundaries are specified by the Prime Minister from time to time by notification in the Government Gazette . 
 Since 1954 , a year ahead of the 1955 general election , an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee ( EBRC ) has been appointed to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions . Even though neither the Constitution nor any law requires this to be done , the Prime Minister has continued to do so from Singapore 's independence in 1965 . This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes . In recent decades , the Committee has been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants . In the EBRC appointed before the general election of 2006 , these were the head of the Elections Department , the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Land Authority , the Deputy CEO of the Housing and Development Board and the Acting Chief Statistician . Since the Committee is only convened shortly before general elections , the preparatory work for boundary delimitation is done by its secretariat the Elections Department , which is a division of the Prime Minister 's Office . 
 The EBRC 's terms of reference are issued by the Prime Minister , and are not embodied in legislation . In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years , the Committee has considered various factors , including using hill ridges , rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines ; and the need for electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors ' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots . In 1963 , the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20 % . The permitted deviation was increased to 30 % in 1980 . It is up to the Cabinet to decide whether or not to accept the Committee 's recommendations . 
 = = = Requirements of GRCs = = = 
 All the candidates in a GRC must either be members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group , and at least one of the candidates must be a person belonging to the Malay , Indian or some other minority community . A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if , regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race , considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community . Similarly , a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such . The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President , the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee . Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive , and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court . 
 The President , at the Cabinet 's direction , declares the electoral divisions that are to be GRCs ; the number of candidates ( three to six ) to stand for Parliament in each GRC ; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay , Indian , or other minority communities . The number of GRCs in which at least one MP must be from the Malay community must be three @-@ fifths of the total number of GRCs , and the number of MPs to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs to be returned at a general election . For the 2011 general election , there were 12 SMCs and 15 GRCs . 
 An electoral division which is a GRC returns the number of MPs designated for the constituency by the President to serve in Parliament . A group of individuals standing together in a GRC is voted for as a team , and not as individual candidates . In other words , a successful voter 's single vote in an SMC sends to Parliament one MP , and a GRC sends a group of MPs depending on how many have been designated for that GRC . All elected MPs are selected on a simple plurality voting ( " first past the post " ) basis . 
 A by @-@ election need not be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP or some other reason . A by @-@ election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats . Assuming that such a situation does arise , the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by @-@ election within a reasonable time , unless he intends to call a general election in the near future . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 In 1988 , 39 SMCs were grouped into 13 three @-@ member GRCs , making up 39 out of a total of 81 elected seats in Parliament . The Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were changed in 1991 and again in 1996 to increase the maximum number of MPs in each GRC from three to four , and then to six . In the 2001 general election , three- and four @-@ member GRCs were replaced by five- and six @-@ member GRCs . There were nine five @-@ member GRCs and five six @-@ member GRCs , making up 75 out of the 84 elected seats in Parliament . This arrangement remained unchanged at the 2006 elections . 
 On 27 May 2009 , the Government announced that it would refine the size and number of GRCs . This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act . Instead , when the next EBRC was appointed , its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six @-@ member GRCs than at present , and to reduce the average size of each GRC . The average size of GRCs at that time was 5 @.@ 4 MPs because there were only five @-@ member and six @-@ member GRCs . The new average , however , would not exceed five MPs . 
 In addition , to ensure that the number of SMCs kept pace with the increase in voters and hence the number of MPs , the EBRC 's terms of reference would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs . The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between voters and their MPs would be strengthened . In the 2011 general election , SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 = = = Advantages = = = 
 As Article 39A of the Constitution states , the GRC scheme entrenches the presence of minority MPs in Parliament , ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament . Article 39A ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed . As the population of a constituency grows , it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents ' views . A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents , and the fact that there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents ' views . 
 = = = Criticisms of the scheme = = = 
 = = = = Diversion from original purpose = = = = 
 The official justification for the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament . However , opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose , especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under @-@ represented in Parliament . In fact , statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly and that the only two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese . One of them was beaten by a minority candidate . In addition , Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers ' Party of Singapore won a by @-@ election in 1981 at Anson , a largely Chinese constituency , and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish . Technically , as the size of GRCs has increased , the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced . Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament , their political clout has also been reduced . 
 Furthermore , the GRC scheme is now used as a recruiting tool for the PAP . In 2006 , Goh Chok Tong stated , " Without some assurance of a good chance of winning at least their first election , many able and successful young Singaporeans may not risk their careers to join politics " . Indeed , every PAP GRC team is helmed by a major figure such as a minister , and this allows new candidates to ride on the coat @-@ tails of the experienced PAP members . Since 1991 , the PAP has generally not fielded first @-@ time candidates in SMC wards . On the other hand , one of the " in @-@ built weaknesses " of GRCs may be that " through no fault of their own or that of their team " , " high @-@ value " MPs can be voted out ; this was said to have occurred when former Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo lost his parliamentary seat to a Workers ' Party of Singapore team in Aljunied GRC at the 2011 general election . 
 It is also said that GRCs serve more as administrative tools than to ensure minority representation . The size of GRCs was increased to take advantage of economies of scale when managing the wards . However , whether GRCs are required for this purpose is arguable , as Goh Chok Tong stated in 1988 that MPs in SMCs could still group together after elections to enjoy economies of scale . 
 = = = = Opposition parties disadvantaged = = = = 
 The GRC scheme has also been criticized for raising the bar for the opposition in elections . First , opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates , including minority candidates , to form teams to contest GRCs . Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams . With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased , and opposition parties have to take a gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs . Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8 % of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election , rounded to the nearest S $ 500 . At the 2011 general election , the deposit was $ 16 @,@ 000 . Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one @-@ eighth of the total number of votes polled in the GRC . Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs . To date , only one opposition party , the Workers ' Party , has won a GRC : Aljunied , in the 2011 general election . 
 = = = = Creation of unequal voting power = = = = 
 GRCs have been criticized as creating unequal voting powers between electors . At present , one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament , compared with one vote in a SMC ward , which only returns one candidate . The GRC scheme has also diluted electors ' voting power . For instance , in an SMC ward there are around 14 @,@ 000 voters , compared to 140 @,@ 000 voters in a five- or six @-@ member GRC . Thus , the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC , as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP that he or she does not like . The situation is compounded by the fact that a 30 % deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated . Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP @-@ to @-@ voter guide ratio is one MP to 26 @,@ 000 voters , which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18 @,@ 200 and 33 @,@ 800 . By extrapolation , a five @-@ member GRC can have between 91 @,@ 000 and 169 @,@ 000 voters , a difference of 86 % . 
 = = = = Weakening of voter – MP relationship = = = = 
 Critics have noted that the credibility and accountability of some candidates may be reduced because in a GRC the members of the team who are popular " protect " less popular members from being voted out . It has been said that the relationship between the electorate and their representatives is also weakened , because the relationship is between the individual and the GRC team rather than between the individual and a particular MP . Improving the link between voters and MPs , and to make the latter more accountable was the reason for the changes proposed in 2009 to introduce more SMCs and to reduce the size of GRCs . 
 = = = = <unk> of racialism = = = = 
 Even though the GRC scheme is intended to ensure minority representation in Parliament , it can be said that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races . It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit , or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs . This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament , and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability . It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates , and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race , culture and language . 
 = = = = Law of large numbers = = = = 
 Derek da Cunha has proposed that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system . According to the theory , the large number of voters from GRC wards generally , though not necessarily always , reflects the popular vote . This was evident at the 2006 elections , at which the PAP garnered an average of 67 @.@ 04 % of the votes in a contested GRC , while the average was 61 @.@ 67 % for a SMC ward . The national average for the 2006 elections was 66 @.@ 6 % . Similar trends can be seen from previous elections . In fact , the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3 % in 1991 , and remained stable at around 5 % in the 1997 , 2001 and 2006 elections . This may be attributable to the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers .

 = Minefields in Croatia = 
 Minefields in Croatia cover 480 @.@ 77 square kilometres ( 185 @.@ 63 square miles ) of territory . The minefields ( usually known as " mine suspected areas " ) are located in 69 cities and municipalities within 9 counties . These areas are thought to contain approximately 46 @,@ 317 land mines , in addition to unexploded ordnance left over from the Croatian War of Independence . Land mines were used extensively during the war by all sides in the conflict ; about 1 @.@ 5 million were deployed . They were intended to strengthen defensive positions lacking sufficient weapons or manpower , but played a limited role in the fighting . 
 After the war 13 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 5 @,@ 000 square miles ) of territory was initially suspected to contain mines , but this estimate was later reduced to 1 @,@ 174 square kilometres ( 453 square miles ) after physical inspection . As of 2013 demining programmes were coordinated through governmental bodies such as the Croatian Mine Action Centre , which was hiring private demining companies employing 632 deminers . As of September 2015 , Croatia plans to clear all suspected minefields by 2019 . The areas are marked with 13 @,@ 274 warning signs . 
 As of 4 April 2013 , 509 people had been killed and 1 @,@ 466 injured by land mines in Croatia since the war ; with these figures including 60 deminers and seven Croatian Army engineers killed during demining operations . In the immediate aftermath of the war there were about 100 civilian mine casualties per year , but this gradually decreased to below ten per year through demining , mine @-@ awareness and education programmes . Croatia has spent approximately € 450 million on demining since 1998 , when the process was taken over by private contractors coordinated by the Croatian Mine Action Centre . The cost to complete the demining is estimated at € 500 million or more . Economic loss to Croatia ( due to loss of land use within suspected minefields ) is estimated at € 47 @.@ 3 million per year . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the Communist regime in Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) , ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs worsened . After the elections , the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence weapons to minimize potential resistance . On 17 August , tensions escalated to an open revolt by the Croatian Serbs . The JNA stepped in , preventing Croatian police from intervening . The revolt centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin , parts of the Lika , Kordun and Banovina regions and eastern Croatian settlements with a significant Serb population . This contiguous area was subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . The RSK declared its intention to join Serbia , and as a result came to be viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region . By March 1991 , the conflict had escalated into what became known as the Croatian War of Independence . In June , Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated . By January 1992 , the RSK held 17 @,@ 028 square kilometres ( 6 @,@ 575 sq mi ) of territory within borders claimed by Croatia . This territory ranged from 2 @.@ 5 to 63 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 to 39 @.@ 2 miles ) in depth , and had a 923 @-@ kilometre ( 574 mi ) front line along Croatian @-@ controlled territory . 
 = = Wartime use = = 
 Land mines were first used by the JNA in early 1991 , before its withdrawal from Croatia , to protect military barracks and other facilities . Even JNA facilities located in urban centres were secured in this way , using mines such as the <unk> @-@ 1 bounding mine and <unk> directional anti @-@ personnel mine . The Croatian Army ( HV ) and Croatian police began laying land mines in late 1991 , relying heavily on them to stop advances by the JNA and the Army of the RSK ( ARSK ) until early 1992 . These early minefields were laid with little documentation . In 1992 the ARSK increased its use of mines to secure the front line , largely due to its limited number of troops . Consequently , the ARSK constructed static defensive lines ( consisting of trenches , bunkers and large numbers of mines designed to protect thinly @-@ manned defences ) to delay HV offensives . This approach was necessitated by the limited depth of RSK territory and the lack of reserves available with which to counterattack ( or block ) breaches of its defensive line , which meant that the ARSK was unable to employ defence in depth tactics . The combination of poor documentation of minefield locations and the lack of markings ( or fencing ) led to frequent injuries to military personnel caused by mines laid by friendly forces . It is estimated that a total of 1 @.@ 5 million land mines were laid during the war . 
 The HV successfully used anti @-@ tank mines as obstacles in combination with infantry anti @-@ tank weapons , destroying or disabling more than 300 JNA tanks ( particularly during defensive operations in Slavonia ) . Conversely , anti @-@ personnel mines deployed by the ARSK proved less effective against the HV during operations Flash and Storm in 1995 . During these operations , the HV crossed ( or bypassed ) many ARSK minefields based on information from land @-@ based and unmanned aerial vehicle reconnaissance of the movement of ARSK patrols , civilian populations and the activation of mines by wildlife . Out of the 224 HV personnel killed in operations Flash and Storm , only 15 fatalities were caused by land mines . Similarly , out of 966 wounded in the two offensives only 92 were injured by land mines . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 As of 4 April 2013 a total of 509 people had been killed and 1 @,@ 466 injured by land mines in 1 @,@ 352 incidents in Croatia . There were 557 civilian casualties from land mines between 1991 and 1995 , during the war and in its immediate aftermath . Between 1996 and 1998 there were approximately 100 civilian casualties from land mines per year in Croatia , but the number gradually decreased to less than ten per year by 2010 . During the war , 57 HV troops were killed or injured by mines in 1992 . In 1995 , 169 were killed or injured ( most during operations Flash and Storm ) out of 130 @,@ 000 HV troops involved . Seven HV engineers were killed and 18 injured by land mines during HV mine clearance operations between 1996 and 1998 . Civilian casualties include 60 deminers killed since 1998 . 
 Croatia has established an extensive framework to assist those injured by mines and the families of mine victims . This assistance includes emergency and ongoing medical care , physical rehabilitation , psychological and social support , employment and social @-@ integration assistance , public awareness and access to public services . Institutions and organizations supporting mine victims include a wide range of governmental bodies and non @-@ governmental organizations ( NGOs ) . 
 = = Existing minefields = = 
 As of 27 November 2015 , there were 487 @.@ 4 square kilometres ( 188 @.@ 2 square miles ) of Croatian territory suspected to contain land mines . These areas are located in 9 counties and 70 cities and municipalities . They are thought to contain approximately 46 @,@ 317 land mines , as well as unexploded ordnance left over from the Croatian War of Independence . Areas suspected to contain land mines are marked with more than 12 @,@ 000 warning signs . Areas thought to contain unexploded ordnance ( but no land mines ) are marked with 409 warning signs . Suspected minefields are primarily located in forests ( 62 percent ) ; the remainder are on agricultural land ( 26 percent ) , karst and shrubland ( 12 percent ) . 
 = = = Social and economic impacts = = = 
 Land mines are a safety issue for populations living near minefields . In 2008 , an estimated 920 @,@ 000 people in Croatia were endangered by their proximity to mined areas ( 20 @.@ 8 percent of the population ) . Land mines are also a significant problem for development , because a substantial portion of the minefields in Croatia are on agricultural land and in forests . Some drainage channels are consequently inaccessible for maintenance , resulting in intermittent flooding ; this is particularly severe in areas bordering Hungary . Similar problems are caused by mines laid on the banks of the Drava , Kupa and Sava rivers . The presence of land mines adversely affected post @-@ war recovery in rural areas , reducing the amount of available agricultural land , impeding development and affecting the quality of life for people in mined areas . In addition to agriculture , the most significant economic problem caused by mines in Croatia is their impact on tourism ( especially on forested areas and hunting in areas inland from the Adriatic Sea coast ) . In 2012 , it was estimated that the economy of Croatia lost 355 million kuna ( c . 47 @.@ 3 million euros ) a year from the effects of mine @-@ suspected areas on the economy . 
 Because of the importance of tourism to the Croatian economy , areas frequented by tourists ( or near major tourist routes ) have been given priority for demining . Other safety @-@ related areas receiving demining priority are settlements , commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields . Agricultural land , infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance . National parks in Croatia were also <unk> as top @-@ priority areas , along with areas significant for fire protection . Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem , and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism . The signs are regularly replaced , sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles . Since the 1990s , only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia . 
 The Government of Croatia established several bodies to address the problem of land mines in Croatia ; foremost among them are the Office for Mine Action and the Croatian Mine Action Centre . The Office for Mine Action is a government agency tasked with providing expert analysis and advice on demining . The Croatian Mine Action Centre is a public @-@ sector body tasked with planning and conducting demining surveys , accepting cleared areas , marking mine @-@ suspected areas , quality assurance , demining research and development , and victim assistance . The work of the Croatian Mine Action Centre is supervised by the Office for Mine Action . 
 As refugees flee to Europe , from Syria and other Middle Eastern nations , some are migrating through Croatia due to Hungary 's recent closing of its borders . These immigrants trying to cross to Europe are seeking Croatia 's help in finding safe routes of passage . 
 = = = Mine awareness and education = = = 
 Croatia has implemented a mine @-@ awareness educational programme aimed at reducing the frequency of mine @-@ related accidents through an ongoing information campaign . The programme is conducted by the Croatian Red Cross , the Ministry of Science , Education and Sports and a number of NGOs in cooperation with the Croatian Mine Action Centre . The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to develop as many programmes as possible and attract new NGOs to mine @-@ awareness and educational activities . It maintains an accessible online database with cartographic information on the location of mine @-@ suspected areas in Croatia . 
 One mine @-@ awareness campaign involving billboard advertising attracted criticism from the Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board ( <unk> ) because the signs were placed in tourist areas , far from any mine @-@ suspected areas . The Ministry of Tourism and the <unk> welcomed the effort 's humanitarian aspect , but considered the signs a potential source of unwarranted negative reaction from tourists . Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include warnings about the danger posed by mines in the country , and provide general information about their location . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 At the end of the Croatian War of Independence , approximately 13 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 5 @,@ 000 square miles ) of the country was suspected of containing land mines . During the war and in its immediate aftermath , demining was performed by HV engineers supported by police and civil defence personnel . Wartime demining was focused on clearance tasks in support of military operations and the safety of the civilian population . In 1996 the Parliament of Croatia enacted the <unk> Act , tasking police with its organization and the government @-@ owned <unk> <unk> company with the demining itself . By April 1998 approximately 40 square kilometres ( 15 square miles ) had been cleared of mines , and the initial estimate of minefield areas was reduced after inspection . By 2003 the entire territory of Croatia was reviewed , and the minefield area reduced to 1 @,@ 174 square kilometres ( 453 square miles ) . 
 Since May 1998 the Croatian Mine Action Centre has been tasked with the development of demining plans , projects , technical inspections , cleared @-@ area handover , demining quality assurance , expert assistance and the coordination of mine @-@ clearance activities . The demining is performed by 35 licensed companies , employing 632 demining professionals and 58 auxiliary personnel . The companies do their work with 681 metal detectors , 55 mine rollers and mine flails , and 15 mine @-@ detection dogs . Mine @-@ clearing machines include locally designed models produced by <unk> @-@ ING . <unk> typically earn € .50 – 1 @.@ 20 for each 1 square metre ( 11 square feet ) cleared , or € 800 – 900 a month . 
 Since 1998 , demining has been funded through the government and by donations . From 1998 to 2011 , donations amounted to € 75 @.@ 5 million ( 17 percent of the total of € 450 million spent on demining during that period ) . Most donations were from foreign contributors , including NGOs and foreign governments ( among them Japan , Germany , Monaco , Luxembourg and the United States ) . The European Union was also a significant contributor during that period , providing € 20 @.@ 7 million . As of 2013 , the Croatian Mine Action Centre has been allocated approximately 400 million kuna ( c . 53 million euros ) a year for demining . An estimated further € 500 million ( or more ) will be needed to remove all remaining land mines from Croatia by 2019 , the deadline for land @-@ mine clearance set by the Ottawa Treaty . The Croatian Mine Action Centre spends approximately 500 @,@ 000 kuna ( c . 66 @,@ 600 euros ) a year to maintain minefield warning signs ( including the replacement of stolen signs ) .
