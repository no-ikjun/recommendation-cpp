 Property losses from the fire can be accounted for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards . City surveyor Søren <unk> submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second , made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728 . The differences between the two surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43 lots , so it is fairly certain that 1 @,@ 227 lots containing about 1 @,@ 600 buildings were lost in flames . All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4 @,@ 500 lots ( per the cadastre of 1699 ) , so about 28 % of the lots were lost . For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47 % . 
 The magistrate also made a survey of the spared parts of town from which it appears that 8 @,@ 749 former residents of the parts touched by fire had found new lodgings . It is estimated that as many as 15 @,@ 000 had become homeless . This is about 20 % of the population , which is estimated at 70 @,@ 000 . However the number of dead and wounded is unknown . It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources , but the number remains uncertain . It is probably low in comparison with the extent of the fire , though . 
 While the human and property losses were staggering , the cultural loss is still felt today . The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such . 35 @,@ 000 texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames . Original works from the historians Hans <unk> , Anders Sørensen <unk> , Niels Krag , and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm , Ole Rømer , Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost . Atlas <unk> by Peder Hansen <unk> and the archive of Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well . The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started . 
 Several other book collections were lost as well . Professor Mathias <unk> made the mistake of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church . Árni Magnússon lost all his books , notes and records , but did manage to rescue his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts . At <unk> <unk> 3 @,@ 150 volumes burned along with its Museum <unk> containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities . The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer . The professors <unk> , Steenbuch and the two <unk> lost practically everything . And on top of all that a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall . 
 In the library on top of Trinitatis Church were many things which the world no longer owns ; the damage cannot be helped .

 When the reconstruction of Denmark 's capital was begun a number of changes were introduced . A commission was appointed to regulate the streets . After <unk> among the ruins this commission submitted a suggestion to create 12 to 15 @-@ metre wide main streets with 10 @-@ metre wide side streets with none of the surrounding houses being half @-@ timbered . 
 This plan was not followed in the reconstruction . Although half @-@ timbered houses were banned at first , the ban was lifted in 1731 as brick houses were considerably more expensive . Medieval Copenhagen , however , had changed permanently when the reconstruction was complete by 1737 . Streets and alleys no longer followed the original paths and some even ceased to exist . 
 = = = The fire houses = = = 
 The term <unk> ( English : fire houses ) today refer to a type of townhouses that was built in large numbers in the years immediately after the fire . Many of them were modelled on generic renderings made by Johan Cornelius Krieger with inspiration from Christof <unk> . The houses are two or three storeys high , five bays wide and have a prominent wall dormer . The façade towards the street is in brick while the rest of the house has timber framing . They are typically painted in bright colours . Well @-@ preserved examples are today found in locations such as <unk> and Gammel <unk> .

 Polikarpov DI @-@ 1 ( also known as 2I @-@ N1 , Russian : <unk> <unk> @-@ 1 ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) ) was a prototype Soviet two @-@ seat fighter designed during the 1920s . The sole prototype built crashed on its ninth flight , due to manufacturing defects , and the program was cancelled . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov began design of a two @-@ seat fighter initially designated as the 2I @-@ N1 ( two @-@ seat Istrebitel ' ( fighter ) with a single Napier engine ) in October 1924 at Zavod ( Factory ) Nr. 1 at Khodynka Aerodrome , Moscow . It was the first Soviet indigenous two @-@ seat fighter . It was a single @-@ bay biplane with its wings arranged in a sesquiplane configuration . The oval @-@ shaped , semi @-@ monocoque fuselage was made of ' shpon ' , molded birch plywood . The wings were also covered with ' shpon ' . The upper wing had two spars , but the lower wing only had one . Internal bracing wires were not used in the wings as it was built up from plywood ribs with large lightening holes and stringers . V @-@ struts made from Duralumin separated the wings and connected the upper wing to the fuselage . Steel bracing wires were used externally . An airfoil enclosed the axle of the fixed undercarriage and a small ski served as a tailskid . It had an imported 336 @-@ kilowatt ( 451 hp ) Napier Lion engine enclosed in a metal cowling . It carried 547 kg ( 1 @,@ 206 lb ) of fuel and oil . The armament consisted of a single fixed 7 @.@ 62 mm ( 0 @.@ 300 in ) synchronized PV @-@ 1 machine gun and a 7 @.@ 62 mm DA machine gun mounted on a ring in the observer 's cockpit . 
 The first flight of the prototype took place on 12 January 1926 and the DI @-@ 1 , as it was now known , demonstrated excellent performance . Polikarpov himself flew as the observer on the fourth and eighth test flights . However , during the ninth flight on 31 March 1926 , the aircraft was making speed runs over the measured kilometer at Khodynka Airfield at a height of 100 metres ( 328 ft ) when the upper surface of the right upper wing ripped off , followed by the lower skin . Both right wings then collapsed and the DI @-@ 1 crashed , killing both the pilot , V. N. <unk> , and the observer , V. V. Mikhailov . 
 Examination of the wreckage revealed that large portions of the wings ' skin were badly glued and that a number of rib caps and stringers were not glued at all . Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the <unk> holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely . The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six @-@ month hiatus in design work . Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger , and thus , heavier , than it needed to be . All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash , nominally for lack of a suitable engine .

 = New Jersey Route 158 = 
 Route 158 ( also known as the Centre Street Bridge ) was a short state highway in Newark and Harrison , New Jersey , in the counties of Essex and Hudson , which are located in the United States . The Centre Street Bridge was first constructed in 1834 as a single @-@ level railroad bridge . However , in 1911 , almost eight decades later , a second , upper level was constructed for rapid transit . In 1937 , the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad , now part of the Port Authority Trans @-@ Hudson line , was realigned onto railroad tracks along New Jersey Route 21 . The upper level of the bridge was abandoned for this purpose , and was later converted to roadway . At the western end in Newark it ran just south of Park Place , beginning at Center Street . The route headed eastward , crossing over Route 21 and the Passaic River before entering Harrison , where it terminated at Second Street north of New Jersey Railroad Avenue . 
 Eventually , the upper level roadway was designated by the New Jersey State Highway Department as Route <unk> . A spur of the recently designated State Highway Route 25A , the highway department made the roadway a suffixed spur of the highway because of the close proximity . Route 25A later became New Jersey Route 58 and is now an alignment of Interstate 280 . The designation remained intact until the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1 , 1953 , when it was changed to New Jersey Route 158 . Route 158 appeared on the state map for New Jersey until up to 1960 , when it disappeared from the maps as a public highway . After 1960 , Route 158 did not appear on maps , and the bridge was torn down around 1979 .

 Route 158 began at an intersection with Park Place and Center Street ( County Route 508 ) in the city of Newark . The route went up in elevation , paralleling Park Place until crossing New Jersey Route 21 ( the McCarter Highway ) . The highway continued eastward , crossing the last patch of land between 21 and the river before heading onto the swing bridge . Route 158 crossed as a two @-@ lane bridge into Harrison . The route continued onto land just north of New Jersey Railroad Avenue , where it turned northward along First Street . Route 158 turned eastward onto Essex Street , with the right @-@ of @-@ way ending at Second Street , where the designation ended as well .

 The lower level of the Centre Street Bridge , a continuation of Centre Street in Newark , was first constructed for the New Jersey Railroad , which later became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad . On September 15 , 1834 , the bridge opened on a single level for trains . A cutoff around the bridge opened in 1870 and the old route became the Centre Street Branch of the New Jersey Railroad , being cut from the main line to the south when the latter was elevated around 1904 . On March 1 , 1901 , a Pennsylvania Railroad train derailed its rear cars on the bridge at 10 : 23 that evening . When it derailed , the rear cars were dragged for 100 yards across the trestle . The train , a locomotive and five cars , had just left the Centre Street station when it derailed . The bridge had no guard rails at the time , and the rails hung over the bridge . The cars were disconnected , and the passengers continued to Jersey City . The reason for the cars jumping the rails were not known . 
 In July 1901 the states of New Jersey and New York proposed improvements to several local bridges to the United States Congress . The proposal asked for $ 45 @,@ 000 ( 1901 USD ) in improvements of dredging and maintaining the channel of the Passaic River below the bridge . On April 2 , 1911 , almost ten years after the proposed improvements , construction began on a new high @-@ speed line in Newark along the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad . It was proposed to be completed by the end of the summer in that year , to help commuters to New York City . The same proposal asked for authorization of a proposal for subways in the city by the state of New Jersey . The bridge at the time was made of steel with concrete flooring and pavement . The upper @-@ level was to have a clearance of 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) and there was to be a 230 feet ( 70 m ) long drawbridge in the center . The upper level was to be used by the new passenger line and the lower level was to be used for the freight line of the Pennsylvania Railroad . 
 The new high @-@ speed line and double @-@ decker Centre Street Bridge was completed on November 18 , 1911 . The last rail that had to be constructed was completed that very day for the eighty @-@ six Newark @-@ bound trains to run in each direction of that line . The drawbridge 's only use was for the freight line that was to go along the lower level of the bridge . As proposed , the upper level was given to the line . On November 25 , 1911 , the bridge re @-@ opened once again as a double level <unk> connecting to the H & M to Park Place . 
 On June 27 , 1937 , a proposal was made by the city of Newark and the counties of Hudson and Essex to convert the upper level of the span to a roadway after proposing that the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad , now the Port Authority Trans @-@ Hudson , to be moved onto tracks that paralleled NJ 21 , which was assigned in 1927 . 
 = = = Road bridge = = = 
 The Centre Street Bridge was later designated as a state highway under the public highway system . The New Jersey State Highway Department had recently designated Route 25A , which became Route 58 , and later Interstate 280 to the south in the proximity of the bridge . The state highway department a few years later designated the alignment of the upper level span of the bridge as New Jersey State Highway Route 25A @-@ D , which was a suffixed spur of Route 25A . Even with the designation , State Highway Route 25A @-@ D did not connect to its parent or grandparent routes . However , unlike Route 25A , Route 25A @-@ D did not appear in the state laws . The route remained intact along the bridge from New Jersey Route 21 and Center Street in Newark to Second Street in Harrison until January 1 , 1953 , when the state highway department completed a second renumbering of state highways in New Jersey . Route 158 appeared in maps along the Centre Street Bridge as a publicly used highway until 1960 , when it disappeared from the maps . Route 158 's official decommissioning date is currently unknown , but the Centre Street Bridge was torn down around 1979 .

 Taiwanese aborigines ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ; Wade – Giles : T <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ; Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī : Tâi @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> chū @-@ <unk> ; literally : " Taiwanese original inhabitants " ) is the term commonly applied to the indigenous peoples of Taiwan , who number more than 530 @,@ 000 and constitute nearly 2 @.@ 3 % of the island 's population . Recent research suggests their ancestors may have been living on Taiwan for approximately 8 @,@ 000 years before a major Han immigration began in the 17th century . Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples , with linguistic and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups , which includes those of the Philippines , Malaysia , Indonesia , Madagascar and Oceania . The issue of an ethnic identity unconnected to the Asian mainland has become one thread in the discourse regarding the political status of Taiwan . 
 For centuries , Taiwan 's aboriginal inhabitants experienced economic competition and military conflict with a series of colonizing newcomers . Centralized government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation , as well as continued contact with the colonizers through trade , intermarriage and other intercultural processes , have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity . For example , of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines ( collectively referred to as the Formosan languages ) , at least ten are now extinct , five are moribund , and several are to some degree endangered . These languages are of unique historical significance , since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family . 
 Taiwan 's Austronesian speakers were formerly distributed over much of the island 's rugged central mountain range and were concentrated in villages along the alluvial plains . The bulk of contemporary Taiwanese aborigines now live in the mountains and in cities . 
 The indigenous peoples of Taiwan face economic and social barriers , including a high unemployment rate and substandard education . Since the early 1980s , many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking a higher degree of political self @-@ determination and economic development . The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by aborigines , including the incorporation of elements of their culture into commercially successful pop music . Efforts are under way in indigenous communities to revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their traditional languages . The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is one means by which tribe members promote aboriginal culture . In addition , several aboriginal tribes have become extensively involved in the tourism and ecotourism industries with the goal of achieving increased economic self @-@ reliance and preserving their culture . 
 = = History and tribal definitions = = 
 For most of their recorded history , Taiwanese aborigines have been defined by the agents of different Confucian , Christian , and Nationalist " civilizing " projects , with a variety of aims . Each " civilizing " project defined the aborigines based on the " <unk> " ' s cultural understandings of difference and similarity , behavior , location , appearance and prior contact with other groups of people ( Harrell 1996 : 5 – 20 ) . <unk> imposed by colonizing forces divided the aborigines into named subgroups , referred to as " tribes " . These divisions did not always correspond to distinctions drawn by the aborigines themselves . However , the categories have become so firmly established in government and popular discourse over time that they have become de facto distinctions , serving to shape in part today 's political discourse within the Republic of China ( ROC ) , and affecting Taiwan 's policies regarding indigenous peoples . 
 The Han sailor , Chen Di , in his Record of the Eastern Seas ( 1603 ) , identifies the indigenous people of Taiwan as simply " Eastern Savages " ( <unk> ; <unk> ) , while the Dutch referred to Taiwan 's original inhabitants as " Indians " or " blacks " , based on their prior colonial experience in what is currently Indonesia ( Teng 2004 : 61 – 5 ) . 
 Beginning nearly a century later , as the rule of the Qing Empire expanded over wider groups of people , writers and gazetteers recast their descriptions away from reflecting degree of acculturation , and toward a system that defined the aborigines relative to their submission or hostility to Qing rule . Qing literati used the term " raw / wild " ( " <unk> " ) to define those people who had not submitted to Qing rule , and " cooked ; tamed or subjugated " ( " <unk> " ) for those who had pledged their allegiance through their payment of a head tax . According to the standards of the Qianlong Emperor and successive regimes , the epithet " cooked " was synonymous with having assimilated to Han cultural norms , and living as a subject of the Empire , but it retained a pejorative designation to signify the perceived cultural lacking of the non @-@ Han people ( Harrell 1996 : 19 ) , ( Diamond 1995 : 100 ) . This designation reflected the prevailing idea that anyone could be civilized / tamed by adopting Confucian social norms ( Crossley 1999 : 281 – 95 ; <unk> 1992 : 8 – 9 ) . 
 As the Qing consolidated their power over the plains and struggled to enter the mountains in the late 19th century , the terms Pingpu ( <unk> ; <unk> ; " Plains tribes " ) and Gaoshan ( <unk> ; <unk> ; " High Mountain tribes " ) were used interchangeably with the epithets " cooked " and " raw " ( Teng 2004 : 125 – 27 ) . During the 50 years of Japanese colonial rule ( 1895 – 1945 ) , anthropologists from Japan maintained the binary classification . In 1900 they incorporated it into their own colonial project by employing the term <unk> ( <unk> ) for the " cooked tribes " , and creating a category of " recognized tribes " for the aborigines who had formerly been called " raw " . The Wushe Incident of 1930 led to many changes in aboriginal policy , and the Japanese government began referring to them as Takasago @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) ( Tai 1999 : 294 ) . The latter group included the Atayal , Bunun , Tsou , Saisiat , Paiwan , Puyuma , and Ami peoples . The Yami ( Tao ) and <unk> were added later , for a total of nine recognized tribes ( Harrison 2001 : 54 – 5 ) . During the early period of Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang ( KMT ) rule the terms Shandi <unk> ( <unk> ) " mountain compatriots " and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) " plains compatriots " were invented , to remove the presumed taint of Japanese influence and reflect the place of Taiwan 's indigenous people in the Chinese Nationalist state ( Harrison 2001 : 60 ) . The KMT later adopted the use of all the earlier Japanese groupings except <unk> . 
 Despite recent changes in the field of anthropology and a shift in government objectives , the Pingpu and Gaoshan labels in use today maintain the form given by the Qing to reflect aborigines ' acculturation to Han culture . The current recognized aborigines are all regarded as Gaoshan , though the divisions are not and have never been based strictly on geographical location . The Amis , Saisiat , Tao and Kavalan are all traditionally Eastern Plains cultures ( Brown 2001 : 163 <unk> ) . The distinction between Pingpu and Gaoshan people continues to affect Taiwan 's policies regarding indigenous peoples , and their ability to participate effectively in government ( <unk> people 2006 ) . 
 Although the ROC 's Government Information Office officially lists 14 major groupings as " tribes " the consensus among scholars maintains that these 14 groupings do not reflect any social entities , political collectives , or self @-@ identified alliances dating from pre @-@ modern Taiwan ( Teng 2004 : 104 – 5 ) . The earliest detailed records , dating from the Dutch arrival in 1624 , describe the aborigines as living in independent villages of varying size . Between these villages there was frequent trade , intermarriage , warfare and alliances against common enemies . Using contemporary ethnographic and linguistic criteria , these villages have been classed by anthropologists into more than 20 broad ( and widely debated ) ethnic groupings ( Tsuchida 1983 : 62 ; Li 1992 : 22 – 3 ) , which were never united under a common polity , kingdom or " tribe " ( Shepherd 1993 : 51 – 61 ) .

 The Government of the Republic of China officially recognizes distinct tribes among the indigenous community based upon the qualifications drawn up by the Council of Indigenous Peoples ( CIP ) ( Ericsson 2004 ) . To gain this recognition , tribes must gather a number of signatures and a body of supporting evidence with which to successfully petition the CIP . Formal recognition confers certain legal benefits and rights upon a group , as well as providing them with the satisfaction of recovering their separate identity as a tribe . As of June 2014 , 16 tribes have been recognized . 
 The Council of Indigenous Peoples consider several limited factors in a successful formal petition . The determining factors include collecting member genealogies , group histories and evidence of a continued linguistic and cultural identity ( Lee 2003 ; Chuang 2005 ) . The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages as the result of colonial cultural and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many tribes a remote possibility . Current trends in ethno @-@ tourism have led many former Plains Aborigines to continue to seek cultural revival ( Brown 2004 ) . 
 Among the Plains groups that have petitioned for tribal status , only the Kavalan and Sakizaya have been officially recognized . The remaining twelve recognized tribes are traditionally regarded as mountain aboriginals . 
 Other tribal groups or subgroups that have pressed for recovery of legal aboriginal status include the Chimo ( who have not formally petitioned the government , see Lee 2003 ) , the <unk> , <unk> , Pazeh , and Siraya ( Kavalan become 2002 ) . The act of petitioning for recognized status , however , does not always reflect any consensus view among scholars that the relevant group should in fact be categorized as a separate tribe . 
 There is discussion among both scholars and political groups regarding the best or most appropriate name to use for many of the tribes and their languages , as well as the proper romanization of that name . Commonly cited examples of this ambiguity include ( Seediq / Sediq / Truku / Taroko ) and ( Tao / Yami ) . 
 Nine of the tribes were originally recognized before 1945 by the Japanese government ( Ericsson 2004 ) . The Thao , Kavalan and Truku were recognized by Taiwan 's government in 2001 , 2002 and 2004 respectively . The Sakizaya were recognized as a 13th tribe on 17 January 2007 ( Cheng 2007 ) , and on 23 April 2008 the Sediq were recognized as Taiwan 's 14th official tribe ( Shih & Loa 2008 ) . Previously the Sakizaya had been listed as Amis and the Sediq as Atayal . <unk> <unk> and <unk> were recognized as the 15th and 16th tribe on 26 June 2014 . A full list of the recognized tribes of Taiwan , as well as some of the more commonly cited unrecognized tribal groups , is as follows :

 The People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) government claims Taiwan as part of its territory and officially refers to all Taiwanese aborigines as Gaoshan ( lit . " high mountain " ) , which are one of the 56 ethnicities officially recognized by the PRC . According to the 2000 Census , 4 @,@ 461 people were identified as Gaoshan living in mainland China . Some surveys indicate that of the 4 @,@ 461 Gaoshan recorded in the 2000 PRC Census , it is estimated that there are 1 @,@ 500 Amis , 1 @,@ 300 Bunun , 510 Paiwan , and the remainder belonging to other tribes ( Hattaway 2003 : 39 , 93 , 425 ) . They are descendants of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan who were in mainland China during the establishment of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 ( Hattaway 2003 : 39 , 93 , 425 ) . 
 = = Assimilation and acculturation = = 
 Archaeological , linguistic and anecdotal evidence suggests that Taiwan 's indigenous peoples have undergone a series of cultural shifts to meet the pressures of contact with other societies and new technologies ( Liu 2002 : 75 – 98 ) . Beginning in the early 17th century , Taiwanese aborigines faced broad cultural change as the island became incorporated into the wider global economy by a succession of competing colonial regimes from Europe and Asia ( Shepherd 1993 : 1 – 10 ; Kang 2003 : 115 – 26 ) . In some cases groups of aborigines resisted colonial influence , but other groups and individuals readily aligned with the colonial powers . This alignment could be leveraged to achieve personal or collective economic gain , collective power over neighboring villages or freedom from unfavorable societal customs and taboos involving marriage , age @-@ grade and child birth ( Shepherd 1995 : 58 – 63 ; Blusse & Everts 2000 : 77 – 8 ) . 
 Particularly among the Plains Aborigines , as the degree of the " civilizing projects " increased during each successive regime , the aborigines found themselves in greater contact with outside cultures . The process of acculturation and assimilation sometimes followed gradually in the wake of broad social currents , particularly the removal of ethnic markers ( such as bound feet , dietary customs and clothing ) , which had formerly distinguished ethnic groups on Taiwan ( Brown 2004 : 38 – 50 ) . The removal or replacement of these brought about an incremental transformation from " Fan " ( barbarian ) to the dominant Confucian " Han " culture ( Brown 2004 : 155 – 64 ) . During the Japanese and KMT periods centralized modernist government policies , rooted in ideas of Social Darwinism and culturalism , directed education , genealogical customs and other traditions toward ethnic assimilation ( Harrison 2001 : 60 – 7 ) , ( Duara 1995 ) . Ethnic shift among the Gaoshan , who had less contact with outsiders due to the inaccessibility of their lands , was more the result of centralized assimilative pressures than gradual social change . Nonetheless , the cultures and languages of most of the recognized tribes remain resilient today . Multicultural policies have contributed to ethnic pride in those communities . 
 = = = Current forms of assimilation = = = 
 Many of these forms of assimilation are still at work today . For example , when a central authority <unk> one language , that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language . As generations pass , use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears , and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well . However , some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities ( Hsieh 2006 ) . One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct tribe . 
 The complexity and scope of aboriginal assimilation and acculturation on Taiwan has led to three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change . The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains , where they became the Highland tribes of today ( Shepherd 1993 ) . A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries , the aborigines were completely <unk> ( <unk> 1981 : 282 ; Meskill 1979 : 253 – 55 ) . Finally , modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines , resulting in a hybrid culture . Today people who comprise Taiwan 's ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere ( Brown 1996 ; Brown 2004 ) . 
 Within the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself , differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place , with most Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture , which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan . Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J. Brown between " short @-@ route " and " long @-@ route " . 
 = = = Surnames and identity = = = 
 Several factors encouraged the assimilation of the Plains Aborigines . Taking a Han name was a necessary step in instilling Confucian values in the aborigines ( Liu 2002 : 31 – 2 ) . Confucian values were necessary to be recognized as a full person and to operate within the Confucian Qing state ( Ebrey 1996 : 19 – 34 ) . A surname in Han society was viewed as the most prominent legitimizing marker of a patrilineal ancestral link to the Yellow Emperor ( Huang Di ) and the Five Emperors of Han mythology ( Ebrey 1996 : 26 ) . Possession of a Han surname , then , could confer a broad range of significant economic and social benefits upon aborigines , despite a prior non @-@ Han identity or mixed parentage . In some cases , members of Plains Aborigines adopted the Han surname Pan ( <unk> ) as a modification of their designated status as Fan ( <unk> : " barbarian " ) . One family of Pazeh became members of the local gentry ( Pan 1996 : 440 – 62 ; Hong 1997 : 310 – 15 ) complete with a lineage to Fujian province . In other cases , families of Plains Aborigines adopted common Han surnames , but traced their earliest ancestor to their locality in Taiwan . 
 In many cases , large groups of immigrant Han would unite under a common surname to form a brotherhood . Brotherhoods were used as a form of defense , as each sworn brother was bound by an oath of blood to assist a brother in need . The brotherhood groups would link their names to a family tree , in essence manufacturing a genealogy based on names rather than blood , and taking the place of the kinship organizations commonly found in China . The practice was so widespread that today 's family books are largely unreliable ( Hsu 1980 : 31 – 4 ; 90 – 105 ; Ebrey 1996 : 19 – 34 ) . Many Plains Aborigines joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife , and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage . 
 The degree to which any one of these forces held sway over others is unclear . Preference for one explanation over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint . The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that by the beginning of the 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group , and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese . In addition , legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until recently , and cultural barriers remain . Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted . One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names . However , aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters , and many names require more than the allotted space ( Loa 2007 ) . 
 = = History of the aboriginal peoples = = 
 Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples , with linguistic and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups , such as peoples of the Philippines , Malaysia , Indonesia , Madagascar and Oceania ( Hill et al . 2007 ; Bird , Hope & Taylor 2004 ) . Chipped @-@ pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15 @,@ 000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era . These people survived by eating marine life . Archaeological evidence points to an abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6 @,@ 000 years ago , with the advent of agriculture , domestic animals , polished stone adzes and pottery . The stone adzes were mass @-@ produced on Penghu and nearby islands , from the volcanic rock found there . This suggests heavy sea traffic took place between these islands and Taiwan at this time ( <unk> , Jiao & Lin 2002 : 307 – 8 ; 313 ) . 
 Recorded history of the aborigines on Taiwan began around the 17th century , and has often been dominated by the views and policies of foreign powers and non @-@ aborigines . Beginning with the arrival of Dutch merchants in 1624 , the traditional lands of the aborigines have been successively colonized by Dutch , Spanish , Ming , Qing , Japanese , and Chinese Nationalist rulers . Each of these successive " civilizing " cultural centers participated in violent conflict and peaceful economic interaction with both the Plains and Mountain tribal groups . To varying degrees , they influenced or transformed the culture and language of the indigenous peoples . 
 Four centuries of non @-@ indigenous rule can be viewed through several changing periods of governing power and shifting official policy toward aborigines . From the 17th century until the early 20th , the impact of the foreign settlers — the Dutch , Spanish and Han — was more extensive on the Plains tribes . The latter were far more geographically accessible , and thus had more dealings with the foreign powers . By the beginning of the 20th century , the Plains tribes had largely been assimilated into contemporary Taiwanese culture as a result of European and Han colonial rule . Until the latter half of the Japanese colonial era the Mountain tribes were not entirely governed by any non @-@ tribal polity . However , the mid @-@ 1930s marked a shift in the intercultural dynamic , as the Japanese began to play a far more dominant role in the culture of the Highland groups . This increased degree of control over the Mountain tribes continued during Kuomintang rule . Within these two broad eras , there were many differences in the individual and regional impact of the colonizers and their " civilizing projects " . At times the foreign powers were accepted readily , as some tribes adopted foreign clothing styles and cultural practices ( Harrison 2003 ) , and engaged in cooperative trade in goods such as camphor , deer hides , sugar , tea and rice ( Gold 1986 : 24 – 8 ) . At numerous other times changes from the outside world were forcibly imposed . 
 Much of the historical information regarding Taiwan 's aborigines was collected by these regimes in the form of administrative reports and gazettes as part of greater " civilizing " projects . The collection of information aided in the consolidation of administrative control . 
 = = = Plains aboriginals = = = 
 The Plains Aborigines mainly lived in stationary village sites surrounded by defensive walls of bamboo . The village sites in southern Taiwan were more populated than other locations . Some villages supported a population of more than 1 @,@ 500 people , surrounded by smaller satellite villages ( Kang 2003 : 111 – 17 ) . Siraya villages were constructed of dwellings made of thatch and bamboo , raised 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) from the ground on stilts , with each household having a barn for livestock . A watchtower was located in the village to look out for headhunting parties from the Highland tribes . The concept of property was often communal , with a series of conceptualized concentric rings around each village . The innermost ring was used for gardens and orchards that followed a <unk> cycle around the ring . The second ring was used to cultivate plants and natural fibers for the exclusive use of the tribe . The third ring was for exclusive hunting and deer fields for tribal use . The Plains Aborigines hunted herds of spotted Formosan Sika Deer , Formosan Sambar Deer , and Reeves 's muntjac as well as conducting light millet farming . Sugar and rice were grown as well , but mostly for use in preparing wine ( Shepherd 1993 : 29 – 34 ) . 
 Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal / matrifocal societies . Men married into a woman 's family after a courtship period during which the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished before marriage . In the age @-@ grade communities , couples entered into marriage in their mid @-@ 30s when a man would no longer be required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle @-@ field . In the matriarchal system of the Siraya , it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid @-@ 30s , when the bride 's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household . It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child @-@ birth taboos were abolished . There is some indication that many of the younger members of <unk> society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age @-@ grade system in a push for greater village power ( Shepherd 1995 : 61 – 5 ) . Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor . Women did the sewing , cooking and farming , while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids , which was a common practice in early Taiwan . Women were also often found in the office of priestess or medium to the gods . 
 For centuries , Taiwan 's aboriginal peoples experienced economic competition and military conflict with a series of colonizing peoples . Centralized government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation , as well as continued contact with the colonizers through trade , intermarriage and other dispassionate intercultural processes , have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity . For example , of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines ( collectively referred to as the Formosan languages ) , at least ten are extinct , five are moribund ( Zeitoun & Yu 2005 : 167 ) and several are to some degree endangered . These languages are of unique historical significance , since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family ( <unk> 1999 ) . 
 = = = European period ( 1623 – 1662 ) = = = 
 = = = = Under Dutch rule = = = = 
 During the European period ( 1623 – 1662 ) soldiers and traders representing the Dutch East India Company maintained a colony in southwestern Taiwan ( 1624 – 1662 ) near present @-@ day Tainan City . This established an Asian base for triangular trade between the company , the Qing Dynasty and Japan , with the hope of interrupting Portuguese and Spanish trading alliances . The Spanish also maintained a colony in northern Taiwan ( 1626 – 1642 ) in present @-@ day Keelung . However , Spanish influence wavered almost from the beginning , so that by the late 1630s they had already withdrawn most of their troops ( Andrade 2005 : 296 2n ) . After they were driven out of Taiwan by a combined Dutch and aboriginal force in 1642 , the Spanish " had little effect on Taiwan 's history " ( Gold 1986 : 10 – 11 ) . Dutch influence was far more significant : expanding to the southwest and north of the island , they set up a tax system and established schools and churches in many villages . 
 When the Dutch arrived in 1624 at Tayouan ( Anping ) Harbor , Siraya @-@ speaking representatives from nearby <unk> village soon appeared at the Dutch stockade to barter and trade ; an overture which was readily welcomed by the Dutch . The <unk> villages were , however , divided into warring factions : the village of <unk> ( <unk> ) was at war with Mattau ( <unk> ) and its ally <unk> , while the village of Soulang maintained uneasy neutrality . In 1629 a Dutch expeditionary force searching for Han pirates was massacred by warriors from Mattau , and the victory inspired other villages to rebel ( Shepherd 1995 : 52 – 3 ) . In 1635 , with reinforcements having arrived from Batavia ( now Jakarta , Indonesia ) , the Dutch subjugated and burned Mattau . Since Mattau was the most powerful village in the area , the victory brought a spate of peace offerings from other nearby villages , many of which were outside the Siraya area . This was the beginning of Dutch consolidation over large parts of Taiwan , which brought an end to centuries of inter @-@ village warfare ( Blusse & Everts 2000 : 11 – 20 ) . The new period of peace allowed the Dutch to construct schools and churches aimed to <unk> and convert the indigenous population ( Campbell 1915 : 240 ; Shepherd 1995 : 66 ) . Dutch schools taught a romanized script ( <unk> writing ) , which transcribed the Siraya language . This script maintained occasional use through the 18th century ( Shepherd 1995 : 66 – 8 ) . Today only fragments survive , in documents and stone stele markers . The schools also served to maintain alliances and open aboriginal areas for Dutch enterprise and commerce . 
 The Dutch soon found trade in deerskins and venison in the East Asian market to be a lucrative endeavor ( Shepherd 1993 : 451 <unk> ) , and recruited Plains Aborigines to procure the hides . The deer trade attracted the first Han traders to aboriginal villages , but as early as 1642 the demand for deer greatly diminished the deer stocks . This drop significantly reduced the prosperity of aboriginal tribes ( Andrade 2005 : 303 ) , forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter the economic impact of losing their most vital food source . 
 As the Dutch began subjugating aboriginal villages in the south and west of Taiwan , increasing numbers of Han immigrants looked to exploit areas that were fertile and rich in game . The Dutch initially encouraged this , since the Han were skilled in agriculture and large @-@ scale hunting . Several Han took up residence in Siraya villages . The Dutch used Han agents to collect taxes , hunting license fees and other income . This set up a society in which " many of the colonists were Han Chinese but the military and the administrative structures were Dutch " ( Andrade 2005 : 298 ) . Despite this , local alliances transcended ethnicity during the Dutch period . For example , the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 , a Han farmers ' uprising , was defeated by an alliance of 120 Dutch musketeers with the aid of Han loyalists and 600 aboriginal warriors ( Shepherd 1993 : 90 ) . 
 Multiple Aboriginal villages in frontier areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression such as when the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex , deer pelts , and rice be given to them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu @-@ lao @-@ wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion . Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu @-@ lao @-@ wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died , after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu @-@ lao @-@ wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653 . 
 However , the Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga 's Chinese forces . The Aboriginals ( Formosans ) of <unk> defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty ; the <unk> Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions while the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661 , celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks . 
 The Dutch period ended in 1662 when Ming loyalist forces of Zheng Chenggong ( Koxinga ) drove out the Dutch and established the short @-@ lived Zheng family kingdom on Taiwan . The <unk> brought 70 @,@ 000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing large tracts of land to support its forces . Despite the preoccupation with fighting the Qing , the Zheng family was concerned with aboriginal welfare on Taiwan . The <unk> built alliances , collected taxes and erected aboriginal schools , where Taiwan 's aborigines were first introduced to the Confucian Classics and Chinese writing ( Shepherd 1993 : 92 – 103 ) . However , the impact of the Dutch was deeply ingrained in aboriginal society . In the 19th and 20th centuries , European explorers wrote of being welcomed as kin by the aborigines who thought they were the Dutch , who had promised to return ( Pickering 1898 : 116 – 18 ) . 
 = = = Qing rule ( 1683 – 1895 ) = = = 
 After the Qing government defeated the Ming loyalist forces maintained by the Zheng family in 1683 , parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire ( Teng 2004 : 35 – 60 ) . Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan 's highly populated western plain for over two centuries , until 1895 . This era was characterized by a marked increase in the number of Han Chinese on Taiwan , continued social unrest , the piecemeal transfer ( by various means ) of large amounts of land from the aborigines to the Han , and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs . 
 During the Qing Dynasty 's two @-@ century rule over Taiwan , the population of Han on the island increased dramatically . However , it is not clear to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers , who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province ( Tsao 1999 : 331 ) , or from a variety of other factors , including : frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines , the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos , and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks , which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth . Moreover , the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han . 
 The Qing government officially sanctioned controlled Han settlement , but sought to manage tensions between the various regional and ethnic groups . Therefore , it often recognized the Plains tribes ' claims to deer fields and traditional territory ( Knapp 1980 : 55 – 68 ; Shepherd 1993 : 14 – 20 ) . The Qing authorities hoped to turn the Plains tribes into loyal subjects , and adopted the head and corvée taxes on the aborigines , which made the Plains Aborigines directly responsible for payment to the government yamen . The attention paid by the Qing authorities to aboriginal land rights was part of a larger administrative goal to maintain a level of peace on the turbulent Taiwan frontier , which was often marred by ethnic and regional conflict . The frequency of rebellions , riots , and civil strife in Qing Dynasty Taiwan is often encapsulated in the saying " every three years an uprising ; every five years a rebellion " ( Kerr 1965 : 4 ) . Aboriginal participation in a number of major revolts during the Qing era , including the <unk> @-@ led Ta @-@ Chia @-@ <unk> revolt of 1731 – 1732 , ensured the Plains tribes would remain an important factor in crafting Qing frontier policy until the end of Qing rule in 1895 ( Shepherd 1993 : 128 – 29 ) . 
 The struggle over land resources was one source of conflict . Large areas of the western plain were subject to large land rents called Huan Da Zu ( <unk> — literally , " Barbarian Big Rent " ) , a category which remained until the period of Japanese colonization . The large tracts of deer field , guaranteed by the Qing , were owned by the tribes and their individual members . The tribes would commonly offer Han farmers a permanent patent for use , while maintaining ownership ( skeleton ) of the subsoil ( <unk> ) , which was called " two lords to a field " ( <unk> ) . The Plains tribes were often cheated out of land or pressured to sell at unfavorable rates . Some disaffected subgroups moved to central or eastern Taiwan , but most remained in their ancestral locations and acculturated or assimilated into Han society ( Chen 1997 ) . 
 The Aboriginals often slaughtered the shipwrecked crews of western ships . In 1867 the entire American crew of the Rover were massacred by aboriginals in the Rover incident . When the Americans launched the punitive Formosa Expedition in retaliation , the aboriginals defeated the Americans and forced them to retreat , killing an American marine while suffering no casualties themselves . 
 In the Mudan Incident ( 1871 ) , Aboriginals slaughtered 54 Ryūkyūan sailors which led to the Japanese invasion of Taiwan ( 1874 ) against the Aboriginals . 
 During the Sino @-@ French War the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the Keelung Campaign . Liu <unk> , who was leading the defence of Taiwan , recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French . The French were defeated at the Battle of Tamsui and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight @-@ month @-@ long campaign before the French withdrew . 
 = = = = Migration to highlands = = = = 
 One popular narrative holds that all of the Gaoshan tribes were originally Plains tribes , which fled to the mountains under pressure from Han encroachment . This strong version of the " migration " theory has been largely discounted by contemporary research as the Gaoshan people demonstrate a physiology , material cultures and customs that have been adapted for life at higher elevations . Linguistic , archaeological , and recorded anecdotal evidence also suggests there has been island @-@ wide migration of indigenous peoples for over 3 @,@ 000 years . 
 Small sub @-@ groups of Plains Aborigines may have occasionally fled to the mountains , foothills or eastern plain to escape hostile groups of Han or other aborigines ( see Tsuchida & Yamada 1991 : 1 – 10 ; Li 2001 ) . The " displacement scenario " is more likely rooted in the older customs of many Plains groups to withdraw into the foothills during headhunting season or when threatened by a neighboring village , as observed by the Dutch during their punitive campaign of <unk> in 1636 when the bulk of the village retreated to <unk> ( Blusse & Everts 2000 : 11 – 12 ; Shepherd 1993 : 1 – 6 ; Shepherd 1995 : 66 – 72 ) . The " displacement scenario " may also stem from the inland migrations of Plains Aborigine subgroups , who were displaced by either Han or other Plains Aborigines and chose to move to the <unk> plain in 1804 , the Puli basin in 1823 and another Puli migration in 1875 . Each migration consisted of a number of families and totaled hundreds of people , not entire tribes ( Shepherd 1993 : 391 – 95 ; Pan 2002 : 36 – 7 ) . There are also recorded oral histories that recall some Plains Aborigines were sometimes captured and killed by Highlands tribes while relocating through the mountains ( Yeh 2003 ) . However , as Shepherd ( 1993 ) explained in detail , documented evidence shows that the majority of Plains people remained on the plains , intermarried Hakka and Hoklo immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong , and adopted a Han identity , where they remain today . 
 Within the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself , differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place , with most Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture , which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan . Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J. Brown between " short @-@ route " and " long @-@ route " . 
 = = = Highland tribes = = = 
 Imperial Chinese and European societies had little contact with the Highland aborigines until expeditions to the region by European and American explorers and missionaries commenced in the 19th and early 20th centuries ( Campbell 1915 ; Mackay 1896 ) . The lack of data before this was primarily the result of a Qing quarantine on the region to the east of the " earth oxen " ( <unk> ) border , which ran along the eastern edge of the western plain . Han contact with the mountain tribes was usually associated with the enterprise of gathering and extracting camphor from Camphor Laurel trees ( Cinnamomum camphora ) , native to the island and in particular the mountainous areas . The production and shipment of camphor ( used in herbal medicines and mothballs ) was then a significant industry on the island , lasting up to and including the period of Japanese rule ( Pickering 1898 : 220 – 24 . ) . These early encounters often involved headhunting parties from the Highland tribes , who sought out and raided unprotected Han forest workers . Together with traditional Han concepts of Taiwanese behavior , these raiding incidents helped to promote the Qing @-@ era popular image of the " violent " aborigine ( Teng 2004 : 230 – 36 ) . 
 Taiwanese Plains Aborigines were often employed and dispatched as interpreters to assist in the trade of goods between Han merchants and Highlands aborigines . The aborigines traded cloth , pelts and meat for iron and matchlock rifles . Iron was a necessary material for the fabrication of hunting knives — long , curved sabers that were generally used as a forest tool . These blades became notorious among Han settlers , given their alternative use to decapitate Highland tribal enemies in customary headhunting expeditions . 
 = = = = Headhunting = = = = 
 The Highland tribes were renowned for their skill in headhunting , which was a symbol of bravery and valor ( Hsu 1991 : 29 – 36 ) . Almost every tribe except the Yami ( Tao ) practiced headhunting . Once the victims had been dispatched the heads were taken then boiled and left to dry , often hanging from trees or shelves constructed for the purpose . A party returning with a head was cause for celebration , as it was believed to bring good luck . The Bunun people would often take prisoners and inscribe prayers or messages to their dead on arrows , then shoot their prisoner with the hope their prayers would be carried to the dead . Taiwanese Hoklo Han settlers and Japanese were often the victims of headhunting raids as they were considered by the aborigines to be liars and enemies . A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields , or employ the ruse of setting a dwelling alight and then decapitating the inhabitants as they fled the burning structure . It was also customary to later raise the victim 's surviving children as full members of the tribe . Often the heads themselves were ceremonially ' invited ' to join the tribe as members , where they were supposed to watch over the tribe and keep them safe . The indigenous inhabitants of Taiwan accepted the convention and practice of headhunting as one of the calculated risks of tribal life . The last groups to practice headhunting were the Paiwan , Bunun , and Atayal groups ( Montgomery @-@ McGovern 1922 ) . Japanese rule ended the practice by 1930 , but some elder Taiwanese can recall the practice ( Yeh 2003 ) . 
 = = = Japanese rule ( 1895 – 1945 ) = = = 
 When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was finalized on 17 April 1895 , Taiwan was ceded by the Qing Empire to Japan ( Gold 1986 : 36 ) . Taiwan 's incorporation into the Japanese political orbit brought Taiwanese aborigines into contact with a new colonial structure , determined to define and locate indigenous people within the framework of a new , multi @-@ ethnic empire ( Kleeman 2003 : 19 ) . The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms : anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan , attempts to reshape the aborigines in the mould of the Japanese , and military suppression . The Aboriginals and Han joined together to violently revolt against Japanese rule in the 1907 <unk> Uprising and 1915 Tapani Incident . 
 Japan 's sentiment regarding indigenous peoples was crafted around the memory of the Mudan Incident , when , in 1871 , a group of 54 shipwrecked Ryūkyūan sailors was massacred by a Paiwan group from the village of Mudan in southern Taiwan . The resulting Japanese policy , published twenty years before the onset of their rule on Taiwan , cast Taiwanese aborigines as " vicious , violent and cruel " and concluded " this is a pitfall of the world ; we must get rid of them all " ( Kleeman 2003 : 20 – 1 ) . Japanese campaigns to gain aboriginal submission were often brutal , as evidenced in the desire of Japan 's first Governor General , <unk> <unk> , to " ... conquer the barbarians " ( Kleeman 2003 : 20 ) . The Seediq Aboriginals fought against the Japanese in multiple battles such as the <unk> incident ( <unk> ) , Truku battle ( <unk> ) , 1902 <unk> incident ( <unk> ) , and the 1903 <unk> incident <unk> . In the Wushe Incident of 1930 , for example , a Seediq group was decimated by artillery and supplanted by the Taroko ( Truku ) tribe , which had sustained periods of bombardment from naval ships and airplanes dropping mustard gas . A quarantine was placed around the mountain areas enforced by armed guard stations and electrified fences until the most remote high mountain villages could be relocated closer to administrative control ( <unk> 1907 : 210 – 19 ) . 
 The Bunun Aboriginals under Chief Raho Ari ( or <unk> Ali , <unk> · <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) engaged in guerilla warfare against the Japanese for twenty years . Raho Ari 's revolt was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the Aboriginals in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over . The <unk> incident w : zh : <unk> began at <unk> when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari 's clan in 1915 . A settlement holding 266 people called <unk> was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the <unk> River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause . Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese " <unk> " of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased . 
 The 1930 " New Flora and Silva , Volume 2 " said of the mountain Aboriginals that the " majority of them live in a state of war against Japanese authority " . The Bunun and Atayal were described as the " most ferocious " Aboriginals , and police stations were targeted by Aboriginals in intermittent assaults . By January 1915 , all Aboriginals in northern Taiwan were forced to hand over their guns to the Japanese , however head hunting and assaults on police stations by Aboriginals still continued after that year . Between 1921 and 1929 Aboriginal raids died down , but a major revival and surge in Aboriginal armed resistance erupted from 1930 @-@ 1933 for four years during which the Wushe Incident occurred and Bunun carried out raids , after which armed conflict again died down . According to a 1933 @-@ year book , wounded people in the Japanese war against the Aboriginals numbered around 4 @,@ 160 , with 4 @,@ 422 civilians dead and 2 @,@ 660 military personnel killed . According to a 1935 report , 7 @,@ 081 Japanese were killed in the armed struggle from 1896 @-@ 1933 while the Japanese confiscated 29 @,@ 772 Aboriginal guns by 1933 . 
 Beginning in the first year of Japanese rule , the colonial government embarked on a mission to study the aborigines so they could be classified , located and " civilized " . The Japanese " civilizing project " , partially fueled by public demand in Japan to know more about the empire , would be used to benefit the Imperial government by consolidating administrative control over the entire island , opening up vast tracts of land for exploitation ( <unk> 2006 : 1 – 8 ) . To satisfy these needs , " the Japanese portrayed and catalogued Taiwan 's indigenous peoples in a welter of statistical tables , magazine and newspaper articles , photograph albums for popular consumption " ( Matsuda 2003 : 181 ) . The Japanese @-@ based much of their information and terminology on prior Qing era narratives concerning degrees of " civilization " ( Ka 1995 : 27 – 30 ) . 
 Japanese ethnographer Ino <unk> was charged with the task of surveying the entire population of Taiwanese aborigines , applying the first systematic study of aborigines on Taiwan . Ino 's research is best known for his formalization of eight tribes of Taiwanese aborigines : Atayal , Bunun , Saisiat , Tsou , Paiwan , Puyuma , Ami and Pepo ( Pingpu ) ( <unk> 2006 : 6 – 8 ; Blundell 2000 : 15 – 16 ) . This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish tribes that are officially recognized by the government . 
 Tribal life under the Japanese changed rapidly as many of the traditional structures were replaced by a military power . Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power . Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages . The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society , but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture , including tattooing ( Simon 2006 ) . By the mid @-@ 1930s as Japan 's empire was reaching its zenith , the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs , rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines . By the end of World War II , aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to die for the Emperor of Japan ( Ching 2001 : 153 – 73 ) . The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945 ( Mendel 1970 : 54 – 5 ) . 
 The Japanese used Aboriginal women as " comfort women " - where they served as sex slaves to Japanese troops . 
 = = = Kuomintang rule ( 1945 – 1987 ) = = = 
 Japanese rule of Taiwan ended in 1945 , following the armistice with the allies on September 2 and the subsequent appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party ( Kuomintang , or KMT ) on October 25 . In 1949 , on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China , Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek led the Kuomintang in a retreat from Mainland China , withdrawing its government and 1 @.@ 3 million refugees to Taiwan . The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government , and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence . The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party 's decades @-@ long history of fighting <unk> in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following the demise of the imperial Qing . The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese cultural identity ( as defined by the state ) at the expense of local cultures . Following the February 28 Incident , the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under martial law , which was to last for nearly four decades . 
 Taiwanese aborigines first encountered the Nationalist government in 1946 , when the Japanese village schools were replaced by schools of the KMT . Documents from the Education Office show an emphasis on Chinese language , history and citizenship — with a curriculum steeped in pro @-@ KMT ideology . Some elements of the curriculum , such as the Wu Feng Legend , are currently considered offensive to aborigines ( Gao 2001 ) . Much of the burden of educating the aborigines was undertaken by unqualified teachers , who could , at best , speak Mandarin and teach basic ideology ( Harrison 2001 : 68 – 70 ) . In 1951 a major political socialization campaign was launched to change the lifestyle of many aborigines , to adopt Han Chinese customs . A 1953 government report on mountain areas stated that its aims were chiefly to promote Mandarin in order to strengthen a national outlook and create good customs . This was included in the Shandi <unk> Hua ( <unk> ) policy to " make the mountains like the plains " . Critics of the KMT 's program for a centralized national culture regard it as institutionalized ethnic discrimination , and point to the loss of several indigenous languages and a perpetuation of shame for being an aborigine as the direct result of what has been referred to as Han chauvinism . 
 The pattern of intermarriage continued , as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal women who were from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives ( Harrison 2003 : 351 ) . Modern studies show a high degree of genetic intermixing . Despite this , many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage . In a 1994 study , it was found that 71 % of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man . For much of the KMT era , the official government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100 % aboriginal parentage , leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non @-@ aboriginal child . Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child . 
 = = = Transition to democracy = = = 
 Authoritarian rule under the Kuomintang ended gradually through a transition to democracy , which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987 . Soon after , the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system , though maintaining a high degree of power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks ( Stainton 2006 : 400 – 10 ) . The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng @-@ hui . However , they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power . The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups . The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics . 
 During the period of political liberalization , which preceded the end of martial law , academic interest in the Plains Aborigines surged as amateur and professional historians sought to rediscover Taiwan 's past . The opposition tang wai activists seized upon the new image of the Plains Aborigines as a means to directly challenge the KMT 's official narrative of Taiwan as a historical part of China , and the government 's assertion that Taiwanese were " pure " Han Chinese ( Hsiau 2000 : 170 ; Brown 2004 : 23 – 9 ) . Many tang wai activists framed the Plains aboriginal experience in the existing anti @-@ colonialism / victimization Taiwanese nationalist narrative , which positioned the Hoklo @-@ speaking Taiwanese in the role of indigenous people and the victims of successive foreign rulers ( Hsiau 2000 : 171 – 73 ; Edmondson 2002 : 32 – 42 ; Su 1986 ) . By the late 1980s many <unk> and Hakka @-@ speaking people began identifying themselves as Plains Aborigines , though any initial shift in ethnic consciousness from Hakka or Hoklo people was minor . Despite the politicized dramatization of the Plains Aborigines , their " rediscovery " as a matter of public discourse has had a lasting effect on the increased socio @-@ political <unk> of Taiwan — emerging from a Han Chinese @-@ dominant perspective into a wider acceptance of Taiwan as a multi @-@ cultural and multi @-@ ethnic community ( Hsiau 2000 : 171 ) . 
 In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to vote for the Kuomintang , to the point that the legislative seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan @-@ blue coalition . This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan @-@ green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT . However , this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds , and as part of an inter @-@ ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate . Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves . Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty @-@ five year reign ( Stainton 2006 : 401 – 10 ; Gao 2007 ; Eyton 2004 ) . 
 = = Aborigines in the democratic era = = 
 The democratic era has been a time of great change , both constructive and destructive , for the aborigines of Taiwan . Since the 1980s , increased political and public attention has been paid to the rights and social issues of the indigenous tribes of Taiwan . Aborigines have realized gains in both the political and economic spheres . Though progress is ongoing , there remain a number of still unrealized goals within the framework of the ROC : " although certainly more ' equal ' than they were 20 , or even 10 , years ago , the indigenous inhabitants in Taiwan still remain on the lowest rungs of the legal and socioeconomic ladders " ( Ericsson 2004 ) . On the other hand , bright spots are not hard to find . A resurgence in ethnic pride has accompanied the aboriginal cultural renaissance , which is exemplified by the increased popularity of aboriginal music and greater public interest in aboriginal culture ( Gluck 2005 ) . 
 = = = Aboriginal political movement = = = 
 The movement for indigenous cultural and political resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( 1948 ) ( Liu 2006 ) . Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter , four decades of martial law controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan . The political liberalization Taiwan experienced leading up to the official end of martial law on 15 July 15 , 1987 , opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT . 
 In December 1984 , the Taiwan Aboriginal People 's Movement was launched when a group of aboriginal political activists , aided by the progressive Presbyterian Church in Taiwan ( PCT ) ( Stainton 2002 ) , established the Alliance of Taiwan Aborigines ( ATA , or yuan chuan hui ) to highlight the problems experienced by indigenous communities all over Taiwan , including : prostitution , economic disparity , land rights and official discrimination in the form of naming rights ( Faure 2001 : 98 – 100 ; Stainton 1999 ; Hsieh 2006 ) . 
 In 1988 , amid the ATA 's Return Our Land Movement , in which aborigines demanded the return of lands to the original inhabitants , the ATA sent its first representative to the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations ( Hsieh 2006 : 47 – 9 ) . Following the success in addressing the UN , the " Return Our Land " movement evolved into the Aboriginal Constitution Movement , in which the aboriginal representatives demanded appropriate wording in the ROC Constitution to ensure indigenous Taiwanese " dignity and justice " in the form of enhanced legal protection , government assistance to improve living standards in indigenous communities , and the right to identify themselves as " yuan chu min " ( Stainton 1999 : 39 ) . The KMT government initially opposed the term , due to its implication that other people on Taiwan , including the KMT government , were newcomers and not entitled to the island . The KMT preferred hsien chu min ( <unk> , " First people " ) , or <unk> chu min ( <unk> , " Early People " ) to evoke a sense of general historical immigration to Taiwan ( Stainton 1999 : 38 – 9 ) . 
 To some degree the movement has been successful . Beginning in 1998 , the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has been changed to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines . In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry @-@ level rank within the Executive Yuan . The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents , offsetting the long @-@ held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine . A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal / Han parents . 
 The present political leaders in the aboriginal community , led mostly by aboriginal elites born after 1949 , have been effective in leveraging their ethnic identity and socio @-@ linguistic acculturation into contemporary Taiwanese society against the political backdrop of a changing Taiwan ( Rudolph 2003 : 123 ) . This has allowed indigenous people a means to push for greater political space , including the still unrealized prospect of Indigenous People 's Autonomous Areas within Taiwan ( Liu 2006 : 427 – 29 ; Ericsson 2004 ; Cheng 2007 ) . In recent years however , the drive by the " ethnic elites " to promote aboriginal particularity has run in contrast to ordinary aborigines who wish to assimilate into contemporary social norms . 
 = = = Aboriginal political representation = = = 
 Aborigines were represented by eight members out of 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan . In 2008 , the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113 , of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members , three each for lowland and highland tribes ( " Legislative Yuan " 2004 ) . The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote for members of the pan @-@ blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature . Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan @-@ blue has been seen as giving the pan @-@ blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted ( Gao 2007 ) . 
 The deep @-@ rooted hostility between Aboriginals and ( Taiwanese ) Hoklo , and the Aboriginal communities effective KMT networks , contribute to Aboriginal skepticism against the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) and the Aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT . 
 Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the " <unk> " movement for political gains , such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP 's " rectification " by recognizing the Taroko for political reasons , with the majority of mountain townships voting for Ma Ying @-@ jeou . The Atayal and Seediq slammed the Truku for their name rectification . 
 In 2005 the Kuomintang displayed a massive photo of the anti @-@ Japanese Aboriginal leader Mona <unk> at its headquarters in honor of the 60th anniversary of Taiwan 's handover from Japan to the Republic of China . 
 May Chin led Aboriginal legislators to protest against the Japanese at Yasukuni shrine . 
 Aboriginals protested against the 14th Dalai Lama during his visit to Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot and denounced it as politically motivated . 
 = = = Inter @-@ tribal conflicts = = = 
 During the Wushe Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona <unk> revolted against the Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not . The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku ( Taroko ) was aggravated by Wushe Incident , since the Japanese had long played them off against each other and the Japanese used Toda and Truku ( Taroko ) collaborators to massacre the Tkdaya . Tkdaya land was given to the Truku ( Taroko ) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident . The Truku had resisted and fought the Japanese before in the 1914 Truku war <unk> but had since been pacified and collaborated with the Japanese in the 1930 Wushe against the Tkdaya . 
 = = = Economic issues = = = 
 Many indigenous communities did not evenly share in the benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during the last quarter of the 20th century . They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations , undermining their pursuit of marketable skills . The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines , which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training . Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity , including isolation , culture shock , and discrimination from their peers ( Chou 2005 : 8 – 13 ) . The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines ( Meyer 2001 : 27 ; Hsu 1991 : 95 – 9 ) . 
 The economic boom resulted in drawing large numbers of aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low @-@ skilled sector of the urban workforce ( <unk> 2000 ; CIP 2004 ) . Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages . The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other tribes as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs as part of the labor force . The aborigines became the most skilled iron @-@ workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects . The result was a mass exodus of tribal members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages , who could not learn their languages or customs while employed . Often , young aborigines in the cities fell into gangs aligned with the construction trade . Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia , Vietnam and the Philippines have led to an increased atmosphere among urban aborigines of xenophobia and encouraged the formulation of a pan @-@ indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection ( Chu 2001 : 167 – 69 ) . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Of the current population of Taiwanese aborigines , about 70 % identify themselves as Christian . Moreover , many of the Plains groups have mobilized their members around predominantly Christian organizations ; most notably the Taiwan Presbyterian Church and Catholicism ( Stainton 2006 : 393 – 98 ) . 
 Before contact with Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods , Taiwanese aborigines held a variety of beliefs in spirits , gods , sacred symbols and myths that helped their societies find meaning and order . Although there is no evidence of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups , there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior . The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture . Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs . The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan Hundred Pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many tribal designs ( Montgomery @-@ McGovern 1922 : 145 – 46 ) . In many Plains Aborigines societies , the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs . During the period of Dutch colonization , the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work ( Blusse 2006 : 71 – 82 ) . 
 During the Zheng and Qing eras , Han immigrants brought <unk> beliefs of Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan 's indigenous people . Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices , though there is evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs . In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility , Ali @-@ zu ( A @-@ li @-@ tsu ) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon ( Shepherd 1986 : 1 – 81 ) . The use of female spirit mediums ( tongji ) can also be traced to the earlier matrilineal Inibs . 
 Although many aborigines assumed Han religious practices , several sub @-@ groups sought protection from the European missionaries , who had started arriving in the 1860s . Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought protection from the oppressive Han . The missionaries , under the articles of extraterritoriality , offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines ( Shepherd 1993 : 382 ) . Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity , language and cultures . 
 The influence of 19th- and 20th @-@ century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration . Many of the churches have replaced earlier tribal functions , but continue to retain a sense of continuity and community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity . Several church leaders have emerged from within the tribes to take on leadership positions in petitioning the government in the interest of indigenous peoples ( Stainton 2006 : 420 – 22 ) and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality . 
 = = = Ecological issues = = = 
 The indigenous tribes of Taiwan are closely linked with ecological awareness and conservation issues on the island , as many of the environmental issues are spearheaded by aborigines . Political activism and sizable public protests regarding the logging of the <unk> Formosan Cypress , as well as efforts by an Atayal member of the Legislative Yuan , " focused debate on natural resource management and specifically on the involvement of aboriginal people therein " ( Chen & Hay 2004 : 1124 ) . Another high @-@ profile case is the nuclear waste storage facility on Orchid Island , a small tropical island 60 km ( 37 mi ; 32 nmi ) off the southeast coast of Taiwan . The inhabitants are the 4 @,@ 000 members of the Tao ( or Yami ) tribe . In the 1970s the island was designated as a possible site to store low and medium grade nuclear waste . The island was selected on the grounds that it would be cheaper to build the necessary infrastructure for storage and it was thought that the population would not cause trouble ( Cohen 1988 : 355 – 57 ) . Large @-@ scale construction began in 1978 on a site 100 m ( 330 ft ) from the <unk> fishing fields . The Tao tribe alleges that government sources at the time described the site as a " factory " or a " fish cannery " , intended to bring " jobs [ to the ] home of the Tao / Yami , one of the least economically integrated areas in Taiwan " ( Ericsson 2004 ) . When the facility was completed in 1982 , however , it was in fact a storage facility for " 97 @,@ 000 barrels of low @-@ radiation nuclear waste from Taiwan 's three nuclear power plants " . ( " Premier apologizes " 2002 ) . The Tao have since stood at the forefront of the anti @-@ nuclear movement and launched several exorcisms and protests to remove the waste they claim has resulted in deaths and sickness ( " Tao demand " 2003 ) . The lease on the land has expired , and an alternative site has yet to be selected ( Loa 2010 ) . 
 = = = Parks , tourism , and commercialization = = = 
 Aboriginal groups are seeking to preserve their <unk> and languages as well as to return to , or remain on , their traditional lands . Eco @-@ tourism , sewing and selling tribal carvings , jewelry and music have become viable areas of economic opportunity . However , tourism @-@ based commercial development , such as the creation of Taiwan Aboriginal Culture Park , is not a panacea . Although these create new jobs , aborigines are seldom given management positions . Moreover , some national parks have been built on aboriginal lands against the wishes of the local tribes , prompting one Taroko activist to label the Taroko National Park as a form of " environmental colonialism " ( Simon 2006 ) . At times , the creation of national parks has resulted in forced resettlement of the aborigines ( Lin 2006 ) . 
 Due to the close proximity of aboriginal land to the mountains , many tribes have hoped to cash in on hot spring ventures and hotels , where they offer singing and dancing to add to the ambience . The <unk> Atayal in particular have been active in this area . Considerable government funding has been allocated to museums and culture centers focusing on Taiwan 's aboriginal heritage . Critics often call the ventures exploitative and " superficial portrayals " of aboriginal culture , which distract attention from the real problems of substandard education ( Mo 2005 ) . Proponents of ethno @-@ tourism suggest that such projects can positively impact the public image and economic prospects of the indigenous community . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 A full @-@ time aboriginal radio station , " Ho @-@ hi @-@ yan " , was launched in 2005 ( Ho Hi Yan 2005 ) with the help of the Executive Yuan , to focus on issues of interest to the indigenous community . This came on the heels of a " New wave of Indigenous Pop " ( Liu 2000 ) , as aboriginal artists , such as A @-@ mei , Pur @-@ dur and <unk> ( Puyuma tribe ) , <unk> , A @-@ Lin ( Ami tribe ) , Princess Ai <unk> ( Paiwan tribe ) , and Landy Wen ( Atayal tribe ) became international pop @-@ stars . The rock musician Chang Chen @-@ <unk> is a member of the Ami tribe . Music has given aborigines both a sense of pride and a sense of cultural ownership . The issue of ownership was exemplified when the musical project Enigma used an Ami chant in their song " Return to Innocence " , which was selected as the official theme of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics . The main chorus was sung by <unk> and his wife , <unk> . The Amis couple successfully sued Enigma 's record label , which then paid royalties to the French museum that held the master recordings of the traditional songs , but the original artists , who had been unaware of the Enigma project , remained uncompensated . ( Anderson 2000 : 283 – 90 ) 
 = 1920 Dayton Triangles season = 
 The 1920 Dayton Triangles season was the franchise 's inaugural season in the American Professional Football Association ( AFPA ) — later named the National Football League . The Triangles entered the season coming off a 5 – 2 – 1 record in 1919 in the Ohio League . After the 1919 season , several representatives from the Ohio League wanted to form a new professional league ; thus , the APFA was created . A majority of the team stayed from the 1919 team , including the coaching staff , while two players left the team . 
 The Triangles opened the season with a win against the Columbus Panhandles . This game is considered the first league game where two APFA teams played against each other . After a six @-@ game winning streak , the Triangles faced their first loss of the season to the future champions , the Akron Pros . This team would give the Triangles their only two losses of the year . The Triangles finished the season with a 5 – 2 – 2 record , which earned them sixth place in the APFA standings . No players were awarded with the first team All @-@ Pro award , Norb Sacksteder made the second team , and Frank Bacon made the third team . 
 = = Offseason = = 
 The Dayton Triangles finished 5 – 2 – 1 in their 1919 season in the Ohio League . The Triangles had several players added to their team for the 1920 season : Max Broadhurst , Doc Davis , Guy Early , Russ Hathaway , Chuck <unk> , <unk> Lentz , Norb Sacksteder , Ed Sauer , Fritz Slackford , and Tiny Turner . Two players — one with a last name Albers , and one with a last name Yerges — did not play for the Triangles in 1920 , and the coaching staff stayed the same . 
 After the 1919 season , representatives of four Ohio League teams — the Canton Bulldogs , the Cleveland Tigers , the Dayton Triangles , and the Akron Pros — called a meeting on August 20 , 1920 to discuss the formation of a new league . At the meeting , they tentatively agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players already under contract with other teams . They also agreed on a name for the circuit : the American Professional Football Conference . They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17 . 
 At that meeting , held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay 's Hupmobile showroom in Canton , representatives of the Rock Island Independents , the Muncie Flyers , the Decatur Staleys , the Racine Cardinals , the Massillon Tigers , the Chicago Cardinals , and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league . Representatives of the Buffalo All @-@ Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting , but sent letters to Hay asking to be included in the league . Team representatives changed the league 's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers , installing Jim Thorpe as president . Under the new league structure , teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed , so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played . Also , representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy .

 = Henrietta Swan Leavitt = 
 Henrietta Swan Leavitt ( July 4 , 1868 – December 12 , 1921 ) was an American astronomer who discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars . A graduate of Radcliffe College , Leavitt started working at the Harvard College Observatory as a " computer " in 1893 , examining photographic plates in order to measure and catalog the brightness of stars . Though she received little recognition in her lifetime , it was her discovery that first allowed astronomers to measure the distance between the Earth and faraway galaxies . She explained her discovery : " A straight line can readily be drawn among each of the two series of points corresponding to maxima and minima , thus showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the variables and their periods . " After Leavitt 's death , Edwin Hubble used the luminosity – period relation for Cepheids together with spectral shifts first measured by fellow astronomer Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory to determine that the universe is expanding ( see Hubble 's law ) . 
 = = Early years and education = = 
 Henrietta Swan Leavitt , the daughter of Congregational church minister George Roswell Leavitt and his wife Henrietta Swan ( Kendrick ) , was born in Lancaster , Massachusetts , a descendant of Deacon John Leavitt , an English Puritan tailor , who settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early seventeenth century . ( The family name was spelled Levett in early Massachusetts records . ) She attended Oberlin College , and graduated from Radcliffe College , then called the Society for the Collegiate Instruction for Women , with a bachelor 's degree in 1892 . She studied a broad curriculum including classical Greek , fine arts , philosophy , analytic geometry and calculus . It wasn 't until her fourth year of college that Leavitt took a course in astronomy , in which she earned an A – . She then traveled in America and in Europe during which time she lost her hearing . 
 = = Career = = 
 In 1893 , Leavitt began working at the Harvard College Observatory as one of the women human " computers " hired by Edward Charles Pickering to measure and catalog the brightness of stars as they appeared in the observatory 's photographic plate collection . ( In the early 1900s , women were not allowed to operate telescopes ) . Because Leavitt had independent means , Pickering initially did not have to pay her . Later , she received $ 0 @.@ 30 an hour for her work . She was reportedly “ hard @-@ working , serious @-@ minded … , little given to frivolous pursuits and selflessly devoted to her family , her church , and her career . ” 
 Pickering assigned Leavitt to study " variable stars , " whose luminosity varies over time . According to science writer Jeremy Bernstein , " variable stars had been of interest for years , but when she was studying those plates , I doubt Pickering thought she would make a significant discovery — one that would eventually change astronomy . " Leavitt noted thousands of variable stars in images of the Magellanic Clouds . In 1908 she published her results in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College , noting that a few of the variables showed a pattern : brighter ones appeared to have longer periods . After further study , she confirmed in 1912 that the Cepheid variables with greater intrinsic luminosity did have longer periods , and that the relationship was quite close and predictable . 
 Leavitt used the simplifying assumption that all of the Cepheids within each Magellanic Cloud were at approximately the same distances from Earth , so that their intrinsic brightness could be deduced from their apparent brightness ( as measured from the photographic plates ) and from the distance to each of the clouds . " Since the variables are probably at nearly the same distance from the Earth , their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light , as determined by their mass , density , and surface brightness . " 
 Her discovery , which she produced from studying some 1 @,@ 777 variable stars recorded on Harvard 's photographic plates , is known as the " period – luminosity relationship " or " Leavitt 's law " : The logarithm of the period is linearly , ( i.e. , directly ) related to the logarithm of the star 's average intrinsic optical luminosity ( which is the amount of power radiated by the star in the visible spectrum ) . In Leavitt 's words , " A straight line can be readily drawn among each of the two series of points corresponding to maxima and minima , thus showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the Cepheid variables and their periods . " 
 Leavitt also developed and continued to refine the Harvard Standard for photographic measurements , a logarithmic scale that orders stars by brightness over 17 magnitudes . She initially analyzed 299 plates from 13 telescopes to construct her scale , which was accepted by the International Committee of Photographic Magnitudes in 1913 . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The period – luminosity relationship for Cepheids made them the first " standard candle " in astronomy , allowing scientists to compute the distances to galaxies too remote for stellar parallax observations to be useful . One year after Leavitt reported her results , Ejnar Hertzsprung determined the distance of several Cepheids in the Milky Way , and with this calibration the distance to any Cepheid could be accurately determined . 
 Cepheids were soon detected in other galaxies , such as Andromeda ( notably by Edwin Hubble in 1923 – 24 ) , and they became an important part of the evidence that " spiral nebulae " are actually independent galaxies located far outside of our own Milky Way . Thus , Leavitt 's discovery would forever change our picture of the universe , as it prompted Harlow Shapley to move our Sun from the center of the galaxy in the " Great Debate " and Edwin Hubble to move our galaxy from the center of the universe . 
 The accomplishments of the American astronomer Edwin Hubble , who established that the universe is expanding , were also made possible by Leavitt 's groundbreaking research . " If Henrietta Leavitt had provided the key to determine the size of the cosmos , then it was Edwin Powell Hubble who inserted it in the lock and provided the observations that allowed it to be turned , " wrote David H. and Matthew D.H. Clark in their book Measuring the Cosmos . To his credit , Hubble himself often said that Leavitt deserved the Nobel Prize for her work . Gösta Mittag @-@ Leffler of the Swedish Academy of Sciences tried to nominate her for that prize in 1924 , only to learn that she had died of cancer three years earlier ( The Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously ) . Though she was paid only $ 10 @.@ 50 per week , her discovery of a way to accurately measure distances on an inter @-@ galactic scale paved the way for modern astronomy ’ s understanding of the structure and scale of the universe . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 Leavitt worked sporadically during her time at Harvard , often sidelined by health problems and family obligations . An illness contracted after her graduation from Radcliffe College rendered her increasingly deaf . In 1921 , when Harlow Shapley took over as director of the observatory , Leavitt was made head of stellar photometry . By the end of that year she had succumbed to cancer , and was buried in the Leavitt family plot at Cambridge Cemetery in Cambridge , Massachusetts . 
 " Sitting at the top of a gentle hill , " writes George Johnson in his biography of Leavitt , " the spot is marked by a tall hexagonal monument , on top of which ( cradled on a draped marble pedestal ) sits a globe . Her uncle Erasmus Darwin Leavitt and his family are also buried there , along with other <unk> . ... " A plaque memorializing Henrietta and her two siblings Mira and Roswell is mounted on one side of the monument . Nearby are the graves of Henry and William James . There is no epitaph at the gravesite memorializing Henrietta Leavitt 's achievements in astronomy . 
 Leavitt was a member of Phi Beta Kappa , the American Association of University Women , the American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , and an honorary member of the American Association of Variable Star Observers . Her early death was seen as a tragedy by her colleagues for reasons that went beyond her scientific achievements . In an obituary her colleague , Solon I. Bailey , noted that " she had the happy faculty of appreciating all that was worthy and lovable in others , and was possessed of a nature so full of sunshine that , to her , all of life became beautiful and full of meaning . "

 The asteroid 5383 Leavitt and the crater Leavitt on the Moon are named after her to honor deaf men and women who have worked as astronomers . 
 Unaware of her death four years prior , the Swedish mathematician Gösta Mittag @-@ Leffler considered nominating her for the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics , and wrote to Shapley requesting more information on her work on Cepheid variables , offering to send her his monograph on Sofia <unk> . Shapley replied , let Mittag @-@ Leffler know that Leavitt had died , and suggested that the true credit belonged to his ( Shapley 's ) interpretation of her findings .

 = High Desert ( Oregon ) = 
 The Oregon high desert is a region of the U.S. state of Oregon , located east of the Cascade Range and south of the Blue Mountains , in the central and eastern parts of the state . Divided into a southern region and a northern region , the desert covers most of five Oregon counties and averages 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) above sea level . The southwest region is part of the Great Basin and the southeast is the lower Owyhee River watershed . The northern region is part of the Columbia Plateau , where somewhat more rainfall allows the largest industry on private land to be the cultivation of alfalfa and hay . Public land within the region is owned primarily by the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) , which manages more than 30 @,@ 000 square miles ( 78 @,@ 000 km2 ) , including five rivers designated as Wild and Scenic . 
 While the high desert is somewhat dry , it is only arid relative to Western Oregon . The region averages 15 inches ( 380 mm ) of annual rainfall ; the Alvord Desert , however , gets only 7 inches ( 180 mm ) of rain each year . Contrary to its name , most of the high desert is not dry enough to truly qualify as desert , and biologically , most of the region is classified as scrubland or steppe . 
 At 9 @,@ 733 feet ( 2 @,@ 967 m ) above sea level , the summit of Steens Mountain is the highest point in the high desert . The broad fault @-@ block mountain is characteristic of the basin and range plate tectonics of the high desert . About 16 million years ago , during the early Miocene epoch , lava flows from volcanic eruptions covered about half the surface area of Oregon . The Earth 's crust then began stretching , giving way to further volcanic activity from 15 million to 2 million years ago . Several ice ages over this time formed the large lakes in the high desert . 
 The climate of the high desert provides habitat for mammals such as pronghorn , coyote , mule deer , black @-@ tailed jackrabbit , and cougar . Birds common in the region include sage grouse , California quail , and prairie falcon . The western juniper is the most common tree in the region , and big sagebrush and common woolly sunflower are the region 's most widespread plants . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The high desert of Oregon is located in the central and southeastern part of the state . It covers approximately 24 @,@ 000 square miles ( 62 @,@ 000 km2 ) , extending approximately 200 miles ( 320 km ) from central Oregon east to the Idaho border and 130 miles ( 210 km ) from central Oregon to the Nevada border to the south . Most of the region is located in Crook , Deschutes , Harney , Lake , and Malheur counties . 
 The high desert gets its name from its generally high elevation , averaging about 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) across the region . It is bordered by the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range to the west . The Blue Mountains are the geographical boundary to the north , marking the northern end of the high desert 's semi @-@ arid plateau . The southern high desert is part of North America 's Basin and Range Province , which extends south through Nevada and Arizona , into Mexico . It contains large alkali lakes and tall cliffs , some with a prominence of more than 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) . Steens Mountain , in Harney County , is the highest point within the region ; its summit is 9 @,@ 733 feet ( 2 @,@ 967 m ) above sea level . To the east , the high desert country of the Columbia Plateau extends across the Snake River and into Idaho . 
 A number of rivers flow through the high desert region . These include the Deschutes River and its tributary the Crooked River , as well as the Malheur , Owyhee , and John Day rivers , which are all within the Columbia River watershed . Since the high desert encompasses the portion of the hydrographic Great Basin located in Oregon , smaller rivers in the high desert flow into closed basins . The <unk> River , the Donner und Blitzen River , and the <unk> River each flow into some of the high desert 's salt lakes . 
 = = = Land use = = = 
 The largest landowner in eastern Oregon is the U.S. government . The Bureau of Land Management administers over 13 @.@ 6 million acres ( 55 @,@ 000 km2 ) in the bureau 's Burns , Lakeview , <unk> , and Vale districts , most of which are in the state 's high desert country . In addition , Congress has designated specific sections of the Crooked , Deschutes , Donner und Blitzen , Malheur , and Owyhee rivers as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System . 
 Agriculture is the largest industry in the region . Livestock ranches utilize large tracts of private and government land for grazing . Ranchers raise cattle and sheep in many parts of the region . Because of low rainfall , most crops require irrigation . Agricultural crops include alfalfa and other hay crops , wheat , oats , barley , potatoes , onions , sugar beets , and mint . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Between 17 and 15 million years ago , magma from deep beneath eastern Oregon rose to the Earth 's surface , causing a period of significant volcanic activity . A series of lava floods erupted from fissures near the Oregon @-@ Idaho @-@ Washington border . The resulting lava flows traveled up to 400 miles ( 640 km ) from their source . Some individual flows covered as much as 10 @,@ 000 square miles ( 26 @,@ 000 km2 ) to a depth of 100 feet ( 30 m ) . Eventually , these lava flows covered half the state of Oregon , creating a formation known as the Columbia River Basalt Group , the geologic foundation beneath much of the high desert . 
 After the original eruptions subsided , the Earth 's crust began to stretch and crack . Between 15 and 2 million years ago , this created hundreds of new volcanoes that added additional layers of lava on top of the Columbia River Basalt and left behind hundreds of lava tubes . These new flows blanketed the southeastern third of the state . Many of the volcanoes and smaller cinder cones from this period still exist in eastern Oregon . Afterwards , subsequent rifting produced large fault @-@ block mountains throughout the region . The escarpment @-@ type mountains and high @-@ elevation valleys created by these faults produced the basin and range landscape that makes up much of Oregon 's high desert country . 
 During the last two million years , a series of ice ages altered the landscape . As each ice sheet melted , runoff and increased rainfall filled many of the region 's closed basins , forming large pluvial lakes . The Goose Lake , Harney , and Klamath basins were filled along with many other smaller basins . Some of the lakes covered as much as 1 @,@ 000 square miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km2 ) . However , as the climate became drier , these large lakes shrank away . Goose Lake , Harney Lake , Malheur Lake , Summer Lake , Lake Abert , and the Warner Lakes are remnants of ancient pluvial lakes . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Annual precipitation throughout Oregon 's high desert region is relatively low , averaging less than 15 inches ( 380 mm ) per year in most areas . Bend , the region 's largest city , only receives 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of precipitation per year . Burns receives about 11 inches ( 280 mm ) of precipitation annually , while Rome , in central Malheur County , and the official weather station at Whitehorse Ranch in southern Harney County receive only 8 inches ( 200 mm ) in an average year . Some of the mountainous areas , however , receive significantly more precipitation in the form of snow . For example , the high @-@ elevation city of Lakeview has an average annual snowfall of nearly 68 inches ( 1 @,@ 700 mm ) . 
 The majority of high desert areas receive most precipitation in the winter months , decreasing steadily through late summer into the fall . Some areas in the eastern and southern parts of the region receive peak precipitation in the late spring and early summer . For example , at Hart Mountain in Lake County , the wettest time of the year is March through June . The driest months throughout Oregon 's high desert are July through September ; however , there are still isolated thunderstorms during that period . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Native peoples and white settlement = = = 
 The indigenous people of the high desert region are the Northern Paiute people . These Native Americans were once semi @-@ nomadic hunter @-@ gatherers who relied on nuts , roots , seeds , berries , and eggs , and animals such as deer , pronghorn , geese , quail , rabbits , and bear , following their food to high and low elevations depending on the time of year . They make sandals , traps , and fishing nets , and weave baskets . Made out of sagebrush , willow , tule plant , Indian hemp , and sumac fibers , the baskets are tight enough to carry water . Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 Throughout the 18th century and into the early 19th century , the Northern Paiute had numerous conflicts with tribes who lived to the northwest . The Wasco @-@ Wishram and other Chinook tribes often encroached on the high desert landscape of the Northern Paiute territory . After one such incident in 1811 , the Northern Paiute migrated north to the Columbia River and attacked Wasco canoes . Around this time , the Northern Paiute numbered approximately 7 @,@ 500 . The Snake War , a war between the natives and white settlers in the region in the 1860s , killed roughly two thirds of the population of the Northern Paiute . The whites won the war and then set aside the Malheur Reservation for the Northern Paiute and other Oregon Native American tribes . 
 White settlers who had traveled to Oregon along the Oregon Trail began to live in the high desert region in the 1850s and the 1860s , after they had begun farming and logging in the Willamette Valley and other lands in western Oregon . Thousands of these emigrants reached the area from the west , crossing the Cascade Range to make land claims in eastern Oregon . The high desert area was settled by whites later than western Oregon in part because of Elijah White 's failure to find a pass east through the Cascades . Once they had claimed more land , pioneers and members of the American government negotiated treaties with natives in the high desert and elsewhere in Oregon , often forcing them off their native lands and on to reservations . 
 In 1866 , American soldiers established Camp Warner , a military camp near present @-@ day Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Lake County . They were sent from Boise , Idaho , to build a military camp in the high desert , and built it east of the Warner Lakes , because they doubted that they could cross the series of wetlands . Maj. Gen. George Crook disapproved of the soldiers ' decision . He built a road across the lakes and moved the camp to the western side of them . 
 Of the four major cities in the high desert , <unk> was established earliest . Its post office originally opened under the name , " Prine " , in 1871 . It was named for Barney Prine , a whisky and metal merchant in the area . Lakeview 's post office was then established in 1876 . At that time , Goose Lake was larger , and it was visible from the post office . The Burns post office opened in 1884 and the city was established in 1891 . It was named for the Scottish poet Robert Burns . Bend 's name was derived from the phrase , " Farewell Bend , " the location where pioneers traveling through the area last saw the Deschutes River . The Bend post office was established in 1904 . 
 In 1878 , the Bannock people and northern Shoshone tribes participated in the Bannock War , a war against white settlers in the region over the destruction of camas root — a major source of food for the natives — by white settlers ' hogs . The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict , and once the white settlers had won the war , the natives were allotted into various reservations . The Northern Paiute were sent to the Yakama Indian Reservation , and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States . 
 White settlers created the 13 @,@ 736 @-@ acre ( 5 @,@ 559 ha ) Burns Paiute Reservation , just north of Burns , in 1897 . The reservation was established in 1972 . It is home to the descendants of the Wada Tika band of Northern Paiutes . As of 1992 , it had 356 members . As of 1980 , there were 57 descendants of the Northern Paiute tribe living outside of the reservation .

 In the 19th century , Oregon 's high desert area was called the Great Sandy Desert ( a misnomer , as there is very little sand in the region ) , the Rolling Sage Plain , and the Artemisia Desert . Over the years , the region has also been known as Oregon 's Empty Quarter , the Great Wide Open , and Oregon 's Cowboy Country . Today , many local residents call it the Oregon Outback . However , the old names are occasionally still used . A 1996 National Geographic magazine " Map of the United States Physical Landscape " used the pioneer name , Great Sandy Desert , to identify the southeastern quarter of Oregon . However , the region is most commonly known as Oregon 's " High Desert " . " High Desert " is the official name for a plain in Deschutes County , as recognized by the United States Board on Geographic Names . Variant names for the High Desert are " Great Sandy Desert " and " Rolling Sage Plains " .

 The Oregon Badlands Wilderness , 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of Bend , has vegetation typical of the high desert region . The native plants are adapted to survive on less than 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rain per year . The area is dominated by big sagebrush and rabbitbrush along with hardy grasses like Idaho fescue , bluebunch wheatgrass , and bunchgrass . In the spring , there are native wildflowers such as Yellow Oregon sunshine , dwarf purple monkeyflower , sulfur buckwheat , Indian paintbrush , and mariposa lilies . Other high desert wildflowers common throughout the region include buttercups , <unk> , <unk> , primroses , and coral mallow . The Oregon Badlands Wilderness also contains the oldest known tree in Oregon , a Western juniper estimated to be more than 1 @,@ 600 years old . 
 Hundreds of animal species are found in Oregon 's high desert environment . In the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge alone , there are over 300 , including 239 bird species and 42 mammals . Throughout the high desert region , Mule deer , pronghorn , coyotes , American badgers , and Black @-@ tailed Jackrabbits are common . Elk , bighorn sheep , cougars , bobcats , gray foxes , red foxes , North American porcupines , and North American beavers are also found in some parts of the high desert . 
 Smaller mammals native to the area include long @-@ tailed weasels , woodchucks , cottontail rabbits , pygmy rabbits , golden @-@ mantled ground squirrels , antelope squirrels , Townsend 's ground squirrels , yellow @-@ pine chipmunks , Ord 's kangaroo rats , and northern pocket gophers . Mice species include Great Basin pocket mouse , northern grasshopper mouse , western harvest mouse , deer mouse , meadow mouse , and creeping vole . There are also numerous bat species that live in Oregon 's high desert country . 
 Common high @-@ desert birds include sage grouse , quail , and sage thrasher . Near high @-@ desert lakes and in riparian areas , there are American dusky flycatchers , yellow warblers , orange @-@ crowned warblers , house wrens , spotted towhees , Brewer 's blackbirds , western meadowlarks , swallows , and <unk> mountain chickadees , Cassin 's finches , black @-@ headed grosbeaks , green @-@ tailed towhees , yellow @-@ rumped warblers , MacGillivray 's warblers , mountain bluebirds , common ravens , northern flickers , and white @-@ headed woodpeckers are common in parts of the region .

 Michael Alan Weiner ( born March 31 , 1942 ) , better known by his professional name Michael Savage , is an American radio host , author , activist , nutritionist , and conservative political commentator . He is the host of The Savage Nation , a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012 , and in 2009 was the second most listened @-@ to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States . Since October 23 , 2012 , Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks . He holds master 's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology , and a Ph.D. from the University of California , Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine . As Michael Weiner , he has written books on nutrition , herbal medicine , and homeopathy ; as Michael Savage , he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List . 
 Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words : borders , language , and culture . Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism , while critics have characterized them as " fostering extremism or hatred . " He opposes illegal immigration to the United States , supports the English @-@ only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture . Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed , he also often covers topics such as medicine , nutrition , music , literature , history , theology , philosophy , sports , business , economics , and culture , and tells personal anecdotes . 
 Since 2009 , Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom , for allegedly " seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred . " 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner in the Bronx , New York , one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner , Jewish emigrants from Russia . He described his childhood as difficult . His father , the owner of an antiques shop , died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970 , and his mother died in 2003 . 
 After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958 , Savage attended Queens College , where he earned a bachelor 's degree in biology in 1963 . After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City . His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce , and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife , Janet . During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate at Millbrook NY , to which Leary had been given access . Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself . Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa , earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972 . He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California , Berkeley , in nutritional ethnomedicine . His thesis was titled Nutritional <unk> in Fiji . 
 = = Shift in political opinions = = 
 Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s . He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti . Stephen Schwartz , also an acquaintance of Savage from this time , reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a " calling card . " Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years , which is maintained with Ginsberg 's papers at Stanford University . One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading , so others could " hear and see and know why I adore your public image . " Another acquaintance was poet and author <unk> <unk> , who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand @-@ up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce . 
 <unk> Robert Cathcart says that by 1980 , in his private conversations with Savage , he knew him to have conservative political views . Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s . Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends . When asked about his shift in politics and other views , Savage replied , " I was once a child ; I am now a man . " Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views . Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker . He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment , while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes . Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s , when he experienced what he saw as " political opposition " after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic . In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript , Immigrants and Epidemics , was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory . In 1996 , Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California , Berkeley . The University instead selected award @-@ winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell . Savage sued the University , contending discrimination for being conservative . Savage later dropped the lawsuit .

 The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal aliens and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work . He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host . On March 21 , 1994 , Savage began his radio career on KGO ( a San Francisco news / talk radio station ) as a fill @-@ in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro . At the time , his slogan was " To the right of Rush and to the left of God . " On January 1 , 1995 , he was given his own show during the drive @-@ time hours . The show quickly became a local hit . During his time at KSFO , Savage reached # 1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive @-@ time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time @-@ slot . 
 In mid 2006 , Savage had 8 – 10 million listeners per week , which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time . Savage has described his listeners as " literate callers with intelligence , wit , and energy . " He has described his show 's production as one with a " ... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato , Henry Miller , Jack Kerouac , Moses , Jesus , and Frankenstein . " Mark de la Viña of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage , " In contrast to Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity and Laura <unk> , Bay Area @-@ based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab . " 
 By 2009 , The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States , making it the second most listened @-@ to radio talk show in the country at the time . Around that time , Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker ; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile , titled " Party of One " , was published in the August 3 , 2009 , issue , which covered Savage 's life and personality in great detail . 
 On September 10 , 2009 , KNEW @-@ AM ( 910 kHz ) in Savage 's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI @-@ AM ( 640 kHz ) / Los Angeles . John Scott , program director of KNEW said in an e @-@ mail that the station was headed " ... in a different philosophical and ideological direction , featuring more contemporary content and more local information . " According to Arbitron monthly ratings , KNEW @-@ AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go . San Francisco station <unk> picked up the program for the San Francisco market , and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive . However , the program was among the first casualties when <unk> went into receivership in September 2010 . 
 On January 22 , 2010 , Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview , and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer . During the show , Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself . The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker . The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to " rattle " Playboy 's readers . On May 12 , 2010 , Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home . Playboy published the interview in June 2010 . He read from a pre @-@ publication copy of the 8 @,@ 000 @-@ word Playboy interview , in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views . Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity , but did not harbor hatred for the writer . He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh , and praised Sanneh as a " real writer " who had understood his subject . 
 On September 27 , 2012 , Savage 's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network , his longtime employer , and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way . Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30 , 2012 . On October 17 , 2012 , Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program , after several weeks off the air , would be returning as of October 23 , 2012 . By April 2013 , according to the radio industry 's Talkers Magazine , Savage had 3 @.@ 5 + million weekly listeners , putting him in a six @-@ way tie for sixth place , and six talk show hosts getting 7 @.@ 5 + million weekly listeners .

 Four months later , on July 7 , Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller , later identified as prank caller Bob Foster , who insulted Savage 's teeth . Savage then asked if Foster was a " sodomite " , to which the caller answered , " Yes , I am . " Savage then said to the caller , 
 Oh , so you 're one of those sodomites . You should only get AIDS and die , you pig ; how 's that ? Why don 't you see if you can sue me , you pig ? You got nothing better to do than to put me down , you piece of garbage ? You got nothing to do today ? Go eat a sausage , and choke on it . Get trichinosis . Now do we have another nice caller here who 's busy because he didn 't have a nice night in the bathhouse who 's angry at me today ? Put another , put another sodomite on .... no more calls ? ... I don 't care about these bums ; they mean nothing to me . They 're all sausages . 
 The day after being fired , Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website . He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments , despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments . He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller , not all people with AIDS . 
 = = Political views = = 
 Michael Savage calls himself an " independent @-@ minded individualist " and says that he " fits no stereotype . " He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence . Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism , and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias . He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders , language , and culture ; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society . 
 In 2003 , Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush " quite reluctantly , incidentally . " In 2004 , Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder 's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re @-@ election of Bush . Savage donated $ 5 @,@ 600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election . 
 Regarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries , Savage said that Ron Paul had " great ideas " but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee . On December 12 , 2011 , he offered Newt Gingrich " 1 million dollars " to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest . He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama , a man he had previously described as a " quasi @-@ pseudo @-@ crypto Marxist " and a possible foreign usurper , in the 2012 election . 
 Since he announced his candidacy in June 2015 , Savage has supported Donald Trump , a frequent guest on his talk show , in the United States 2016 presidential election .

According to Vicki Behenna , the lieutenant ’ s mother , additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $ 40 @,@ 000 .

 On June 9 , 2007 , Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication 's annual " Freedom of Speech Award , " and he accepted it with a pre @-@ recorded speech . 
 National Radio Hall of Fame 
 In 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On @-@ Air Personality . He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity , Diane Rehm and Mike <unk> [ 1 ] 
 = = = Criticisms = = = 
 In July 2005 , former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America . Goldberg wrote that " Savage 's brand of over @-@ the @-@ top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left . " David Klinghoffer , a National Review columnist , speculated that The Savage Nation " is an act , a put @-@ on . " 
 Various liberal advocacy groups and media watchdogs such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism , homophobia , transphobia , bigotry , and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality , Islam , feminism , sex education , and immigration . 
 On April 17 , 2006 , he said on the topic of Muslims , " They say , ' Oh , there 's a billion of them . ' I said , ' So , kill 100 million of them , then there 'll be 900 million of them . ' I mean , would you rather die — would you rather us die than them ? " This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region . This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK . 
 In the wake of the actor Robin Williams ’ suicide , Savage asserted that suicide is an " aggressive act " that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind . The assertion prompted criticism , but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host ’ s frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life . A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months , and especially in the most recent week previous to the call . After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially , he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund . The Fund raised over $ 10 @,@ 000 in just a few days . Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls . The advice that the Detroit caller had given - " you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem " encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had .

 In March 2006 , Savage drew the ire of some in the Catholic community when he accused the Catholic Church of breaking federal law by giving assistance to illegal immigrants ( in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it " pastoral support " ) . William A. Donohue , the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights , was scheduled to be on the show that day but refused after hearing Savage 's language . He later said , " what is not fine is Savage 's diatribe about the ' greedy pigs ' in the Catholic Church and how ' the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom . ' He owes all Catholics an apology . " 
 On March 28 , 2006 , Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter massive rallies held in California during which demonstrators marched in opposition to proposed legislation that would impose new immigration restrictions .

 When Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication 's annual " Freedom of Speech Award , " C @-@ SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre @-@ recorded speech that had been sent by Michael Savage . Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years , C @-@ SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person . Savage stated that C @-@ SPAN 's decision was " censorship " and he told his listeners to express their ire to C @-@ SPAN through calls and e @-@ mails to the organization . 
 = = = = Dispute with CAIR = = = = 
 In early November 2007 , the Council on American @-@ Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage 's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims . Savage was quoted as saying Muslims " need deportation " , and that adherents of Islam would do well to " take your religion and shove it up your behind " because " I 'm sick of you . " On his show and website , Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas . 
 On November 8 , 2007 , following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments , Citrix Systems , Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show . 
 Savage sued CAIR for its use , on its website , of excerpts from his show , for copyright infringement by CAIR . The suit alleged that CAIR 's repackaging of Savage 's comments was " deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage " . The excerpts included Savage 's characterization of the Qur 'an as " a throwback document " and a " book of hate " . CAIR called the suit " bizarre , sloppy and baseless " . On July 25 , 2008 , the United States district court dismissed Savage 's suit against CAIR , holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use , as it was used to " comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations . " The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit . On August 14 , 2008 , however , Savage 's lawyer announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case . CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request . 
 = = = = Autism = = = = 
 In July 2008 , Savage claimed that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of " a racket " designed to get disability payments for " poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government . " He returned to the subject on his July 16 , 2008 , show with the following remarks : 
 Now , the illness du jour is autism . You know what autism is ? I 'll tell you what autism is . In 99 percent of the cases , it 's a brat who hasn 't been told to cut the act out . That 's what autism is . What do you mean they scream and they 're silent ? They don 't have a father around to tell them , " Don 't act like a moron . You 'll get nowhere in life . Stop acting like a putz . Straighten up . Act like a man . Don 't sit there crying and screaming , idiot . " 
 On July 21 , 2008 , following a public information campaign led by the liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America , several dozen parents and grandparents of autistic children picketed outside the studios of WOR in New York , calling for Savage to be fired and for commercial sponsors to withdraw their advertising from his program . In response , WOR issued a statement saying , " We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners . " Also that day , the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising , and the <unk> Mississippi radio network dropped Savage 's program , replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show . Later that evening , Savage devoted his entire three @-@ hour program to the subject , taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments . On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been " ripped out of context " by " far left Stalinists " who want him off of the air . He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King , and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies ' drive to drug children for higher profits . On July 25 , 2008 , Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers , including RadioShack , Sears , Home Depot , and <unk> , will discontinue their support for Savage 's show . 
 Savage 's syndicator , Talk Radio Network , has responded by releasing a lengthy statement , along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage 's discussions of autism , to show that the comments were taken out of context . 
 = = = = Banned from entering the United Kingdom = = = = 
 On May 5 , 2009 , it was announced by then @-@ Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is " considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter @-@ community violence " . During his radio broadcast on that same day , Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation , calling her a " lunatic " . 
 During a subsequent NPR talk show , Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution 's First Amendment . After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom , Savage replied , " No . Thank God I 'm an American . But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses , is astonishing " . Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British @-@ made goods , commenting , " If they want to play hardball , we 'll play hardball . " When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric , Savage called him a " foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You ’ re nobody and I ’ m not going to talk to you ! " At that point , Neal Conan invited him to leave . One commentator later said " It 's quite ironic that someone like Michael Savage sees no hypocrisy in strongly defending his right to the First Amendment only to show outrage and intolerance a few minutes later toward the views of someone else he doesn 't agree with . " 
 Of the banning , the Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , wrote : " America still has a constitutional protection of free speech , and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight . " In The Guardian , Catherine Bennett wrote : " The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act , so staggeringly capricious and stupid , as to defy evaluation . " While Sam Leith wrote : " Barring this shock @-@ jock from Britain risks turning a rabid <unk> into a beacon for free speech . " 
 On July 12 , 2010 , the new Coalition government , of which the Conservative Party 's David Cameron is Prime Minister , announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK .

 On October 14 , 2014 , Savage criticized veteran sufferers of Post traumatic stress disorder , accusing them of " weakness " . According to Savage , " Everyone has depression in their life .

You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government . That ’ s what you wind up with . It ’ s a weak , sick , nation . A weak , sick , broken nation . And you need men like me to save the country . You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we ’ re being laughed at around the world .

 Patty Seymour ( born January 23 , 1960 ) is a semi @-@ retired professional wrestler , better known by her ring name Leilani Kai . She began training with The Fabulous Moolah right after finishing high school . In the 1980s , as part of the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) ' s Rock ' n ' Wrestling Connection , a storyline that combined wrestling and music , Kai defeated Wendi Richter to become the WWF Women 's Champion . Kai , however , lost the title at the inaugural WrestleMania event . She was later paired with Judy Martin , in a tag team that would become known as The Glamour Girls . The team held the WWF Women 's Tag Team Championship twice ( managed by " The Mouth of the South " Jimmy Hart ) and the LPWA Tag Team Championship once . In her later career , Kai returned briefly to the WWF in 1994 , challenging for the Women 's Championship at WrestleMania X. She also wrestled for World Championship Wrestling under the name Patty <unk> and held the NWA World Women 's Championship .

 Seymour was trained by The Fabulous Moolah in 1975 right after she finished high school . She was originally from Florida , but because Moolah thought she looked a little bit Hawaiian , Schroeder was given the ring name Leilani Kai . Her fellow wrestlers also bestowed upon her the nickname " The Hawaiian Princess " during her early career . Four weeks after beginning her training , Moolah sent her on a two @-@ week tour of Alaska . Over the next few years she worked for promotions throughout the United States , including in Oklahoma , Minnesota , California , and New York . It was in 1979 in North Carolina , that Kai first began working with Judy Martin , who would be her future tag team partner .

 On July 23 , 1984 , Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah at MTV 's The Brawl to End it All for the WWF Women 's Championship , ending what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history ( Moolah 's 28 @-@ year reign , though in reality she had won and lost the title on numerous occasions and Richter actually ended a 7 @-@ year reign ) . As a result , in early 1985 , Kai — who had been trained by Moolah — wrestled Richter and defeated her for the title at The War to Settle the Score , with Moolah in her corner and singer Cyndi Lauper in Richter 's corner . Richter , however , regained the title at the first @-@ ever WrestleMania one month later . These matches were part of the WWF 's " Rock ' n ' Wrestling Connection " , an era that combined both music and professional wrestling .

 Kai was then paired with Judy Martin , and the duo won the WWF Women 's Tag Team Championship from the champions Velvet McIntyre and Desiree Petersen in Egypt in August 1985 , although this match 's existence has been disputed . Meanwhile , in August 1986 , Kai traveled to Japan where she won All Japan Women 's Pro @-@ Wrestling 's All Pacific Championship from Chigusa Nagayo , whom she also lost the title to in April 1987 . 
 In November 1987 , Kai and Martin became known as The Glamour Girls , and she underwent an image change that involved bleaching her dark hair platinum blonde at the suggestion of their manager Jimmy Hart . The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel 's team to face the Fabulous Moolah 's team . Martel 's team — Martel , the Glamour Girls , Dawn Marie , and Donna Christanello — lost to The Fabulous Moolah 's team — Moolah , Velvet McIntyre , Rockin ' Robin , and the Jumping Bomb Angels ( <unk> <unk> and Itsuki Yamazaki ) . Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women 's Tag Team Championship . The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988 , with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold . Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women 's division . 
 The Glamour Girls then surfaced in the newly formed Ladies Professional Wrestling Association ( LPWA ) , managed by Adnan El <unk> . In February 1991 , they won the LPWA Tag Team Championship from the team of Misty Blue and Heidi Lee Morgan . Leilani Kai appeared on the November 10 , 1991 episode of WCW Main Event , losing to Madusa . They retained the Tag Team Championship against Malia Hosaka and Bambi at the only LPWA pay per view <unk> Showdown in 1992 . The title was abandoned when the promotion closed .

 = Gridlock ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " Gridlock " is the third episode of the third series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on BBC One on 14 April 2007 . It was written by Russell T Davies and directed by Richard Clark . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( David Tennant ) takes his new companion Martha Jones ( Freema Agyeman ) to New New York in the far future , where they discover the remainder of humanity on the planet live in perpetual gridlock within the Motorway , an underground highway system . When Martha is kidnapped , the Doctor races to find her before she enters the dangerous " fast lane " . 
 " Gridlock " completes a loose trilogy that began with " The End of the World " ( 2005 ) and " New Earth " ( 2006 ) , and contains hints at the series ' story arc . The story is designed to show how the Doctor can bring hope into a world . Production of " Gridlock " took place in September and October 2006 . Much of the episode was filmed in @-@ studio and used a large amount of computer @-@ generated imagery , so it appeared to be set in a " CGI world " . Some location filming was done in Cardiff , most notably at the Temple of Peace . " Gridlock " was viewed by 8 @.@ 41 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Doctor takes Martha in the TARDIS to the year five billion and fifty three and the city of New New York on the planet New Earth . They end up in an alleyway where street traders are selling mood patches to help people deal with their emotions . While the Doctor talks to a vendor , Martha is kidnapped at gun point by a young couple named Milo and Cheen . Once in their vehicle , they explain that Cheen is pregnant and that they needed three adult passengers with them to use the fast lane . They promise they will drop Martha off when they reach their destination ten miles away , estimated to take six years . Cheen also mentions rumours about something living down in the fast lane , saying that cars that go down there vanish and are never seen again . 
 The Doctor chases after Martha 's kidnappers and arrives at the Motorway , a completely enclosed highway filled with thousands of hover vans stuck in gridlock . The fumes in the air begin to affect the Doctor and he seeks refuge in the van of Thomas Kincade Brannigan and his wife Valerie . The Doctor learns that the couple , along with all the other traffic on the road , have only travelled a short distance in several years . Brannigan helps the Doctor to locate the vehicle containing Martha , which is heading towards the fast lane . The Doctor tries to call the police but gets put on hold , and Brannigan refuses to put his family in danger so the Doctor decides to try to reach Martha himself . He begins to jump down from lane to lane , breaking in and out of vans with his sonic screwdriver . Shortly after the Doctor leaves , Novice Hame enters Brannigan 's van , chasing after him . 
 Martha , Milo , and Cheen drive into the fast lane and begin to hear strange noises all around . A nearby driver warns them to escape into the slow lanes before being eaten by the creatures that live in the fast lane , but Milo refuses . The Doctor , finding himself in a van just above the fast lane , looks out the bottom and discovers that the floor of the Motorway is filled with Macra . The Macra are monstrous crab @-@ like alien beings that were once intelligent but now have devolved into feral beasts , who attempt to capture and eat those that fly in the fast lane . The Doctor watches as Milo 's van is nearly caught by a Macra claw , but Martha realises that the beings are attracted by the light and motion generated by the van and has Milo cut the power . This saves them from the beasts but leaves them with only a few minutes of breathable air in the van . 
 Novice Hame finally catches up with the Doctor and teleports him against his will to the senate building where the Face of Boe is waiting . Hame explains that a new mood drug called " Bliss " proved too addictive , and a virus mutated with the Bliss drug , became airborne and wiped out the entire surface population in a matter of minutes . Those in the Motorway were spared by being sealed in and keeping the travellers in constant traffic to avoid telling them the real problem . The Face of Boe wired himself to the system to keep the Motorway operational . The Doctor determines that whatever danger that Bliss may have caused before has long passed , and works with Hame to try to power up the systems to unseal the Motorway . The Face of Boe sacrifices his life energy to the system , allowing the ceiling of the Motorway to open . The Doctor broadcasts a call for all drivers to escape through the ceiling and gives Martha directions to come find him . 
 When Martha arrives , the Doctor and Novice Hame are tending over the Face of Boe . The Face of Boe is close to death and the glass container that encased it is shattered . The Doctor tries to encourage the Face of Boe to live , as they are both the last of their kinds . Knowing that it is dying , the Face of Boe imparts its final message to the Doctor : " You are not alone " . The Doctor and Martha leave Hame to mourn and the Doctor tells Martha the message meant nothing . Martha knows the Doctor is lying and forces him to tell her the truth . As the undercity fills with the sound of the entire surviving population of New New York singing the hymn Abide With Me , he explains to Martha that he is indeed the last Time Lord and tells her all about Gallifrey and the Time War .

 " Gridlock " is the third in a trilogy which began with series one 's " The End of the World " and series two 's " New Earth " . Novice Hame and the green crescent seen on the mood patches previously appeared in " New Earth " . Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies wanted to visit the same world each year to maintain a sense of continuity , something that could be hard to do with Doctor Who 's formula . Producer Phil Collinson remarked that " Gridlock " displayed Davies ' tendency to write about " topical " issues ; it is set in a dark dystopian future , but is also a satire on the common traffic jam . While the story is bleak , Davies showed how the Doctor transforms the place by literally opening up the sky and bringing in light . Davies also used hymns to signify hope and a togetherness of the members of the Motorway . Those on the Motorway sing " The Old Rugged Cross " , and the hymn heard at the end of the episode is " Abide with Me " . The episode also displays the Doctor 's growing attachment to Martha ; he feels guilty for lying to her and bringing her to New New York just to show off and realises that he misses her when she is taken . 
 Davies stated that he based many aspects of New New York on <unk> One from the anthology comic 2000 AD , including the businessman 's appearance on Max Normal from the Judge Dredd comic books . The numbered mood patches parallel the number coded mood controllers in the Ninth Doctor novel Only Human by Gareth Roberts ; Davies confirms that this was his inspiration . The character of Sally Calypso was an homage to Halo Jones , which featured a similar character named <unk> <unk> . Also in the online commentary , Davies noted that Brannigan 's appearance was based on " Ratz " , the CGI disembodied cat 's head that was a " virtual presenter " of CBBC 's Live & Kicking in the early 1990s . Ma and Pa at the start of the episode are based on the farming couple in the painting American Gothic , both having identical hairstyles , glasses and fashions . Alice and May Cassini are the first homosexual married couple featured in Doctor Who . 
 The episode marks the second appearance of the large crustacean Macra race , who previously appeared in the Second Doctor serial The Macra Terror ( 1967 ) . In " Gridlock " , they have " devolved " from their previous , more intelligent , state . Davies thought it was " cute " to bring back a forty @-@ year @-@ old monster whose story is now missing . " Gridlock " also contains important hints about the story arc of the series as it reveals the " great secret " promised to the Doctor by the Face of Boe in " New Earth " – " You are not alone " . The Face of Boe was originally intended to die in " New Earth " , but as that episode featured another death , it was put off . The meaning of Boe 's final words are revealed in " Utopia " , while " Last of the Time Lords " suggest that the Face of Boe 's true identity is Captain Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 " Gridlock " was in the third filming block for the series , along with " The Lazarus Experiment " . Filming took place from mid @-@ September to early October 2006 . The episode uses " some of the largest and most complex CGI effects of all the series so far " . The Motorway was entirely constructed out of CGI aside from a single car set ; it was the first time an episode was set inside a " CGI world " . Will Cohen , The Mill 's Visual FX Producer , revealed in Radio Times that the films Blade Runner , The Fifth Element and Star Wars , specifically the planet of Coruscant influenced the look of New New York . 
 Much of the episode was completed in the Upper Boat Studios , particularly the interior car scenes . For this , only one car set was used , with it being redecorated for each different car . The cars were decorated to look like they had been lived in , and incorporated futuristic and well @-@ known home objects . Brannigan and Valerie 's children were played by real kittens , which proved difficult to direct . The production team shot for four days in the " 6 @-@ foot by 6 @-@ foot " car , which Davies called a " nightmare " because not many camera angles were available and only one crew member could adjust the props and lighting at a time . In addition , smoke was generated around the car so it would blend in with the CGI smoke from the CGI cars . The small set was intended to benefit the actors , as they would feel claustrophobic . For the scene in which the Doctor jumps from car to car , the underside of a car was built and suspended ten to fifteen feet above the top of the car set with a green screen all around to get as many angles as possible . Davies preferred action sequences that moved up and down , a scale that is not seen much on television . The Temple of Peace in Cardiff was the location for the <unk> Temple , as well as the TV Studio with news reporter Sally Calypso . The production team spent two days filming there , on 18 and 19 September 2006 . The undercity where the Doctor and Martha arrive was filmed at the Cardiff Bay maltings and the Ely <unk> , which were designed to look in disrepair . The artificial rain proved difficult in some shots , as the production team had trouble getting one of the side walls wet .

 " Gridlock " was broadcast directly after the FA Cup semi @-@ final between Manchester United and Watford on BBC One . Had the match gone into extra time , the episode would have been postponed until the following week . Overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 8 million viewers , which increased to 8 @.@ 41 once time @-@ shifted viewers had been taken into account . This placed it as the second most @-@ watched programme of the week on BBC One , and the seventh overall . " Gridlock " received an Appreciation Index of 85 . 
 IGN 's Travis Fickett rated " Gridlock " an 8 @.@ 4 out of 10 , calling it " the first great episode " of the third series . He particularly praised the satire of a traffic jam , Tennant 's acting , and the use of Martha as a companion to aid the Doctor 's loss . Ian Berriman of SFX gave " Gridlock " four out of five stars . He praised the attention to detail of the props department , the appearance of the Macra , and the concept of the traffic jam , but felt there were many plot holes . He also called Travis Oliver , the actor who played Milo , " wooden " . Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger wrote that he did not like the episode much on first viewing because it was " too busy and too chaotic to get a proper grip on " but " subsequent viewings proved those very qualities are the backbone of the story . " He initially wished to see more of the Macra . Mark Wright of The Stage was positive towards calling back to " The End of the World " and " New Earth " , and praised Agyeman and the visual look of the episode . Despite finding the ending " life @-@ affirming " , he found a possible plot hole : " one wonders why the Face of Boe didn 't just open the roof in the first place " . 
 DVD Talk 's Nick Lyons compared the episode to " fine wine ... [ it ] gets better with age " . Lyons wrote , " Not only does the episode contain stunning imagery ( the Macra , the motorway ) , but ' Gridlock ' also has some of the most touching scenes in " Doctor Who " history " . In Who Is the Doctor , an unauthorised guide to the revival of Doctor Who , Graeme Burk interpreted " Gridlock " as an allegory that was not meant to be realistic , and commented that its strength was the " powerful " theme of the motorists being blind to the truth . He stated that the " fun , fast @-@ paced story with lots of comedic set pieces " worked to its advantage , and the appearance of the Macra was a " treat " for long @-@ time fans . Despite the popularity of the later series episodes " Human Nature " / " The Family of Blood " and " Blink " , Burk felt that " Gridlock " was the " worthiest candidate for this season 's best story " . Burk 's co @-@ author Robert Smith ? also called it " one of the best episodes " of the revived series , particularly praising the acting of Tennant and Agyeman . Topless Robot named it the fifth best Tenth Doctor episode . 
 = United States Senate election in California , 1950 = 
 The 1950 United States Senate election in California followed a campaign characterized by accusations and name @-@ calling . Republican Richard Nixon defeated Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas , after Democratic incumbent Sheridan Downey withdrew during the primary election campaign . Douglas and Nixon each gave up their congressional seats to run against Downey ; no other representatives were willing to risk the contest . 
 Both Douglas and Nixon announced their candidacies in late 1949 . In March 1950 Downey withdrew from a vicious primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement , after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race . Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist and was the first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio , who was accused of being a communist . Boddy , Nixon , and Douglas each entered both party primaries , a practice known as cross @-@ filing . In the Republican primary , Nixon was challenged only by cross @-@ filers and fringe candidates . 
 Nixon won the Republican primary and Douglas the Democratic contest , with each also finishing third in the other party 's contest ( Boddy finished second in both races ) . The contentious Democratic race left the party divided , and Democrats were slow to rally to Douglas — some even endorsed Nixon . The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries , and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio to the detriment of national security . Nixon 's attacks were far more effective , and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20 percentage points , carrying 53 of California 's 58 counties and all metropolitan areas . 
 Though Nixon was later criticized for his tactics in the campaign , he defended his actions , and also stated that Douglas 's positions were too far to the left for California voters . Other reasons for the result have been suggested , ranging from tepid support for Douglas from President Truman and his administration to the reluctance of voters in 1950 to elect a woman . The campaign gave rise to two memorable political nicknames , both coined by Boddy or making their first appearance in his newspaper : " the Pink Lady " for Douglas and " Tricky Dick " for Nixon . 
 = = Background = = 
 California Senator Sheridan Downey was first elected in 1938 . An attorney , he ran unsuccessfully in 1934 for Lieutenant Governor of California as Upton Sinclair 's running mate , and had a reputation as a liberal . As a senator , however , his positions gradually moved to the right , and he began to favor corporate interests . Manchester Boddy , the editor and publisher of the Los Angeles Daily News , was born on a potato farm in Washington state . He had little newspaper experience when , in 1926 , he was given the opportunity to purchase the Daily News by a bankruptcy court , but built it into a small but thriving periodical . He shared his views with his readers through his column , " Thinking and Living " , and , after initial Republican leanings , was a firm supporter of the New Deal . While the Daily News had not endorsed the Sinclair @-@ Downey ticket , Boddy had called Sinclair " a great man " and allowed the writer @-@ turned @-@ gubernatorial candidate to set forth his views on the newspaper 's front page . 
 Both Helen Douglas and Richard Nixon entered electoral politics in the mid @-@ 1940s . Douglas , a New Deal Democrat , was a former actress and opera singer , and the wife of actor Melvyn Douglas . She represented the 14th congressional district beginning in 1945 . Nixon grew up in a working @-@ class family in Whittier . In 1946 , he defeated 12th district Congressman Jerry Voorhis to claim a seat in the United States House of Representatives , where he became known for his anticommunist activities , including his involvement in the Alger Hiss affair . 
 In the 1940s , California experienced a huge influx of migrants , increasing its population by 55 % . Party registration in 1950 was 58 @.@ 4 % Democratic and 37 @.@ 1 % Republican . However , other than Downey , most major California officeholders were Republican , including Governor Earl Warren ( who was seeking a third term in 1950 ) and Senator William Knowland . 
 During the 1950 campaign , both Nixon and Douglas were accused of having a voting record comparable to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio . The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time , Marcantonio represented East Harlem . He was accused of being a communist , though he denied being one ; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism . Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party , stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights . He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) , on which Nixon served .

 Douglas disregarded advice from party officials to wait until 1952 to run for the Senate , when Republican Senator Knowland would be up for reelection . Fundraising for the campaign was a concern from the beginning ; Douglas friend and aide Ed <unk> wrote her that she would probably need to raise $ 150 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 @.@ 8 million today ) , which Douglas considered a massive sum . <unk> wrote , 
 Now , you can win . You will not be a favorite ; you 'll be rather a long shot . But given luck and money and a hell of a lot of work , you can win ... but for Christ 's sake don 't commit suicide with no dough ... Maybe you can 't crucify mankind on a cross of gold , but you can sure as hell crucify a statewide candidate upon a cross of no @-@ gold . 
 On October 5 , 1949 , Douglas made a radio appearance announcing her candidacy . She attacked Downey almost continuously throughout the remainder of the year , accusing him of being a do @-@ nothing , a tool of big business , and an agent of oil interests . She hired Harold Tipton , a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area , as her campaign manager . Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee , and felt that were she to win the primary , the wide gap between Nixon 's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her . Downey , who suffered from a severe ulcer , was initially undecided about running , but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas . Earl Desmond , a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey 's , also entered the race . 
 In January 1950 , Douglas opened campaign headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco , which was seen as a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey 's seat and would not withdraw from the race . Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates ; Douglas , who was not a good debater , declined . The two candidates traded charges via press and radio , with Downey describing Douglas 's views as extremist . 
 Douglas 's formal campaign launch on February 28 was overshadowed by rumors that Downey might retire , which Douglas called a political maneuver on Downey 's part to get the attention of the press . However , on March 29 , amid rumors that he was doing badly in the polls , Downey announced both his retirement and his endorsement of Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy . In his statement , the senator indicated that , due to his ill health , he was not up to " waging a personal and militant campaign against the vicious and unethical propaganda " of Douglas . 
 Boddy filed his election paperwork the next day , on the final day petitions were accepted , with his papers signed by Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher <unk> , a Republican , and by Downey campaign manager and 1946 Democratic senatorial candidate Will Rogers , Jr . The publisher had been urged to enter the race by state Democratic leaders and by wealthy oilmen . He had no political experience ; Democratic leaders had sought to draft him to run for the Senate in 1946 , but he had declined . He later stated that his reasons for running were that the race would be a challenge , and that he would meet interesting people . Boddy , Douglas , and Nixon each " cross @-@ filed " , entering both major party primaries . 
 Douglas called Downey 's departure in favor of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made no attempt to reach a rapprochement with the senator , who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April , and was on sick leave from Congress for several months . The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas ; it removed the incumbent from the field , but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News — one of the few big city papers to consistently support her . 
 = = = = Boddy versus Douglas = = = = 
 For the first month of Boddy 's abbreviated ten @-@ week campaign , he and Douglas avoided attacking each other . Boddy 's campaign depicted him as born in a log cabin , and highlighted his World War I service . The publisher campaigned under the slogan , " Manchester Boddy , the Democrat Every Body Wants . " Boddy stated that he was fighting for the " little man " , and alleged that the average individual was overlooked by both big government and big labor . However , his campaign , having a late start , was disorganized . The candidate himself had little charisma , and little presence as a public speaker . According to Rob Wagner , who wrote of the campaign in his history of Los Angeles newspapers of the era , Boddy " was all sizzle and no substance " . 
 The campaign calm broke off near the end of April 1950 , when Boddy 's Daily News and affiliated newspapers referred to the congresswoman as " decidedly pink " and " pink shading to deep red " . At the end of the month , the Daily News referred to her for the first time as " the pink lady " . Douglas generally ignored Boddy 's attacks , which continued unabated through May . In a Daily News column , Boddy wrote that Douglas was part of " a small minority of red hots " which proposed to use the election to " establish a beachhead on which to launch a Communist attack on the United States " . One Boddy campaign publication was printed with red ink , and stated that Douglas " has too often teamed up with the notorious extreme radical , Vito Marcantonio of New York City , on votes that seem more in the interest of Soviet Russia than of the United States " . 
 On May 3 , Congressman George Smathers defeated liberal Senator Claude Pepper for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida . Smathers ' tactics included dubbing his opponent " Red Pepper " and distributing red @-@ covered brochures , The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper , that included a photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio . Soon after Smathers ' triumph in the primary , which in the days of the yellow dog South was tantamount to election , South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt , who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC , sent him a letter telling him about Smathers ' brochure . Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon , " It occurs to me that if Helen is your opponent in the fall , something of a similar nature might well be produced ... " Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper 's defeat , " The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy , and we are sick about it . " She also noted , " What a vicious campaign was carried on against him . No doubt the fur will begin to fly out here too " , and " It is revolting to think of the depths to which people will go . " 
 Downey reentered the fray on May 22 , when he made a statewide radio address on behalf of Boddy , stating his belief that Douglas was not qualified to be a senator . He concluded , " Her record clearly shows very little hard work , no important influence on legislation , and almost nothing in the way of solid achievement . The fact that Mrs. Douglas has continued to bask in the warm glow of publicity and propaganda should not confuse any voter as to what the real facts are . " 
 Douglas brought an innovation to the race — a small helicopter , which she used to travel around the state at a time when there were few freeways linking California 's cities . She got the idea from her friend , Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson , who had used a helicopter in his close 1948 race . Douglas leased the craft from a helicopter company in Palo Alto owned by Republican supporters , who hoped her influence would lead to a defense contract . When she used it to land in San Rafael , her local organizer , Dick Tuck , called it the " <unk> " , and the name stuck . 
 In early April , polls gave Nixon some chance of winning the Democratic primary , which would mean his election was secured . He sent out mailings to Democratic voters . Boddy attacked Nixon for the mailings ; Nixon responded that Democratic voters should have the opportunity to express no confidence in the Truman administration by voting for a Republican . " Democrats for Nixon " , a group affiliated with Nixon 's campaign , asked Democratic voters " as one Democrat to another " to vote for the congressman , sending out flyers which did not mention his political affiliation . Boddy quickly struck back in his paper , accusing Nixon of misrepresenting himself as a Democrat . A large ad in the same issue by the " Veterans Democratic Committee " warned Democratic voters that Nixon was actually a Republican and referred to him for the first time as " Tricky Dick " . The exchange benefited neither Nixon nor Boddy ; Douglas won the primary on June 6 and exceeded their combined vote total . 
 = = = Republican contest = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1949 , Nixon , although anxious to advance his political career , was reluctant to run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary . He considered his party 's prospects in the House to be bleak , absent a strong Republican trend , and wrote " I seriously doubt if we can ever work our way back in power . Actually , in my mind , I do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House , even from a relatively good District , if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority . " 
 In late August 1949 , Nixon embarked on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California , where he was less well known , to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran . With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so , Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat . He hired a professional campaign manager , Murray Chotiner , who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon 's first congressional race . 
 Nixon announced his candidacy in a radio broadcast on November 3 , painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism . Chotiner 's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition . Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries ; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman , the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary . The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization , and on intensive fundraising , which proved successful . 
 Nixon had built part of his reputation in the House on his role in the Alger Hiss affair . Hiss 's retrial for perjury after a July 1949 hung jury was a cloud over Nixon 's campaign ; if Hiss was acquitted , Nixon 's candidacy would be in serious danger . On January 21 , 1950 , the jury found Hiss guilty , and Nixon received hundreds of congratulatory messages , including one from the only living former President , Herbert Hoover . 
 At the end of January 1950 , a subcommittee of the California Republican Assembly , a conservative grassroots group , endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Frederick Houser ( who had lost narrowly to Downey in 1944 ) over Nixon for the Senate candidacy by a 6 – 3 vote , only to be reversed by the full committee , which endorsed Nixon by 13 – 12 . Houser eventually decided against running . Los Angeles County Supervisor Raymond Darby commenced a Senate run , but changed his mind and instead ran for lieutenant governor . Darby was defeated by incumbent Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight in the Republican primary . Knight had also been considered likely to run for the Senate , but decided to seek re @-@ election instead . Actor Edward Arnold began a Senate run , but dropped it in late March , citing a lack of time to prepare his campaign . Nixon was opposed for the Republican nomination only by cross @-@ filing Democrats and by two fringe candidates : Ulysses Grant Bixby Meyer , a consulting psychologist for a dating service , and former judge and law professor Albert Levitt , who opposed " the political theories and activities of national and international Communism , Fascism , and <unk> " and was unhappy that the press was paying virtually no attention to his campaign . 
 On March 20 , Nixon cross @-@ filed in the two major party primaries , and two weeks later began to criss @-@ cross the state in his campaign vehicle : a yellow station wagon with " Nixon for U.S. Senator " in big letters on both sides . According to one contemporary news account , in his " barnstorming tour " , Nixon intended to " [ talk ] up his campaign for the U.S. Senate on street corners and wherever he can collect a crowd . " During his nine @-@ week primary tour , he visited all of California 's 58 counties , speaking sometimes six or eight times in a day . His wife Pat Nixon stood by as her husband spoke , distributing campaign thimbles that urged the election of Nixon and were marked with the slogan " Safeguard the American Home " . She distributed more than 65 @,@ 000 by the end of the campaign . 
 A Douglas supporter heard Nixon speak during the station wagon tour , and wrote to the congresswoman : 
 He gave a magnificent speech . He is one of the cleverest speakers I have ever heard . The questions on the Mundt @-@ Nixon bill , his views on the loyalty oath , and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for . Indeed , he was so skillful — and , I might add , cagey — that those who came indifferent were sold , and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts ... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands . 
 With no serious challenge from Republican opponents , Nixon won an overwhelming victory in the Republican primary , with his cross @-@ filing rivals , Boddy , Douglas , and Desmond , dividing a small percentage of the vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates . 
 = = = Joint appearances = = = 
 There were no candidate debates , but Douglas and Nixon met twice on the campaign trail during the primary season . The first meeting took place at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco , where Nixon waved a check for $ 100 that his campaign had received from " Eleanor Roosevelt " , with an accompanying letter , " I wish it could be ten times more . Best wishes for your success . " The audience was shocked at the idea of Eleanor Roosevelt , widow of Democratic former president Franklin Roosevelt and known for her liberal views , contributing to Nixon 's campaign . Nixon went on to explain that the envelope was postmarked Oyster Bay , New York , and that the Eleanor Roosevelt who had sent the contribution was Eleanor Butler Roosevelt , the widow of former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt 's eldest son . The audience laughed , and Douglas later wrote that she had been distracted and gave a poor speech . A memo from Chotiner several days later noted that Boddy had failed to attend the function , and that Douglas wished that she had also not attended . 
 A second joint appearance took place in Beverly Hills . According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold , Douglas arrived late , while Nixon was already speaking . Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch , provoking laughter from the audience . The laughter recurred as Nixon , sitting behind Douglas as she spoke , <unk> to indicate his disapproval of what she was saying ; she appeared bewildered at the laughter . Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again , but she did not stay to listen .

 The rift in the Democratic party caused by the primary was slow to heal ; Boddy 's supporters were reluctant to join Douglas 's campaign , even with President Truman 's encouragement . The President refused to campaign in California ; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt . Roosevelt , the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt , had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948 , but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower . Fundraising continued to be a major problem for Douglas , the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions . The weekend after the primary , Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign . They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $ 197 @,@ 000 ( today , about $ 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 ) . They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy , a political opponent of Nixon 's , came to Nixon 's office and gave him a donation of $ 1 @,@ 000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. , his father . John Kennedy indicated that he could not endorse Nixon , but that he would not be heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career . Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist . 
 Nixon 's positions generally favored large corporations and farming interests , while Douglas 's did not , and Nixon reaped the reward with contributions from them . Nixon favored the Taft @-@ Hartley Act , passage of which had been bitterly opposed by labor unions ; Douglas advocated its repeal . Douglas supported a requirement that federally subsidized water from reclamation projects only go to farms of not more than 160 acres ( 0 @.@ 65 km2 ) ; Nixon fought for the repeal of that requirement . 
 When the Korean War broke out in late June , Douglas and her aides feared being put on the defensive by Nixon on the subject of communism , and sought to preempt his attack . Douglas 's opening campaign speech included a charge that Nixon had voted with Marcantonio to deny aid to South Korea and to cut aid to Europe in half . Chotiner later cited this as the crucial moment of the campaign : 
 She was defeated the minute she tried to do it , because she could not sell the people of California that she would be a better fighter against communism than Dick Nixon . She made the fatal mistake of attacking our strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness . 
 Nixon objected to Douglas 's speech , stating that he had opposed the Korea bill because it did not include aid to Taiwan , and had supported it once the aid had been included . As for the Europe charge , according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose , Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas 's charge had no credibility . In fact , Nixon had opposed a two @-@ year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan , favoring a one @-@ year reauthorization with a renewal provision , allowing for more congressional oversight . 
 Nixon realized that the battle in California would be fought over the threat of communism , and his campaign staff began to research Douglas 's voting record . Republican officials in Washington sent the campaign a report listing 247 times Marcantonio ( who generally followed the Democratic line ) and Douglas had voted together , and 11 times that they had not . Nixon biographer Conrad Black suggests that Nixon 's strategy in keeping the focus on communism was to " distract [ Douglas ] from her strengths — a sincere and attractive woman fighting bravely for principles most Americans would agree with if they were packaged correctly — to scrapping ... on matters where she could not win . " Chotiner stated 20 years later that Marcantonio suggested the comparison of voting records , as he disliked Douglas for failing to support his beliefs fully . 
 Public support for the Korean War initially resulted in anger towards communists , and Nixon advocated the passage of legislation he had previously introduced with Senator Mundt which would tighten restrictions on communists and the Communist Party . Douglas argued that there was already sufficient legislation to effect any necessary prosecutions , and that the Mundt @-@ Nixon bill ( soon replaced by the similar McCarran @-@ Wood bill ) would erode civil liberties . With the bill sure to pass , Douglas was urged to vote in favor to provide herself with political cover . She declined to do so , though fellow California Representative Chester E. Holifield warned her that she would not be able to get around the state fast enough to explain her vote and Nixon would " beat [ her ] brains in " . Douglas was one of only 20 representatives ( including Marcantonio ) who voted against the bill . Truman vetoed it ; Congress enacted it over his veto by wide margins in late September . Douglas was one of 47 representatives ( including Marcantonio ) to vote to sustain the veto . In a radio broadcast soon after the veto override , Douglas announced that she stood with the President , Attorney General J. Howard McGrath and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in their fight against communism . 
 = = = Debut of the Pink Sheet = = = 
 On September 10 , Eleanor Roosevelt , the late president 's widow and the gubernatorial candidate 's mother , arrived in California for a quick campaign swing to support her son and Douglas before she had to return to New York as a delegate to the United Nations . Douglas hoped that the former first lady 's visit would mark a turning point in the campaign . At a Democratic rally featuring Mrs. Roosevelt the next day in Long Beach , Nixon workers first handed out a flyer headed " Douglas – Marcantonio Voting Record " , printed with dark ink on pink paper . The legal @-@ size flyer compared the voting records of Douglas and Marcantonio , principally in the area of national security , and concluded that they were indistinguishable . In contrast , the flyer said , Nixon had voted entirely in opposition to the " Douglas – Marcantonio Axis " . It implied that sending Douglas to the Senate would be no different from electing Marcantonio , and asked if that was what Californians wanted . The paper soon became known as the " Pink Sheet " . Chotiner later stated that the color choice was made at the print shop when campaign officials approved the final copy , and " for some reason or other it just seemed to appeal to us for the moment " . An initial print run of 50 @,@ 000 was soon followed by a reprint of 500 @,@ 000 , distributed principally in heavily populated Southern California . 
 Douglas made no immediate response to the Pink Sheet , despite the advice of Mrs. Roosevelt , who appreciated its power and urged her to answer it . Douglas later stated that she had failed to understand the appeal of the Pink Sheet to voters , and simply thought it absurd . Nixon followed up on the Pink Sheet with a radio address on September 18 , accusing Douglas of being " a member of a small clique which joins the notorious communist party @-@ liner Vito Marcantonio of New York , in voting time after time against measures that are for the security of this country " . He assailed Douglas for advocating that Taiwan 's seat on the United Nations Security Council be given to the People 's Republic of China , as appeasement towards communism . 
 Late in September , Douglas complained of alleged whispering campaigns aimed at her husband 's Jewish heritage , and which stated that he was a communist . At the end of September , the splits in the Democratic Party became open when 64 prominent Democrats , led by George Creel , endorsed Nixon and castigated Douglas . Creel said , " She has voted consistently with Vito Marcantonio . Belated flag @-@ waving cannot erase this damning record , nor can the tawdry pretense of ' liberalism ' excuse it . " According to Creel , Downey was working behind the scenes to secure Nixon 's election . 
 James Roosevelt 's lackluster campaign led Douglas backers to state that he was not only failing to help Douglas , he was not even helping himself . With polls showing the two major Democratic candidates in dire straits , Roosevelt wrote to President Truman , proposing that Truman campaign in the state in the final days before the election . Truman refused to do so . He also declined Douglas 's pleas for a letter of support ( privately calling her " one of the worst nuisances " ) , and even refused to allow her to be photographed with him at a signing ceremony for a water bill which would benefit California . When Truman flew to Wake Island in early October to confer with General Douglas MacArthur regarding the Korean situation , he returned via San Francisco , but told the press he had no political appointments scheduled . He spoke at an event at the War Memorial Opera House during his stopover , but both Roosevelt and Douglas were relegated to orchestra @-@ level seats , far from the presidential box . Vice President Alben Barkley did visit the state to campaign for the Democrats . However , Time magazine wrote that he did not appear to be helpful to Douglas 's campaign . The Vice President stated that while he was not familiar with Douglas 's votes , he was certain that she had voted the way she did out of sincere conviction and urged Californians to give the Senate a " dose of brains and beauty " . Attorney General McGrath also came to California to campaign for the Democrats , and freshman Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota tirelessly worked the San Joaquin Valley , talking to farmers and workers . 
 = = = Name @-@ calling and supporters : the final days = = = 
 Douglas adopted Boddy 's " Tricky Dick " nickname for Nixon , and also referred to him as " pee wee " . Her name @-@ calling had an effect on Nixon : when told she had called him " a young man with a dark shirt " in an allusion to Nazism , he inquired , " Did she say that ? Why , I 'll castrate her . " Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that it would be difficult to do , and Nixon replied that he would do it anyway . Nixon returned the attacks ; at friendly gatherings and especially at all @-@ male events , he stated that Douglas was " pink right down to her underwear " . 
 Douglas 's last large @-@ scale advertisement blitz contained another Nazi allusion . Citing five votes in which Nixon and Marcantonio had voted together and in opposition to Douglas , it accused Nixon of using " the big lie " and stated : " <unk> invented it / <unk> perfected it / <unk> uses it " . Nixon responded , " Truth is not smear . She made the record . She has not denied a single vote . The iron curtain of silence has closed around the opposition camp . " Through the final days of the campaign , he struck a constant drumbeat : Douglas was soft on communism . 
 Though polls showed Nixon well ahead , his campaign did not let up . A fundraising solicitation warned , " Right Now Nixon Is Losing ... Not Enough Money " . <unk> urged voters to cast their ballots for him . Borrowing an idea from Nixon 's 1946 campaign , the campaign announced that people should answer their phones , " Vote for Nixon " ; random calls would be made from campaign headquarters and households that answered their phones that way would receive scarce consumer appliances . Chotiner even instructed that 18 @-@ month @-@ old copies of The Saturday Evening Post , containing a flattering story about Nixon , be left in doctor 's offices , barber shops , and other places where people wait across the state . 
 In the last days of the campaign , Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for . Boddy 's paper endorsed her , while Truman praised her . Douglas 's actor husband , Melvyn Douglas , on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign , spoke out on behalf of his wife , as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor . Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him , including Howard Hughes , Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne . Another actor , Ronald Reagan , was among Douglas 's supporters , but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro @-@ Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts , he was converted to Nixon 's cause and led quiet fundraising for him . Douglas was apparently unaware of this — 30 years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her . 
 Chotiner had worked on Warren 's 1942 campaign , but had parted ways from him , and the popular governor did not want to be connected to the Nixon campaign . Nonetheless , Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement . Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor , as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet . Douglas repeatedly avoided the question , but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign , she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected . Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner , who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas 's comments , and the governor responded , " In view of her statement , I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday . " Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon , and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well . 
 Despite the polls , Douglas was confident that the Democratic registration edge would lead her to victory , so much so that she offered a Roosevelt staffer a job in her senatorial office . On election day , November 7 , 1950 , Nixon defeated Douglas by 59 percent to 41 . Of California 's 58 counties , Douglas won only five , all in Northern California and with relatively small populations ; Nixon won every urban area . Although Warren defeated Roosevelt by an even larger margin , Nixon won by the greatest number of votes of any 1950 Senate candidate . Douglas , in her concession speech , declined to congratulate Nixon . Marcantonio was also defeated in his New York district .

 A week after the election , Downey announced that he was resigning for health reasons . Warren appointed Nixon to the short remainder of Downey 's term ; under the Senate rules at the time , this gave Nixon seniority over the senators sworn in during January . Nixon took office on December 4 , 1950 . He used little of his seniority , since in November 1952 he was elected vice president as Dwight Eisenhower 's running mate , the next step on a path that would lead him to the presidency in 1969 . Downey , who as a former senator retained floor privileges , was hired as a lobbyist by oil interests . In 1952 , as Republicans took over the White House and control of both houses of Congress , he was fired . An aide stated that the big corporations did not need Downey anymore . Boddy , dispirited by his election defeat and feeling let down by the average citizens for whom he had sought to advocate , lapsed into semi @-@ retirement after his primary defeat . In 1952 , he sold his interest in the Daily News , which went into bankruptcy in December 1954 . 
 It was rumored that Douglas would be given a political appointment in the Truman administration , but the Nixon @-@ Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for the President . According to Democratic National Committee vice @-@ chair India Edwards , a Douglas supporter , the former congresswoman could not have been appointed <unk> . In 1952 , she returned to acting , and eight years later campaigned for John F. Kennedy during Nixon 's first , unsuccessful presidential run . She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon 's 1972 reelection , and called for his ouster from office during the Watergate scandal . 
 Less than a week after the election , Douglas wrote to one of her supporters that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result . Blaming the war , voter mistrust of Truman 's foreign policy , and high prices at home , Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take a large part of the women 's vote and the labor vote . Later in November , she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952 . In 1956 , she stated in an interview that , while Nixon had never called her a communist , he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or " communistic " . In 1959 , she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator , and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon . In her memoirs , published posthumously in 1982 , she wrote , " Nixon had his victory , but I had mine ... He hadn 't touched me . I didn 't carry Richard Nixon with me , thank God . " She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with , " There 's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there , and didn 't care how . " 
 In 1958 , Nixon , by then vice president , allegedly stated that he regretted some of the tactics his campaign had used in the campaign against Douglas , blaming his youth . When the statements were reported , Nixon denied them . He issued press releases defending his campaign , and stating that any impression that Douglas was pro @-@ communist was justified by her record . He said Douglas was part of a whispering campaign accusing him of being " anti @-@ Semitic and Jim Crow " . In his 1978 memoirs , he stated that " Helen Douglas lost the election because the voters of California in 1950 were not prepared to elect as their senator anyone with a left @-@ wing voting record or anyone they perceived as being soft on or naive about communism . " He indicated that Douglas faced difficulties in the campaign because of her gender , but that her " fatal disadvantage lay in her record and in her views " . 
 = = = History and legend = = = 
 Contemporary accounts ascribed the result to a number of causes . Douglas friend and former Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes blamed Roosevelt 's weak candidacy and what he believed was Nixon 's use of the red scare . Supervisor John Anson Ford of Los Angeles County chalked up the result to Nixon 's skill as a speaker and a lack of objective reporting by the press . Douglas 's campaign treasurer , Alvin Meyers , stated that while labor financed Douglas 's campaign , it failed to vote for her , and blamed the Truman Administration for " dumping " her . Douglas 's San Diego campaign manager claimed that 500 @,@ 000 people in San Diego and Los Angeles had received anonymous phone calls alleging Douglas was a communist , though he could not name anyone who had received such a call . Time magazine wrote that Nixon triumphed " by making the Administration 's failures in Asia his major issue " . 
 As Nixon continued his political rise and then moved towards his downfall , the 1950 race increasingly took on sinister tones . According to Nixon biographer Earl Mazo , " Nothing in the litany of reprehensible conduct charged against Nixon , the campaigner , has been cited more often than the tactics by which he defeated Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas for senator . " Douglas friend and McGovern campaign manager Frank Mankiewicz , in his 1973 biography , Perfectly Clear : Nixon from Whittier to Watergate , focused on the race and the Pink Sheet , and alleged that Nixon never won a free election , that is , one without " major fraud " . 
 Historian Ingrid Scobie came to a different conclusion in her biography of Douglas , Center Stage . Scobie concluded that , given voter attitudes at the time , no woman could have won that race . Scobie stated that Nixon 's tactics , which used voter anger at communists , contributed to the magnitude of Douglas 's defeat , as did the fragmentation of the California Democratic Party in 1950 , the weakness of Roosevelt at the head of the ticket , Douglas 's idealistic positions ( to the left of many California Democrats ) and Boddy 's attacks . In his early biography of Nixon , Mazo contrasted the two campaigns and concluded , " when compared with the surgeons of the Nixon camp , the Douglas operators performed like apprentice butchers " . 
 Both Roger Morris and Greg Mitchell ( who wrote a book about the 1950 race ) conclude that Nixon spent large sums of money on the campaign , with Morris estimating $ 1 – 2 million ( perhaps $ 12 million — $ 24 million today ) and Mitchell suggesting twice that . Gellman , in his later book , conceded that Nixon 's officially reported amount of $ 4 @,@ 209 was understated , but indicated that campaign finance law at that time was filled with loopholes , and few if any candidates admitted to their full spending . He considered Morris 's and Mitchell 's earlier estimates , though , to be " guess [ es ] " and " fantastic " . Black suggests that Nixon spent about $ 1 @.@ 5 million and Douglas just under half of that . 
 Scobie summed up her discussion of Douglas 's defeat , 
 As an actress , she entered Broadway as a star on sheer talent and little training ... [ As an opera singer ] , she sang abroad for two summers , fully expecting that the next step would be the Metropolitan Opera . In politics after five months of working with the [ California Democratic ] Women 's Division , it seemed only natural that she head the state 's organization and serve as Democratic National Committeewoman . Restless after three years in those positions , she saw the possibility of becoming a member of Congress as a logical next step . Only four years later , she felt ready to run for the Senate . But her lack of political experience and her inflexible stands on political issues , along with gender questions , eroded the support of the Democratic Party in 1950 . What in fact may have hurt her the most is that for which she is most remembered — her idealism .

 = History of Liverpool F.C. ( 1892 – 1959 ) = 
 The history of Liverpool Football Club from 1892 to 1959 covers the period from the club 's foundation , through their first period of success from 1900 to the 1920s , to the appointment of Bill Shankly as manager . 
 Liverpool Football Club was formed on 15 March 1892 following a disagreement between the directors of Everton Football Club and its president , John Houlding , who owned the club 's ground , Anfield . A dispute over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park , which left Houlding with an empty stadium . Thus , he founded Liverpool F.C. , and they joined the Lancashire League . After winning the league title in their first season , Liverpool were accepted into the Football League for the 1893 – 94 season , following the resignations of Accrington and Bootle . 
 The appointment of Tom Watson as the club 's manager in 1896 led to the club 's first period of sustained success . Liverpool consolidated their position in the Football League following promotion to the First Division , and won their first League championship in 1901 . A further championship followed in 1906 , and in 1914 the club reached their first FA Cup final , losing to Burnley . Watson died suddenly in 1915 of pneumonia after the outbreak of the First World War . The club won two further championships in 1922 and 1923 when football resumed after the war . 
 An expansion to the Spion Kop terracing in the 1920s increased Anfield 's capacity . Liverpool 's fortunes declined during the inter @-@ war years , when the club often finished in midtable . Liverpool became League champions again in 1947 , in the first season after the Second World War , but following a slow downturn in performance the club was relegated to the Second Division in 1954 . By the time of Shankly 's appointment in 1959 , Liverpool had been in the Second Division for five seasons . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Liverpool 's origins lie with their neighbours Everton . Founded in 1878 , Everton moved to Anfield in 1884 , a facility owned by the club 's president , John Houlding , a former Lord Mayor of Liverpool . In 1892 a dispute arose between Houlding and the Everton board of directors , over the club 's tenancy of the ground . The annual rent had risen from £ 100 in 1884 to £ 250 in 1892 ; Houlding wanted to sell the ground to the club , which in turn wished to agree a long @-@ term rental . Houlding would only agree to this on the basis of a rent at a level unacceptable to the club . Negotiations having failed , the directors decided to leave Anfield and find another ground , leaving Houlding with an empty stadium . His response was to form a new football club to occupy the stadium . He attempted to retain the team name " Everton " by registering the name " Everton Football Club and Athletic Grounds Company , Limited " with Companies House , but the Football League decided that the name belonged to the departed Everton club , which acquired new premises at Goodison Park . Houlding therefore adopted the name " Liverpool Football Club " for his new venture . 
 Having established his new club , Houlding applied for membership of the First Division of the Football League , rather than the newly formed Second Division . The League , unimpressed with this premature application , refused to admit the club , which instead joined the Lancashire League . Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892 , a pre @-@ season friendly match against Rotherham Town , which they won 7 – 1 . The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players – manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland – so they became known as the " team of Macs " . Liverpool 's first match in the Lancashire League , which they won 8 – 0 , was against Higher Walton . 200 spectators attended the match , but as the twenty @-@ two match season proceeded , and Liverpool continued to win , attendances increased . Approximately 2 @,@ 000 people watched Liverpool defeat South Shore in the penultimate match of the season at Anfield . 
 Liverpool 's first season was successful , as the club narrowly won the Lancashire League title on goal average , over Blackpool . They also won the Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton . The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club £ 130 to replace them . Following their success , Liverpool reapplied to the Football League . This application was successful , mainly because of the resignations of Accrington and Bootle from the Second Division . Liverpool 's original strip had been blue and white chequered shirts and white shorts , similar to those of their neighbours Everton . From 1894 they changed to red shirts and white shorts . 
 The club 's first match in the Football League was against Middlesbrough Ironopolis on 2 September 1893 , which they won 2 – 0 , with Malcolm <unk> scoring Liverpool 's first goal in League football . Liverpool 's first season in the Football League saw them unbeaten in 28 matches , 22 of which they won . They finished at the top of the Second Division , but as at that time there was no automatic promotion to the First Division , they were entered into the test match system . This involved a knockout match with the bottom team in the First Division , Newton Heath ( later renamed Manchester United ) . Liverpool won , and took their place in the First Division . Their stay in the division lasted only a season , as they finished in bottom position , with seven wins from thirty matches . They were relegated to the Second Division , after facing Bury in the test match and losing 1 – 0 , despite Bury playing most of the match with ten men after their goalkeeper was sent off . 
 = = Consolidation = = 
 As more people began to watch Liverpool , the ground capacity was expanded . The Main Stand was built , which helped to bring regular attendances of around 20 @,@ 000 . Liverpool 's stay in the Second Division was brief , as they secured promotion to the First Division during the 1895 – 96 season – twelve wins in their final fourteen matches gave them a first @-@ place finish , followed by success in the test matches over Small Heath ( later renamed Birmingham City ) and West Bromwich Albion . The club reached the semi @-@ final of the FA Cup for the first time in the 1896 – 97 season ; they were drawn against Aston Villa , and with Everton in the other semi @-@ final , there was the prospect of a first all @-@ Merseyside cup final . However , while Everton won their tie , Liverpool were defeated 3 – 0 . After winning promotion , the club appointed Tom Watson , who was managing Sunderland , as their new manager . Watson 's record of three League championships in four seasons with Sunderland convinced Houlding to make Watson the highest @-@ paid manager in England , with a yearly salary of £ 300 . Following Watson 's appointment , McKenna remained at the club as an administrator . 
 During the next two seasons Liverpool consolidated their place in the First Division , with fifth and ninth @-@ place finishes . Performances improved in the 1898 – 99 season , when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship . They faced Aston Villa , with whom they were level on points , although Villa 's goal average advantage of 0 @.@ 02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title . In the event , Villa won 5 – 0 , to leave Liverpool as the runners @-@ up . Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi @-@ final , where they faced Sheffield United . The match finished in a 2 – 2 draw ; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4 – 4 , and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch . The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground , which Sheffield United won 1 – 0 . 
 Liverpool won their first League championship in 1901 . Integral to their success were their captain Alex Raisbeck , and striker Sam Raybould . Raisbeck , a centre @-@ half , had been signed from Hibernian in 1898 . He became club captain a year later , and was often the focal point of the team , as an important defensive player and the instigator of many of Liverpool 's attacks . Raybould was signed from local club New Brighton Tower , and in the 1899 – 1900 season scored seven times as the club won nine of their last eleven matches , to finish in tenth place . He would go on to score 128 goals in 226 matches for Liverpool . Success in the 1900 – 01 season looked unlikely in February , at which point Liverpool had lost eight games and conceded 31 goals . However , they won nine and drew three of their next twelve matches , while only conceding four goals , to achieve their first League title . They were less successful in the following two seasons , finishing in eleventh and fifth places respectively . The 1903 – 04 season saw the club relegated to the Second Division ; like the previous relegation it was only for one year as they won the division the following season . On their return in the 1905 – 06 season they became the first team to win the Second and First Division in successive seasons . They also reached the semi @-@ final of the FA Cup , where they faced Everton and lost 2 – 0 . 
 Houlding died in 1902 , and in 1905 the ownership of the club was restructured . Of the existing 3 @,@ 000 shares , 2 @,@ 000 were held by the Houlding family . The club owed a debt of £ 10 @,@ 000 to Houlding , and a further £ 5 @,@ 000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family . The family offered to give up the 2 @,@ 000 shares and wipe out the debt , if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee . The board agreed , and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15 @,@ 000 shares available for £ 1 each . Following the share issue , McKenna became chairman of the club . 
 Following the club 's successes , a new stand was erected along the Walton Breck Road end of the ground . The stand became known as the Spion Kop – it was originally given this name by local journalist Ernest Edwards , the sports editor of the Liverpool Daily Post and the Echo , after a famous hill in South Africa , where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War . More than 300 men had died , many of them from Liverpool , as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop . 
 In the seasons following their second league title , Liverpool enjoyed limited success , generally finishing in midtable . They finished in second place behind Aston Villa in the 1909 – 10 season , the last for their captain , Raisbeck , who returned to his native Scotland to play for Partick Thistle . Liverpool 's form declined after his departure , with their best performance in the League a 12th @-@ place finish in the 1912 – 13 season . There was improvement in 1914 when the club reached their first FA Cup final , which they lost 1 – 0 to Burnley at Crystal <unk> following season four Liverpool players were implicated in the 1915 British football betting scandal , which involved a match with Manchester United . A 2 – 0 victory for United was required to win the bet , in which players from both sides were involved . With the score at 2 – 0 , Liverpool 's Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar with a shot , at which several of his teammates gestured angrily towards him . Subsequently , Tom <unk> , Tom Miller , Bob Pursell and Jackie Sheldon were found guilty by a Football Association ( FA ) enquiry of conspiring with three Manchester United players ( Sandy Turnbull , Arthur Whalley and Enoch West ) to fix a United win . All the players involved were banned for life . Following the end of the First World War , in which Turnbull was killed at the Battle of Arras in 1917 , the FA lifted the surviving players ' bans in recognition of their service in the conflict .

 Three weeks after visiting his hometown of Newcastle to celebrate his 56th birthday , Liverpool 's manager Tom Watson developed a severe chill , which developed into pneumonia . He died on 6 May 1915 ; Raisbeck and two other former Liverpool stars , Ned Doig and Arthur Goddard , were pallbearers at the funeral . 
 During the First World War , with normal Football League activity suspended , Liverpool competed in a regional league , the Lancashire Section . The competition was split into two parts : " Principal Tournament " and the " Supplementary Competition " . Liverpool won the former in the 1916 – 17 season , and the latter in the 1917 – 18 and 1918 – 19 seasons . A number of Liverpool players fought in the war , including Philip Bratley , Robert Crawford and Wilfred Bartrop . Bartrop was the only one to be killed , dying on 7 November 1918 while fighting in Belgium . 
 When football resumed after the war for the 1919 – 20 season , Watson 's post as manager was taken by David Ashworth . Liverpool finished in fourth place . During the season George V became the first reigning monarch to watch a League match , when Liverpool played Manchester City . Liverpool repeated their fourth @-@ place finish in 1920 – 21 , before regaining the League championship in the 1921 – 22 season . Liverpool had looked certain title winners , before the loss of three of their last six games put their chances in doubt . A 4 – 1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the last match of the season was enough to secure Liverpool 's third League championship . 
 Ashworth left Liverpool midway through the following season , to manage Oldham Athletic – he wished to be closer to his wife and daughter , who lived in nearby Stockport . His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen , a club director . McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment , but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship . This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott , who conceded only 31 goals during the season , a league record at the time . Liverpool 's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier . Following their successive championships , Liverpool 's fortunes declined as their side aged . Some of the players had begun their careers before the war ; goalkeeper Scott had been in the side since 1912 . The club began the 1923 – 24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row , but finished in twelfth place . They achieved fourth place the following season , which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War . Changes to the offside rule in the 1925 – 26 season resulted in an increase in the number of goals scored during matches . Liverpool contributed to this , with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United , but could only manage a seventh @-@ place finish . 
 In 1920 , the Kop had been redesigned and extended to hold 30 @,@ 000 spectators , all standing . At the time , the Kop was the biggest football stand in the country , able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds . The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool 's fortunes ; they scored 90 goals during the 1928 – 29 season , striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them , yet finished in fifth place . McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club , and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident . He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson . The club 's fortunes did not improve under Patterson 's leadership ; they generally finished midtable . Their results were inconsistent ; in September 1930 , they lost 7 – 0 at West Ham United , yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7 – 2 at Anfield . 
 During the 1930s Liverpool 's form continued to deteriorate , and they avoided relegation in the 1933 – 34 season by only four points . Scott left the club at the end of what had been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper . In ten matches from the start of 1934 , Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal , and after a 9 – 2 defeat against Newcastle United , he was replaced by Arthur Riley . The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form , with a 6 – 2 victory over Birmingham City and a 4 – 1 win against Middlesbrough . Scott , who joined Belfast Celtic after 24 years at Liverpool , remains the club 's longest @-@ serving player . As they became used to finishing in the lower part of the league table , Liverpool began to lose their best players . Hodgson , who had scored 233 goals in 358 league games , was sold to Aston Villa in 1936 and the club struggled to replace him . They finished 19th in the season following his departure . Also in 1936 , Patterson resigned as manager for health reasons , and resumed his role as the club 's secretary . His replacement , Southampton manager George Kay , did not initially fare much better ; Liverpool narrowly avoided relegation in the 1936 – 37 season , and finished in 11th place in each of the following two seasons . By the outbreak of the Second World War , Liverpool had become accustomed to finishing midtable . 
 Soon after the outbreak of war in 1939 , the 1939 – 40 season was cancelled and all first @-@ class football in Britain temporarily suspended . When matches resumed , competitions were played on a regional basis as in the previous war , and teams often did not complete a full season . Liverpool participated in the Football League North , which they won in the 1942 – 43 season . Many footballers served in the armed forces , away from their clubs for long periods , and would often appear as " guests " for other clubs . Two Liverpool players were decorated for their wartime service ; Berry Nieuwenhuys received the Czech Medal of Merit , and Bill Jones was awarded the Military Medal after rescuing wounded comrades under fire .

 League football in England resumed in the 1946 – 47 season , after seven seasons ' suspension due to the war . Before the resumption , Liverpool embarked on an eight @-@ week tour of the United States and Canada , scoring 70 goals in the ten matches played . In escaping from post @-@ war food rationing while on tour , the Liverpool players were able to eat more , and by the end of the trip had gained in weight an average of 7 pounds ( 3 @.@ 2 kg ) a man . The New York Times reporter who followed the team on the tour noted the " perceptible gain in strength on the playing field . " 
 The first game played at Anfield after the war was against Middlesbrough , on 4 September 1946 , which Liverpool lost 1 – 0 before a crowd of 34 @,@ 140 . Despite this defeat , Liverpool finished the 1946 – 47 season as League champions . Vital to this success were their attacking players ; after a 5 – 0 defeat to Manchester United the club bought Albert Stubbins from Newcastle United , to augment the attack alongside Jack Balmer and Billy Liddell . Balmer typified this new attacking strength by scoring hat @-@ tricks in three successive matches . However , the club were unable to match this success in the two seasons that followed , and finished in 11th and 12th places respectively . The 1949 – 50 season brought another disappointing league campaign . The season started well , as the club was unbeaten in their first 19 matches and was top of the league at the turn of the year . Their form declined thereafter , and they finished eighth . This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup , as they reached their second final ( their first at Wembley ) , against Arsenal . They were unable to win their first FA Cup ; two goals from Arsenal striker Reg Lewis meant Liverpool lost 2 – 0 . 
 After their FA Cup final appearance , Liverpool 's fortunes declined steadily . Kay resigned through ill @-@ health , and was replaced by Don Welsh . Welsh 's first season did not go smoothly , as Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Norwich City of the Third Division South . The following year , 61 @,@ 905 spectators watched Liverpool beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2 – 1 in the fourth round of the FA Cup , the biggest attendance ever recorded at Anfield . Under Welsh 's stewardship the club gradually slipped further down the table , and were relegated to the Second Division in the 1953 – 54 season , after finishing in bottom place . Their relegation came after 50 uninterrupted years in the top division of English football . The side 's decline did not prevent John Moores , owner of retail company Littlewoods , from investing in the club with a 51 % stake . 
 Liverpool 's first season in the Second Division in 1954 – 55 brought them an 11th @-@ place finish . During this season the club suffered the biggest defeat in its history , a 9 – 1 loss to Birmingham City . Although in the following season they improved to third place , it was not enough for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked at the end of the season . His replacement was Phil Taylor , a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff . Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran , Alan A 'Court and Jimmy Melia , who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come , but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division . The Liverpool board persisted with him , despite the club 's loss to non @-@ League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959 . His tenure ended during the 1959 – 60 season ; after a good start , their form began to tail off mid @-@ season , and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town , Taylor resigned . The man who replaced him was Huddersfield 's manager , Bill Shankly .

 During the cold open , Jim ( John Krasinski ) runs 500 feet of red wire from Dwight 's desk to the top of a telephone pole as a prank , and Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) follows it all the way to the top of the pole . Meanwhile , Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) enlists Michael ( Steve Carell ) to report on the success of a small family @-@ owned local paper competitor named Prince Paper , which works in an area where Dunder Mifflin has never successfully acquired clients . Michael brings Dwight along on his field work to help gather information . Michael visits business owner Roger Prince ( Dan Desmond ) posing as a potential customer named " Michael Scarn " , while Dwight enters and pretends to request a job . The kind and overly trusting Roger Prince gives Michael the company 's customer list to use as a reference , and Michael and Dwight leave triumphantly . 
 However , Michael damages his car while exiting the parking space , which catches the attention of the Prince family . They come out to help fix the car as much as they can as Michael watches . Michael is visibly moved by their kindness and has a change of heart regarding giving the customer list to Wallace , but Dwight remains unmoved . Back at the office , Dwight tries to convince Michael he can 't let his heart get in the way of business . Michael agrees to send the list and his information to Wallace , but then tries to escape and get rid of the list . Dwight chases Michael down and takes the list from him , causing Michael to finally give in . David Wallace calls Michael to congratulate him on getting the list . Michael then explains he is feeling a " bittersweet " moment over what he did to Prince Paper , bitter because he potentially ruined a decent family , but sweet because he satisfied Wallace . 
 Meanwhile , the rest of the office get into a heated debate over whether actress Hilary Swank can be considered " hot " . Kevin ( Brian Baumgartner ) leads the group voting she is not hot , claiming she looks like a " monster " . Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to switch sides by having him imagine Hilary kissing him , only for Kevin to switch back , saying the debate is whether she is hot , not whether he would have sex with her . Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) resists the debate , but eventually votes " hot " after getting offended by Kevin 's crude remarks . Kelly ( Mindy Kaling ) , who believes herself less attractive than Swank , gets emotional when Toby ( Paul Lieberstein ) defends his " not hot " vote . Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) argues they should not let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot , or decide anything at all . Oscar ( Oscar Nuñez ) gives a detailed overhead presentation about the structure of Swank 's facial features , concluding she is " attractive ... not hot . " An uncharacteristically uplifting Stanley ( Leslie David Baker ) votes hot , claiming pointing out flaws is no way to live life . At the end of the debate , the sides are still tied until Michael , oblivious of their debate , passes by the pictures on the wall and casually calls her hot .

 " Prince Family Paper " was directed by Asaad <unk> and written by B. J. Novak , who also plays Ryan Howard on the show .

 Dan Bakkedahl , a comedian best known as a correspondent from the Comedy Central comedy program The Daily Show , made a guest appearance as Robert Prince , Jr . , the son of the Prince Paper owner . When Michael infiltrates Prince Family Paper , he identifies himself as Michael Scarn . This is a reference to the second season episode " The Client " , in which Pam discovers an action film screenplay starring a character based on himself named Agent Michael Scarn . In a later episode of season 5 ( episode 21 , Two Weeks ) it is revealed that Prince Family Paper went bankrupt . This is probably due to the actions of Michael .

 " Prince Family Paper " received generally mixed reviews . Travis Fickett of IGN called it one of the show 's better Michael @-@ and @-@ Dwight centric episodes , and called the chase between them " a classic scene and perfectly executed " . Fickett also praised several character moments , like Kelly 's breakdown over whether Hilary Swank is hot , but said the Swank subplot was less interesting than the main story . Brian Howard of The Journal News said he appreciated that the script had Michael follow through on betraying the Princes , rather than deciding to spare them , because he felt it was more realistic . Howard said , " They didn ’ t let Michael off the hook . Instead the writers took a dark and dirty turn toward the truly tragic , in the literal sense of the word . " He also praised the Hilary Swank subplot as funny and a realistic conversation topic among <unk> , although he admitted it was " relegated to almost buffer status " to the main plot . Alan Sepinwall , television columnist with The Star @-@ Ledger , said Michael 's conflicted feelings about betraying the Prince family came up too late and resolved too abruptly to work well , and that the chase between Michael and Dwight was a poorly constructed " misfire " . However , he called the subplot about Hilary Swank " genius with a capital G " . 
 TV Squad writer Jay Black praised the main plot , and wrote , " I was delighted that the trip to the Prince Family Paper Company became a test of Michael 's morals rather than the usual exercise in his stupidity . " Black said Dwight 's attempts to get Michael to give up the client were among the best set of scenes for the season . However , Black said the Hilary Swank subplot suffered in comparison , and felt like a vain attempt to find something for the supporting cast to do . The A.V. Club writer Nathan Rabin was disappointed with " Prince Family Paper " , calling it overly dependent on throwaway gags and describing it as " about as inconsequential as The Office gets " . Rabin complimented the opening gag with Jim and Dwight , but said it " felt like the kind of gag the show has pulled off dozens , if not hundreds of times , before " . Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly said it was not one of the strongest Office episodes , and that the script took a particularly mean tone with the Prince Family Paper subplot . But Wheat said it included some enjoyable moments , like Jim 's prank against Dwight in the opening scene . Will Leitch of New York magazine was very critical of the episode , especially the Hilary Swank subplot , which he said " sounded like a conversation B. J. Novak had with himself at a party and submitted as a backup script " . Leitch also pointed out the episode had nothing to do with the show 's ongoing plotlines : " It 's the definition of filler . Which would have been fine , had it been funnier . " " Prince Family Paper " was voted the lowest @-@ rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season , according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally , where the episode was rated 6 @.@ 98 out of 10 . 
 = Áedán mac Gabráin = 
 Áedán mac Gabráin ( pronounced [ <unk> mak <unk> ] in Old Irish ) was a king of Dál Riata from c . 574 until c . 609 . The kingdom of Dál Riata was situated in modern Argyll and Bute , Scotland , and parts of County Antrim , Ireland . <unk> record that Áedán was a son of Gabrán mac Domangairt . 
 He was a contemporary of Saint Columba , and much that is recorded of his life and career comes from hagiography such as Adomnán of Iona 's Life of Saint Columba . Áedán appears as a character in Old Irish and Middle Irish language works of prose and verse , some now lost . 
 The Irish annals record Áedán 's campaigns against his neighbours , in Ireland , and in northern Britain , including expeditions to the Orkney Islands , the Isle of Man , and the east coast of Scotland . As recorded by Bede , Áedán was decisively defeated by Æthelfrith of Bernicia at the Battle of Degsastan . Áedán may have been deposed , or have abdicated , following this defeat . His date of death is recorded by one source as 17 April 609 . 
 = = Neighbours = = 
 Áedán was the chief king in Dál Riata , ruling over lesser tribal kings . The Senchus fer n @-@ Alban records the sub @-@ divisions of Dál Riata in the 7th and 8th centuries , but no record from Áedán 's time survives . According to the Senchus , Dál Riata was divided into three sub @-@ kingdoms in the 7th century , each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder . These were the Cenél nGabráin , named for Áedán 's father , who ruled over Kintyre , Cowal and Bute ; the Cenél Loairn of northern Argyll ; and the Cenél nÓengusa of Islay . Within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by the Senchus . Details of the Irish part of the kingdom are less clear . 
 Looking outward , Dál Riata 's neighbours in north Britain were the Picts and the Britons of the Hen Ogledd , the Brittonic @-@ speaking parts of what is now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland . The most powerful Brittonic kingdom in the area was Alt Clut , later known as Strathclyde and Cumbria . Late in Áedán 's life , the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdom of Bernicia became the greatest power in north Britain . 
 In Ireland , Dál Riata formed part of Ulster , ruled by Báetán mac Cairill of the Dál Fiatach . The other major grouping in Ulster were the disunited tribes of the Cruithne , later known as the Dál nAraidi . The most important Cruithne king in Áedán 's time was Fiachnae mac Báetáin . Beyond the kingdom of Ulster , and generally hostile to it , were the various kingdoms and tribes of the Uí Néill and their subjects and allies . Of the Uí Néill kings , Áed mac <unk> of the Cenél Conaill , Columba 's first cousin once removed , was the most important during Áedán 's reign . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Adomnán , the Senchus fer n @-@ Alban and the Irish annals record Áedán as a son of Gabrán mac Domangairt ( died c . 555 – 560 ) . Áedán 's brother <unk> is known from Adomnán and his death is recorded c . 597 . The Senchus names three other sons of Gabrán , namely <unk> , Domnall , and Domangart . Although nothing is known of <unk> and Domangart or their descendants , Adomnán mentions a certain Ioan , son of Conall , son of Domnall , " who belonged to the royal lineage of the Cenél nGabráin " , but this is generally read as meaning that Ioan was a kinsman of the Cenél nGabráin , and his grandfather named Domnall is not thought to be the same person as Áedán 's brother Domnall . 
 Áedán was about forty years old when he became king , following the death of his uncle Conall mac Comgaill in 574 . His succession as king may have been contested ; Adomnán states that Columba had favoured the candidacy of Áedán 's brother <unk> . Adomnán claims that Áedán was ordained as king by Columba , the first example of an ordination known in Britain and Ireland . 
 In 574 , following the account of Conall 's death , the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach record a battle in Kintyre , called the Battle of <unk> , or <unk> . The precise location of the battle is unidentified . The annals agree that " <unk> , son of Conall , son of Comgall , and many others of the allies of the sons of Gabrán , fell . " In 575 , the Annals of Ulster report " the great convention of Druim <unk> " , at Mullagh or Daisy Hill near <unk> , with Áed mac <unk> and Columba in attendance . Adomnán reports that Áedán was present at the meeting . The purpose of the meeting is not entirely certain , but one agreement made there concerned the status of Áedán 's kingdom . Áedán and Áed agreed that while the fleet of Dál Riata would serve the Uí Néill , no tribute would be paid to them , and warriors would only be provided from the Dál Riata lands in Ireland . 
 The reason for this agreement is thought to have been the threat posed to Áedán , and also to Áed , by Báetán mac Cairill . Báetán is said to have forced the king of Dál Riata to pay homage to him at <unk> on <unk> . Áedán is thought to be the king in question , and Ulster sources say that Báetán collected tribute from Scotland . Following Báetán 's death in 581 , the Ulstermen abandoned the Isle of Man , which they had captured in Báetán 's time , perhaps driven out by Áedán who is recorded as fighting there c . 583 . Earlier , c . 580 , Áedán is said to have raided Orkney , which had been subject to Bridei son of Maelchon , King of the Picts , at an earlier date . 
 Áedán 's campaigns on the Isle of Man have sometimes been confused with the battle against the <unk> mentioned by Adomnán . The <unk> appear to have been the Maeatae , a tribe in the area of the upper river Forth . This campaign was successful , but Áedán 's sons Artúr and Eochaid Find were killed in battle according to Adomnán . This battle may have taken place c . 590 and be recorded as the Battle of <unk> or <unk> . 
 The Prophecy of Berchán says of Áedán : " Thirteen years ( one after another ) [ he will fight against ] the Pictish host ( fair the diadem ) . " The only recorded battle between Áedán and the Picts appears to have been fought in Circinn , in 599 or after , where Áedán was defeated . The annals mention the deaths of his sons here . It has been suggested that this battle was confused with the " Battle of <unk> " in Circinn , fought c . 584 , in which Bridei son of Maelchon was killed . This battle is described as being " fought between the Picts themselves " . 
 A number of Welsh traditions point to warfare between Áedán and King Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut , the northern Brittonic kingdom later known as Strathclyde Hector Munro Chadwick and subsequent historians suggest Áedán was initially in a long @-@ term alliance with Rhydderch and his predecessors , but that it eventually collapsed into conflict . Adomnán reports that Rhydderch sent a monk named <unk> to Iona to speak with Columba " for he wanted to learn whether he would be slaughtered by his enemies or not " . A Welsh Triad names Áedán 's plundering of Alt Clut as one of the " three unrestrained <unk> of Britain " , and the poem <unk> <unk> tells of a battle between Áedán and Rhydderch . The lost Irish epic <unk> <unk> <unk> is usually thought to refer to the attack on Alt Clut in 870 by Vikings , but MacQuarrie suggests that it may refer to an attack by Áedán on Rhydderch . 
 = = Degsastan and after = = 
 Degsastan appears not to have been the first battle between Áedán and the Bernicians . The death of his son Domangart in the land of the Saxons is mentioned by Adomnán , and it is presumed that Bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle . 
 Of the roots of this conflict , Bede mentions only that Áedán was alarmed by Æthelfrith 's advance . Wherever the Battle of Degsastan was fought , Bede saw it as lying within Northumbria . The battle was a decisive victory for Æthelfrith , and Bede says , carefully , that " [ f ] rom that day until the present , no king of the Irish in Britain has dared to do battle with the English . " Although victorious , Æthelfrith suffered losses ; Bede tells us his brother <unk> was killed with all his following . <unk> appears to be called Eanfrith in Irish sources , which name his killer as Máel <unk> mac Báetáin of the Cenél nEógain , son of High @-@ King Báetán mac <unk> . The Irish poem Compert <unk> says that the king of Ulster , Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi , aided Áedán against the Saxons , perhaps at Degsastan . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle mentions that Hering , son of King <unk> of Bernicia , was present , apparently fighting with Áedán . 
 After the defeat of Degsastan , the annals report nothing of Áedán until his death around six years later , perhaps on 17 April 609 , the date supplied by the Martyrology of Tallaght , composed c . 800 . The Annals of Tigernach give his age as 74 . The Prophecy of Berchán places his death in Kintyre and says " [ h ] e will not be king at the time of his death " , while the 12th century Acta Sancti <unk> claims that he was expelled from the kingship . John of Fordun , writing in the 14th century , believed that Áedán had been buried at <unk> in Kintyre . 
 = = Áedán 's descendants = = 
 Áedán was succeeded by his son , Eochaid <unk> . Adomnán gives an account of Columba 's prophecy that Eochaid 's older brothers would predecease their father . Áedán 's other sons are named by the Senchus fer n @-@ Alban as Eochaid Find , <unk> , Bran , <unk> , Conaing , and Gartnait . Adomnán also names Artúr , called a son of Conaing in the Senchus , and Domangart , who is not included in the Senchus . Domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of Áedán , most likely another son of Conaing . The main line of Cenél nGabráin kings were the descendants of Eochaid <unk> through his son Domnall Brecc , but the descendants of Conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th . 
 It has been suggested that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch , king of the Picts , whose death is reported around 601 , but this rests on the idea of Pictish <unk> , which has been criticised . Even less certainly , it has been argued that Gartnait 's successor in the Pictish king @-@ lists , Nechtan , was his grandson , and thus Áedán 's great @-@ grandson . 
 Less is known of Áedán 's daughters . <unk> , also recorded as Gemma , married a prince named <unk> of the Dál Fiatach . The names of Áedán 's wives are not recorded , but one was said to be Brittonic , and another may have been a Pictish woman named Domelch , if indeed the Gartnait son of Domelch and Gartnait son of Áedán are one and the same .

The show was called The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold @-@ out months with HBO producing a successful special about it . Pee @-@ wee became an instant cult figure and for the next decade Reubens would be completely committed to his character , doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee @-@ wee . In 1985 Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure , directed by the then @-@ unknown Tim Burton , was a financial and critical success , and soon developed into a cult film . Big Top Pee @-@ wee , 1988 's sequel , was less successful than its predecessor . Between 1986 and 1990 , Reubens starred as Pee @-@ wee in the CBS Saturday @-@ morning children 's program Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse . 
 Thereafter , Reubens decided to take a sabbatical from Pee @-@ wee . In July 1991 , Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota , Florida . The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public 's view of Reubens and Pee @-@ wee . The arrest postponed Reubens ' involvement in major projects until 1999 , when he appeared in several big @-@ budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee @-@ wee . 
 Since 2006 , Reubens has been making cameos and guest appearances in numerous projects , such as Reno 911 ! , 30 Rock , Dirt , Pushing Daisies , and The Blacklist . Since the 1990s , he has worked on two possible Pee @-@ wee films : one dark and adult , dubbed The Pee @-@ wee Herman Story , and one a family @-@ friendly epic adventure called Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse : The Movie . In 2010 , he starred on Broadway in The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show . 
 In 2016 , Reubens helped write and star in the Netflix original movie , Pee @-@ wee 's Big Holiday reprising his role as Pee @-@ wee Herman . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Reubens was born Paul Rubenfeld in Peekskill , New York , and grew up in Sarasota , Florida , where his parents , Judy ( Rosen ) and Milton Rubenfeld , owned a lamp store . His mother was a teacher . His father was an automobile salesperson who had flown for Britain 's Royal Air Force and for the U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II , later becoming one of the founding pilots of the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War . Paul has two younger siblings , Luke ( born 1958 ) , who is a dog trainer , and Abby ( born 1953 ) , who is an attorney , and board member of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee . 
 Reubens spent a significant amount of his childhood in Oneonta , New York . As a child , Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus , whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota . The circus 's atmosphere sparked Reubens ' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work . Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy , which made him want to make people laugh . At age five , Reubens asked his father to build him a stage , where he and his siblings would put on plays . 
 Reubens attended Sarasota High School , where he was named president of the National Thespian Society . He was accepted into Northwestern University 's summer program for gifted high @-@ school students and also joined the local Asolo Theater and Players of Sarasota Theater , appearing in several plays . After graduation , he attended Boston University and began auditioning for acting schools . He was turned down by several schools , including Juilliard , and twice by Carnegie @-@ Mellon , before being accepted at the California Institute of the Arts and moving to California , where he worked in restaurant kitchens and as a Fuller Brush salesman . 
 In the 1970s , Reubens performed at local comedy clubs and made four guest appearances on The Gong Show as part of a boy – girl act he had developed with Charlotte McGinnis , called The Hilarious Betty and Eddie . He soon joined the Los Angeles – based improvisational comedy team The Groundlings and remained a member for six years , working with Bob McClurg , John Paragon , Susan Barnes , and Phil Hartman . Hartman and Reubens became friends , often writing and working on material together . In 1980 , he had a small part as a waiter in The Blues Brothers . 
 = = Pee @-@ wee Herman = = 
 The character of " Pee @-@ wee Herman " originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings , where Reubens came up with the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic , but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would never make it . Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling , John Paragon , would help write the show . Despite having been compared to other famous characters , such as Hergé 's Tintin and Collodi 's Pinocchio , Reubens says that there is no specific source for " Pee @-@ wee " but rather a collection of ideas . Pee @-@ wee 's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father , where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play , for which Reubens adopted a cartoon @-@ like way of speaking that would become Pee @-@ wee 's . Pee @-@ wee 's name resulted from a one @-@ inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child , and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth . The first small gray suit Pee @-@ wee ever wore had been handmade for director and founder of the Groundlings Gary Austin , who passed it on to Reubens , while " someone " handed him the " little kid bow tie " before a show . 
 = = = The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show : 1981 – 1984 = = = 
 Reubens auditioned for Saturday Night Live for the 1980 – 1981 season , but Gilbert Gottfried , who was a close friend of the show 's producer and had the same acting style as Reubens , got the place ( ironically , Gottfried would later get in trouble for joking about Reubens ' indecent exposure arrest as an award presenter at the Emmys ) . Reubens was so angry and bitter that he decided he would borrow money and start his own show in Los Angeles using the character he had been developing during the last few years , " Pee @-@ wee Herman " . 
 With the help of other Groundlings like John Paragon , Phil Hartman and Lynne Marie Stewart , Pee @-@ wee acquired a small group of followers and Reubens took his show to The Roxy Theatre where " The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show " ran for five sellout months , doing midnight shows for adults and weekly matinees for children , moving into the mainstream when HBO aired The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show in 1981 as part of their series On Location . Reubens also appeared as Pee @-@ wee in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong 's Next Movie . Although it was Reubens in the role of Pee @-@ Wee , the end credits of the movie billed him as Hamburger Dude . Reubens ' act had mainly positive reactions and quickly acquired a group of fans , despite being described as " bizarre " , and Reubens being described as " the weirdest comedian around " . Pee @-@ wee was both " corny " and " hip " , " retrograde " and " avant @-@ garde " . 
 When Pee @-@ wee 's fame started growing , Reubens started to move away from the spotlight , keeping his name under wraps and making all his public appearance and interviews in character while billing Pee @-@ wee as playing himself ; Reubens was trying to " get the public to think that that was a real person " . Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman . In the early and mid @-@ 1980s , Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee @-@ wee Herman which gave Pee @-@ wee an even bigger following . During the mid @-@ 1980s , Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show , playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis , Caroline 's in New York City and , in 1984 , in front of a full Carnegie Hall .

 The success of The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show prompted Warner Bros. to hire Reubens to write a script for a full @-@ length Pee @-@ wee Herman film . Reubens ' original idea was to do a remake of Pollyanna , which Reubens claims is his favorite film . Halfway through writing the script , Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike with them , which inspired Reubens to start on a new script with Phil Hartman . When Reubens and the producers of Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure saw Tim Burton 's work on Vincent and Frankenweenie , they chose Burton to be the film 's director . The film tells the story of Pee @-@ wee Herman embarking on nationwide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle . The movie went on to gross $ 40 @,@ 940 @,@ 662 domestically , recouping almost six times its $ 7 million budget . At the time of release in 1985 , the film received mixed reviews , but Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure developed into a cult film .

 After seeing the success of Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure , the CBS network approached Reubens with an ill @-@ received cartoon series proposal . In 1986 , CBS agreed to sign Reubens to act , produce , and direct his live @-@ action children 's program , Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse , with a budget of $ 325 @,@ 000 per episode , the same price as a prime @-@ time sitcom , and no creative interference from CBS ; although CBS did request a few minor changes throughout the years . After casting actors like Laurence Fishburne and S. Epatha Merkerson , production began in New York City . The opening credits of the show were sung by Cyndi Lauper . Playhouse was designed as an educational yet entertaining and artistic show for children and , despite being greatly influenced by 1950s shows Reubens watched as a child like The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show , The Mickey Mouse Club , Captain Kangaroo and Howdy Doody , it quickly acquired a dual audience of kids and grownups . Reubens , always trying to make of Pee @-@ wee a positive role model , was after making a significantly moral show , one that would teach children the ethics of reciprocity . Reubens believed that children liked the Playhouse because it was fast @-@ paced , colorful and " never talked them down " ; while parents liked the Playhouse because it reminded them of the past . 
 In 1986 , Reubens ( billed as Paul Mall ) was the voice of the ship 's computer in Flight of the Navigator . In 1987 , Reubens provided the voice of REX , the main robot in the George Lucas produced Disneyland attraction , Star Tours , and reprised the role of Pee @-@ wee Herman in cameo appearances in the film Back to the Beach and TV show Sesame Street , the latter of which made a cameo in Playhouse . 
 Right after the success of Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure Reubens began working with Paramount Pictures on a sequel entitled Big Top Pee @-@ wee . Reubens and George McGrath 's script was directed by Grease director Randal Kleiser . The film was not as successful as its predecessor , receiving mild reviews and doing just over one third as well in the box office , earning only $ 15 million . 
 Reubens attended 1988 Academy Awards with Top co @-@ star Valeria <unk> , which stirred rumors that the two were dating . The following year Reubens exchanged vows with Doris Duke 's adopted daughter , <unk> Heffner , at a mock wedding over which Imelda Marcos presided , in Shangri @-@ La , Doris Duke 's mansion in Honolulu , Hawaii . 
 Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse aired from September 13 , 1986 , until November 10 , 1990 . Reubens had originally agreed to do two more seasons after the third , and when CBS asked Reubens about the possibility of a sixth season he declined , wanting to take a sabbatical . Reubens had been suffering from burnout from playing Pee @-@ wee full @-@ time and had been warning that Pee @-@ wee was temporary and that he had other ideas he would like to work on . The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons , which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special . Playhouse garnered 15 Emmy Awards , all of them in the Creative Arts Emmy Award category . 
 = = = Pee @-@ wee 's legacy = = = 
 Reubens had not always thought of his character as one for children , but sometime during the mid @-@ 1980s , he started forming Pee @-@ wee into the best role model he possibly could , making of his show a morally positive show that cared about issues like racial diversity . Reubens was also careful on what should be associated to Pee @-@ wee . Being a heavy smoker , he went to great lengths never to be photographed with a cigarette in his mouth , even refusing to endorse candy bars and other kinds of junk food , all the while trying to release his own sugar @-@ free cereal " Ralston Purina Pee @-@ wee Chow cereal " , a project that died after a blind test . 
 With his positive attitude and quirkiness , Pee @-@ wee became an instant cult figure , earning a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by 1989 , and successfully building a Pee @-@ wee franchise , with toys , clothes and other items generating more than $ 25 million at its peak in 1988 . Reubens also published a book as Pee @-@ wee in 1989 called Travels with Pee @-@ Wee . CBS aired reruns of Playhouse until July 1991 , when Reubens was arrested , pulling from their schedule the last two remaining reruns . Fox Family Channel briefly aired reruns of the Playhouse in 1998 . In early July 2006 , Cartoon Network began running a teaser promo during its Adult Swim lineup . A later press release and many other promos confirmed that the show 's 45 original episodes would nightly air from Monday to Thursday starting on that date . Playhouse attracted 1 @.@ 5 million viewers nightly . In 2007 , TV Guide named Playhouse one of the top 10 TV cult classics of all time . Several children 's television personas cite Pee @-@ wee Herman as an inspiration , including Blue 's Clues 's Steve Burns and SpongeBob SquarePants 's Stephen Hillenburg . 
 In November 2004 , all 45 episodes of the Playhouse , plus six episodes that had never before been released on home video , were released on DVD split between two box set collections . Reubens planned to re @-@ release the DVDs with audio commentaries by the following year , but this has yet to materialize . 
 Pee @-@ wee 's small glen plaid suits seemed ridiculous during the 1980s , but since the late 1990s have made him a " style icon " , with fashion houses and designers like Christopher Bailey , Ennio <unk> , Miuccia Prada , Viktor & Rolf , and Thom Browne creating cut tight suits with high <unk> and short trousers that have been compared to Pee @-@ wee 's . In early 2007 Nike released a collection of Nike SB sneakers called " Fallen Heroes " . The collection was loosely inspired by Milli Vanilli , MC Hammer , Vanilla Ice , and Pee @-@ wee Herman . Pee @-@ wee 's sneakers use a gray and white color scheme with red detail , with an illustration on the <unk> of a man in a suit sitting alone in a theatre with his hand on his lap suggesting Reubens ' 1991 theatre arrest . 
 Reubens has mentioned he has plans for a museum , which would contain many of the Playhouse sets and props he still owns .

 In July 1991 , while visiting with relatives , Reubens was arrested in Sarasota , Florida for masturbating during a film at an adult theater . After arresting a number of other men , a detective who had been observing Reubens detained him on his way out . When detectives examined his driver 's license , Reubens told them , " I 'm Pee @-@ wee Herman " , and offered to do a children 's benefit for the sheriff 's office , " to take care of this " . The next day , after a local reporter recognized Reubens ' name , Reubens ' attorney made the same offer to the Sarasota Herald @-@ Tribune in exchange for withholding the story . In 1971 , Reubens had been arrested in the same county for loitering and prowling near an adult theater , though charges were dropped . His second arrest was in 1983 when Reubens was placed on two years ' probation for possession of marijuana , although adjudication was withheld . On the night of the arrest Reubens went to Nashville , where his sister and lawyer lived , and then to New Jersey , where he would stay for the following months at his friend Doris Duke 's estate . 
 The 1991 arrest was widely covered , and Reubens and his character both became the subject of ridicule . Disney @-@ MGM Studios suspended a video that showed Pee @-@ wee explaining how voice @-@ over tracks were made from its studio tour . Toys " R " Us removed Pee @-@ wee toys from its stores . It was commonly thought that Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse got cancelled due to the arrest ; in actuality the show was already retired as Reubens had decided against a sixth season . However , the popularity of the show had put it into syndication , which CBS revoked in fall of 1991 . Reubens released a statement denying the charges . 
 Reubens pleaded no contest . The plea kept the charge off Reubens ' record and obligated him to spend 75 hours performing community service , making an anti @-@ drug public service announcement that he would write , produce and finance . 
 Despite the negative publicity , many artists who knew Reubens , such as Cyndi Lauper , Annette Funicello , Zsa Zsa Gabor , and Valeria <unk> , spoke out in his support . Bill Cosby defended Reubens , saying , " Whatever [ Reubens has ] done , this is being blown all out of proportion . " Other people who knew Reubens , such as Playhouse production designer Gary Panter , S. Epatha Merkerson , and Big Top Pee @-@ wee director Randal Kleiser , also spoke in support . Reubens ' fans organized support rallies after CBS canceled the reruns , picketing in Los Angeles , New York , and San Francisco . The TV news magazine A Current Affair received " tens of thousands " of responses to a Pee @-@ wee telephone survey , in which callers supported Reubens by nine @-@ to @-@ one . 
 Reubens , who for years would not give interviews or appear on talk shows , did make a subsequent public appearance as Pee @-@ wee at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards , where he asked the audience , " Heard any good jokes lately ? " He received a standing ovation . Reubens then appeared as Pee @-@ wee once in 1992 , when he participated in a Grand Ole Opry tribute to Minnie Pearl . As part of his community service , Reubens returned to the Pee @-@ Wee character for a public service announcement , as well as reviving one of his Playhouse characters , a claymation character named " Penny " for a second PSA talking about the dangers of substance abuse . 
 = = 1990s and comeback in Blow = = 
 During the 1990s , Reubens kept a low profile , dedicating himself to writing and collecting a variety of things , " everything from fake food , to lamps " , although he did do some dubbing and took small parts in films such as 1992 's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Tim Burton 's Batman Returns ( Reubens portrayed the Penguin 's father ) and 1996 's Matilda and Dunston Checks In . In 1993 , he voiced for a character in another one of Burton 's productions , The Nightmare Before Christmas . ( Reubens would later voice Lock for the video game The Nightmare Before Christmas : Oogie 's Revenge in 2004 . ) During the mid @-@ 1990s , Reubens played a recurring role on the TV series Murphy Brown . The role earned him positive reviews and his first and only non @-@ Pee @-@ wee Emmy nomination , for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series . He appeared six times on the show between 1995 and 1997 . Afterward , Reubens began working on an NBC pilot entitled Meet the <unk> , a show that would be based on You Can 't Take It with You . The project got stuck in development hell , and was later dropped when Reubens ' ideas grew too elaborate and expensive , although Philip Rosenthal blamed NBC 's negative response on Reubens being on a " blacklist " . 
 By 1999 , Reubens had given several interviews as himself and made public appearances while promoting the movie Mystery Men , the first being on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 1999 . He also starred in Dwight Yoakam 's Western South of Heaven , West of Hell , playing as a rapist and killer . In 2001 , Reubens had his first extended television role since Playhouse , as the host of the short @-@ lived ABC game show You Don 't Know Jack , based on the game of the same name . It was cancelled after six episodes due to low ratings . 
 Reubens ' played a flamboyant hairdresser turned drug dealer in Ted Demme 's drama Blow , which starred Penélope Cruz and Johnny Depp . His performance was praised and he began receiving scripts for potential movie projects . 
 Reubens dated actress Debi Mazar in 1993 after he started attending film premieres with her . Reubens has since credited Mazar with ending his depression from his arrest .
