 = Battle of Uhud = 
 The Battle of Uhud ( Arabic : غزوة <unk> <unk> ‘ <unk> ) was fought on Saturday , March 23 , 625 ( 7 Shawwal 3 AH in the Islamic calendar ) at the valley located in front of Mount Uhud , in what is now northwestern Arabia . It occurred between a force from the Muslim community of Medina led by the Islamic prophet Muhammad , and a force led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb from Mecca , the town from which many of the Muslims had previously emigrated . The Battle of Uhud was the second military encounter between the Meccans and the Muslims , preceded by the Battle of Badr in 624 , where a small Muslim army had defeated a larger Meccan army . 
 Marching out from Mecca towards Medina on March 11 , 625 AD , the Meccans desired to avenge their losses at Badr and strike back at Muhammad and his followers . The Muslims readied for war soon afterwards and the two armies fought on the slopes and plains of Mount Uhud . 
 Whilst outnumbered , the Muslims gained the early initiative and forced the Meccan lines back , thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected . When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory , a serious mistake was committed by a part of the Muslim army , which altered the outcome of the battle . A breach of Muhammad 's orders by the Muslim archers , who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp , allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry , led by Meccan war veteran Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid , which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks . Many Muslims were killed , and even Muhammad himself was badly injured . The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud . The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further , but marched back to Mecca declaring victory . 
 For the Muslims , the battle was a significant setback : although they had been close to routing the Meccans a second time , their breach of Muhammad 's orders in favor of collecting Meccan spoils reaped severe consequences . The two armies would meet again in 627 AD at the Battle of the Trench . 
 = = Background = = 
 Muhammad had preached the religion of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622 . He had attracted a small community of followers , but also drew staunch opposition from the rest of the Quraysh , the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged . The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina ( formerly known as Yathrib ; Medina means City ) . The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to Damascus which the Muslims intercepted and raided . The Meccans sent out a small army to punish the Muslims and stop their raiding . At the Battle of Badr in 624 , a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army . 
 Many Muslims considered this unexpected victory a proof that they had been favored by God and believed they were assured such victories in the future . A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan . He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr , for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad , vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina . Several months later , Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city , obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir and learning more of the current situation in Medina . He and his party then left Medina , burning down two houses and laying waste to some fields in fulfillment of his vow . Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter .

 The following year on March 11 , 625 , with Abu Sufyan at the helm , the Meccans — anxious to avenge their defeat at Badr — raised another force numbering 3 @,@ 000 and set out for the Muslim base in Medina . Rather than attacking Medina itself , which was populated by numerous strongholds that would have required long sieges to overcome , they camped on the pastures north of the city , hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them . According to the early Muslim historian Ibn Ishaq , a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan 's army to provide vocal support , including Hind bint Utbah , his wife . 
 A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army 's presence and numbers late on Thursday March 21 . The next morning , a Muslim conference of war convened , and there was dispute over how to best repel the Meccans . Muhammad and many of the senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds . Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops , and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige . Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter , and readied the Muslim force for battle . 
 = = Encounter at Uhud = = 
 A group of approximately 1 @,@ 000 Muslim men set out on late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces . Early the next morning , they took a position on the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud . Shortly before the battle commenced , ' Abd @-@ Allah ibn Ubayy ( the chief of the <unk> tribe ) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina , with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy 's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans . Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur 'an for this act . 
 What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met , was with the leave of Allah , in order that He might test the believers , - 
 And the Hypocrites also . These were told : " Come , fight in the way of Allah , or ( at least ) drive ( The foe from your city ) . " They said : " Had we known how to fight , we should certainly have followed you . " They were that day nearer to <unk> than to Faith , saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal . 
 ( They are ) the ones that say , ( of their brethren slain ) , while they themselves sit ( at ease ) : " If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain . " Say : " <unk> death from your own selves , if ye speak the truth . " 
 The Muslim force , now numbering around 700 , was stationed on the slopes of Uhud , facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself . Before the battle , Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp . This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army ; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank , while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated on the east side of the Muslim camp . Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp , and thus the Muslim army wouldn 't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry , keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50 : 1 ratio . 
 Muhammad ordered the Muslim archers to never under any circumstances leave their positions on the hill unless ordered to do so by him only , he made this order very clear by uttering these words to the archers , " If you saw us prevail and start to take spoils , do not come to assist us . And if you saw us get vanquished and birds eat from our heads , do not come to assist us . " 
 The Meccan army positioned itself facing the Muslim lines , with the main body led by Abu Sufyan , and the left and right flanks commanded by Ikrimah ibn Abi @-@ Jahl and Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid respectively . ' Amr ibn al- ' As was named the commander of cavalry and his task was to coordinate attack between the cavalry wings . 
 The Meccans attacked with their initial charge led by the Medinan exile Abu ‘ Amir . Thwarted by a shower of stones from the Muslims , Abu ‘ Amir and his men were forced to retire and tend to the camps behind the Meccan lines . The Meccan standard @-@ bearer , Talhah ibn Abi Talhah al- ‘ <unk> , advanced and challenged the enemy to a duel . Ali ( Ali ibn Abi Talib ) , the young cousin of Muhammad , rushed forth and struck Talhah down in a single blow . Talhah 's brother , <unk> , ran forward to pick up the fallen banner — the Meccan women willing him on with songs and the loud beating of <unk> . Hamza ibn ‘ Abd al @-@ <unk> emerged from the Muslim ranks , bringing him to a similar fate as Talhah . It was their family that was responsible for the Meccan army 's standard @-@ bearing , and thus one by one , Talhah 's brothers and sons went to retrieve the Meccan banner and fight unsuccessfully , until they all eventually perished . 
 Following the duels , general engagement between the two armies commenced . Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks . The Meccan army was pushed back , and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers . Enjoying the best of these early encounters , the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines , with victory appearing certain . However , it was the detachment of the Muslim archers , disobeying Muhammad 's strict orders to remain stationary , that would shift the outcome of the battle , as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp , leaving the flank vulnerable . 
 At this critical juncture , the Meccan cavalry led by Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid exploited this move and attacked the remaining minority of Muslim archers who refused to disobey Muhammad 's orders and were still positioned on the hill . From there , the Meccans were then able to target and overrun the Muslim flank and rear . Confusion ensued , and numerous Muslims were killed . Most notably was Hamza , who had been thrown down in a surprise attack by the javelin of the Ethiopian slave of Hind , <unk> ibn Harb . While the Meccan riposte strengthened , rumors circulated that Muhammad too had perished . It emerged , however , that Muhammad had only been wounded — due to missiles of stone which resulted in a gash on his forehead and lip . It is recorded that Ali ibn Abi Talib alone remained , fending off the assaults of Khalid 's cavalrymen . According to Ibn <unk> , " The Prophet became the object of the attack of various units of the army of <unk> from all sides . Ali attacked , in compliance with Muhammad 's orders , every unit that made an attack upon him and dispersed them or killed some of them , and this thing took place a number of times in Uhud . " 
 After fierce hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , most of the Muslims managed to withdraw and regroup higher up on the slopes of Uhud . A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina , though many of these were killed . The Meccans ' chief offensive arm , its cavalry , was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims , and so the fighting ceased . Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses , cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets . Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza , taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat . Abu Sufyan , after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad 's companion , Umar ( Umar ibn al @-@ Khattab ) , decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage . 
 The battle is generally believed by scholars to be a defeat for the Muslims , as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans . Chase F. Robinson , writing in the Encyclopaedia of Islam , states the notion that " the Muslims suffered a disheartening defeat is clear enough . " Other scholars such as William Montgomery Watt disagree , noting that while the Muslims did not win , the Meccans had failed to achieve their strategic aim of destroying Muhammad and his followers ; and that the Meccans ' untimely withdrawal indicated weakness on their part . The battle is also noted for the emergence of the military leadership and tactical military genius of Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid , who would later become the most famous of all Arab generals during the Islamic expansion era , in conquering the Sassanid Empire and Byzantine held Syria . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Muhammad and the Muslims buried the dead on the battlefield , returning home that evening . The Meccans retired for the evening at a place called Hamra al @-@ Asad , a few miles away from Medina . The next morning , Muhammad sent out a small force to harry the Meccan army on their way home . According to Watt , this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory . The Meccans , not wanting to be perceived as being chased away , remained nearby for a few days before leaving . 
 = = = Muslim reaction = = = 
 For the Muslims , the battle held a religious dimension as well as a military one . They had expected another victory like at Badr , which was considered a sign of God 's favor upon them . At Uhud , however , they had barely held off the invaders and had lost a great many men . A verse of the Qur 'an revealed soon after the battle cited the Muslims ' disobedience and desire for loot as the cause for this setback : 
 Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy , <unk> ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order , and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight ( of the booty ) which ye covet . Among you are some that hanker after this world and some that desire the Hereafter . Then did He divert you from your foes in order to test you but He forgave you : For Allah is full of grace to those who believe . 
 According to the Qur 'an , then , the misfortunes at Uhud — largely the result of the rear guard abandoning their position in order to seek booty — were partly a punishment and partly a test for steadfastness . Firestone observes that such verses provided inspiration and hope to the Muslims , <unk> future battles that they would experience . He adds that rather than demoralizing the Muslims , the battle seemed to reinforce the solidarity between them . 
 = = = Further conflict = = = 
 Abu Sufyan , whose position as leader was no longer undisputed , set about forging alliances with surrounding nomadic tribes in order to build up strength for another advance on Medina . The success of the Meccans ' rousing of tribes against Muhammad reaped disastrous consequences for him and the Muslims with two main losses : one was where a Muslim party had been invited by a chieftain of the Ma <unk> tribe , who were then killed as they approached by the tribe of Sulaym ; while the other was when the Muslims had sent out instructors to a tribe which stated it wanted to convert to Islam — the instructors had been led into an ambush by the guides of the would @-@ be Muslim tribe , and were subsequently killed . Soon thereafter , Muhammad became convinced that the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir harbored enmity towards him and were plotting to kill him . The Banu Nadir were expelled from Medina after a fifteen @-@ day siege , with some relocating to the oasis of Khaybar and others to Syria . Abu Sufyan , along with the allied confederate tribes , would attack Medina in the Battle of the Trench , two years after the events at Uhud ( in 627 ) .

 This event is mentioned in Ibn Ishaq 's biography of Muhammad .

The general sequence of the events gained consensus early on , as demonstrated in the text of Ibn Ishaq , an early biographer of Muhammad . Accounts of the battle are derived mainly from descendants of the participants . Much of the basic narrative and chronology , according to Robinson , is reasonably authentic , although some of the more elaborate details — such as the exact scale of the Muslim defeat — may be doubtful or difficult to ascertain . 
 = = Battle of Uhud in warfare = = 
 Though strategically indecisive , the conduct of the battle was sufficient proof of the military awareness of the Arabs even before their campaigns in Persia and Syria . The basic assumption that Arabs were generally raiders and learned warfare from the Persians and Syrians is proved wrong here . Abu Sufyan made full use of his cavalry by deploying them as two mobile wings . The infantry based centre provided the base upon which the cavalry would operate . He intended to pull the celebrated " Double <unk> " maneuver . He deployed his forces in the same manner as a Persian or Byzantine general would have done . 
 Muhammad on the other hand showed his ability as a general by choosing the battlefield of Uhud . He decided according to the will of Muslims to fight in open country but he was aware of the superior mobility of the Meccans . He knew an encounter in open country would expose the infantry wings to envelopment , so to neutralize the Meccan mobility factor , he decided to hold high ground with Mount Uhud in their rear , which provided security from any attack from the rear . Moreover , as the front was of approximately of 800 to 900 yd ( 730 to 820 m ) and on one flank he rested Mount <unk> and on other flank were the defiles of Mount Uhud so in military language he refused both wings to the Meccan cavalry . The only approach from which they could be taken from the rear was protected by the deployment of archers . This battle is a specimen of how an infantry based entity should fight against a cavalry dominated arm . The comparison of this battle with the Battle of <unk> fought by Tariq ibn Ziyad against the Visigothic Kingdom is indeed striking .

 The battle of Uhud is the second of the two main battles featured in Moustapha Akkad 's 1976 film centering on the life of Muhammad , Mohammad , Messenger of God . The other battle featured is the battle of Badr . The battle of Uhud is also depicted in the 2004 animated film , Muhammad : The Last Prophet , directed by Richard Rich , and in the 2012 TV series Farouk Omar . The cave in Mount Uhud where Muhammad rested temporarily during the battle has also received recent media attention in the light of proposals by some Islamic scholars for it to be destroyed . 
 = Idiopathic intracranial hypertension = 
 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) , sometimes called by the older names benign intracranial hypertension ( BIH ) or pseudotumor cerebri ( PTC ) , is a neurological disorder that is characterized by increased intracranial pressure ( pressure around the brain ) in the absence of a tumor or other diseases . The main symptoms are stroke @-@ like headache , nausea , and vomiting , as well as pulsatile tinnitus ( sounds perceived in the ears , with the sound occurring in the same rhythm as the pulse ) , double vision and other visual symptoms . If untreated , it may lead to swelling of the optic disc in the eye , which can progress to vision loss . 
 IIH is diagnosed with a brain scan ( to rule out other causes ) and a lumbar puncture ; lumbar puncture may also provide temporary and sometimes permanent relief from the symptoms . Some respond to medication ( with the drug acetazolamide , Topiramate , Furosemide , others or a combination ) , but others require surgery to relieve the pressure . The condition may occur in all age groups , but is most common in women aged 20 – 40 . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The most common symptom of IIH is headache , which occurs in almost all ( 92 – 94 % ) cases . It is characteristically worse in the morning , generalized in character and throbbing in nature . It may be associated with nausea and vomiting . The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure , such as coughing and sneezing . The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders . Many have pulsatile tinnitus , a whooshing sensation in one or both ears ( 64 – 87 % ) ; this sound is synchronous with the pulse . Various other symptoms , such as numbness of the extremities , generalized weakness , loss of smell , and loss of coordination , are reported more rarely ; none are specific for IIH . In children , numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present . 
 The increased pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves , a group of nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck . Most commonly , the abducens nerve ( sixth nerve ) is involved . This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward . Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side . More rarely , the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve ( third and fourth nerve palsy , respectively ) are affected ; both play a role in eye movements . The facial nerve ( seventh cranial nerve ) is affected occasionally – - the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face . 
 The increased pressure leads to papilledema , which is swelling of the optic disc , the spot where the optic nerve enters the eyeball . This occurs in practically all cases of IIH , but not everyone experiences symptoms from this . Those who do experience symptoms typically report " transient visual obscurations " , episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time . Long @-@ term untreated papilledema leads to visual loss , initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision . 
 Physical examination of the nervous system is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema , which is seen on examination of the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera . If there are cranial nerve abnormalities , these may be noticed on eye examination in the form of a squint ( third , fourth , or sixth nerve palsy ) or as facial nerve palsy . If the papilledema has been longstanding , visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased . Visual field testing by automated ( Humphrey ) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate . Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy , in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced . 
 = = Causes = = 
 " Idiopathic " means " of unknown etiology " . Therefore , IIH can only be diagnosed if there is no alternative explanation for the symptoms . Intracranial pressure may be increased due to medications such as high @-@ dose vitamin A derivatives ( e.g. isotretinoin for acne ) , long @-@ term tetracycline antibiotics ( for a variety of skin conditions ) and hormonal contraceptives . There are numerous other diseases , mostly rare conditions , that may lead to intracranial hypertension . If there is an underlying cause , the condition is termed " secondary intracranial hypertension " . Common causes of secondary intracranial hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea ( a sleep @-@ related breathing disorder ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , chronic kidney disease , and Behçet 's disease . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The cause of IIH is not known . The Monro @-@ Kellie rule states that the intracranial pressure is determined by the amount of brain tissue , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) and blood inside the bony cranial vault . Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH : an excess of CSF production , increased volume of blood or brain tissue , or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain . 
 The first theory , that of increased production of cerebrospinal fluid , was proposed in early descriptions of the disease . However , there is no experimental data that supports a role for this process in IIH . 
 The second theory posits that either increased blood flow to the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure . Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role , but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH . Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue . It remains unclear why this might be the case . 
 The third theory suggests that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion . Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses . It is not clear whether this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon . It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist , where raised ICP ( intracranial pressure ) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses , resulting in venous hypertension ( raised venous pressure ) , decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the history and examination . To confirm the diagnosis , as well as excluding alternative causes , several investigations are required ; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is more likely to have an alternative problem : children , men , the elderly , or women who are not overweight . 
 = = = Investigations = = = 
 Neuroimaging , usually with computed tomography ( CT / CAT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , is used to exclude any mass lesions . In IIH these scans typically appear to be normal , although small or slit @-@ like ventricles , dilatation and buckling of the optic nerve sheaths and " empty sella sign " ( flattening of the pituitary gland due to increased pressure ) and enlargement of Meckel 's caves may be seen . 
 An MR <unk> is also performed in most cases to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis / obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis . A contrast @-@ enhanced MRV ( <unk> ) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses . These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and <unk> . Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased <unk> fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging . 
 Lumbar puncture is performed to measure the opening pressure , as well as to obtain cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) to exclude alternative diagnoses . If the opening pressure is increased , CSF may be removed for transient relief ( see below ) . The CSF is examined for abnormal cells , infections , antibody levels , the glucose level , and protein levels . In IIH , by definition all of these are within their normal limits . Occasionally , the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms . This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate over the course of the normal day . If the suspicion of problems remains high , it may be necessary to perform more long @-@ term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 The original criteria for IIH were described by Dandy in 1937 . 
 They were modified by Smith in 1985 to become the " modified Dandy criteria " . Smith included the use of more advanced imaging : Dandy had required <unk> , but Smith replaced this with computed tomography . In a 2001 paper , <unk> and Corbett amended Dandy 's criteria further . They added the requirement that the patient is awake and alert , as coma precludes adequate neurological assessment , and require exclusion of venous sinus thrombosis as an underlying cause . Furthermore , they added the requirement that no other cause for the raised ICP is found . 
 In a 2002 review , Friedman and Jacobson propose an alternative set of criteria , derived from Smith 's . These require the absence of symptoms that could not be explained by a diagnosis of IIH , but do not require the actual presence of any symptoms ( such as headache ) attributable to IIH . These criteria also require that the lumbar puncture is performed with patient lying sideways , as a lumbar puncture performed in the upright sitting position can lead to artificially high pressure measurements . Friedman and Jacobson also do not insist on MR venography for every patient ; rather , this is only required in atypical cases ( see " diagnosis " above ) . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 The primary goal in treatment of IIH is the prevention of visual loss and blindness , as well as symptom control . IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and , where applicable , weight loss . IIH may resolve after initial treatment , may go into spontaneous remission ( although it can still relapse at a later stage ) , or may continue chronically . 
 = = = Lumbar puncture = = = 
 The first step in symptom control is drainage of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture . If necessary , this may be performed at the same time as a diagnostic LP ( such as done in search of a CSF infection ) . In some cases , this is sufficient to control the symptoms , and no further treatment is needed . 
 The procedure can be repeated if necessary , but this is generally taken as a clue that additional treatments may be required to control the symptoms and preserve vision . Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients , and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often . Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient 's vision deteriorates rapidly . 
 = = = Medication = = = 
 The best @-@ studied medical treatment for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide ( Diamox ) , which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase , and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent . It can cause the symptoms of hypokalemia ( low blood potassium levels ) , which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers . Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy , since it has been shown to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies . Also , in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies . The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated , but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP . 
 Various analgesics ( painkillers ) may be used in controlling the headaches of intracranial hypertension . In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol , a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief . 
 The use of steroids in the attempt to reduce the ICP is controversial . These may be used in severe papilledema , but otherwise their use is discouraged .

 Venous sinus stenoses leading to venous hypertension appear to play a significant part in relation to raised ICP , and stenting of a transverse sinus may resolve venous hypertension , leading to improved CSF resorption , decreased ICP , cure of papilloedema and other symptoms of IIH . 
 A self @-@ expanding metal stent is permanently deployed within the dominant transverse sinus across the stenosis under general anaesthesia . In general patients are discharged the next day . Patients require double antiplatelet therapy for a period of up to 3 months after the procedure and aspirin therapy for up to 1 year . 
 In a systematic analysis of 19 studies with 207 cases , there was an 87 % improvement in overall symptom rate and 90 % cure rate for treatment of papilloedema . Major complications only occurred in 3 / 207 patients ( 1 @.@ 4 % ) . In the largest single series of transverse sinus stenting there was an 11 % rate of recurrence after one stent , requiring further stenting . 
 Due to the permanence of the stent and small but definite risk of complications , most experts will recommend that patients with IIH must have papilloedema and have failed medical therapy or are intolerant to medication before stenting is undertaken . 
 Consultation with a neurologist , <unk> and / or ophthalmologist in combination with a <unk> who performs the procedure is generally recommended . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 Two main surgical procedures exist in the treatment of IIH : optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration and shunting . Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated . The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH . Neither procedure is perfect : both may cause significant complications , and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms . There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best . 
 Optic nerve sheath fenestration is an <unk> operation that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye . It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure , but it may be the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure . The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest . Moreover , the procedure may lead to significant complications , including blindness in 1 – 2 % . The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision , or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery . 
 Shunt surgery , usually performed by neurosurgeons , involves the creation of a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity . The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal ( LP ) shunt , which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity . Generally , a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect . LP shunting provides long @-@ term relief in about half the cases ; others require revision of the shunt , often on more than one occasion — usually due to shunt obstruction . If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions , a <unk> or <unk> shunt may be considered . These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain , usually by stereotactic surgery , and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity , respectively . Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts , it is possible that this procedure will become the first @-@ line type of shunt treatment . 
 It has been shown that in obese people , bariatric surgery ( and especially gastric bypass surgery ) can lead to resolution of the condition in over 95 % . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 It is not known what percentage of people with IIH will remit spontaneously , and what percentage will develop chronic disease . 
 IIH does not normally affect life expectancy . The major complications from IIH arise from untreated or treatment @-@ resistant papilledema . In various case series , the long @-@ term risk of ones vision being significantly affected by IIH is reported to lie anywhere between 10 and 25 % . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 On average , IIH occurs in about one per 100 @,@ 000 people , and can occur in children and adults . The median age at diagnosis is 30 . IIH occurs predominantly in women , especially in the ages 20 to 45 , who are four to eight times more likely than men to be affected . Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH : women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH , and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight . In men this relationship also exists , but the increase is only five @-@ fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight . 
 Despite several reports of IIH in families , there is no known genetic cause for IIH . People from all ethnicities may develop IIH . In children , there is no difference in incidence between males and females . 
 From national hospital admission databases it appears that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002 . This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity , although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration . 
 = = History = = 
 The first report of IIH was by the German physician Heinrich <unk> , who described it in 1893 under the name serous meningitis . The term " pseudotumor cerebri " was introduced in 1904 by his compatriot Max <unk> . Numerous other cases appeared in the literature subsequently ; in many cases , the raised intracranial pressure may actually have resulted from underlying conditions . For instance , the <unk> hydrocephalus reported by London neurologist Sir Charles Symonds may have resulted from venous sinus thrombosis caused by middle ear infection . Diagnostic criteria for IIH were developed in 1937 by the Baltimore neurosurgeon Walter Dandy ; Dandy also introduced <unk> <unk> surgery in the treatment of the condition . 
 The terms " benign " and " pseudotumor " derive from the fact that increased intracranial pressure may be associated with brain tumors . Those patients in whom no tumour was found were therefore diagnosed with " pseudotumor cerebri " ( a disease mimicking a brain tumor ) . The disease was renamed " benign intracranial hypertension " in 1955 to distinguish it from intracranial hypertension due to life @-@ threatening diseases ( such as cancer ) ; however , this was also felt to be misleading because any disease that can blind someone should not be thought of as benign , and the name was therefore revised in 1989 to " idiopathic ( of no identifiable cause ) intracranial hypertension " . 
 Shunt surgery was introduced in 1949 ; initially , <unk> shunts were used . In 1971 , good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting . Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period ( 1988 – 1993 ) during which optic nerve fenestration ( which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871 ) was more popular . Since then , shunting is recommended predominantly , with occasional exceptions .

 The Groton Monument , sometimes called the Fort Griswold Monument , is a granite monument in Groton , Connecticut . It is dedicated to the defenders who fell during the Battle of Groton Heights on September 6 , 1781 . The monument was originally 127 feet ( 39 m ) high , but it was later changed in 1881 to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Groton Heights ; the cupola was removed and replaced by an iron @-@ capped pyramid in emulation of the Bunker Hill Monument . The monument bears a plaque describing the events of the Battle of Groton Heights and another plaque with the names of the Americans who died in the battle . In 1918 , lightning destroyed the capstone and damaged the adjacent Monument House Museum which features exhibits about the Revolutionary War . Visitors can climb the monument and visit the museum from Memorial Day through Labor Day . The Groton Monument is located in Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park , which includes Fort Griswold , in Groton , Connecticut , United States .

 The Groton Monument association was incorporated in 1820 and had the monument designed by the partnership of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis . The cornerstone was laid on September 6 , 1825 and the monument was completed in 1830 . Originally , the monument was 127 feet ( 39 m ) high , but this was later changed in 1881 to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Groton Heights , the cupola was removed and replaced by an iron @-@ capped pyramid in emulation of the Bunker Hill Monument . As a result of these renovations , the height was extended to 135 feet ( 41 m ) high . 
 A plaque affixed to the monument above the entrance reads : " THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED UNDER THE <unk> OF THE STATE OF <unk> , A.D. 1830 , AND IN THE <unk> YEAR OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE U.S.A.

 The monument was repaired and the grounds renovated with an appropriation of $ 5000 from the State of Connecticut in 1893 and completed by early 1894 . In 1901 , lightning struck the Groton Monument and any damage caused was noted as trivial because The Day says the event was a " dim memory " and its exact date un @-@ discoverable . In 1918 , lightning again struck the monument with great effect . The bolt of lightning shattered the capstone and sent the pieces to the ground before traveling through the brass railings and scattered the cards in one of the wire @-@ racks . The lightning also jumped 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) to the monument house and damaged the veranda , <unk> the brick tilling floor and even sticking some to the ceiling and doing minor damage inside the museum . Frederic Bill , attempted to find a fitting match for the original capstone , but could not . 
 In 1985 , Hurricane Gloria blew out a window of the monument . In 1986 , the State of Connecticut spent $ 6250 to re @-@ mortar the monument . The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work . In 2007 , Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site , but it would be required if the monument were to continue to survive . Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $ 350 @,@ 000 for its preservation .

 The Groton Monument is formally located in Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park , which includes Fort Griswold , in Groton , Connecticut , United States . The State of Connecticut came to control the site in 1902 and as of 2007 , Connecticut 's Department of Environmental Protection was the specific branch in charge . On July 1 , 2011 , the department was reorganized as the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection . In 1981 , the bicentennial of the battle , the monument was originally scheduled to be closed due to budget cuts , but instead would remain open throughout the season . The monument was expected to be visited by thousands of people during the celebration . There is an adjacent museum operated by the Daughters of the American Revolution , which features exhibits about the Revolutionary War and the battle at Fort Griswold .

 Saskatchewan Highway 641 is a highway in the province of Saskatchewan , Canada , beginning at Highway 39 near Rouleau , and traveling north ending at Highway 15 at Semans . The highway intersects the Trans Canada Highway , Saskatchewan Highway 1 south of Pense and east of Belle Plaine , Highway 20 at Lumsden , and Highway 22 at Earl Grey . Local Improvement Districts were the precursors of rural municipalities which initially established and maintained roads in their area . Early settlers helped to construct and maintain the route and would get paid road improvement wages from the local rural municipality . The 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) concurrency between Highway 20 and Highway 641 was constructed in 1927 following the removal of the Canadian National Railway line between Lumsden and Craven . The remainder of the road followed Dominion land survey township and range lines .

 Between 1897 and 1909 , municipal administration affairs were handled by Local Improvement District ( LID ) Number 165 . The LID changed its boundaries on December 13 , 1909 , and on January 1 , 1913 , the LID was renamed Pense No. 160 .

 The Saskatchewan Highway Act was established in 1922 , in compliance with the 1919 Canadian highway act . At the initial stages of the Saskatchewan Highway Act , 10 miles ( 16 km ) of provincial highways were gravel and the rest were earth roads . The road allowances were laid out as a part of the Dominion Land survey system for homesteading . Travel along the Provincial Highway 641 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances , barbed wire fencing and the Canadian Northern rail line . As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel , the first highway was designed on 90 @-@ degree , right @-@ angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads . 
 There is a historical monument erected along the highway which states that the early railway was established along the east side of the Last Mountain Lake ( Long Lake ) in 1907 , and constructed on the west side in 1911 . The monument documents as well the " Lady of the Lake " sternwheeler which was used on Long Lake . Local historians clarify that the rail came to the east of the Lake in 1911 , and to the west in 1912 . The " Lady of the Lake " began as a sternwheeler , but was modified to a screw propeller . Also on the Lake the " S.S. Qu 'Appelle " , a luxurious steamer , towed a barge across the lake . 
 Lumsden was initially served by the Canadian National Railway CNR , however the Canadian Pacific Railway CPR was built through Craven in 1910 . The new line brought freight to Lumsden infrequently and the elevator was torn down in 1927 , and the CNR track removed the next year . The highway went through where the CNR bridge had been built . Highway 20 is marked on an early 1926 and 1955 maps , but highway 641 is unmarked - showing up as surveyed township and range roads only .

 = Paratheria ( mammals ) = 
 Paratheria is an obsolete term for a taxonomic group including the <unk> mammals ( sloths , anteaters , and armadillos ) and various groups thought to be related to them . It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths , anteaters , armadillos , and pangolins , usually classified as placentals , from both marsupial and placental mammals , an arrangement that received little support from other workers . When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s , they were thought to be related to xenarthrans , leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals . However , by the early 1990s , gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans , and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals . 
 = = History = = 
 The term " Paratheria " was coined by British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in 1887 in a review of tooth development in mammals . He found that the " Edentata " were especially distinctive . In this group , he included the sloths , anteaters , and armadillos , which are still placed together as Xenarthra , as well as the pangolins and the aardvark . According to Thomas , edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution . Consequently , he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals , for which terms had been introduced by Thomas Huxley : Eutheria ( placentals ) and <unk> ( marsupials ) . For this new grouping , he suggested the name Paratheria " to indicate their position by the side of , but separate from , the other Mammals " ( the Greek <unk> para means " beside " ) . Thomas had included one other mammal among the edentates , the aardvark ; however , he was unable to provide a satisfactory scenario for the origin of its wholly unique dentition , which he could only compare with that of some fish . Thomas 's arrangement was foreshadowed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville 's 1839 classification ; he placed edentates ( except the sloth Bradypus , which he considered to be a primate ) as a major division , the <unk> ( " poorly toothed " ) . This group was considered to be distinct from the other <unk> ( placentals ) , the Bien <unk> ( " well @-@ toothed " ) . Similarly , Paul Gervais proposed in 1855 that edentates should be placed in a separate subclass of mammals . 
 Thomas 's hypothesis received little support , or even attention , in subsequent years . In 1893 , Henry Fairfield Osborn remarked that new studies of edentate teeth indicated that they were not as distinct as Thomas thought . William Berryman Scott did , however , place Paratheria as a separate subclass in 1904 , although he apparently did not follow Thomas 's theories about the origins of edentate teeth . In 1910 , William King Gregory reviewed the interrelationships of mammals and placed edentates among other placentals , though he gave " Paratheria " as an alternative name for his superorder Edentata , which included Xenarthra and tentatively <unk> ( pangolins ) , <unk> ( aardvarks ) , and the fossil <unk> . In 1976 , Eli Minkoff also used " Paratheria " for a placental superorder that included Edentata ( for the sloths , armadillos , and anteaters ) and <unk> . 
 The Paratheria hypothesis enjoyed a brief renaissance when unusual , high @-@ crowned teeth began turning up in the Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil record of Argentina . In 1984 , Sudamerica ameghinoi , from the Paleocene of Argentina , was assigned to Xenarthra within Paratheria , ranked as a cohort ( a taxonomic rank between infraclass and superorder ) . Two years later , José Bonaparte named Gondwanatherium <unk> from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina , which he thought to be related to Sudamerica , and tentatively assigned it to Paratheria , now ranked as an infraclass . Bonaparte described an additional related animal , Vucetichia gracilis , from the Argentinean Late Cretaceous in 1990 ; by then he classified it in the order Gondwanatheria , which was tentatively assigned to the infraclass Paratheria . Bonaparte argued against George Gaylord Simpson 's 1931 view that xenarthrans derive from the Tertiary <unk> of North America , and instead suggested that xenarthrans , and perhaps pangolins , split from eutherians ( placentals and their extinct relatives ) as early as the Early Cretaceous and derived from some early " <unk> " ( a now @-@ abandoned grouping of early mammals , including dryolestoids among others ) . 
 However , Bonaparte himself had abandoned the proposed relationship between xenarthrans and gondwanatherians by 1993 . Instead , gondwanatherians were shown to be related to another Late Cretaceous Argentinean animal , Ferugliotherium ( which turned out to be <unk> from Vucetichia ) , and through it to multituberculates . The relation between multituberculates and gondwanatheres later became controversial , but they are no longer thought to be related to xenarthrans . By 1996 , " few if any systematists would ... doubt the eutherian affinities of xenarthrans " and molecular data have also supported the placement of Xenarthra within placentals as one of four major clades . The name " Paratheria " is no longer in use .

 Route 183 is a 2 @.@ 12 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 41 km ) long state highway in the northern regions of New Jersey . The southern end of NJ 183 is at an interchange with Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 206 near Netcong , while the northern end is at an interchange with US 206 in Stanhope . The route heads northward through downtown Netcong and along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and enters Sussex County , New Jersey . The route is a former alignment of US 206 bypassed in 1973 . 
 The highway dates back to the designations of State Highway Route 31 , which was main north – south highway in New Jersey . The Netcong Circle , a traffic circle in Netcong between NJ 183 and U.S. Route 46 was present for the entire lifetime of NJ 183 until it was replaced by a signalized intersection in 2013 . A nearby bridge over a New Jersey Transit line was also replaced .

 Route 183 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 206 and Interstate 80 in the community of Roxbury , New Jersey . The route heads northward , intersecting with local dead @-@ end streets deep in the forests of rural Morris County . Route 183 passes a nearby factory and intersects U.S. Route 46 . The route continues northward , crossing over a creek and entering downtown Netcong . Downtown Netcong is highly developed , and Route 183 serves as the main street through the community . The highway intersects with Allen Street ( Morris County Route 631 ) before running along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and into Sussex County . 
 Upon entering Sussex County , Route 183 enters the community of Stanhope . At the intersection with Musconetcong Avenue , the highway turns to the northwest , leaving the shores of the lake . Route 183 continues through the residential developments in Stanhope , working its way into the mountains above the lake . At the intersection with Dell Road , Route 183 becomes intertwined with the interchange on U.S. Route 206 northbound , and the highways merge a short distance later in Stanhope . 
 = = History = = 
 The original designation in the area of Netcong along Route 183 's alignment is State Highway Route 31 , which consisted much of the alignment of current @-@ day U.S. Route 206 . The route was first assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering as a co @-@ designation to US 206 . This alignment remained in place for about two and half decades , when in the 1953 state highway renumbering , the State Highway Route 31 designation was dropped in favor of using U.S. Route 206 . The route in Netcong stayed the same for several years after the decommissioning until the Regional Plan Association proposed a freeway realignment of US 206 in 1962 . The highway was to serve local recreation areas and relieve traffic on Interstate 287 to the east . The route was advocated through 1972 , and after the fiscal year budgets went sour , the proposal was dropped . 
 In 2007 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed the elimination of the Netcong Traffic Circle , located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80 . The project was to produce two outcomes : replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses , and the elimination of the Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection . The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound . The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge , and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection , with pedestrian and bicycle fittings . The entire project cost about $ 13 @.@ 3 million ( 2009 USD ) of state and local funds to construct . The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013 ; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year . The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013 . 
 The circle itself dated back to construction in 1938 . The circle itself could not handle the 17 @,@ 000 vehicles a year that use the large roadway daily , and was the site of several accidents , including 45 in 2007 alone . The entire traffic circle conversion will eliminate two businesses in the area and is still slated for construction .

 = Malaria = 
 Malaria is a mosquito @-@ borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans ( a group of single @-@ celled microorganisms ) belonging to the Plasmodium type . Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever , fatigue , vomiting , and headaches . In severe cases it can cause yellow skin , seizures , coma , or death . Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten . If not properly treated , people may have recurrences of the disease months later . In those who have recently survived an infection , reinfection usually causes milder symptoms . This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria . 
 The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquito . The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito 's saliva into a person 's blood . The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce . Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans . Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum because P. vivax , P. ovale , and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria . The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans . Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films , or with antigen @-@ based rapid diagnostic tests . Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite 's DNA have been developed , but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity . 
 The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents , or with mosquito @-@ control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water . Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common . Occasional doses of the medication sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria . Despite a need , no effective vaccine exists , although efforts to develop one are ongoing . The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin . The second medication may be either mefloquine , lumefantrine , or sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine . Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available . It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common , malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance . Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications ; for example , chloroquine @-@ resistant P. falciparum has spread to most malarial areas , and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia . 
 The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator . This includes much of Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , Asia , and Latin America . In 2015 , there were 214 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 438 @,@ 000 deaths , 90 % of which occurred in Africa . Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37 % , but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases . Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development . In Africa , it is estimated to result in losses of US $ 12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs , lost ability to work , and negative effects on tourism . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin 8 – 25 days following infection ; however , symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention . Initial manifestations of the disease — common to all malaria species — are similar to flu @-@ like symptoms , and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis , gastroenteritis , and viral diseases . The presentation may include headache , fever , shivering , joint pain , vomiting , hemolytic anemia , jaundice , hemoglobin in the urine , retinal damage , and convulsions . 
 The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm — a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating , occurring every two days ( tertian fever ) in P. vivax and P. ovale infections , and every three days ( quartan fever ) for P. malariae . P. falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36 – 48 hours , or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever . 
 Severe malaria is usually caused by P. falciparum ( often referred to as falciparum malaria ) . Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9 – 30 days after infection . Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms , including abnormal posturing , nystagmus , conjugate gaze palsy ( failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction ) , <unk> , seizures , or coma . 
 = = = Complications = = = 
 Malaria has several serious complications . Among these is the development of respiratory distress , which occurs in up to 25 % of adults and 40 % of children with severe P. falciparum malaria . Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis , <unk> pulmonary oedema , concomitant pneumonia , and severe anaemia . Although rare in young children with severe malaria , acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5 – 25 % of adults and up to 29 % of pregnant women . <unk> of HIV with malaria increases mortality . Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever , where hemoglobin from <unk> red blood cells leaks into the urine . 
 Infection with P. falciparum may result in cerebral malaria , a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy . It is associated with retinal whitening , which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever . Enlarged spleen , enlarged liver or both of these , severe headache , low blood sugar , and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur . Complications may include spontaneous bleeding , coagulopathy , and shock . 
 Malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths , infant mortality , abortion and low birth weight , particularly in P. falciparum infection , but also with P. vivax . 
 = = Cause = = 
 Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium ( phylum Apicomplexa ) . In humans , malaria is caused by P. falciparum , P. malariae , P. ovale , P. vivax and P. knowlesi . Among those infected , P. falciparum is the most common species identified ( ~ 75 % ) followed by P. vivax ( ~ 20 % ) . Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths , recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is associated with potentially life @-@ threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection . P. vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa . There have been documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes ; however , except for P. knowlesi — a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques — these are mostly of limited public health importance . 
 Global warming is likely to affect malaria transmission , but the severity and geographic distribution of such effects is uncertain . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 In the life cycle of Plasmodium , a female Anopheles mosquito ( the definitive host ) transmits a motile infective form ( called the <unk> ) to a vertebrate host such as a human ( the secondary host ) , thus acting as a transmission vector . A <unk> travels through the blood vessels to liver cells ( hepatocytes ) , where it reproduces asexually ( tissue schizogony ) , producing thousands of merozoites . These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles ( blood schizogony ) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites , at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew . 
 Other merozoites develop into immature gametocytes , which are the precursors of male and female gametes . When a fertilised mosquito bites an infected person , gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut . The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an <unk> — a fertilized , motile zygote . <unk> develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect 's salivary glands , ready to infect a new vertebrate host . The sporozoites are injected into the skin , in the saliva , when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal . 
 Only female mosquitoes feed on blood ; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar , and do not transmit the disease . The females of the Anopheles genus of mosquito prefer to feed at night . They usually start searching for a meal at dusk , and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal . Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions , although this is rare . 
 = = = Recurrent malaria = = = 
 Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom @-@ free periods . Depending upon the cause , recurrence can be classified as either recrudescence , relapse , or reinfection . <unk> is when symptoms return after a symptom @-@ free period . It is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment . Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells . Relapse commonly occurs between 8 – 24 weeks and is commonly seen with P. vivax and P. ovale infections . P. vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites , with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite . <unk> means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced . <unk> cannot readily be distinguished from recrudescence , although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure . People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Malaria infection develops via two phases : one that involves the liver ( exoerythrocytic phase ) , and one that involves red blood cells , or erythrocytes ( erythrocytic phase ) . When an infected mosquito pierces a person 's skin to take a blood meal , sporozoites in the mosquito 's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes , multiplying asexually and <unk> for a period of 8 – 30 days . 
 After a potential dormant period in the liver , these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites , which , following rupture of their host cells , escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle . The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell . 
 Within the red blood cells , the parasites multiply further , again asexually , periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells . Several such amplification cycles occur . Thus , classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells . 
 Some P. vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic @-@ phase merozoites , but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months ( 7 – 10 months is typical ) to several years . After a period of dormancy , they reactivate and produce merozoites . <unk> are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P. vivax infections , although their existence in P. ovale is uncertain . 
 The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body 's immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance . However , circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen . To avoid this fate , the P. falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells , causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels , thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen . The blockage of the <unk> causes symptoms such as in placental malaria . <unk> red blood cells can breach the blood – brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria . 
 = = = Genetic resistance = = = 
 According to a 2005 review , due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria — especially the P. falciparum species — it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history . Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait , thalassaemia traits , glucose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells . 
 The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade @-@ offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria . Sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood . Normally , red blood cells have a very flexible , <unk> shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries ; however , when the modified hemoglobin S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen , or crowd together due to dehydration , they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape . In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen , and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely . In the early stages of malaria , the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle , and so they are removed from circulation sooner . This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell . Individuals who are homozygous ( with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele ) have sickle @-@ cell anaemia , while those who are heterozygous ( with one abnormal allele and one normal allele ) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia . Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait 's survival , the trait is preserved in malaria @-@ prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form . 
 = = = Liver dysfunction = = = 
 Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease . The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis . While it has been considered a rare occurrence , malarial <unk> has seen an increase , particularly in Southeast Asia and India . Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Owing to the non @-@ specific nature of the presentation of symptoms , diagnosis of malaria in non @-@ endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion , which might be elicited by any of the following : recent travel history , enlarged spleen , fever , low number of platelets in the blood , and higher @-@ than @-@ normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells . 
 Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen @-@ based rapid diagnostic tests ( <unk> ) . In some areas , RDTs need to be able to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non @-@ falciparum infections . Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite — about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010 . Despite its widespread usage , diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks : many settings ( especially rural ) are not equipped to perform the test , and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood . The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75 – 90 % in optimum conditions , to as low as 50 % . Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites , but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer , and are unable to tell how many parasites are present . 
 In regions where laboratory tests are readily available , malaria should be suspected , and tested for , in any unwell person who has been in an area where malaria is endemic . In areas that cannot afford laboratory diagnostic tests , it has become common to use only a history of fever as the indication to treat for malaria — thus the common teaching " fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise " . A drawback of this practice is overdiagnosis of malaria and mismanagement of non @-@ malarial fever , which wastes limited resources , erodes confidence in the health care system , and contributes to drug resistance . Although polymerase chain reaction @-@ based tests have been developed , they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common as of 2012 , due to their complexity . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Malaria is classified into either " severe " or " uncomplicated " by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . It is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present , otherwise it is considered uncomplicated . 
 Decreased consciousness 
 Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk 
 Inability to feed 
 Two or more convulsions 
 Low blood pressure ( less than 70 mmHg in adults and 50 mmHg in children ) 
 Breathing problems 
 Circulatory shock 
 Kidney failure or hemoglobin in the urine 
 Bleeding problems , or hemoglobin less than 50 g / L ( 5 g / dL ) 
 Pulmonary oedema 
 Blood glucose less than 2 @.@ 2 mmol / L ( 40 mg / dL ) 
 Acidosis or lactate levels of greater than 5 mmol / L 
 A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100 @,@ 000 per microlitre ( µL ) in low @-@ intensity transmission areas , or 250 @,@ 000 per µL in high @-@ intensity transmission areas 
 Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe P. falciparum @-@ malaria presenting with neurological symptoms , including coma ( with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11 , or a Blantyre coma scale greater than 3 ) , or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure . 
 Various types of malaria have been called by the names below : 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Methods used to prevent malaria include medications , mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites . There is no vaccine for malaria . The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density , high <unk> mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans . If any of these is lowered sufficiently , the parasite will eventually disappear from that area , as happened in North America , Europe and parts of the Middle East . However , unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world , it could become re @-@ established if conditions revert to a combination that favours the parasite 's reproduction . Furthermore , the cost per person of eliminating <unk> mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density , making it economically unfeasible in some areas . 
 Prevention of malaria may be more cost @-@ effective than treatment of the disease in the long run , but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world 's poorest people . There is a wide difference in the costs of control ( i.e. maintenance of low endemicity ) and elimination programs between countries . For example , in China — whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces — the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health . In contrast , a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one @-@ fifth of the public health budget . 
 In areas where malaria is common , children under five years old often have anemia which is sometimes due to malaria . Giving children with anemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but did not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalization . 
 = = = Mosquito control = = = 
 Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes . For individual protection , the most effective insect repellents are based on <unk> or <unk> . Insecticide @-@ treated mosquito nets ( ITNs ) and indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) have been shown to be highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common . Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin @-@ based combination therapies ( ACTs ) may also reduce transmission . 
 Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria . Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net . Insecticide @-@ treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70 % protection compared with no net . Between 2000 and 2008 , the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250 @,@ 000 infants in Sub @-@ Saharan Africa . About 13 % of households in Sub @-@ Saharan countries owned ITNs in 2007 and 31 % of African households were estimated to own at least one ITN in 2008 . In 2000 , 1 @.@ 7 million ( 1 @.@ 8 % ) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN . That number increased to 20 @.@ 3 million ( 18 @.@ 5 % ) African children using ITNs in 2007 , leaving 89 @.@ 6 million children unprotected and to 68 % African children using mosquito nets in 2015 . Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids , a class of insecticides with low toxicity . They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn . It is recommended to hang a large " bed net " above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground . 
 Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home . After feeding , many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the <unk> , so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides , the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite . As of 2006 , the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations , including DDT and the pyrethroids <unk> and deltamethrin . This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention , which prohibits its agricultural use . One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance . Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors , and due to the irritation caused by spraying , their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors , meaning that they are less affected by the IRS . 
 There are a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria . Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations . Electronic mosquito repellent devices which make very high frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away , do not have supporting evidence . 
 = = = Other methods = = = 
 Community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world . Recognizing the disease in the early stages can stop the disease from becoming fatal . Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant , still water , such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito , thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people . This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas . Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants , and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal . 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 There are a number of drugs that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travelers to places where infection is common . Many of these drugs are also used in treatment . Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine @-@ resistant parasites are not common . In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications , three medications — mefloquine ( <unk> ) , doxycycline ( available generically ) , or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride ( <unk> ) — are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed . <unk> and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated ; mefloquine is associated with death , suicide , and neurological and psychiatric symptoms . 
 The protective effect does not begin immediately , and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving ( except for atovaquone / proguanil , which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward ) . The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists , and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short @-@ term visitors . This is due to the cost of the drugs , side effects from long @-@ term use , and the difficulty in obtaining anti @-@ malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations . During pregnancy , medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother . The use of preventative drugs where malaria @-@ bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications ; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease . While medications against fever are commonly used , their effects on outcomes are not clear . 
 Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications . The most effective treatment for P. falciparum infection is the use of artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials ( known as artemisinin @-@ combination therapy , or ACT ) , which decreases resistance to any single drug component . These additional antimalarials include : <unk> , lumefantrine , mefloquine or sulfadoxine / pyrimethamine . Another recommended combination is <unk> and <unk> . ACT is about 90 % effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria . To treat malaria during pregnancy , the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy ( 1st trimester ) , and ACT in later stages ( 2nd and 3rd trimesters ) . In the 2000s ( decade ) , malaria with partial resistance to <unk> emerged in Southeast Asia . Infection with P. vivax , P. ovale or P. malariae usually do not require hospitalization . Treatment of P. vivax requires both treatment of blood stages ( with chloroquine or ACT ) and clearance of liver forms with <unk> . Treatment with <unk> prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria . 
 Severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P. falciparum . The other species usually cause only febrile disease . Severe and complicated malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high ( 10 % to 50 % ) . Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms . Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs . For severe malaria , parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults . In another systematic review , artemisinin derivatives ( artemether and <unk> ) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children . Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit . This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it . It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort , low blood sugar , and low blood potassium . 
 = = = Resistance = = = 
 Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st @-@ century malaria treatment . Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins . Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs . The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world . Malaria strains found on the Cambodia – Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins , and may therefore be untreatable . Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin <unk> in <unk> doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype . Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia , Myanmar , Thailand , and Vietnam , and there has been emerging resistance in Laos . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 When properly treated , people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery . However , severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days . In the most severe cases of the disease , fatality rates can reach 20 % , even with intensive care and treatment . Over the longer term , developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria . Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune @-@ deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein – Barr virus . 
 During childhood , malaria causes anemia during a period of rapid brain development , and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria . Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits , behavioural disorders , and epilepsy . Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The WHO estimates that in 2010 there were 219 million cases of malaria resulting in 660 @,@ 000 deaths . Others have estimated the number of cases at between 350 and 550 million for falciparum malaria and deaths in 2010 at 1 @.@ 24 million up from 1 @.@ 0 million deaths in 1990 . The majority of cases ( 65 % ) occur in children under 15 years old . About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year ; in Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , maternal malaria is associated with up to 200 @,@ 000 estimated infant deaths yearly . There are about 10 @,@ 000 malaria cases per year in Western Europe , and 1300 – 1500 in the United States . About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003 . Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years . According to the WHO and UNICEF , deaths attributable to malaria in 2015 were reduced by 60 % from a 2000 estimate of 985 @,@ 000 , largely due to the widespread use of insecticide @-@ treated nets and artemisinin @-@ based combination therapies . In 2012 , there were 207 million cases of malaria . That year , the disease is estimated to have killed between 473 @,@ 000 and 789 @,@ 000 people , many of whom were children in Africa . Efforts at decreasing the disease in Africa since the turn of millennium have been partially effective , with rates of the disease dropping by an estimated forty percent on the continent . 
 Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator , in areas of the Americas , many parts of Asia , and much of Africa ; in Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , 85 – 90 % of malaria fatalities occur . An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100 @,@ 000 of population were Ivory Coast ( 86 @.@ 15 ) , Angola ( 56 @.@ 93 ) and Burkina Faso ( 50 @.@ 66 ) . A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso , Mozambique and Mali . The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global endemic levels of malaria , providing a means with which to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden . This effort led to the publication of a map of P. falciparum endemicity in 2010 . As of 2010 , about 100 countries have endemic malaria . Every year , 125 million international travellers visit these countries , and more than 30 @,@ 000 contract the disease . 
 The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex , and malaria @-@ afflicted and malaria @-@ free areas are often found close to each other . Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall , consistent high temperatures and high humidity , along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature , providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding . In drier areas , outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall . Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities . For example , several cities in the Greater Mekong <unk> of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria @-@ free , but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions , including along international borders and forest fringes . In contrast , malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas , though the risk is lower in the larger cities . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the parasite responsible for P. falciparum malaria has been in existence for 50 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 years , the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10 @,@ 000 years ago , concurrently with advances in agriculture and the development of human settlements . Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees . Some evidence suggests that the P. falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas . 
 References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout recorded history . Hippocrates described periodic fevers , labelling them tertian , quartan , <unk> and quotidian . The Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps . Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire , and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the " Roman fever " . Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at @-@ risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors . This included areas such as southern Italy , the island of Sardinia , the Pontine Marshes , the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber River . The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds . <unk> gardens , swamp @-@ like grounds , runoff from agriculture , and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water . 
 The term malaria originates from Medieval Italian : mala aria — " bad air " ; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland . The term first appeared in the English literature about 1829 . Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America , where it is no longer endemic , though imported cases do occur . 
 Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880 , when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran — a French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria — observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time . He therefore proposed that malaria is caused by this organism , the first time a protist was identified as causing disease . For this and later discoveries , he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine . A year later , Carlos Finlay , a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana , provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans . This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott , and work by Sir Patrick Manson , the " father of tropical medicine " , on the transmission of filariasis . 
 In April 1894 , a Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street , London . This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1898 when Ross , who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta , proved the complete life @-@ cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes . He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds . He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds . For this work , Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine . After resigning from the Indian Medical Service , Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria @-@ control efforts in Egypt , Panama , Greece and Mauritius . The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900 . Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal . This public @-@ health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public @-@ health campaigns against the disease . 
 The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree , which contains quinine . This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes , mainly in Peru . The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control fever . Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the Jesuits introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640 ; by 1677 , it was included in the London Pharmacopoeia as an antimalarial treatment . It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient , quinine , was extracted from the bark , isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph <unk> <unk> . 
 Quinine became the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s , when other medications began to be developed . In the 1940s , chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance <unk> , first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s . 
 The medicinal value of Artemisia annua has been used by Chinese herbalists in traditional Chinese medicines for 2 @,@ 000 years . In 1596 , Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his " Compendium of Materia Medica " . Artemisinins , discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant Artemisia annua , became the recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria , administered in combination with other antimalarials as well as in severe disease . Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source , The Handbook of <unk> for Emergency Treatments , written in 340 by Ge Hong For her work on malaria , Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
 Plasmodium vivax was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapy — deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis . In 1927 , the inventor of this technique , Julius Wagner @-@ Jauregg , received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries . The technique was dangerous , killing about 15 % of patients , so it is no longer in use . 
 The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT . Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria , its use quickly spread to agriculture . In time , pest control , rather than disease control , came to dominate DDT use , and this large @-@ scale agricultural use led to the evolution of resistant mosquitoes in many regions . The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria . During the 1960s , awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased , ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s . Before DDT , malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larva stages , for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water . 
 Malaria vaccines have been an elusive goal of research . The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunizing mice with live , radiation @-@ attenuated sporozoites , which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal , viable sporozoites . Since the 1970s , there has been a considerable effort to develop similar vaccination strategies for humans .

 = = = Economic impact = = = 
 Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty : some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development . Although tropical regions are most affected , malaria 's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes . The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread . During the late 19th and early 20th centuries , it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states . 
 A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995 , adjusted for parity of purchasing power , between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference ( $ 1 @,@ 526 USD versus $ 8 @,@ 268 USD ) . In the period 1965 to 1990 , countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0 @.@ 4 % per year , compared to 2 @.@ 4 % per year in other countries . 
 Poverty can increase the risk of malaria , since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease . In its entirety , the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US $ 12 billion every year . The economic impact includes costs of health care , working days lost due to sickness , days lost in education , decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria , and loss of investment and tourism . The disease has a heavy burden in some countries , where it may be responsible for 30 – 50 % of hospital admissions , up to 50 % of outpatient visits , and up to 40 % of public health spending . 
 Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children . Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery . Consequently , severe and cerebral malaria have far @-@ reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease . 
 = = = Counterfeit and substandard drugs = = = 
 Sophisticated counterfeits have been found in several Asian countries such as Cambodia , China , Indonesia , Laos , Thailand , and Vietnam , and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries . The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40 % of artesunate @-@ based malaria medications are counterfeit , especially in the Greater Mekong region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in participating countries . There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory . Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution . 
 Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients , contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities , poor quality ingredients , poor stability and inadequate packaging . A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one @-@ third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub @-@ Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis , packaging analysis , or were falsified .

 Throughout history , the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers , nation @-@ states , military personnel , and military actions . In 1910 , Nobel Prize in Medicine @-@ winner Ronald Ross ( himself a malaria survivor ) , published a book titled The Prevention of Malaria that included a chapter titled " The Prevention of Malaria in War . " The chapter 's author , Colonel C. H. Melville , Professor of Hygiene at Royal Army Medical College in London , addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars : " The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself , certainly the history of war in the Christian era . ... It is probably the case that many of the so @-@ called camp fevers , and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery , of the wars of the sixteenth , seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin . " 
 Malaria was the most important health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II , where about 500 @,@ 000 men were infected . According to Joseph Patrick Byrne , " Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns . " 
 Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new anti @-@ malarial agents . During World War I and World War II , inconsistent supplies of the natural anti @-@ malaria drugs cinchona bark and quinine prompted substantial funding into research and development of other drugs and vaccines . American military organizations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center , Walter Reed Army Institute of Research , and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases of the US Armed Forces . 
 Additionally , initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas ( <unk> ) , established in 1942 , and its successor , the <unk> Disease Center ( now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , or CDC ) established in 1946 . According to the CDC , <unk> " was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories , where malaria was still problematic " . 
 = = = Eradication efforts = = = 
 Several notable attempts are being made to eliminate the parasite from sections of the world , or to eradicate it worldwide . In 2006 , the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015 , and the organization plans to dissolve if that goal is accomplished . Several malaria vaccines are in clinical trials , which are intended to provide protection for children in endemic areas and reduce the speed of transmission of the disease . As of 2012 , The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticide @-@ treated nets intended to stop mosquito @-@ borne transmission of malaria . The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market . Other efforts , such as the Malaria Atlas Project , focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict the spread of malaria based on the availability of habitat of malaria @-@ carrying parasites . The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee ( <unk> ) of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) was formed in 2012 , " to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination " . In November 2013 , WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with the long @-@ term goal of malaria eradication . 
 Malaria has been successfully eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas . Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe , but vector control programs , in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans , eliminated it from those regions . Several factors contributed , such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices , and advances in sanitation , including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings . Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods , and the use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s . ( see National Malaria Eradication Program ) In Suriname , the disease has been cleared from its capital city and coastal areas through a three @-@ pronged approach initiated by the Global Malaria Eradication program in 1955 , involving : vector control through the use of DDT and IRS ; regular collection of blood smears from the population to identify existing malaria cases ; and providing chemotherapy to all affected individuals . Bhutan is pursuing an aggressive malaria elimination strategy , and has achieved a 98 @.@ 7 % decline in microscopy @-@ confirmed cases from 1994 to 2010 . In addition to vector control techniques such as IRS in high @-@ risk areas and thorough distribution of long @-@ lasting ITNs , factors such as economic development and increasing access to health services have contributed to Bhutan 's successes in reducing malaria incidence . The UK 's Department for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will spend $ <unk> over five years from 2016 in an effort to end deaths caused by the disease .

 The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda ( <unk> ) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development ( R & D ) needed to be addressed for the worldwide eradication of malaria . 
 = = = Vaccine = = = 
 Immunity ( or , more accurately , tolerance ) to P. falciparum malaria does occur naturally , but only in response to years of repeated infection . An individual can be protected from a P. falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non @-@ infective by a dose of X @-@ ray irradiation . An effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria , although several are under development . The highly polymorphic nature of many P. falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design . Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes , zygotes , or <unk> in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria . These transmission @-@ blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood ; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual , these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito . Other vaccine candidates , targeting the blood @-@ stage of the parasite 's life cycle , have been inadequate on their own . For example , <unk> was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s , but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective . Several potential vaccines targeting the pre @-@ erythrocytic stage of the parasite 's life cycle are being developed , with RTS , S as a leading candidate ; it is expected to be licensed in 2015 . A US biotech company , <unk> , is developing a pre @-@ erythrocytic attenuated vaccine called <unk> that uses whole sporozoites to induce an immune response . In 2006 , the Malaria Vaccine Advisory Committee to the WHO outlined a " Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap " that has as one of its landmark objectives to " develop and license a first @-@ generation malaria vaccine that has a protective efficacy of more than 50 % against severe disease and death and lasts longer than one year " by 2015 .

 Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts , organelles usually found in plants , complete with their own genomes . These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism , such as fatty acid biosynthesis . Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti @-@ malarial drugs . 
 With the onset of drug @-@ resistant Plasmodium parasites , new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease . One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal @-@ amino acid adducts , which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins . Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal @-@ based complexes are attracting research interest . 
 ( + ) <unk> : Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called <unk> . It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells . This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model . As of 2014 , a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .

 A non @-@ chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes . Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito , or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite . Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released . Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation ; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population . 
 Genomics is central to malaria research . With the sequencing of P. falciparum , one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae , and the human genome , the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied . Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria , potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission . 
 In one study , a genetically @-@ modified strain of Anopheles <unk> was created that no longer supported malaria transmission , and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring . 
 Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations , for instance to combat insects so they cannot transmit diseases ( in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria and <unk> ) .

 Nearly 200 parasitic Plasmodium species have been identified that infect birds , reptiles , and other mammals , and about 30 species naturally infect non @-@ human primates . Some malaria parasites that affect non @-@ human primates ( NHP ) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites , such as P. <unk> ( a model for P. falciparum ) and P. cynomolgi ( P. vivax ) . Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans . Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research , such as P. berghei . Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order <unk> , and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii , the Galapagos , and other archipelagoes . The parasite P. <unk> is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds . Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria , as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction . 
 = Old Blockhouse = 
 The Old Blockhouse , also known as the Dover Fort , is a 16th @-@ century fortification on the island of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly . It was built between 1548 and 1551 by the government of Edward VI to protect the islands against French attack . 
 Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the anchorage of St Helen 's Pool , the blockhouse would have housed a battery of two or three artillery pieces , positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop . An earthwork bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively . A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed on the side of the gun platform . 
 During the interregnum following the English Civil War , the Old Blockhouse was occupied by the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651 . Blake 's naval guns out @-@ ranged those of the fort , and , after fierce fighting , the blockhouse was taken . A battery of guns was maintained at the blockhouse until at least the 1750s , but by the end of the 18th century the fortification was disused and in ruins . 
 After 1922 the blockhouse was placed into the guardianship of the state by the lessee of the island , Arthur Dorrien @-@ Smith , and in the 21st century it is controlled by English Heritage and open to tourists . It is protected as a scheduled monument under UK law .

 The Old Blockhouse was built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the Scilly Isles against French attack . Tensions with France had grown during the reign of Henry VIII and spilled over into war in 1538 . Henry initially responded by fortifying the coasts of England , constructing new artillery forts designed to defend against the longer @-@ range cannons that were becoming common in the 16th century . Henry 's son , the nine @-@ year @-@ old Edward VI , inherited the throne in 1547 , facing renewed war with France . Edward Seymour was made the Lord Protector to the King , and he appointed his brother , Thomas , as England 's Lord Admiral . Thomas inspected the Scilly Isles personally and concluded that they were vulnerable to a French invasion . 
 As a result of the inspection , Sir Francis Flemming , the Lieutenant @-@ General of the Ordnance , was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands , supported by a shipment of lead to help with construction , and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England . The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew , the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth . Tresco was in need of modern defences , but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island . 
 The Old Blockhouse was built as part of this programme of work . The blockhouse was positioned on high ground to protect the Old Grimsby harbour , overlooking both the harbour and the nearby anchorage of St Helen 's Pool . When complete , it would have held a battery of two to three guns , which could have fired on targets attempting to enter the harbour , or engaged ships approaching the Scilly Isles from the north @-@ east . 
 Edward Seymour fell from power in 1549 , and after his removal a new survey was carried out by Captain William Tyrell , in part to confirm that the new fortifications were suitably located across the islands . Building work across the Scilly Isles continued , expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary 's , and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550 , since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own . Orders were given in 1551 to send bows , arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands , where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552 . 
 The Old Blockhouse appears to have been completed , but the Crown 's resources had become badly stretched and the decision was taken at the end of 1552 to curtail further expenditure on the Scilly Isles . Between 1548 and 1552 , a total of £ 3 @,@ 123 had been spent on improving the fortifications on the islands ; a 1579 survey suggested that , with the cost of the garrisons , the project had come to a total of £ 6 @,@ 000 . Edward 's successor , Queen Mary I , intended to establish a garrison of 150 soldiers on the islands , but it is uncertain if these numbers were ever achieved . 
 = = = 17th century = = = 
 The Old Blockhouse saw military action in 1651 during the interregnum after the end of the English Civil War , making it one of the very few of England 's coastal defences to have ever seen actual fighting . The Scilly Isles were supporters of Charles I during the civil war , and after a short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648 . Tresco formed a base for Royalists privateers and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch , then hostile to England , might counter the piracy by occupying the islands , gaining a foothold they could then use against England . In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake in charge of a naval task force to retake the islands . 
 Blake arrived at St Helen 's Pool in April 1651 and set about taking the island of Tresco , attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse . Blake deployed a force of men in small boats , but they landed on the wrong island and had to be recalled to the ships . The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse ; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back . Blake 's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance , and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties . Around 15 of the assault force were killed , but the guns of Blake 's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell . Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary 's . 
 The blockhouse remained an important fortification after the invasion . Parliament invested £ 1 @,@ 050 in the islands ' defences and carried out a survey in 1652 , calling the blockhouse the " Dover Fort . In 1660 , Charles II was restored to the throne and Edward Sherburne was sent to the Scilly Isles to inspect the defences ; he recommended that repairs be carried out to the Old Blockhouse . 
 = = = 18th @-@ 21st centuries = = = 
 The Crown , in the form of the Duchy of Cornwall , leased the islands in 1687 to the Godolphin family , followed by August Smith in 1831 . The blockhouse was inspected by Christian Lilly in 1715 , on the orders of the Duke of Marlborough ; he reported that it was " very much decayed " , with only the walls standing , but recommended that it be repaired at a cost of £ 28 . The antiquary William Borlase noted during his 1752 visit that there was a battery of guns at the Old Blockhouse , guarding the harbour , but by the time that the writer John Troutbeck saw the site at the end of the century , the guns had been removed . The blockhouse walls remained in good condition , however , and Troutbeck considered that it would still have military utility if brought back into service . 
 In 1922 , the lease passed to Arthur Dorrien @-@ Smith , who agreed to pass several properties on Tresco , including the blockhouse , into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works . In the 21st century , the blockhouse is controlled by English Heritage , the successor to the ministry , and open to tourists . It is protected as a scheduled monument under UK law . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Old Blockhouse comprises a paved , square gun platform , approximately 7 metres ( 23 ft ) by 6 @.@ 5 metres ( 21 ft ) , with 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) thick , low granite walls , which were probably somewhat taller when they were first built . It is built on top of a rocky outcrop , which forms part of the lower courses of the walls , and is reached by a flight of stairs . The platform originally had embrasures on the north @-@ west and north @-@ east corners , with the walls probably forming a parapet , although it is possible there may also have been a roof to the platform . 
 In the south @-@ west corner of the platform is a lean @-@ to , which may have been either a powder locker or a shelter for the blockhouse watch ; a compartment in the south wall might have also been used to store ammunition . A small room , 2 @.@ 8 metres ( 9 ft 2 in ) by 3 @.@ 6 metres ( 12 ft ) , was added on to the west , after the construction of the main building , possibly during the English Civil War . This was equipped with windows and a fireplace , and would have formed living quarters for the troops . 
 An earthwork bank defends the landward side of the blockhouse , described variously as between around 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 ft 8 in ) and 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) high , similar to those found around forts of this period along the Thames River in England . There are also the remains of a defensive stone wall on the seaward side of the blockhouse , although much of the wall has been destroyed by coastal erosion . 
 The design of the blockhouse is conservative for the period , and echoes that of the forts built during the reign of Henry VIII . This is in contrast to the nearby fortification of Harry 's Walls , built at the same time as the blockhouse , but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions . 
 = Puerto Rican amazon = 
 The Puerto Rican amazon ( Amazona vittata ) , also known as the Puerto Rican parrot or <unk> , is the only bird endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona . Measuring 28 – 30 cm ( 11 @.@ 0 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes . Two subspecies have been described , although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island , extinct since 1912 . Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon ( Amazona leucocephala ) and the Hispaniolan amazon ( Amazona ventralis ) . 
 The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at between three and four years of age . It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester . Once the female lays eggs she will remain in the nest and continuously incubate them until hatching . The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching . This parrot 's diet is varied and consists of flowers , fruits , leaves , bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy . 
 The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union since 1994 . Once widespread and abundant , the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat ; the species completely vanished from Vieques and Mona Island , nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico . Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction . In 2012 , the total estimated population was 58 – 80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The Puerto Rican amazon was described by Dutch ornithologist Pieter Boddaert in 1783 . It belongs to the large Neotropical genus Amazona , commonly known as amazons ; these birds have also been given the generic epithet of " parrot " by the American Ornithologists ' Union , hence " Puerto Rican parrot " is an alternative common name in North America . The indigenous Taíno people called it the <unk> , an onomatopoeic name that resembled the parrots ' flight call . 
 There are two recognized subspecies : 
 A. v. vittata is the nominate and only extant subspecies , inhabiting Puerto Rico and formerly nearby Vieques Island and Mona Island . 
 A. v. gracilipes inhabited Culebra Island and is now extinct . It is unclear whether it was substantially different from the nominate subspecies . 
 = = = Evolutionary history = = = 
 There is no evidence that the West Indies were connected to a continent in the past , and thus the various native bird species are assumed to be descended from those that immigrated to the Caribbean at some point . Some small species would have encountered problems traversing large bodies of water , but parrots have flight strength and various behavioral characteristics that would facilitate " over @-@ water " dispersion . Most Caribbean bird species originate from Central , North and South America . The Amazona species found in the Caribbean are divided in two groups : five mid @-@ sized species found in the Greater Antilles and seven large species in the Lesser Antilles . All the Greater Antillean amazons display characteristics leading to suppositions of relatedness , including predominantly green @-@ toned color patterns and white rings around the eyes . <unk> and Amato conclude that all Greater Antillean Amazona descend from Amazona albifrons with Amazona vittata , Amazona leucocephala , and Amazona ventralis constituting a complex , a cluster of species so closely related that they intergrade . 
 British ornithologist David Lack considered that the Puerto Rican amazon had evolved from the Hispaniolan amazon ( A. ventralis ) found in Hispaniola , but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis , including the similarities found between the black @-@ billed amazon ( A. agilis ) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon . Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships , and that patterns changed with relative ease even within members of the same species . The research concluded that the Puerto Rican amazon may share a common ancestor with the Jamaican A. agilis . Recent phylogenetic studies show that the Puerto Rican amazon is more closely related to the Hispaniolan amazon and the Cuban amazon than to the black @-@ billed amazon . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Puerto Rican amazon measures 28 – 30 cm ( 11 @.@ 0 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) and weighs 250 – 300 g ( 8 @.@ 8 – 10 @.@ 6 oz ) , or 275 g ( 9 @.@ 7 oz ) on average . Although small compared to amazons in general , it is similar in size to other Greater Antilles Amazona species . Sexual dimorphism is not present . Both males and females have predominantly green plumage , though their feathers have blue edges . The primary flight feathers of the wings and the main covert feathers are dark blue . The color of the feathers on the underside varies depending on the body part : the feathers on the underside of the wings , which can be seen during flight , are bright blue ; those in the tail have yellow @-@ green tone . Their underparts are paler and yellow @-@ tinged , their foreheads are red , and they have white ovals around the eyes . The iris is brown , the bill a horn color , and the legs yellow @-@ tan . Aside from DNA tests , males and females can only be distinguished by behavioral differences during the breeding season . Immature birds have plumage similar to adults . 
 = = Population and distribution = = 
 The precise distribution of the Puerto Rican amazon before the arrival of Spanish colonialists is uncertain , because of a lack of contemporary records and then the extermination of the indigenous Taíno people , but the species was apparently widespread and abundant . There is also evidence the species may have inhabited other nearby islands , such as Antigua , Barbuda and the Virgin Islands . Estimates of the parrot 's early numbers vary greatly . Some authorities claim that there were once more than a million individuals , while others suggest a more modest population of 100 @,@ 000 . During the first 150 years of Spanish rule the human population was small , and in 1650 , when the population of the island was 880 people , the species was still abundant throughout the archipelago . After 1650 , human habitation increased exponentially , and by the 18th century the Puerto Rican amazon population started to be affected . Heinrich Moritz <unk> , a German naturalist , declared that by 1836 the parrot population had noticeably declined . Even so , as late as 1864 , British ornithologist Edward Cavendish Taylor noted that the parrots were still common near the island 's capital , San Juan . 
 At first , human activity had not posed a significant threat to the Puerto Rican amazon . The Taíno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population . In the past two hundred years , however , many factors have led to a drastic decrease in the birds ' numbers : agricultural development , the construction of roads , hydroelectric development , and the adoption of young chicks as pets . Especially during the latter half of the 19th century , most of Puerto Rico 's virgin forests , a historical habitat of the species , were cleared for agricultural development , primarily for the production of sugar , cotton , corn and rice . The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest ; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if possible . As agriculture expanded , the amazon 's habitat disappeared further and its population declined . 
 The species was historically found in mature or old @-@ growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations , and in holes , cliffs , and other diverse habitats at lower elevations . The species could be found at medium elevations in the <unk> State Forest ( until 1910 ) and the Rio Abajo State Forest ( until the 1920s ) , and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest ( until the 1930s ) . Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island 's coast to find food . At the same time , the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico 's smaller islands — Culebra , Vieques and Mona — and became restricted to five locations : two in karst @-@ limestone areas , two in high montane rainforests and one in mangrove forest at the foot of the El Yunque National Forest . One of these karst regions , located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico , was identified as a haven for the species . In particular , a region named Valle de las <unk> ( Valley of the Parrots ) , located between San Sebastián and <unk> , was home to a sizable population . Some amazons survived in small pockets of degraded forest but these proved insufficient to support large colonies . Eventually their natural habitat was reduced to the Cordillera Central and undisturbed forest areas , and by 1940 they were only to be found in primary forest at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest . The species is currently found at elevations between 396 and 823 m ( 1 @,@ 299 and 2 @,@ 700 ft ) . Since the species requires mature forests with open @-@ cavity trees for reproduction , it does not occur in dwarf and secondary forests . 
 By the 1950s , there were only 200 parrots in the wild , and in 1975 the population reached an absolute low of 13 individuals . Numbers then recovered , and in August 1989 there were an estimated minimum of 47 individuals . But on September 18 , 1989 , Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds . In the aftermath of the hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals . In 2004 , the wild population was 30 – 35 individuals , and the long @-@ term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations . The current range of the species is 16 km2 ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) , 0 @.@ 2 % of what it once was . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The Puerto Rican amazon is diurnal , typically beginning its day half an hour after sunrise . It is generally secretive when inside its nest , using its green plumage as camouflage . In contrast , it may be vocal and noisy when outside the nest . Upon taking flight , its color pattern provides some contrast to the forest . The flight mechanism of this species is similar to the one found in other amazons , and involves strokes below the body axis , unlike most birds whose wings flow above their bodies in flight . Amazons can fly moderately fast , reaching a top speed of approximately 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) , and are fairly agile when evading predators in mid @-@ air . When in search of food , the parrots group in pairs . Couples and their fledged young display a tendency to stay together . The amazon makes two flight calls , a take @-@ off squawk which consist of a pattern of long squawks , and a loud " bugle " , commonly used in flight and which may have several meanings depending on the circumstances when it is used . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Like almost all amazons , the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore . Its diet consists of flowers , fruits , leaves , bark and nectar obtained from the forest 's canopy . The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials , although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range . Among the items it consumes are the pericarp of the seeds of sierra palm ( <unk> montana ) , tabonuco ( <unk> excelsa ) , and negra <unk> ( <unk> domingensis ) ; the fruits of bejuco de rana ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , and palo de <unk> ( <unk> portoricensis ) ; the flowers of bejuco de rana , <unk> ( <unk> latifolia ) , and <unk> <unk> ; the leaves and twigs of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , laurel sabino ( Magnolia splendens ) , <unk> verde ( <unk> <unk> ) , and <unk> <unk> ; the bark of bejuco de rana , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ( Psychotria <unk> ) ; and the buds of <unk> ( Inga vera ) . It normally selects the fruits positioned directly in front of its eyes , picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions . When feeding , it uses a foot to pick up the food . The amazon feeds in a slow , paused manner taking 8 – 60 seconds to consume separate items . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Puerto Rican amazon usually mates for life , with pairs only changing mates if one bird perishes or abandons the nest . A male may abandon the female if the latter is injured , re @-@ mating with a more " physically perfect " subject . The pairing process is unknown ; however , new pairs tend to participate in mutual mating dances characterised by coordinated bows , partial extension of the wings and full tail expansion . 
 The Puerto Rican amazon is a secondary cavity nester , nesting in tree trunk cavities , both naturally occurring and excavated by other species . It prefers to nest in Palo <unk> trees ( <unk> <unk> ) , but uses other trees , including the laurel sabino ( Magnolia splendens ) and tabonuco ( <unk> excelsa ) , to a lesser extent . These trees are mature cavity @-@ forming trees which provide protection against predators and the entry of water . Recently , the species has also nested in artificial wooden boxes designed as part of the recovery plan for the species . Nest height varies from 7 – 15 m ( 23 – 49 ft ) above ground . The male usually leads the search for nest sites , although the final decision seems to be taken by the female . Once a site is selected , the pair will spend some time inspecting and cleaning it . No lining material is added to the nest . 
 The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at 4 years of age in the wild and at 3 years in captivity . The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July ( the dry season ) . Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers , with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse . Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas , with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female 's back . As the time for egg @-@ laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest , with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation . The female lays 2 – 4 eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days , while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food . Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame . The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest , usually 60 to 65 days after they hatch . Nonetheless , they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season . 
 Like other amazons , the Puerto Rican amazon is gregarious while performing daily activities , but territorial around its nest . The size of the territory around the nest is usually around 50 meters ( 164 feet ) . Pairs are extremely cautious near their nest , usually moving in a slow manner when leaving the nest to avoid the attention of predators . Although territorial defense is mostly composed of loud vocalizations there are instances of actual physical combat . Pairs will defend their nest sites against invading couples , sometimes focusing on the location 's defense instead of egg @-@ laying . Pairs nesting in areas uninhabited by other parrots will remain mostly silent unless other parrots enter the zone . Some pairs may display moderate territoriality even when not apparently intending to nest , with these tendencies beginning in the latter half of the breeding season . One hypothesis is that this would occur in young pairs that had still not reached full maturity , serving as " practice territoriality " . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 On March 11 , 1967 , the Puerto Rican amazon entered the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species . At the time of inclusion the population was estimated at 70 individuals . In 1968 , recovery efforts began to increase the population in the wild . In 1972 , when the estimated population was 16 individuals , the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) at the Luquillo Aviary began efforts to breed parrots in captivity and yielded good results . In June 2006 , it was reported by the USFWS that its birds in captivity had successfully hatched 39 chicks ( the yearly average is around 16 ) . In 2006 , 22 birds were released in the Rio Abajo State Forest to initiate a second wild population , and a further 19 were released at the same site on 27 December 2008 . 
 The World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) lists the Puerto Rican amazon as a critically endangered species since 1994 . The species is regulated under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , rendering illegal international trade in specimens or parts . 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 Human activity is arguably the main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon . Early settlers of Puerto Rico , such as the Taíno , hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance . Later , habitat destruction , capture of immature individuals for the pet industry , hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline . The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the main reason for the decline of population . 
 Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon include the red @-@ tailed hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis ) , the broad @-@ winged hawk ( Buteo platypterus ) , the peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) and the pearly @-@ eyed thrasher ( <unk> fuscatus ) . The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid @-@ 20th century and has been a problem for the parrot population since 1973 ; to combat this , specially designed deep nests were prepared for the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders . Introduced honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) , the related Hispaniolan amazon ( Amazona ventralis ) , black rats ( Rattus rattus ) and Indian mongooses ( Herpestes javanicus ) may compete for nesting cavities , and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks . 
 Natural disasters , such as hurricanes , were not a threat to the Puerto Rican parrot population when it was more readily self @-@ maintaining , but as a result of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well . Hurricane Hugo passed through the species ' range in September 1989 , and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals . 
 = = = Recovery plan = = = 
 In response to the Puerto Rican amazon 's low population and endangered status , a recovery plan was drafted and implemented in 1968 . Its main objective was to <unk> the species to threatened status by the year 2020 . Other objectives included establishing two separate viable wild populations ( each of which would consist of 500 or more individuals for a period of at least five years ) , protecting habitat for those populations , and controlling predators , parasites and competitors . A third site was planned in 2011 by the Caribbean Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex . As part of the conservation efforts , a captive population was established in the Luquillo Aviary in 1973 . Another was established in 1993 when some individuals were transferred from the Luquillo Aviary to the Rio Abajo State Forest under the administration of the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources ( Departamento de <unk> Naturales y <unk> ) . In 2007 , expanded facilities at the <unk> Aviary at the El Yunque National Forest were inaugurated and dedicated to the late Priscilla Stubbe , who was a major fundraiser for the new facility . 
 Human activity once again threatened the amazon during the following years . In 2012 , it was reported that the <unk> flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species . Via Verde , a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis Fortuño administration , raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed . New conservation efforts have also begun during this timeframe . In 2011 , a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez sequenced the amazon 's genome . On August 15 , 2013 , the discovery of non @-@ assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced . Experts considered this a sign of expansion , <unk> that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region . This was noted as a significant advance , since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity , which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals . This was accompanied by a second announcement , which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild ( fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens ) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico . 
 The creation of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013 , with the municipalities of Maricao and Isabela being analyzed . In November 2013 , plans for the establishment of a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced . The following month , ten amazons were released at Río Abajo . 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program , which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011 . The wild population grew by 15 chicks , an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year . During this time frame , the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals . A severe drought caused by the emergence of El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer , benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season . However , this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest , representing a risk for the population . On August 13 , 2015 , a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao . Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year , before they are released to create a new population in the region .

 Stanley George " Frenchy " Bordagaray ( January 3 , 1910 – April 13 , 2000 ) was an American professional baseball player . He played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) as an outfielder and third baseman for the Chicago White Sox , Brooklyn Dodgers , St. Louis Cardinals , Cincinnati Reds , and New York Yankees between 1934 and 1945 . He had a .283 batting average for his career . 
 Bordagaray gained publicity through the press through his colorful personality and various gimmicks . He appeared in bit parts in movies and grew a mustache in a time when baseball players were expected to be clean shaven . He has been inducted into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame , and the Fresno and Ventura County Sports Halls of Fame . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bordagaray was born in Coalinga , California on January 3 , 1910 to Dominique and Louise Bordagaray , who were original settlers of the San Joaquin Valley . Bordagaray was the middle of seven children . 
 Of Basque and French descent , Bordagaray got his nickname from his mother . His father wanted him to become a violinist . He lettered in baseball , football , and track and field at Fresno State College .

 = = = Early career ( 1931 – 1933 ) = = = 
 Bordagaray made his professional baseball debut in minor league baseball with the Sacramento Senators of the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) during the 1931 season . They originally gave him a three @-@ week tryout without pay , so that he could retain his amateur status ; at the end of the tryout , the Senators offered Bordagaray his first professional contract . At only 20 years of age , Bordagaray 's father needed to provide his consent . Though his father initially refused and threatened to take the Senators to court , he changed his mind after visiting his son . Fresno State 's football coach , Stan <unk> , attempted to negotiate Bordagaray 's release , but Senators owner Lewis <unk> refused . 
 Bordagaray led the PCL in batting average ( .373 ) during the 1931 season . He publicly held out from the Senators for more money during the offseason , which became an annual tradition for Bordagaray . In the 1932 season , he batted .322 in games played . He followed this up by batting .351 in 117 games during the 1933 season . 
 While with the Senators , Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100 yard dash , losing by a few feet . During a game , Bordagaray reportedly went to use the toilet during the ninth inning . While he was off the field , the pitcher threw the ball , unaware he had no right fielder . The batter hit the pitch to right field , leading to a double . Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray , rather telling the pitcher to make sure his fielders were in place before throwing .

 The Chicago White Sox bought Bordagaray 's contract from Sacramento for $ 15 @,@ 000 ( $ 265 @,@ 336 in current dollar terms ) in the spring of 1934 . He batted .322 with a .344 on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) and .379 slugging percentage ( SLG ) , with no home runs , two runs batted in in 29 games for the 1934 Chicago White Sox . <unk> Swanson reclaimed the role he held in 1933 as starting right fielder for Chicago , and Bordagaray was returned to Sacramento in June , reclaiming their money . He spent the rest of 1934 with the Senators , batting .321 with 34 doubles and a .433 slugging percentage . After the 1934 season , the Senators traded Bordagaray to the Brooklyn Dodgers for Johnny Frederick , Art Herring and cash . He hit .282 with a .319 OBP and .363 SLG with 18 steals and 69 runs scored for the 1935 Dodgers . He was third in the National League ( NL ) in steals , four behind leader Augie Galan and two behind Pepper Martin . 
 Bordagaray showed up at spring training in 1936 with a mustache , which he grew for a bit role in The Prisoner of Shark Island , filmed during the offseason . This was scandalous , as baseball players were expected to be clean shaven at the time ; the last player believed to have worn a mustache was Wally Schang during the 1914 season . Looking for stories to write about , sportswriters for the Dodgers encouraged Bordagaray to grow out his mustache and goatee . The Brooklyn Eagle hosted a contest to determine what sort of beard Bordagaray should grow . After a few months , Dodgers manager Casey Stengel made him shave . <unk> would not be seen in MLB again until Oakland Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley paid his players to grow facial hair in the 1970s . Finley hosted a " mustache day " , and invited Bordagaray to serve as master of ceremonies . 
 Heading into the 1936 season , Stengel decided to use Bordagaray as his starting third baseman . For the year , Bordagaray batted .315 with a .346 OBP and .419 SLG for the Dodgers , finishing ninth in the NL with 12 steals . He was third among the team 's regulars in average , behind Babe Phelps and Joe <unk> . His <unk> fielding percentage was second among outfielders in the NL , trailing only teammate Johnny Cooney . That season , however , he received a $ 500 fine and 60 @-@ day suspension for spitting at an umpire . When asked about it , Bordagaray replied , " The penalty is a bit more than I expectorated . "

 With Burleigh Grimes succeeding Stengel as the Dodgers ' manager after the 1936 season , the Dodgers sold Bordagaray , Jimmy Jordan and Dutch Leonard to the St. Louis Cardinals as part of an off @-@ season shakeup ; it was seen as the completion of an August 1 trade in which the Dodgers acquired Tom <unk> from the Cardinals . With the Cardinals , Bordagaray batted .293 with a .331 OBP and .367 SLG during the 1937 season . His 11 stolen bases were eighth best in the NL . With the 1938 Cardinals , Bordagaray was used mostly as a bench player , as Enos Slaughter joined the team , playing in the outfield with Joe Medwick , Terry Moore , and Martin , and Art Garibaldi was set to play third base . Bordagaray batted .282 with a .325 OBP and .327 SLG with only two steals in 1938 . While a member of the Cardinals , Bordagaray played the washboard in Martin 's " Mudcat Band " . 
 Upon the conclusion of the 1938 season , the Cardinals assigned Bordagaray to their farm team in Rochester . They traded Bordagaray to the Cincinnati Reds for Dusty Cooke and cash later in the offseason . In 63 games with the Reds in 1939 , his batting average declined to .197 , as did his OBP ( .252 ) and SLG ( .254 ) . In the 1939 World Series , he pinch ran twice for Ernie Lombardi , but did not play in the field or have a plate appearance .

Bordagaray spent the 1940 season in the minor leagues , with the Kansas City Blues of the American Association . The Yankees promoted Bordagaray in 1941 . He hit .260 with a .325 OBP and .274 SLG in 36 games during the regular season , and appeared in one game during the 1941 World Series as a pinch runner for Bill Dickey . 
 Before the 1942 season , the Dodgers purchased Bordagaray from the Yankees . He hit .241 with a .279 OBP and .276 SLG in 48 games with the 1942 Dodgers , and .302 with a .379 OBP and .384 SLG in 89 games during the 1943 season . As Brooklyn 's primary third baseman and leadoff hitter in 1944 , Bordagaray hit .281 with a .331 OBP and .385 SLG with 85 runs in 501 at @-@ bats , topping 100 games played for the first time since 1936 .

 = Kanō Jigorō = 
 Kanō Jigorō ( <unk> <unk> , 28 October 1860 – 4 May 1938 ) was a Japanese educator and athlete , the founder of Judo . Judo was the first Japanese martial art to gain widespread international recognition , and the first to become an official Olympic sport . Pedagogical innovations attributed to Kanō include the use of black and white belts , and the introduction of dan ranking to show the relative ranking among members of a martial art style . Well @-@ known mottoes attributed to Kanō include " Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort " （ <unk> Sei @-@ <unk> Zen @-@ you ） and " Mutual Welfare and Benefit " （ <unk> Ji @-@ ta Kyou @-@ ei ） . 
 In his professional life , Kanō was an educator . Important postings included serving as director of primary education for the Ministry of Education ( <unk> , <unk> ) from 1898 to 1901 , and as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School from 1901 until 1920 . He played a key role in making judo and kendo part of the Japanese public school programs of the 1910s . 
 Kanō was also a pioneer of international sports . Accomplishments included being the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) ( he served from 1909 until 1938 ) ; officially representing Japan at most Olympic Games held between 1912 and 1936 ; and serving as a leading spokesman for Japan 's bid for the 1940 Olympic Games . 
 His official honors and decorations included the First Order of Merit and Grand Order of the Rising Sun and the Third Imperial Degree . Kanō was inducted as the first member of the International Judo Federation ( <unk> ) Hall of Fame on 14 May 1999 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Kanō Jigorō was born to a sake @-@ brewing family in the town of Mikage , Japan ( now within <unk> @-@ ku , Kobe ) . The family sake brands included " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " Kiku @-@ Masamune " . But Kanō 's father Kanō <unk> ( né <unk> <unk> ) was an adopted son and he did not go into the family business . Instead he worked as a lay priest and as a senior clerk for a shipping line . Kanō 's father was a great believer in the power of education , and he provided Jigorō , his third son , with an excellent education . The boy 's early teachers included the neo @-@ Confucian scholars Yamamoto <unk> and Akita <unk> . Kanō 's mother died when the boy was nine years old , and his father moved the family to Tokyo . The young Kanō was enrolled in private schools , and had his own English language tutor . In 1874 he was sent to a private school run by Europeans to improve his English and German language skills . 
 At the time Kanō stood 1 @.@ 57 m ( 5 feet 2 inches ) but weighed only 41 kg ( 90 pounds ) . He wished he were stronger . One day , Nakai <unk> ( a friend of the family who was a member of the shogun 's guard ) , mentioned that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training . He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent . Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai 's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous . Kanō 's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu , telling him to pursue a modern sport instead . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 When Kanō attended the Tokyo Imperial University in 1877 , he started looking for jūjutsu teachers . He first looked for <unk> , called <unk> . His assumption was that doctors knew who the better martial art teachers were . His search brought him to Yagi <unk> , who had been a student of Emon <unk> in the Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū school of jūjutsu . Yagi , in turn , referred Kanō to Fukuda <unk> , a bonesetter who taught Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū in a 10 @-@ mat room adjacent to his practice . Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū was itself a combination of two older schools : the Yōshin @-@ ryū and Shin no Shindō @-@ ryū . 
 Fukuda 's training method consisted mostly of the student taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand the mechanics of the technique . Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form . He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice ( randori ) in order to teach through experience . It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms ( kata ) . This method was difficult , as there were no special mats for falling , only the standard straw mats ( tatami ) laid over wooden floors . 
 Kanō had trouble defeating Fukushima <unk> , who was one of his seniors at the school . Therefore , Kanō started trying unfamiliar techniques on his rival . He first tried techniques from sumo . When these did not help , he studied more , and tried a technique ( " fireman 's carry " ) that he learned from a book on western wrestling . This worked , and <unk> , or " shoulder wheel " , remains part of the judo repertoire , although at this moment the judo organizations of some countries prohibit this throw in competition judo . 
 On 5 August 1879 , Kanō participated in a jūjutsu demonstration given for former United States president Ulysses S. Grant . This demonstration took place at the home of the prominent businessman <unk> Eiichi . Other people involved in this demonstration included the jūjutsu teachers Fukuda <unk> and Iso <unk> , and Kanō 's training partner Godai <unk> . Fukuda died soon after this demonstration , at the age of 52 . Kanō began studying with Iso , who had been a friend of Fukuda . Despite being 62 years old and standing only 5 ft 0 in ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) tall , Iso had gained a powerful build from <unk> training . He was known for excellence in kata , and was also a specialist in atemi , or the striking of vital areas . In Iso 's method , one began with kata and then progressed to free fighting ( randori ) . Due to Kanō 's intense practice and his solid grounding in the <unk> taught by Fukuda , he was soon an assistant at Iso 's school . After Fukuda 's death in 1881 , Fukuda 's widow gave the scrolls of the school to Kanō , then 21 years old . Some popular works suggest that Kanō obtained a teaching license in this school , but this has not been documented : no Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū certificate ( s ) with Kanō 's name visible is depicted anywhere in the Kōdōkan museum or in any published source . Neither is such rank specified in any authentic Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū archival documents . 
 While under Iso 's tutelage , Kanō witnessed a demonstration by the Yōshin @-@ ryū jūjutsu teacher Totsuka <unk> and later took part in randori with members of Totsuka 's school . Kanō was impressed by the Yōshin @-@ ryū practitioners and realized that he might never be able to beat someone as talented as Totsuka simply by training harder : he also needed to train smarter . It was this experience that first led Kanō to believe that to be truly superior , one needed to combine the best elements of several ryū , or schools , of jūjutsu including <unk> <unk> @-@ ryū Taijutsu . Toward this end , he began to seek teachers who could provide him with superior elements of jūjutsu that he could adopt . 
 After Iso died in 1881 , Kanō began training in Kitō @-@ ryū with Iikubo <unk> ( <unk> ) . Iikubo was expert in kata and throwing , and fond of randori . Kanō applied himself thoroughly to learning Kitō @-@ ryū , believing Iikubo 's throwing techniques in particular to be better than in the schools he had previously studied . It is Iikubo who issued Kanō 's only verified jūjutsu rank and teaching credential , namely a certificate of <unk> ( not <unk> <unk> ) in <unk> Kitō <unk> , dated October 1883 . 
 = = Kodokan judo = = 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 During the early 1880s , there was no clear separation between the jūjutsu that Kanō was teaching and the jūjutsu that his teachers had taught in the past . Kanō 's Kitō @-@ ryū teacher , Iikubo <unk> , came to Kanō 's classes two or three times a week to support Kanō 's teaching . Eventually student and master began to exchange places , and Kanō began to defeat Iikubo during randori : 
 To name his system , Kanō revived a term that Terada Kan <unk> , the fifth headmaster of the Kitō @-@ ryū , had adopted when he founded his own style , the <unk> @-@ ryū : " <unk> " . The name combined the characters jū ( <unk> ) , meaning " <unk> " , and dō , which is literally " The Way " , but figuratively meaning ' <unk> 
 From a technical standpoint , Kanō combined the throwing techniques of the Kitō @-@ ryū and the choking and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū . As such , judo 's Koshiki no Kata preserves the traditional forms of the Kitō @-@ ryū with only minor differences from the mainline tradition . Similarly , many of the techniques ( but not the forms ) of the Tenjin Shin 'yō @-@ ryū are preserved in the Kime no Kata . 
 Initially , Kanō borrowed ideas from everywhere . As he wrote in 1898 , " By taking together all the good points I had learned of the various schools and adding thereto my own inventions and discoveries , I devised a new system for physical culture and moral training as well as for winning contests . " However , after judo was introduced into the Japanese public schools , a process that took place between 1906 and 1917 , there was increasing standardization of kata and tournament technique . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Kanō also oversaw the development and growth of his judo organization , the Kodokan . This was a remarkable effort in itself , as the Kodokan 's enrollment grew from fewer than a dozen students in 1882 to more than a thousand dan @-@ graded members by 1911 . 
 In May or June 1882 , Kanō started the Kodokan dojo with twelve mats , in space belonging to the <unk> @-@ ji ( <unk> ) , a Buddhist temple in what was then the <unk> ward of Tokyo ( now the Higashi Ueno district of <unk> ward ) , with Iikubo attending the <unk> three days a week to help teach . Kanō had only a handful of students at this time , but they improved their technique through regular contests with local police jūjutsu teams . 
 The Kodokan moved to a 60 @-@ mat space in April 1890 . In December 1893 , the Kodokan started moving to a larger space located in <unk> @-@ cho , Koishikawa @-@ cho , and the move was completed by February 1894 . 
 The Kodokan 's first <unk> , or winter training , took place at the <unk> @-@ cho dojo during the winter of 1894 – 1895 . Midsummer training , or <unk> , started in 1896 . " In order to inure the pupil to the two extremes of heat and cold and to cultivate the virtue of perseverance " , Britain 's E.J. Harrison wrote : 
 During the late 1890s , the Kodokan moved two more times ; first to a 207 @-@ mat space in November 1897 , and then to a 314 @-@ mat space in January 1898 . In 1909 , Kanō incorporated the Kodokan , and endowed it with ¥ 10 @,@ 000 ( then about U.S. $ 4 @,@ 700 ) . The reason , said Japan Times on 30 March 1913 , was " so that this wonderful institution might be able to reconstruct , for that is what it really does , the moral and physical nature of the Japanese youth , without its founder 's personal attention . " 
 The Kodokan moved once again during Kanō 's lifetime , and on 21 March 1934 , the Kodokan dedicated this 510 @-@ mat facility . Guests at the opening included the Belgian , Italian , and Afghan ambassadors to Japan . In 1958 , when the Kodokan moved to its current eight story facility , that now has more than 1200 mats , the old building was sold to the Japan Karate Association . 
 = = = Ideals = = = 
 On 18 April 1888 , Kanō and Reverend Thomas Lindsay presented a lecture called " <unk> : The Old Samurai Art of Fighting without Weapons " to the Asiatic Society of Japan . This lecture took place at the British Embassy in Tokyo . Its theme was that the main principle of judo involved gaining victory by yielding to strength . 
 Being an idealist , Kanō had broad aims for judo , which he saw as something that simultaneously encompassed self @-@ defense , physical culture , and moral behavior . 
 In 1915 , Kanō gave this definition to judo : 
 In 1918 , Kanō added : 
 During March 1922 , Kanō brought all this to fruition through the introduction of the Kodokan <unk> , or Kodokan Cultural Association . This organization held its first meeting at Tokyo 's <unk> Hotel on 5 April 1922 , and held its first public lecture three days later at the YMCA hall in Kanda . The mottoes of the Kodokan Cultural Association were " Good Use of Spiritual and Physical Strength " and " Prospering in Common for <unk> and Others . " Although those are literal translations , the phrases were usually translated into English as " Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort " and " Mutual Welfare and Benefit . " The theories of this organization were described in some detail in an article published in an American magazine Living Age in September 1922 .

 Although Kanō promoted judo whenever he could , he earned his living as an educator . 
 Kanō entered Tokyo Imperial University during June 1877 . He majored in political science and economics , which at that time were taught by the Department of Aesthetics and Morals . He graduated in July 1882 , and the following month he began work as a professor , fourth class , at the Gakushuin , or Peers School , in Tokyo . In 1883 , Kanō was appointed professor of economics at <unk> Agricultural College ( now the Faculty of Agriculture at University of Tokyo ) , but during April 1885 , he returned to Gakushuin , with the position of principal . 
 In January 1891 , Kanō was appointed to a position at the Ministry of Education . In August 1891 , he gave up this position to become a dean at the Fifth Higher Normal School ( present @-@ day Kumamoto University ) . One of the teachers at Fifth Higher between 1891 and 1893 was Lafcadio Hearn . Around this same time , Kanō married . His wife , <unk> <unk> , was the daughter of a former Japanese ambassador to Korea . Eventually , the couple had six daughters and three sons . 
 During the summer of 1892 , Kanō went to Shanghai to help establish a program that would allow Chinese students to study in Japan . Kanō revisited Shanghai during 1905 , 1915 , and 1921 . 
 In January 1898 , Kanō was appointed director of primary education at the Ministry of Education , and in August 1899 , he received a grant that allowed him to study in Europe . His ship left Yokohama on 13 September 1899 , and he arrived in Marseilles on 15 October . He spent about a year in Europe , and during this trip , he visited Paris , Berlin , Brussels , Amsterdam , and London . He returned to Japan in 1901 . Soon after returning to Japan , he resumed his post as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School , and he remained in this position until his retirement on 16 January 1920 . He also helped establish Nada Middle High School in 1928 at Kobe , which later became one of highest @-@ ranked private high schools in Japan . 
 Considering that he majored in political science and economics , Kanō 's family thought that after graduating from university , he would pursue a career in some government ministry . Indeed , through influential friends of his father 's , he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance . However , his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin . The students of Japan 's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers . The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws ( <unk> ) right to the doors of the classes , whereas teachers were forbidden . The teachers often felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice . In effect , the teachers were treated as servants . 
 Kanō believed this to be unacceptable . He refused to play such a subservient role when teaching his students . To Kanō , a teacher must command respect . At the same time , he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods . The theories of the American educator John Dewey especially influenced him . Kanō 's manner had the desired effect upon the students , but the administration was slower to warm to his methods and it was not until the arrival of a new principal that Kanō 's ideas found acceptance . 
 All this is to say that Kanō 's educational philosophy was a combination of both traditional Japanese neo @-@ Confucianism and contemporary European and American philosophies , to include <unk> , Utilitarianism , and " evolutionary progressivism " , as Social Darwinism was then known . 
 The goals of Kanō 's educational philosophies and methods ( indeed , the goals of most Japanese educational programs of the early 20th century ) were to 1 ) develop minds , bodies , and spirits in equal proportion , 2 ) increase patriotism and loyalty , especially to the Emperor , 3 ) teach public morality , and 4 ) increase physical strength and stamina , especially for the purpose of making young men more fit for military service . 
 <unk> , especially as done in the huge formations favored at the time , could be boring , and at the high school and college levels , games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses . Moreover , at elite levels , baseball , football , and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development . Instead , elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning , at almost any cost . 
 For Kanō , the answer to this conundrum was one word : judo . Not judo in the sense of simply throwing other people around , and definitely not judo in the sense of winning at any cost . Instead , it was judo in the sense of " Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort " and " Mutual Welfare and Benefit . " Or , as Kanō himself put it to a reporter in 1938 : " When yielding is the highest efficient use of energy , then yielding is judo . " 
 = = = International Olympic Committee = = = 
 Kanō became active in the work of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1909 . This came about after Kristian <unk> of the Swedish Olympic Committee wrote to the governments of Japan and China to ask if they were going to send teams to the 1912 Olympics . The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no , so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this . The Ministry logically turned to Kanō , who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe . Kanō agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee , and , after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes , developed , in his words , " a fairly good idea of what the Olympic Games were . " 
 Toward fulfilling his duties as a member , in 1912 , Kanō helped establish the Japan Amateur Athletic Association ( Dai Nippon Tai @-@ <unk> <unk> ) , which had the mission of overseeing amateur sport in Japan . Kanō was the official representative of Japan to the Olympics in Stockholm in 1912 , and he was involved in organizing the Far Eastern Championship Games held in Osaka during May 1917 . In 1920 , Kanō represented Japan at the Antwerp Olympics , and during the early 1920s , he served on the Japanese Council of Physical Education . He did not play much part in organizing the Far Eastern Championship Games held in Osaka in May 1923 , nor did he attend the 1924 Olympics in Paris , but he did represent Japan at the Olympics in Amsterdam ( 1928 ) , Los Angeles ( 1932 ) , and Berlin ( 1936 ) . From 1931 to 1938 , he was also one of the leading international spokesmen in Japan 's bid for the 1940 Olympics . 
 Kanō 's chief goal in all this was , in his words , to gather people together for a common cause , with friendly feeling . His goals did not , however , particularly involve getting judo into the Olympics . As he put it in a letter to Britain 's Gunji Koizumi in 1936 : 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In 1934 , Kanō stopped giving public exhibitions . The reason was his failing health , probably compounded by kidney stones . The British judoka Sarah Mayer wrote " People don ’ t seem to think he will live much longer " to her friends in London . Nevertheless , Kanō continued attending important Kodokan events such as <unk> @-@ <unk> ( New Years ' ceremonies ) whenever he could , and he continued participating in Olympics business . 
 In May 1938 , Kanō died at sea , while on board the NYK Line motor ship <unk> Maru . Because the Japanese merchant fleet of the 1930s used Tokyo time wherever it was in the world , the Japanese date of death was 4 May 1938 at about 5 : 33 am JST , whereas the international date of death was 3 May 1938 at 20 : 33 UTC . The cause of death was officially listed as <unk> but other sources list food poisoning as the cause of death . During the 1990s , there appeared allegations that Kanō was murdered by poisoning rather than dying of pneumonia . Although there is no known contemporary documentation to support this claim , Kanō 's opposition to Japanese militarism was well @-@ known , and many others who also opposed it were allegedly assassinated . 
 Judo did not die with Kanō . Instead , during the 1950s , judo clubs sprang up throughout the world , and in 1964 , judo was introduced as an Olympic sport in the Tokyo Olympics , and was reintroduced at the Munich Olympics in 1972 . Kanō 's posthumous reputation was therefore assured . Nonetheless , his true legacy was his idealism . As Kanō said in a speech given in 1934 , " Nothing under the sun is greater than education . By educating one person and sending him into the society of his generation , we make a contribution extending a hundred generations to come . " 
 Kanō has also been compared to the Marquis of Queensberry in the way his legacy left a whole new set of rules :

 = Kongō @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Kongō @-@ class battlecruiser ( <unk> , Kongō @-@ gata jun <unk> ) was a class of four battlecruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) immediately before World War I. Designed by British naval architect George Thurston , the lead ship of the class was the last Japanese capital ship constructed outside Japan , by Vickers . 
 During the late 1920s , all but Hiei were reconstructed and reclassified as battleships . After the signing of the London Naval Treaty in 1930 , Hiei was reconfigured as a training ship to avoid being scrapped . Following Japan 's withdrawal from the London Naval Treaty , all four underwent a massive second reconstruction in the late 1930s . Following the completion of these modifications , which increased top speeds to over 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) , all four were reclassified as fast battleships . 
 The Kongō @-@ class battleships were the most active capital ships of the Japanese Navy during World War II , participating in most major engagements of the war . Hiei and Kirishima acted as escorts during the attack on Pearl Harbor , while Kongō and Haruna supported the invasion of Singapore . All four participated in the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal . Hiei and Kirishima were both lost during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942 , while Haruna and Kongō jointly bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal . The two remaining Kongō @-@ class battleships spent most of 1943 shuttling between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944 . Haruna and Kongō engaged American surface vessels during the Battle of Leyte Gulf . Kongō was torpedoed by USS Sealion in November 1944 , while Haruna was sunk at her moorings by air attack in Kure Naval Base in late July 1945 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design of the Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers came about as a result of the IJN 's modernization programs , as well as the perceived need to compete with the British Royal Navy . 
 In March 1908 , the Royal Navy launched HMS Invincible at Newcastle upon Tyne . Armed with eight 12 @-@ inch ( 30 cm ) main guns , Invincible rendered all current — and designed — Japanese capital ships obsolete by comparison . In 1911 , the Japanese Diet passed the Emergency Naval Expansion Bill , authorizing the construction of one battleship ( Fusō ) and four armoured cruisers , to be designed by British naval architect George Thurston . In his design of the class , Thurston relied on many techniques that would eventually be used by the British on the Tiger class . 
 Under the terms of the contract signed with Vickers in November 1910 , one member of the Kongō class — the lead ship Kongō — was to be built in Britain and Vickers were to maximize technology transfer to Japan . The design of the ships was from Vickers Design <unk> ( corresponding to the Japanese design designation B @-@ 46 ) . The original design featured eight or ten 12 @-@ inch ( 304 @.@ 8 mm ) 50 @-@ caliber guns , sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns , and eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . Cdr <unk> <unk> pushed for the adoption of a new 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) / 45 calibre gun that was currently under development . After trials of the new gun , which were witnessed by both the Japanese Navy and Royal Navy , the Japanese made the decision on 29 Nov 1911 to use the new gun despite the keel having already been laid down on the 17 January 1911 , and the resulting need to quickly make a large number of alternations to the design , so as to not prolong the construction . 
 The final design of the battlecruisers resulted in an improved version of the Lion class , displacing an estimated 27 @,@ 940 tonnes ( 27 @,@ 500 long tons ) . It also called for eight 14 @-@ inch guns mounted in four twin gun turrets ( two forward and two aft ) with a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . 
 To ensure transfer of the latest design knowledge to Japan more than 100 technical specialists were sent on 18 months secondments from Japan to Vickers during the construction phase of Kongō . If superintendents , supervisors and trial witnesses are also included then approximately 200 Japanese spent time in Britain . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ships had a length of 214 @.@ 58 meters ( 704 ft 0 in ) overall and a beam of 28 @.@ 04 meters ( 92 ft 0 in ) . They had a draft of 8 @.@ 22 meters ( 27 ft 0 in ) and displaced 27 @,@ 384 metric tons ( 26 @,@ 952 long tons ) at normal load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Kongō @-@ class ships had two sets of Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines , except for Haruna 's Brown @-@ Curtis turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts . The high @-@ pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low @-@ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts . The turbines were arranged in two compartments , separated by a centerline longitudinal <unk> ; both compartments were situated between turrets No. 3 and 4 . They were designed to produce a total of 65 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 48 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 36 Yarrow or Kampon water @-@ tube boilers , with working pressures ranging from 17 @.@ 1 to 19 @.@ 2 atm ( 1 @,@ 733 to 1 @,@ 945 kPa ; 251 to 282 psi ) . The boilers , arranged in eight compartments , were mixed @-@ firing with fuel oil sprayed onto the coal for extra power . The ships had a stowage capacity of 4 @,@ 200 long tons ( 4 @,@ 300 t ) of coal and 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) of oil , giving them a range of 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The battlecruisers were designed to reach a speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) and all of them exceeded that speed on their sea trials . Kongō and Hiei attained 27 @.@ 54 knots ( 51 @.@ 00 km / h ; 31 @.@ 69 mph ) and 27 @.@ 72 knots ( 51 @.@ 34 km / h ; 31 @.@ 90 mph ) with 78 @,@ 275 shp ( 58 @,@ 370 kW ) and 76 @,@ 127 shp ( 56 @,@ 768 kW ) , respectively . 
 In their first reconstruction during the late 1920s , the ships were reboilered with 10 , 11 ( Hiei ) or 16 ( Haruna ) Kampon boilers and their fuel stowage was rearranged to accommodate 2 @,@ 661 long tons ( 2 @,@ 704 t ) of coal and 3 @,@ 292 long tons ( 3 @,@ 345 t ) of oil . This increased their range to 8 @,@ 930 nautical miles ( 16 @,@ 540 km ; 10 @,@ 280 mi ) at 14 knots and allowed the fore funnel to be removed , which greatly decreased smoke interference with the bridge and fire @-@ control systems . Coupled with the addition of external torpedo bulges , this reduced their speed to 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) and caused the IJN to reclassify them as battleships . During their 1930s reconstructions into fast battleships , the existing boilers were removed and replaced with eleven oil @-@ fired Kampon boilers . These upgraded boilers gave the Kongō and her sister ships much greater power , with the class capable of speeds exceeding 30 @.@ 5 knots ( 56 @.@ 5 km / h ; 35 @.@ 1 mph ) . This made them the only Japanese battleships fully suited to operations alongside fast carriers . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The primary armament of the Kongō class consisted of eight 45 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ inch guns , mounted in four superfiring twin @-@ gun turrets . The turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees except in Kongō whose turrets had a maximum elevation capability of + 25 degrees . The shells could be loaded at any angle and the guns had a firing cycle of 30 – 40 seconds . These guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships ' careers . During the first reconstruction of the class during the 1920s , the elevation of the main guns was increased to a maximum of + 33 degrees . The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns . 
 By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armor @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed 673 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 485 lb ) and had a muzzle velocity of 775 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . They had a maximum range of 25 @,@ 000 meters ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernisation . Also available was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 378 lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 <unk> incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . 
 As built , the Kongō class was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50 @-@ caliber six @-@ inch guns mounted in single casemates along the sides of the hull at the level of the upper deck . Eight guns were mounted per side , and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of + 15 degrees . Each gun could fire a 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 lb ) high explosive projectile a maximum distance of 22 @,@ 970 yards ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) at a rate of between four and six shots per minute . During their reconstruction in the 1930s , the maximum elevation of the guns was increased to + 30 degrees , which increased their maximum range by approximately 900 metres ( 980 yd ) . During their second reconstruction , two of these guns were removed from each ship , bringing the total to fourteen six @-@ inch guns . 
 The ships also mounted four 40 @-@ caliber 76 mm anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns . The 76 @-@ millimetre ( 3 in ) high @-@ angle guns were in single mounts . Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and could fire a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) projectile with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . Both ships were equipped with eight submerged 533 @-@ millimetre ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , four on each broadside . 
 The Kongō class 's secondary armament changed significantly over time . During the modernizations of the 1930s , all of the 76 mm guns were replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 127 mm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) dual @-@ purpose guns . These guns were fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . During reconstruction , the two foremost 152 mm guns were also removed . 
 The light AA armament of the Kongō class changed dramatically from 1933 to 1944 . During the second reconstruction , the ships were fitted with four to eight twin 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) machine @-@ guns , later replaced by 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) gun mounts . Both weapons were license @-@ built French Hotchkiss designs . The 25 mm guns were mounted on the Kongō class in single , double and triple mounts . This model was the standard Japanese light anti @-@ aircraft gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . The twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . Haruna ultimately carried 118 guns in 30 triple , two twin and 24 single mounts . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers were designed with the intention of maximizing speed and maneuverability , and as such were not as heavily armoured as later Japanese capital ships . Nevertheless , the Kongō class possessed significant quantities of armour , and were heavily upgraded during their modernizations . In their initial configuration , the Kongō class possessed an upper belt that was 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick , and a lower belt with a thickness of 8 inches ( 203 mm ) . Vickers Cemented was used in the construction of the Kongō , while the original armour of the other three was constructed of a variation of Krupp Cemented Armour , designed by the German Krupp Arms Works . Subsequent developments of Japanese armour technology relied upon a hybrid design of the two variations until drastic changes were made during the design of the Yamato class in 1938 . The armoured belt near the bow and stern of the vessels was strengthened with an additional 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of cemented armour . The conning tower of the Kongō class was very heavily armoured , with variations of Krupp Cemented Armour up to 14 inches ( 360 mm ) thick . The turrets were lightly armoured compared to later designs , with a maximum plate thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) . The deck armour ranged from 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 75 inches ( 38 to 70 mm ) . 
 During the reconstructions that each ship underwent during the interwar period , most of the armour of the Kongō class was heavily upgraded . The main lower belt was strengthened to be a uniform thickness of 8 inches , while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from 5 to 8 inches ( 127 to 203 mm ) reinforced the main armoured belt . The upper belt remained unchanged , but was closed by 9 @-@ inch bulkheads at the bow and stern of the ships . The turret armour was strengthened to 10 inches ( 254 mm ) , while 4 inches ( 102 mm ) were added to portions of the deck armour . The armour upgrades increased the displacement by close to 4 @,@ 000 tons on each ship , violating the terms of the Washington Treaty . Even after these modifications , the armour capacity of the Kongō class remained much less than that of newer capital ships , a factor which played a major role in the sinking of Hiei and Kirishima at the hands of U.S. Navy cruisers and battleships in 1942 . 
 = = Ships = = 
 Due to a lack of available slipways , the latter two were the first Japanese warships to be built by Japanese private shipyards . Completed by 1915 , they were considered the first modern battlecruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy . According to naval historian Robert Jackson , they " outclassed all other contemporary [ capital ] ships " . The design was so successful that the construction of the fourth battlecruiser of the Lion @-@ class — HMS Tiger — was halted so that design features of the Kongō class could be added . 
 = = = Kongō = = = 
 Kongō was laid down 17 January 1911 at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , launched 18 May 1912 , and commissioned 16 August 1913 . She arrived in Yokosuka via Singapore in November 1913 to undergo armaments sighting checks in Kure Naval Arsenal , being placed in reserve upon her arrival . On 23 August 1914 , Japan formally declared war on the German Empire as part of her contribution to the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , and Kongō was deployed near Midway Island to patrol the communications lines of the Pacific Ocean , attached to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet . Following the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , Kongō and her contemporaries ( including the ships in the Nagato , Ise and Fusō classes ) were the only Japanese capital ships to avoid the scrapyard . On 1 November 1924 , Kongō docked at Yokosuka for modifications which improved fire control and main @-@ gun elevation , and increased her antiaircraft armament . In September 1929 , she began her first major reconstruction . Her horizontal armour , boilers , and machinery space were all improved , and she was equipped to carry Type 90 Model 0 floatplanes . When her reconstruction was completed on 31 March 1931 , she was reclassified as a battleship . From October 1933 to November 1934 , Kongō was the flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet , before being placed in reserve when the flag was transferred to Yamashiro . 
 On 1 June 1935 , Kongō 's second reconstruction began . Japan 's withdrawal from the London Naval Treaty led to reconstruction of her forward tower to fit the Pagoda @-@ Style of design , improvements to the boilers and turbines , and reconfiguration of the aircraft catapults aft of Turret 3 . Her new top speed of 30 knots ( 35 mph ; 56 km / h ) qualified her as a fast battleship . The modifications were completed on 8 January 1937 . In either August or November 1941 , she was assigned to the Third Battleship Division with her three sister ships , and sailed on 29 November as part of the main body — four fast battleships , three heavy cruisers , eight destroyers — for the Japanese invasion of Malaya and Singapore . Following the destruction of the British Force Z , the Main Body departed for French Indochina , before escorting a fast carrier task force in February during the invasion of the Dutch East Indies . Kongō provided cover for Japanese carriers during attacks on the Dutch East Indies in February and Ceylon in March and April . Kongō and Hiei were part of the Second Fleet Main Body during the Battle of Midway , but were diverted north on 9 June to assist in the invasion of the Aleutian Islands . Kongō and her sisters engaged American naval forces in the Battle of Guadalcanal . During this engagement Kongō and Haruna bombarded Henderson Field with 430 14 @-@ inch and 33 6 @-@ inch shells on 13 October 1942 . Following armament and armour upgrades in late 1943 and early 1944 , Kongō sailed as part of Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet during the Battle of the Philippine Sea . During the Battle of Leyte Gulf , Kongō sortied as part of Admiral Kurita 's Center Force , scoring hits on an American escort carrier and sinking or damaging two destroyers during the Battle off Samar . Kongō and an escort , Urakaze , were sunk northwest of Taiwan on 21 November 1944 by the submarine USS Sealion , after being hit on the port bow by two or three torpedoes . Approximately 1 @,@ 200 of her crew — including her Captain and the commander of the Third Battleship Division , Vice Admiral Yoshio Suzuki — were lost . She was removed from the Navy List on 20 January 1945 . 
 = = = Hiei = = = 
 Hiei was laid down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 4 November 1911 , launched 21 November 1912 , and commissioned at Sasebo 4 August 1914 , attached to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet . After conducting patrols off China and in the East China Sea during World War I , Hiei was placed in reserve in 1920 . After undergoing minor reconstructions in 1924 and 1927 , Hiei was demilitarized in 1929 to avoid being scrapped under the terms of the Washington Treaty ; she was converted to a training ship in Kure from 1929 to 1932 . All of her armour and most of her armament were removed under the restrictions of the treaty and carefully preserved . In 1933 , she was refitted as an Imperial Service Ship and — following further reconstruction in 1934 — became the Emperor 's ship in late 1935 . In 1937 , following Japan 's withdrawal from the London Treaty , Hiei underwent a massive reconstruction along lines similar to those of her sister ships . When the reconstruction was completed on 31 January 1940 , Hiei was reclassified as a battleship . Hiei sailed in November 1941 as an escort of Vice @-@ Admiral Chuichi Nagumo 's carrier force which attacked Pearl Harbor . Hiei provided escort cover during carrier raids on Darwin in February 1942 , before a joint engagement with Kirishima that sank an American destroyer in March . She participated in carrier actions against Ceylon and Midway Island , and was subsequently drydocked in July . Following carrier escort duty during the Battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa @-@ Cruz , Hiei departed as the flagship of Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe 's Combat Division 11 to bombard Henderson Field on the night of 12 – 13 November 1942 . When the fleet encountered Rear Admiral Daniel Callaghan 's Task Group in Ironbottom Sound , the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal ensued . In an extremely confusing melee , Hiei disabled two American heavy cruisers — killing two rear admirals in the process — but was hit by about 85 shells from the guns of cruisers and destroyers , rendering her virtually unmaneuverable . Abe transferred his flag to Kirishima , and the battleship was taken under tow by the same ship , but one of her rudders froze in the full starboard position . Over the next day , Hiei was attacked by American aircraft many different times . While trying to evade an attack at 14 : 00 , Hiei lost her emergency rudder and began to show a list to stern and starboard . Hiei was scuttled northwest of Savo Island on the evening of 13 November by Japanese destroyers .

 Kirishima 's keel was laid in Mitsubishi 's Nagasaki yard on 17 March 1912 . She was launched about a year and a half later ( 1 December 1913 ) and transferred to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for fitting out . After her completion on 19 April 1915 , she served off Japan , China and Korea 's coasts during the First World War . After the war , she alternated between being based in Japan and patrolling off Japanese ports . On 14 September 1922 , she collided with the destroyer ( Fuji ) , causing minor damage to both ships . Kirishima also assisted rescue efforts in the aftermath of the devastating 1923 Great Kantō earthquake , which destroyed most of Tokyo . After being sent to the reserve fleet in December 1923 , she received a refit during 1924 . Returning to the main fleet , the battlecruiser operated off China for periods of time in 1925 – 1926 , until she returned to reserve from 1927 to 1931 in preparation for a major reconstruction . Her superstructure was rebuilt , and she received extensive upgrades to armour , propulsion , and waterline bulges . After a period of fleet duty in the early 1930s , she underwent a two @-@ year reconstruction ( 1934 – 1936 ) to rebuild her as a Fast Battleship . This upgrade improved her engine plant , redesigned the superstructure , lengthened the stern , and enabled her to equip floatplanes . After serving as a transport and support @-@ ship during the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , Kirishima escorted the aircraft carrier strikeforce bound for the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 . Following the start of World War II , Kirishima served as an escort during carrier attacks on Port Darwin and the Dutch East Indies . Kirishima joined her sister ships in escorting naval sorties against Ceylon . She once again served escort duty during the disastrous Battle of Midway , before transferring to Truk Lagoon in preparation for operations against American landings on Guadalcanal . After participating in the Battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz , Kirishima joined Hiei in a night attack on 13 November 1942 . Following the loss of the latter on the evening of 13 November , Kirishima subsequently engaged American battleships on the night of 14 / 15 November . She managed to inflict superficial damage on USS South Dakota , but she was in turn caught off guard while attacking South Dakota and was crippled by USS Washington . With her engines largely disabled and listing heavily to starboard , Kirishima was abandoned in the early morning of 15 November 1942 . She capsized and sank at 03 : 25 with the loss of 212 of her crew . 
 = = = Haruna = = = 
 Haruna was laid down at Kobe by Kawasaki on 16 March 1912 , launched 14 December 1913 , and formally commissioned 19 April 1915 . After a short patrolling duty off Sasebo , Haruna suffered a breech explosion during gunnery drills on 12 September 1920 ; seven crewmen were killed and the No. 1 turret badly damaged . After a long period of time in reserve , Haruna underwent her first modernization from 1926 to 1928 . The process upgraded her propulsion capabilities , enabled her to carry and launch floatplanes , increasing her armour capacity by over 4 @,@ 000 tons , and was shortly thereafter reclassified as a Battleship . She was overhauled a second time from 1933 to 1935 , which additionally strengthened her armour and reclassified her as a fast battleship . During the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , Haruna primarily served as a large @-@ scale troop transport for Japanese troops to the Chinese mainland . On the eve of the commencement of World War II , Haruna sailed as part of Vice @-@ Admiral Nobutake Kondō 's Southern Force . On 8 December 1941 , Haruna provided heavy support for the invasion of Malaya and Singapore . She participated in the major Japanese offensives in the southern and southwestern Pacific in early 1942 , before sailing as part of the carrier @-@ strike force during the Battle of Midway . Haruna bombarded American positions at Henderson Field at Guadalcanal , and provided escort to carriers during the Solomon Islands campaign . In 1943 , she deployed as part of a larger force on multiple occasions to counter the threat of American carrier strikes , but did not actively participate in a single battle . In 1944 , Haruna was an escort during the Battle of the Philippine Sea and fought American surface vessels off Samar during the Battle of Leyte Gulf . She was the only one of the four battleships in her class to survive 1944 . Haruna remained at Kure throughout 1945 , where she was sunk by aircraft of Task Force 38 on 28 July 1945 , after taking nine bomb hits at her moorings . She was subsequently raised and broken up for scrap in 1946 .

 Sleepy Hollow is a 1999 supernatural horror film directed by Tim Burton . It is a film adaptation loosely inspired by the 1820 short story " The Legend of Sleepy Hollow " by Washington Irving and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci , with Miranda Richardson , Michael Gambon , Casper Van Dien , Ray Park and Jeffrey Jones in supporting roles . The plot follows police constable Ichabod Crane ( Depp ) sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman . 
 Development began in 1993 at Paramount Pictures with Kevin Yagher originally set to direct Andrew Kevin Walker 's script as a low @-@ budget slasher film . Disagreements with Paramount resulted in Yagher being demoted to prosthetic makeup designer , and Burton was hired to direct in June 1998 . Filming took place from November 1998 to May 1999 , and Sleepy Hollow was released to generally favorable reviews from critics , and grossed approximately $ 206 million worldwide . The film won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1799 , New York City police constable Ichabod Crane ( Johnny Depp ) is facing imprisonment for going against traditional methods . Ichabod submits to deployment to the Westchester County hamlet of Sleepy Hollow , New York , which has been plagued by a series of brutal slayings in which the victims are found decapitated : Peter Van Garrett ( Martin Landau ) , a wealthy farmer ; his son Dirk ; and the widow Emily Winship . Crane is informed that the killer is an undead headless Hessian mercenary from the American Revolutionary War who rides on a black steed in search of his missing head . 
 Crane begins his investigation , remaining skeptical about the supernatural elements until he actually encounters the Headless Horseman , who kills the town magistrate , Samuel <unk> ( Richard Griffiths ) . Boarding at the home of the town 's richest family , the Van Tassels , Crane is taken with their daughter Katrina ( Christina Ricci ) . Crane and Young Masbath , the son of one of the Horseman 's victims , go to the cave dwelling of a reclusive sorceress . She reveals the location of the Tree of the Dead , which marks the Horseman 's grave , as well as his portal into the natural world . 
 Crane discovers that the ground is freshly disturbed and the Horseman 's skeleton has the skull missing . He realizes that whoever dug up and stole the skull is the person controlling the Horseman . The Killian family are taken by the Horseman and Katrina 's suitor Brom van Brunt ( Casper Van Dien ) is killed trying to stop the Horseman . 
 Crane starts to believe that a conspiracy links all the deaths together , so he looks into Van Garrett 's Last Will . Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died , leaving all his possessions to his new bride , Emily Winship . Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will were the victims of Horseman and that Katrina 's father Baltus Van Tassel ( Michael Gambon ) , who would have inherited the fortune , is the person holding the skull . Katrina , finding out that Crane suspects her father , burns the evidence that Crane has accumulated . 
 A council is held in the church . The Horseman seemingly kills Katrina 's stepmother , Lady Van Tassel , and heads off to the church to get Baltus . Crane realizes the Horseman can 't enter the church due to it being holy . A fight breaks out in the church and the chaos ends only when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window , dragging him out and acquiring his head . The next day , Crane believes Katrina to be the one who controls the Headless Horsemen . 
 Crane becomes suspicious when the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound that seems to have been caused post @-@ mortem . The real Lady Van Tassel ( Miranda Richardson ) then emerges , alive . Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts , and that she became a witch and summoned the Horseman to kill them off and make herself sole heir to the family fortune . She then sends the killer after Katrina to solidify her hold on what she considers her rightful property . 
 Following a fight and a stagecoach chase , Crane eventually thwarts Lady Van Tassel by throwing the skull to the Horseman , which causes his head to become reattached to his body and the curse broken . The Horseman , no longer under Lady Van Tassel 's control , simultaneously kisses and bites her , and hoists her up on his horse . He then rides to Hell , taking her with him , fulfilling her end of the deal with the Devil . Crane returns home to New York with Katrina and Young Masbath , just in time for the new century .

 In 1993 , Kevin Yagher , a make @-@ up effects designer who had turned to directing with Tales from the Crypt , had the notion to adapt Washington Irving 's short story " The Legend of Sleepy Hollow " into a feature film . Through his agent , Yagher was introduced to Andrew Kevin Walker ; they spent a few months working on a film treatment that transformed Ichabod Crane as a schoolmaster from Connecticut to a banished New York City detective . Yagher and Walker subsequently pitched Sleepy Hollow to various studios and production companies , eventually securing a deal with producer Scott Rudin , who had been impressed with Walker 's unproduced spec script for Seven . Rudin optioned the project to Paramount Pictures in a deal that had Yagher set to direct , with Walker scripting ; the pair would share story credit . Following the completion of Hellraiser : Bloodline , <unk> had planned Sleepy Hollow as a low @-@ budget production — " a pretentious slasher film with a spectacular murder every five minutes or so . " Paramount disagreed on the concept and demoted Yagher 's involvement to prosthetic makeup designer . " They never really saw it as a commercial movie , " producer Adam Schroeder noted . " The studio thinks ' old literary classic ' and they think The Crucible . We started developing it before horror movies came back . " 
 Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio interest in 1998 . Schroeder , who shepherded Tim Burton 's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990 , suggested that Burton direct the film . Francis Ford Coppola 's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope ; Burton only became aware of Coppola 's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollow 's trailer and saw Coppola 's name on it . Burton , coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives , was hired to direct in June 1998 . " I had never really done something that was more of a horror film , " he explained , " and it 's funny , because those are the kind of movies that I like probably more than any other genre . " His interest in directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday — particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages . As a result , Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions , including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde , and other films such as Frankenstein , Bride of Frankenstein , various Roger Corman horror films , Jason and the Argonauts , and Scream Blacula Scream . The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s . " One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase , and he brought in some layouts from it , so that was exciting . It was one of the things that maybe shaped what I like to do . " Burton worked with Walker on rewrites , but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod 's bumbling mannerisms , and emphasize the character 's romance with Katrina . His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system . 
 While Johnny Depp was Burton 's first choice for the role of Ichabod Crane , Paramount required him to consider Brad Pitt , Liam Neeson and Daniel Day @-@ Lewis . Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton . The actor wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving 's description of the character in the short story . This included a long prosthetic snipe nose , huge ears , and elongated fingers . Paramount turned down his suggestions , and after Depp read Tom Stoppard 's rewrite of the script , he was inspired to take the character even further . " I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate , fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side , like a frightened little girl , " Depp explained . He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have , and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury 's performance in Death on the Nile . " It 's good , " Burton reasoned , " because I 'm not the greatest action director in the world , and he 's not the greatest action star . " Depp modeled Ichabod 's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film series . He also studied Roddy McDowall 's acting for additional influence . Burton added that " the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had . " Christina Ricci , who worked with producer Scott Rudin on The Addams Family , was cast as Katrina Van Tassel . Sleepy Hollow also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones ( from Beetlejuice and Ed Wood ) as <unk> <unk> , Christopher Walken ( Max Schreck in Batman Returns ) as the Hessian Horseman , Martin Landau ( Ed Wood ) in a cameo role , and Hammer veteran Michael Gough ( Alfred in Burton 's Batman films ) , whom Burton tempted out of retirement . The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The original intention had been to shoot Sleepy Hollow predominantly on location with a $ 30 million budget . Towns were scouted throughout Upstate New York along the Hudson Valley , and the filmmakers decided on Tarrytown for an October 1998 start date . The Historic Hudson Valley organization assisted in scouting locations , which included the Philipsburg Manor House and forests in the Rockefeller State Park Preserve . " They had a wonderful quality to them , " production designer Rick Heinrichs reflected on the locations , " but it wasn 't quite lending itself to the sort of expressionism that we were going for , which wanted to express the feeling of foreboding . " Disappointed , the filmmakers scouted locations in <unk> , Massachusetts , and considered using Dutch colonial villages and period town recreations in the Northeastern United States . When no suitable existing location could be found , coupled with a lack of readily available studio space in the New York area needed to house the production 's large number of sets , producer Scott Rudin suggested the UK . 
 Rudin believed England offered the level of craftsmanship in period detail , painting and costuming that was suitable for the film 's design . Having directed Batman entirely in Britain , Burton agreed , and designers from Batman 's art department were employed by Paramount for Sleepy Hollow . As a result , principal photography was pushed back to November 20 , 1998 at Leavesden Film Studios , which had been recently vacated by Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace . The majority of filming took place at Leavesden , with studio other work at Shepperton Studios , where the massive Tree of the Dead set was built using Stage H. Production then moved to the Hambleden estate at Lime Tree Valley for a month @-@ long shoot in March , where the town of Sleepy Hollow was constructed . " We came to England figuring we would find a perfect little town , " producer Adam Schroeder recalled , " and then we had to build it anyway . " Filming in Britain continued through April , and a few last minute scenes were shot using a sound stage in Yonkers , New York the following May . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Responsible for the film 's production design was Rick Heinrichs , who Burton intended to use on Superman Lives . While the production crew was always going to build a substantial number of sets , the decision was taken early on that to fulfill Burton 's vision best would necessitate shooting Sleepy Hollow in a totally controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios . The production design was influenced by Burton 's love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday — particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages . Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture , German Expressionism , Dr. Seuss illustrations , and Hammer 's Dracula Has Risen from the Grave . One sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the " Forest to Field " set , for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field . This stage was then transformed into , variously , a graveyard , a corn field , a field of harvested wheat , a churchyard , and a snowy battlefield . In addition , a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank . 
 = = = = Cinematography = = = = 
 Burton was impressed by the cinematography in Great Expectations , and hired Emmanuel Lubezki as Sleepy Hollow 's director of photography . Initially , Lubezki and Burton contemplated shooting the film in black and white and in old square Academy ratio . When that proved unfeasible , they opted for an almost monochromatic effect which would enhance the fantasy aspect . Burton and Lubezki intentionally planned the over @-@ dependency of smoke and soft lighting to accompany the film 's sole wide @-@ angle lens strategy . Lubezki also used Hammer horror and Mexican lucha films from the 1960s , such as Santo Contra los <unk> and Santo vs. las Mujeres Vampiro . Lighting effects increased the dynamic energy of the Headless Horseman , while the contrast of the film stock was increased in post @-@ production to add to the monochromatic feel . 
 Leavesden Studios , a converted airplane factory , presented problems because of its relatively low ceilings . This was less of an issue for The Phantom Menace , in which set height was generally achieved by digital means . " Our visual choices get channeled and violent , " Heinrichs elaborated , " so you end up with liabilities that you tend to exploit as virtues . When you 've got a certain ceiling height , and you 're dealing with painted backings , you need to push atmosphere and diffusion . " This was particularly the case in several exteriors that were built on sound stages . " We would mitigate the disadvantages by hiding lights with teasers and smoke . " 
 = = = = Visual effects = = = = 
 The majority of Sleepy Hollow 's 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) , while Kevin Yagher supervised the human and creature effects . Framestore also assisted on digital effects , and The Mill handled motion control photography . In part a reaction to the computer @-@ generated effects in Mars Attacks ! , Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible . Ray Park , who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double , wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect , digitally removed by ILM . Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on Vincent — such as forced perspective sets . 
 The windmill was a 60 @-@ foot @-@ tall forced @-@ perspective exterior ( visible to highway travellers miles away ) , a base and rooftop set and a quarter @-@ scale miniature . The interior of the mill , which was about 30 @-@ feet high and 25 @-@ feet wide , featured wooden gears equipped with mechanisms for grinding flour . A wider view of the windmill was rendered on a Leavesden soundstage set with a quarter @-@ scale windmill , complete with rotating vanes , painted sky backdrop and special @-@ effects fire . " It was scary for the actors who were having burning wood explode at them , " Heinrichs recalled . " There were controls in place and people standing by with hoses , of course , but there 's always a chance of something going wrong . " For the final shot of the burning mill exploding , the quarter @-@ scale windmill and painted backdrop were erected against the outside wall of the " flight shed " , a spacious hangar on the far side of Leavesden Studios . The hangar 's interior walls were knocked down to create a 450 @-@ foot run , with a 40 @-@ foot width still allowing for coach and cameras . Heinrichs tailored the sets so cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki could shoot from above without seeing the end of the stage . 
 Actor Ian McDiarmid , who portrayed Dr. Lancaster , had just finished another Leavesden production with Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace . He compared the aesthetics of the two films , stating that physical sets helped the actors get into a natural frame of mind . " Having come from the blue @-@ screen world of Star Wars it was wonderful to see gigantic , beautifully made perspective sets and wonderful clothes , and also people recreating a world . It 's like the way movies used to be done . "

 To promote Sleepy Hollow , Paramount Pictures featured the film 's trailer at San Diego Comic @-@ Con International in August 1999 . The following October , the studio launched a website , which Variety described as being the " most ambitious online launch of a motion picture to date . " The site ( <unk> ) offered visitors live video chats with several of the filmmakers hosted by Yahoo ! Movies and enabled them to send postcards , view photos , trailers and a six @-@ minute behind @-@ the @-@ scenes featurette edited from a broadcast that aired on Entertainment Tonight . Extensive tours of 10 sets where offered , where visitors were able to roam around photographs , including the sets for the entire town of Sleepy Hollow , forest , church , graveyard and covered bridge . Arthur Cohen , president of worldwide marketing for Paramount , explained that the " Web @-@ friendly " pre @-@ release reports from websites such as Ain 't It Cool News and Dark Horizons encouraged the studio to create the site . In the weeks pre @-@ dating the release of Sleepy Hollow , a toy line was marketed by McFarlane Toys . Simon & Schuster also published The Art of Sleepy Hollow ( ISBN <unk> ) , which included the film 's screenplay and an introduction by Tim Burton . A novelization , also published by Simon & Schuster , was written by Peter Lerangis . 
 Sleepy Hollow was released in the United States on November 19 , 1999 in 3 @,@ 069 theaters , grossing $ 30 @,@ 060 @,@ 467 in its opening weekend at the # 2 spot behind The World Is Not Enough .

David Walsh of the National Institute on Media and the Family criticized the film 's financial success from the exaggeration of gore . " The real impact is not so much that violent images create violent behavior , " Walsh explained , " but that they create an atmosphere of disrespect . " Burton addressed the concerns as a matter of opinion . " Everyone has a different perception of things . When I was a kid , " Burton continued , " I was probably more scared by seeing John Wayne or Barbra Streisand on the big screen than by seeing violence . " 
 Paramount Home Video first released Sleepy Hollow on DVD in the United States on May 23 , 2000 . The HD DVD release came in July 2006 , while the film was released on Blu @-@ ray Disc two years later , in June 2008 .

 Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 67 % of critics gave the film a " Certified Fresh " rating , based on 126 reviews with an average score of 6 @.@ 2 / 10 , with the site 's consensus stating , " Sleepy Hollow entertains with its stunning visuals and creepy atmosphere . " Metacritic , another review aggregator , assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 ( out of 100 ) based on 35 reviews from mainstream critics , considered to be " generally favorable " . 
 Roger Ebert praised Johnny Depp 's performance and Tim Burton 's methods of visual design . " Johnny Depp is an actor able to disappear into characters , " Ebert continued , " never more readily than in one of Burton 's films . " Richard Corliss wrote , in his review for TIME Magazine , " Burton 's richest , prettiest , weirdest [ film ] since Batman Returns . The simple story bends to his twists , freeing him for an exercise in high style . " 
 David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor highly praised Burton 's filmmaking and the high @-@ spirited acting of cast , but believed Andrew Kevin Walker 's writing was too repetitious and formulaic for the third act . " You go into a Tim Burton film wanting to be transported , but Sleepy Hollow is little more than a lavish , art @-@ directed slasher movie . " 
 Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly wrote Sleepy Hollow is " a choppily plotted crowd @-@ pleaser that lacks the seductive , <unk> alchemy of Burton 's best work .

 Andrew Johnston of Time Out New York wrote : " Like the best of Burton 's films , Sleepy Hollow takes place in a world so richly imagined that , despite its abundant terrors , you can 't help wanting to step through the screen . " 
 Mick LaSalle , writing in the San Francisco Chronicle , criticized Burton 's perceived image as a creative artist . " All Sleepy Hollow has going for it is art direction , and even in that it falls back on cliché . " Doug Walker linked the film to the Hammer Films style of horror cinematography , considering it an homage to those movies , comparing the usage of dignified British actors , choices in color and movie sets and character relations . Walker gave it the merit of recreating the " very specific genre " of Hammer Films , citing the skill and " clever casting " Burton used to manage this . 
 Jonathan Rosenbaum from the Chicago Reader called Sleepy Hollow " a ravishing visual experience , a pretty good vehicle for some talented American and English actors , " but concluded that the film was a missed opportunity to depict an actual representation of the short story . " Burton 's fidelity is exclusively to the period feeling he gets from disreputable Hammer horror films and a few images culled from Ichabod and Mr. Toad . When it comes to one of America 's great stories , Burton obviously couldn 't care less . "

 = To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World = 
 To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World is an open letter written on February 24 , 1836 , by William B. Travis , commander of the Texian forces at the Battle of the Alamo , to settlers in Mexican Texas . The letter is renowned as a " declaration of defiance " and a " masterpiece of American patriotism " , and forms part of the history education of Texas schoolchildren . 
 On February 23 , the Alamo Mission in San Antonio , Texas had been besieged by Mexican forces led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna . Fearing that his small group of men could not withstand an assault , Travis wrote this letter seeking reinforcements and supplies from supporters . The letter closes with Travis 's vow of " Victory or Death ! " , an emotion which has been both praised and derided by historians . 
 The letter was initially entrusted to courier Albert Martin , who carried it to the town of Gonzales some seventy miles away . Martin added several postscripts to encourage men to reinforce the Alamo , and then handed the letter to Launcelot Smithers . Smithers added his own postscript and delivered the letter to its intended destination , San Felipe de Austin . Local publishers printed over 700 copies of the letter . It also appeared in the two main Texas newspapers and was eventually printed throughout the United States and Europe . Partially in response to the letter , men from throughout Texas and the United States began to gather in Gonzales . Between 32 and 90 of them reached the Alamo before it fell ; the remainder formed the nucleus of the army which eventually defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto . 
 Following the end of the Texas Revolution , the original letter was delivered to Travis 's family in Alabama , and in 1893 , one of his descendants sold it to the State of Texas for $ 85 ( $ 2 @,@ 239 today ) . For many decades it was displayed at the Texas State Library ; the original letter is now protected and a copy is on display under a portrait of Travis . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country 's immigration policies , allowing foreigners to settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas . People flocked to the area ; an 1834 census estimated the Texas population at 7 @,@ 800 Mexicans and 30 @,@ 000 English @-@ speaking people primarily from the United States . Among the immigrants was William Barret Travis , an Alabama native who had variously worked as a teacher , a newspaper publisher , and a lawyer . An avid reader , Travis often devoured a novel in a single day . His taste ran primarily to romantic adventure and history , especially the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Benjamin Disraeli and the historical works of Herodotus . Historians have speculated that Travis 's choice of reading material may have affected his behavior — Travis was known for his melodramatic ways . 
 In May 1831 , Travis opened a law office in Anahuac , Texas . Almost immediately , he and his law partner , Patrick Jack , clashed with the local military commander , Juan Davis Bradburn . Their subsequent actions were instrumental in causing the May 1832 Anahuac Disturbances . According to historian William C. Davis , Bradburn " overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction " . Bradburn was forced to resign his post and flee Texas . 
 The Anahuac Disturbances coincided with a Mexican civil war . Texians aligned themselves with proponents of federalism advocating a stronger role for state governments , in opposition to a centralized government that set most policies at the national level . The federalists prevailed , and their favored general , Antonio López de Santa Anna , was elected president . In 1835 , Santa Anna began consolidating power ; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states . Travis , an ardent foe of centralism , led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender . Many Texas settlers thought Travis 's action was imprudent , and he was forced to apologize . Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest , local authorities did not enforce it . 
 Texians became increasingly discontented with the government as Santa Anna positioned himself as a dictator . In October , the Texas Revolution began and delegates appointed a provisional government . Travis was commissioned lieutenant colonel in the new regular army and asked to raise a cavalry company . He participated in the Siege of Béxar , where he proved to be " an impulsive , occasionally insubordinate , officer " . 
 By the end of 1835 , Texians had expelled all Mexican troops from Texas . Believing the war ended , many Texians resigned from the army and returned home . In January , the provisional government essentially collapsed ; despite a lack of authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches , the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith , who in turn disbanded the legislature . No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge . 
 Even as Texian governmental authority declined , rumors flew that Santa Anna would personally lead an invasion of Texas to quell the rebellion . Despite this news , Texian army strength continued to dwindle . Texas settlers were divided on whether they were fighting for independence or a return to a federalist government in Mexico . The confusion caused many settlers to remain at home or to return home . Fewer than 100 Texian soldiers remained garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Béxar ( now San Antonio , Texas ) . Their commander , James C. Neill , feared that his small force would be unable to withstand an assault by the Mexican troops . In response to Neill 's repeated requests for reinforcements , Governor Smith assigned Travis and 30 men to the Alamo ; they arrived on February 3 . Most of the Texians , including Travis , believed that any Mexican invasion was months away . 
 = = Composition of the letter = = 
 Travis assumed command of the Alamo garrison on February 11 , when Neill was granted a furlough . On February 23 , Santa Anna arrived in Béxar at the head of approximately 1500 Mexican troops . The 150 Texian soldiers were unprepared for this development . As they rushed to the Alamo , Texians quickly herded cattle into the complex and scrounged for food in nearby houses . The Mexican army initiated a siege of the Alamo and raised a blood @-@ red flag signalling no quarter . Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo 's largest cannon . 
 The first night of the siege was largely quiet . The following afternoon , Mexican artillery began firing on the Alamo . Mexican Colonel Juan Almonte wrote in his diary that the bombardment dismounted two of the Alamo 's guns , including the massive 18 @-@ pounder cannon . The Texians quickly returned both weapons to service . Shortly after , Travis wrote an open letter pleading for reinforcements from " the people of Texas & All Americans in the World " . 
 To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World : 
 Fellow citizens & compatriots — I am besieged , by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna — I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man . The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion , otherwise , the garrison are to be put to the sword , if the fort is taken — I have answered the demand with a cannon shot , & our flag still waves proudly from the walls . I shall never surrender or retreat . Then , I call on you in the name of Liberty , of patriotism & everything dear to the American character , to come to our aid , with all dispatch — The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days . If this call is neglected , I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country — Victory or Death . 
 William Barret Travis 
 Lt. Col. <unk> 
 P.S. The Lord is on our side — When the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn — We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels & got into the walls 20 or 30 head of <unk> .

 Travis entrusted the letter to courier Albert Martin , who rode through the night to cover the 70 miles ( 110 km ) to the closest town , Gonzales , as quickly as possible . During his journey , Martin added two postscripts . The first relayed Martin 's fear that the Mexican army had already attacked the Alamo and ended " Hurry on all the men you can in haste " . The second postscript is more difficult to read , as the letter was later folded along one line of text . The paper has since partially frayed along the fold , obliterating several words . The gist of the message , however , is that the men at the Alamo were " determined to do or die " , and Martin intended to gather reinforcements and return as quickly as possible . 
 In Gonzales , Martin turned the letter over to Launcelot Smithers . When the Mexican army arrived in Béxar , Smithers had immediately set out for Gonzales . Travis may have sent him as an official courier , or he may have journeyed there on his own to warn the townspeople . Smithers added his own message under Martin 's , encouraging men to gather in Gonzales to go to the relief of the Texians at the Alamo . 
 Before departing Gonzales , Smithers gave a letter to Andrew Ponton , the alcalde ( or mayor ) of the town . This second letter may have actually been the reason Smithers travelled to Gonzales , or it might have been a paraphrased version of the letter Martin had delivered . The copy read : 
 To All the Inhabitants of Texas : 
 In a few words there is 2000 Mexican soldiers in Bexar , and 150 Americans in the Alamo . Sesma is at the head of them , and from best accounts that can be obtained , they intend to show no quarter . If every man cannot turn out to a man every man in the Alamo will be murdered . 
 They have not more than 8 or 10 days provisions . They say they will defend it or die on the ground . Provisions , ammunition and Men , or suffer your men to be murdered in the Fort . If you do not turn out Texas is gone . I left Bexar on the 23rd at 4 P.M. By order of 
 W.V. [ sic ] Travis 
 L. Smithers 
 Ponton sent the Smithers copy of the letter to Colonel Henry <unk> , the commander of the Committee of Vigilance and Safety in Nacogdoches . <unk> kept the letter he received and sent a copy , with his additional comments , to Dr. John Sibley , the chairman of the Committee of Vigilance and Safety for Texas Affairs in Natchitoches , Louisiana . 
 Smithers rode hard and delivered Travis 's letter to San Felipe de Austin in fewer than 40 hours . In a hurriedly organized meeting , town leaders passed a series of resolutions pledging assistance to the Alamo defenders . The results of the meeting were printed in a broadsheet alongside a reproduction of Travis 's letter . After distributing all 200 copies of their initial print run , newspaper publishers Joseph Baker and Thomas Borden made at least four other reproductions of the letter , resulting in more than 500 additional copies . Their final printing included a message from Governor Henry Smith urging the colonists " to fly to the aid of your besieged countrymen and not permit them to be massacred by a mercenary foe . ... The call is upon ALL who are able to bear arms , to rally without one moment 's delay , or in fifteen days the heart of Texas will be the seat of war . " On March 2 , the letter was printed in the Texas Republican . It appeared in the other major Texas newspaper , the Telegraph and Texas Register , three days later . The letter was eventually reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe . 
 = = Texian response = = 
 This letter was one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo . Each carried a similar message — the Mexican army had invaded Texas , the Alamo was surrounded , and the Texians needed more men and ammunition to wage a successful defense . No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government . By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government completely ineffective , and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government . Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced . 
 Many Texas residents disagreed with the convention 's perception . As the message spread across Texas , settlers left their homes and assembled in Gonzales , where Colonel James Fannin was due to arrive with the remaining Texian Army troops . On February 27 one group of reinforcements impatiently set out on their own ; as a result 32 additional Texians entered the Alamo . Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced the Alamo on March 4 . 
 Almost all of the Texians were killed at the Battle of the Alamo when the Mexican army attacked on March 6 ; Travis was likely the first to die . Unaware that the Alamo had fallen , reinforcements continued to assemble ; over 400 Texians were waiting in Gonzales when news of the Texian defeat reached the town on March 11 . Earlier that day , General Sam Houston , newly reappointed commander of the Texian Army , had arrived in Gonzales . On hearing of the Alamo 's fall , Houston took command of the assembled volunteers . The following month , this hastily organized army defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto , ending the Texas Revolution . 
 This letter may have influenced the election of David G. Burnet as interim president of the new Republic of Texas . After reading one of the broadsheet versions of the letter , Burnet rushed to join Travis at the Alamo . After stopping at Washington @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Brazos to recruit reinforcements from the men assembled at the Convention of 1836 , Burnet became so " inspired by their deliberations " that he remained as a visitor . The convention declared independence from Mexico on March 2 , but delegates feared for the safety of the new country 's officers . Speaking privately with many of the delegates , Burnet professed his willingness to serve as president of a new republic , even if that made him a target of Santa Anna . The most popular delegates were absent from the convention on other business for the war effort . In the absence of interest in the position from most of those remaining , Burnet was nominated for president and defeated the only other candidate , Samuel Carson , by a 29 – 23 margin .

 After the Texas Revolution ended , the original draft of the letter was given to Travis 's family in Alabama . Several prominent Texians are known to have visited Travis 's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended , but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered the letter . Travis 's daughter Susan ( aged five at the time of his death ) passed the letter down to her descendants ; it eventually reached her great @-@ grandson , John G. Davidson . In February 1891 , Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture , Insurance , Statistics , and History . Two years later , Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $ 250 ( $ 6 @,@ 584 today ) . This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts , and the state was hesitant to agree . After negotiations , Davidson agreed to accept $ 85 ( $ 2 @,@ 239 today ) for the letter , and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership . 
 For many decades , the letter was publicly displayed , usually in a locked glass case with other manuscripts and artifacts from the Texas Revolution . At times , it was arranged alongside the Travis family Bible and a copy of Travis 's will . In 1909 , the letter was moved to the Texas State Library and has since left that building only twice ; it was among 143 documents loaned to the Committee on Historical Exhibits for the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936 , and it returned briefly to the site of the exposition in 1986 . The original letter is no longer on permanent display . In its place is , in the words of Michael Green , former reference archivist for the Texas State Library Archives Division , " an exacting , one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind facsimile " . Directly over its display case is a portrait of Travis . 
 Four copies of the original broadsides are known to survive . One was placed for auction in 2004 , where it was predicted to reach a price of over $ 250 @,@ 000 .

 In October 2012 , the Texas General Land Office announced plans to display the famous Travis Letter in the Alamo from February 23 to March 7 , 2013 . This will mark the first time the iconic letter has returned to the Alamo since it was written by Travis . The display was free and open to the general public . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Travis ' letter is regarded as " the most famous document in Texas history " , but its widespread distribution allowed an impact outside the relatively isolated settlements in Texas . Historians place the letter in a broader context , " as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism " or even " one of the greatest declarations of defiance in the English language " . It is rare to see a book about the Alamo or the Texas Revolution which does not quote the letter , either in full or part . The letter also appears in full in most Texas history textbooks geared towards elementary and middle school children . The postscripts , however , have rarely been printed . Despite its asserted impact , minimal scholarship exists on the letter itself . 
 Almost from the moment of his arrival in Texas , Travis had attempted to influence the war agenda in Texas . As he realized the magnitude of the opposition he faced at the Alamo , the tone of Travis 's writings shifted from perfunctory reports to the provisional government to more eloquent messages aimed at a wider audience . With limited time and opportunity to sway people to his way of thinking , Travis 's success , and perhaps his very survival , would depend on his ability to " emotionally move the people " . His previous work as a journalist likely gave him a good understanding of the type of language that would most resonate with his intended audience . Travis used this particular letter not only as a means to publicize his immediate need for reinforcements and supplies , but also to shape the debate within Texas by offering " a well @-@ crafted provocation " that might incite others to take up arms . He chose " unambiguous and defiant " language , resulting in a " very powerful " message . The letter represented an unofficial declaration of independence for Texas . Its word usage evoked the American Revolution and Patrick Henry 's famed cry of " Liberty or Death ! " 
 Critics have derided the letter for its emotionalism , noting that it appears to show " a preoccupation with romance and chivalry " not uncommon to fans of Sir Walter Scott . In particular , they point to Travis 's asserted determination to sacrifice his own life for a lost cause . 
 = It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) = 
 " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released as the final track of his 1974 album Dark Horse . Harrison was inspired to write the song while in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan , in northern India , with his friend Ravi Shankar . The composition originated on a day that Harrison describes in his autobiography as " my most fantastic experience " , during which his party and their ascetic guide toured the city 's temples . The song 's choruses were adapted from the Sanskrit chant they sang before visiting Seva Kunj , a park dedicated to Krishna 's childhood . The same pilgrimage to India led to Harrison staging Shankar 's Music Festival from India in September 1974 and undertaking a joint North American tour with Shankar at the end of that year . 
 Despite the devotional nature of the song , Harrison wrote it part @-@ way through a period of divergence from the spiritual goals he had espoused in his previous works , particularly Living in the Material World ( 1973 ) . " It Is ' He ' " serves as a rare example of an overtly religious song on Dark Horse . Recorded between August and October 1974 , the track features an unusual mix of musical styles and instrumentation – including gospel @-@ style keyboards , folk @-@ rock acoustic guitar , Indian string and percussion instruments , and Moog synthesizer . Besides Harrison , the musicians on the recording include Billy Preston , Tom Scott and Emil Richards , all of whom played in his 1974 tour band and contributed to Shankar 's concurrent release , Shankar Family & Friends . 
 " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " continued Harrison 's fusion of the Hindu bhajan tradition with Western pop and rock . The song failed to gain the favourable reception afforded his earlier productions in that style , however , such as " My Sweet Lord " , " Hare Krishna Mantra " and " Give Me Love " . With his spiritual pronouncements during the tour proving similarly unwelcome to many music critics , Harrison subsequently withdrew from making such public statements of Hindu religiosity until producing Shankar 's Chants of India album in 1996 . " It Is ' He ' " was the last overtly devotional song released under Harrison 's name until the posthumously issued " Brainwashed " in 2002 . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 In a 1994 interview held at Ravi Shankar 's home in California , George Harrison referred to the reluctance he used to feel before visiting Shankar in India or meeting with A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada , founder of the Hare Krishna movement , or more formally the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ( ISKCON ) . This was due to the " craziness " taking place in his life , Harrison continued , which sat at odds with the spiritual goals represented by these friends . In January and February 1974 , he visited India part @-@ way through a period that he describes in his autobiography , I , Me , Mine ( 1980 ) , as " the naughty years " , coinciding with the end of his marriage to Pattie Boyd . The visit led to Harrison writing two songs that would appear on his Dark Horse album later that year : " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " and " Simply Shady " . While the latter track reflected the singer 's recent indulgences with drugs and alcohol , " It Is ' He ' " documented what author Simon Leng terms " a spiritual epiphany for Harrison " in the Hindu holy city of Vrindavan . 
 Harrison went to India in 1974 to attend a ceremony in honour of Shankar 's new home , in Benares , on the banks of the River Ganges . At this time , the two musicians came up with the idea for Ravi Shankar 's Music Festival from India – a revue of Indian folk music presented by an orchestra of eighteen pioneers of the genre – and a subsequent joint tour of North America . From Benares , Harrison and Shankar then travelled across the state of Uttar Pradesh to Vrindavan , where the Hindu deity Krishna is said to have spent his childhood , thousands of years before . Discussing " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " in I , Me , Mine , Harrison recalls that they arrived there at dusk , and adds : " the whole town is Krishna conscious – everyone , everywhere was chanting ' Hare Krishna ' and various permutations on that . " 
 = = = Touring Vrindavan 's temples = = = 
 Shankar had arranged for an English @-@ speaking ascetic named Sripad Maharaj to serve as their guide on a tour of the local temples . Despite the bedraggled appearance of Maharaj , Harrison noticed that throughout the tour , <unk> and other passers @-@ by would greet the guide by kissing his feet – a sign of the utmost reverence . 
 The party slept for a few hours in rooms provided by one of the temples , during which Harrison heard " huge heavenly choirs " in his dreams and experienced " the deepest sleep I had ever had in my life " . After they had attended morning puja at this temple , at 4 am , Maharaj began singing a bhajan , a Hindu musical prayer . In the tradition of communal chanting , or kirtana , Harrison and the others there sang in response , repeating Maharaj 's lines , for a period lasting up to five hours . 
 Late that morning , Harrison and Shankar accompanied Maharaj to Seva Kunj , a park that commemorates Krishna 's love for all @-@ night dancing with his gopis ( cow @-@ herd girls ) . Harrison later marvelled of Seva Kunj : " All the trees , which are so ancient , bow down and the branches touch the ground . Just to walk in that place is incredible . " In I , Me , Mine , he describes the Vrinadavan tour as " my most fantastic experience " and says that , at Maharaj 's suggestion , he turned the bhajan into a song , titled " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " . 
 = = = Other activities in Vrindavan = = = 
 Harrison and Shankar spent a few days in the city , at the Sri Chaitanya Prema <unk> ashram , on the banks of the Yamuna River ; there , they meditated , wrote music and discussed " the art of devotion " . Harrison also met with Prabhupada at this time and reunited with ISKCON disciples Gurudas and Yamuna . The latter couple were among the founding devotees of the London Radha Krishna Temple , whose recordings of chants , including a hit version of the Hare Krishna mantra , Harrison had produced for Apple Records in 1969 – 70 . Theologian Dale Allison writes that " It Is ' He ' " resulted from Harrison having " rediscovered his enthusiasm for chanting " while in India . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Leng describes the mood of the song as " upbeat pseudo @-@ calypso " . He views it as a further example of the musical approach that Harrison employed in songs such as " My Sweet Lord " and " Give Me Love ( Give Me Peace on Earth ) " , whereby the Hindu bhajan tradition is fused with Western gospel music . The inclusion of Sanskrit verse in " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " recalls both " My Sweet Lord " , which incorporates part of the Hare Krishna mantra as well as other Hindu prayers , and " Gopala Krishna " , an unreleased track that Harrison also recorded for his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970 . 
 Over a three @-@ chord pattern in the key of G major , Harrison adapted the words sung at the Vrinadavan kirtana , in a repetitive form typical of a mantra : 
 Jai Krishna , jai Krishna Krishna 
 Jai Krishna , jai Sri Krishna 
 Jai radhé , jai radhé radhé 
 Jai radhé , jai sri radhé . 
 Aside from offering praise to Krishna , these lines address Radha , his consort and lover , whom ISKCON devotees recognise as the female form of God . The words serve as the song 's chorus and translate to mean , " All glories and praise to Lord Krishna ; all glories and praise to Goddess Radha . " 
 Similar to Harrison 's 1973 song " Living in the Material World " – where he contrasts the Western or " material " parts of the composition with its meditative , " spiritual sky " sections – " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " employs a change in tempo and rhythm , to differentiate between the Sanskrit choruses and the English @-@ language verses . Lyrically , the latter sections outline the " It Is ' He ' " element of the song title . In the first of the three verses , Harrison sings of his deity as " He whose eyes have seen / What our lives have been / And who we really are " ; in the final verse , the description is : " He who is complete / Three worlds at His feet / Cause of every star ... 
 = = Recording = = 
 Throughout 1974 , progress on Dark Horse was compromised by Harrison 's commitment to setting up a new record label , also called Dark Horse , and his dedication to projects by the label 's first signings , Shankar and the English duo Splinter . With expectations high for his North American tour , the first by a former member of the Beatles , Harrison later referred to the pressure he had imposed on himself that year as " ridiculous " . As a further distraction , his return to less ascetic ways post @-@ Vrinadavan was marked by what he termed " a bit of a bender to make up for all the years I 'd been married " , as Boyd left him in July . 
 Harrison taped an early version of " It Is ' He ' " at his Friar Park studio , FPSHOT , in Oxfordshire , with Bobby Purvis and Bill Elliott of Splinter on backing vocals . On the officially released recording , he was backed by members of his 1974 tour band , including Tom Scott ( flute ) , Billy Preston ( piano , organ ) , Willie Weeks ( bass ) and Andy Newmark ( drums ) . These four American musicians attended the main sessions for Dark Horse , which took place at FPSHOT over August – September , in between rehearsals there for the Music Festival of India 's tour of Europe and the recording of a studio album by Shankar 's ensemble , which Harrison also produced . Harrison 's own contributions to the track included 12 @-@ string acoustic guitar and Moog synthesizer . 
 In October , with his album still unfinished , Harrison flew to Los Angeles , California , where he rehearsed with his musicians and Shankar 's orchestra for the upcoming tour , while carrying out further recording at A & M Studios . As additional members of the tour band , Jim Horn and Chuck Findley played flutes on " It Is ' He ' " and Emil Richards overdubbed percussion . 
 The completed recording features a mix of musical styles , with the R & B @-@ funk rhythm section of Weeks and Newmark , gospel keyboards from Preston , and Richards ' <unk> recalling pre @-@ rock ' n ' roll skiffle . Aside from the Western instrumentation he supplied on " It Is ' He ' " , Harrison provided Indian music textures through his use of the gut @-@ stringed gubgubbi – described by Leng as a " banjo @-@ meets @-@ vocal sound " – as well as small hand @-@ cymbals ( or <unk> ) , commonly played by Hare Krishna devotees during kirtana . In addition , according to Leng , the flute parts serve as a musical reference to Krishna , who is often shown playing a flute in scenes depicting his Lila ( pastimes ) in Vrindavan . 
 Already suffering from laryngitis , Harrison overtaxed his voice during the weeks of combined recording and rehearsals in Los Angeles , and his hoarse singing would doom his subsequent concerts in the eyes of many observers . Alone among the tracks on Dark Horse , however , " It Is ' He ' " contains a lead vocal that is relatively clean and free of the effects of laryngitis . 
 = = Release = = 
 Dark Horse was issued on 9 December 1974 , towards the end of Harrison and Shankar 's North American tour , with a UK release following on 20 December . The concerts had attracted scorn from many music critics , partly because of Harrison 's decision to feature Indian music so heavily in the program and his frequent statements regarding his Hindu faith . " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " appeared as the final track on Dark Horse , sequenced after " Far East Man " , a song that Harrison biographers interpret variously as a tribute to Shankar and India , and a reaffirmation of the humanitarian goals represented by Harrison and Shankar 's Bangladesh aid project . 
 In contrast with Living in the Material World in 1973 , " It Is ' He ' " was the sole example of a devotional song on the album . Leng considers that Dark Horse coincided with " a crisis of faith " on Harrison 's part and that , amid confessionals dealing with the singer 's troubled personal life and rock @-@ star excess , the track was " almost a reminder to himself of golden days in India , when he felt comforted by belief " . 
 While he identifies a level of religiosity in other songs on Dark Horse , Allison pairs the album with Material World as works that " literally wear their Hinduism on their record sleeves " . The front cover of Dark Horse includes a Himalayan landscape , above which floats the Nath Tradition yogi Shiv @-@ Goraksha Babaji , while the phrase " All glories to Sri Krsna " appears on the back cover . Among his handwritten notes on the LP 's inner sleeve , Harrison included Sripad Maharaj 's name in a list headed " Thanks to " . The song was published by Oops Publishing ( or Ganga in the United States ) , the new company that Harrison founded in March 1974 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Like the North American tour , Dark Horse was much maligned on release . According to Simon Leng , Harrison 's rejection of rock ' n ' roll tradition and the Beatles ' legacy during the tour was the cause for the album 's unfavourable critical reception ; in the case of " It Is ' He ' " , Leng continues , this manifested as " outright hostility " from some reviewers , who saw it as " one Krishna <unk> too many " . Bob Woffinden of the NME wrote : " You keep looking for saving graces [ on the album ] , for words of enthusiasm to pass on ... Tracks like ' It Is HE ( Jai Sri Krishna ) ' are more typical . There , the endless repetition of ' Jai Sri <unk> , Jai Sri <unk> ' over an enfeebled tune is hardly compelling listening . " Writing for Rolling Stone , Jim Miller opined : " [ Harrison 's ] religiosity , once a spacey bauble in the Beatles ' panoply , has come to resemble the obsessiveness of a zealot . " In a more favourable review , Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker called the song " a bit of a <unk> " and credited Harrison with the creation of " a new category in music – Country and Eastern " . 
 The song has invited varied opinions among Harrison and Beatles biographers . In their book Eight Arms to Hold You , Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as " an inauspicious ending to a half @-@ baked LP " . Ian Inglis describes the deceleration into half @-@ time during the verses as " awkward " and notes the failure of " It Is ' He ' " next to Harrison 's earlier successes with " My Sweet Lord " and " Hare Krishna Mantra " . Inglis concludes : " The gently floating Indian [ choruses ] are somewhat undermined by the ponderous nature of the rock @-@ oriented interludes , and the evangelical nature of the English words – ' he who is complete ' – finally discourage any attempt at participation . " Author Elliot Huntley describes the song as " Krishna @-@ consciousness psychobabble " , with a refrain that is " repeated ad nauseam " . Writing in The Rough Guide to the Beatles , Chris Ingham views the track as " George at his happy @-@ clappy nadir " and pairs it with " Ding Dong , Ding Dong " , which Harrison released as a hoped @-@ for Christmas – New Year hit in the UK , as " two of the worst songs he ever allowed out " . 
 While also commenting on the underachieving " Ding Dong " single , Alan Clayson writes : " Despite its non @-@ Christian slant , George might have fared better with the wonderful ' It Is " He " ( Jai Sri Krishna ) ' ... [ The ] repeated chorus was so uplifting that it scarcely mattered that it was sung ( without laryngitis ) entirely in Hindi – no more , anyway , than McCartney breaking into French on ' Michelle ' off Rubber Soul . " Robert Rodriguez rates " It Is ' He ' " among Harrison 's most overlooked tracks from the 1970s and describes it as " a joyful delight " and " unrelentingly calming yet catchy " . Leng notes the song as a continuation of Harrison 's successful bhajan – gospel " formula " , now rendered as " Krishna skiffle " and set in a " Kashmiri party atmosphere " . Leng views " It Is ' He ' " as " charming " and credits Harrison with anticipating the late 1980s world music genre , through his ethnomusicologist 's adoption of the Bengali gubgubbi , or <unk> . 
 In a review of the 2014 reissue of Dark Horse , for Paste magazine , Robert Ham cited the song as a highlight of the album , writing : " The giddy ' Is It " He " ( Jai Sri Krishna ) ' ... is a joyous affirmation of [ Harrison 's ] spiritual beliefs that mashes up many of his musical interests , with Indian instruments finding consort with rambling English folk and R & B horn stabs . " Blogcritics ' Chaz Lipp identified " a lot of rewarding listening [ on Dark Horse ] for those willing to listen with an open mind " , among which , he continues : " ' Far East Man ' is a smooth soul collaboration with Ron Wood that , once heard , lodges itself in the brain . Even catchier is the closing track , ' It Is " He " ( Jai Sri Krishna ) . ' " 
 = = Aftermath and legacy = = 
 First published in August 1980 , I , Me , Mine contains two pages of description from Harrison on Vrindavan and the story behind " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " . This coverage contrasts with little discussion of his years as a member of the Beatles , and typically brief commentary on each of his songs . In the book , Harrison dedicates " It Is ' He ' " to Sripad Maharaj , whom he describes as " a wonderful , humble , Holy man " . 
 After 1974 , Harrison no longer wrote songs as obviously Krishna @-@ devotional as " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " , although he returned to recording bhajans intermittently , with songs such as " Dear One " in 1976 and " Life Itself , released in 1981 . In his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West , Peter Lavezzoli writes that following Dark Horse and the " ill @-@ fated 1974 tour " , Harrison " continued to infuse his work with an implicit spirituality that rarely manifested on the surface " . Speaking to ISKCON devotee Mukunda Goswami in 1982 , Harrison said : 
 Back in the sixties , whatever we were all getting into , we tended to broadcast it as loud as we could . I had had certain realizations and went through a period where I was so thrilled about my discoveries and realizations that I wanted to shout and tell it to everybody . But there 's a time to shout it out and a time not to shout it out . 
 Having distanced himself from the Hare Krishna movement after Prabhupada 's death in 1977 and through the 1980s , Harrison returned to Vrindavan with Mukunda and other devotees in 1996 , while in India working on Shankar 's album Chants of India . Leng views the latter project as Harrison returning to the musical statements of his Radha Krishna Temple recordings and " It Is ' He ' ( Jai Sri Krishna ) " . During the Friar Park sessions for Chants of India , Harrison taped the Indian music portions of his song " Brainwashed " , which ends with the Sanskrit prayer " Namah Parvati " . Dale Allison comments that it was not until the release of this chanted mantra , issued posthumously in 2002 , that Harrison again made such an " explicit statement " of Hindu religiosity as he had on " It Is ' He ' " .
