 = Monarchies in Europe = 
 There are currently thirteen ( 13 ) sovereign monarchies in Europe : the Principality of Andorra , the Kingdom of Belgium , the Kingdom of Denmark , the Principality of Liechtenstein , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , the Principality of Monaco , the Kingdom of the Netherlands , the Kingdom of Norway , the Kingdom of Spain , the Kingdom of Sweden , the Sovereign Military Order of Malta , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the State of the Vatican City . Ten of these are states where the head of state ( a monarch ) inherits his or her office , and usually keeps it for life or until they abdicate . As for the other two : in the Vatican City ( an elective monarchy , styled as an absolute theocracy ) , the head of state , the Sovereign ( who is a Pope ) , is elected at the papal conclave , while in Andorra ( technically a semi @-@ elective diarchy ) , the joint heads of state are the elected President of France and the Bishop of <unk> , appointed by the Pope . 
 Most of the monarchies in Europe are constitutional monarchies , which means that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state : either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so , or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by convention . The exceptions are Liechtenstein , which is usually considered a semi @-@ constitutional monarchy due to the large influence the prince still has on politics , and the Vatican City , which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy . There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy ( see monarchism and republicanism ) in any of the twelve states , although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them ( e.g. the political organisation Republic in the United Kingdom ) . Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union : Belgium , Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and the United Kingdom . 
 At the start of the 20th century , France , Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government . The ascent of republicanism to the political mainstream started only at the beginning of the 20th century , facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution ; as at the beginning of the 21st century , most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state .

 Europe 's monarchs 
 = = = Andorra = = = 
 Andorra has been a co @-@ principality since the signing of a <unk> in 1278 , when the count of Foix and the bishop of La Seu d 'Urgell agreed to share sovereignty over the landlocked country . After the title of the count of Foix had been passed to the kings of Navarre , and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France , an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to the count of Foix in regard to the <unk> . Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812 – 1813 . After the Empire 's demise , Andorra became independent again . The current joint monarchs are Bishop Joan Enric Vives <unk> and President François Hollande of France . 
 = = = Belgium = = = 
 Belgium has been a kingdom since 21 July 1831 without interruption , after it became independent from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands with Léopold I as its first king . Belgium is the only remaining popular monarchy in the world : The monarch is formally known as the " King of the Belgians " , not the " King of Belgium " . While in a referendum held on 12 March 1950 , 57 @.@ 68 per cent of the Belgians voted in favor of allowing Léopold III , whose conduct during World War II had been considered questionable and who had been accused of treason , to return to the throne ; due to civil unrest , he opted to abdicate in favor of his son Baudouin I on 16 July 1951 . The current monarch is Philippe . 
 = = = Denmark = = = 
 In Denmark , the monarchy goes back to the prehistoric times of the legendary kings , before the 10th century . Currently , about 80 per cent support keeping the monarchy . The current monarch is Margrethe II . The Danish monarchy also includes the Faroe Islands and Greenland which are parts of the Kingdom of Denmark with internal home rule . Due to this status , the monarch has no separate title for these regions . 
 = = = Liechtenstein = = = 
 Liechtenstein formally came into existence on 23 January 1719 , when Charles VI , Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the <unk> of Vaduz united and raised to the dignity of a principality . Liechtenstein was a part of the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805 ; this marked Liechtenstein 's formal independence , though it was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards . While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria @-@ Hungary until World War I , it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead . Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921 , Hans @-@ Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein 's politics in the early 21st century , which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003 , effectively making Liechtenstein a semi @-@ constitutional monarchy again . However , the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely . The current monarch is Hans @-@ Adam II , who turned over the day @-@ to @-@ day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois , Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein on 15 August 2004 . 
 = = = Luxembourg = = = 
 Luxembourg has been an independent grand duchy since 9 June 1815 . Originally , Luxembourg was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890 . While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands , this was not possible in Luxembourg due to the order of succession being based on Salic law at that time ; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe . In a referendum held on 28 September 1919 , 80 @.@ 34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy . The current monarch is Henri . 
 = = = Monaco = = = 
 Monaco has been ruled by the House of Grimaldi since 1297 . From 1793 until 1814 , Monaco was under French control ; the Congress of Vienna designated Monaco as being a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1815 until 1860 , when the Treaty of Turin ceded the surrounding counties of Nice and Savoy to France . Menton and Roquebrune @-@ Cap @-@ Martin , part of Monaco until the mid @-@ 19th century before seceding in hopes of being annexed by Sardinia , were ceded to France in exchange for 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 French francs with the Franco @-@ Monegasque Treaty in 1861 , which also formally guaranteed Monaco its independence . Until 2002 , Monaco would have become part of France had the house of Grimaldi ever died out ; in a treaty signed that year , the two nations agreed that Monaco would remain independent even in such a case . The current monarch is Albert II . 
 = = = Netherlands = = = 
 The Netherlands originally became independent as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands , which lasted from 26 July 1581 until 18 January 1795 , when the Netherlands became a French puppet state as the Batavian Republic . The Batavian Republic existed from 19 January 1795 until 4 June 1806 . It was transformed into the Kingdom of Holland on 5 June 1806 ; since then , the Netherlands have been a kingdom . They were subsequently annexed to the French Empire in 1810 . The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was established on 16 March 1815 . With the independence of Belgium on 21 July 1831 , the Netherlands again took a new form , as the Kingdom of the Netherlands . Nowadays , about 70 to 80 per cent of the Dutch are in favor of keeping the monarchy . The current monarch is Willem @-@ Alexander . 
 = = = Norway = = = 
 Norway was united and independent for the first time in 872 , as a kingdom . It is thus one of the oldest monarchies in the world , along with the Swedish and Danish ones . Norway was part of the Kalmar Union from 1397 until 1524 , then part of Denmark – Norway from 1536 until 1814 , and finally part of the Union between Sweden and Norway from 1814 until 1905 . Norway became completely independent again on 7 June 1905 . Support for establishing a republic lies around 20 per cent . The current monarch is Harald V. 
 = = = Spain = = = 
 Spain came into existence as a single , united kingdom under Charles I of Spain on 23 January 1516 . The monarchy was briefly abolished by the First Spanish Republic from 11 February 1873 until 29 December 1874 . The monarchy was abolished again on 14 April 1931 , first by the Second Spanish Republic – which lasted until 1 April 1939 – and subsequently by the dictatorship of Francisco Franco , who ruled until his death on 20 November 1975 . Monarchy was restored on 22 November 1975 under Juan Carlos I , who was also the monarch until is abdication in 2014 . His son Felipe VI is the current monarch . Today , there is a large number of organisations campaigning in favor of establishing a Third Spanish Republic ; Data from 2006 suggest that only 25 per cent of Spaniards are in favor of establishing a republic , however , the numbers have increased since Juan Carlos I abdicated . 
 = = = Sweden = = = 
 Sweden ’ s monarchy goes back as far as the Danish one , to the semi – legendary kings before the 10th century , since then it has not been interrupted . However , the unification of the rivalling kingdoms Svealand and Götaland ( consolidation of Sweden ) did not occur until some time later , possibly in the early 11th century . The current royal family , the House of Bernadotte , has reigned since 1818 . The current monarch is Carl XVI Gustaf . 
 = = = United Kingdom = = = 
 The monarchy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland can be defined to have started either with the Kingdoms of England ( 871 ) or Scotland ( 843 ) , with the Union of the Crowns on 24 March 1603 , or with the Acts of Union of 1 May 1707 . It was briefly interrupted by the English Interregnum , with the Commonwealth of England existing in its stead from 30 January 1649 until 15 December 1653 and from 26 May 1659 until 25 May 1660 and The Protectorate taking its place from 16 December 1653 until 25 May 1659 . The current monarch is Elizabeth II . 
 Support for establishing a republic instead of a monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006 , while a majority thinks that there will still be a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years ' time , public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist a century after the poll . Public opinion is , however , certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years . About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth 's death . 
 The monarch of the United Kingdom is also the monarch of the fifteen other Commonwealth realms , none of which are in Europe . Some of these realms have significant levels of support for republicanism . 
 = = = Vatican City = = = 
 <unk> from the Holy See , in existence for almost two thousand years , the Vatican City was not a sovereign state until the 20th century . In the 19th century the annexation of the Papal States by the Kingdom of Sardinia , and the subsequent establishment of the Kingdom of Italy , was not recognized by the Vatican . However , by the Lateran Treaty of 1929 , the Kingdom of Italy recognized Vatican City as an independent city state , and vice versa . Since then , the elected monarch of the Vatican City state has been the current pope . The pope still officially carries the title " King of the Ecclesiastical State " ( in Latin : Rex Status <unk> ) . 
 = = Succession laws = = 
 The succession order is determined by primogeniture in most European monarchies . Belgium , Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Sweden and the United Kingdom now adhere to absolute primogeniture , whereby the eldest child inherits the throne , regardless of gender ; Monaco and Spain have the older system of male @-@ preference primogeniture , while Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture . Norway will adopt absolute primogeniture for the grandchildren of King Harald V , but his second child and only son , Crown Prince Haakon remains the heir apparent over his older sister , Princess Märtha Louise . 
 There are plans to change to absolute primogeniture in Spain through a rather complicated process , as the change entails a constitutional amendment . Two successive parliaments will have to pass the law by a two @-@ thirds majority and then put it to a referendum . As parliament has to be dissolved and new elections have to be called after the constitutional amendment is passed for the first time , the previous Presidente del Gobierno José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero indicated he would wait until the end of his first term in 2008 before passing the law , although this deadline passed without the referendum being called . The amendment enjoys strong public support . 
 To change the order of succession in the United Kingdom , as the Queen of the United Kingdom is also the queen of the fifteen other Commonwealth realms , a change had to be agreed and made by all of the Commonwealth realms together . In the United Kingdom , the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 was enacted , and after completion of the legislative alterations required in some other realms , the changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015 . 
 Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture ( aka Salic law ) , which completely excludes women from the order of succession unless there are no male heirs of any kind present , and was criticised for this by a United Nations committee for this perceived gender equality issue in November 2007 . 
 The co @-@ princes of Andorra are elected and appointed ( the president of the French Republic , and the Bishop of La Seu d 'Urgell ( appointed by the Pope ) , respectively ) . 
 The absolute monarch of Vatican City , the Pope , is elected by the College of Cardinals . The current ruler is Pope Francis . 
 Luxembourg also used agnatic primogeniture until 20 June 2011 , when absolute primogeniture was introduced .

 = = Calls for abolition = = 
 Due to the ongoing economic crisis in Europe beginning in 2008 , the value of monarchies , and especially of the civil lists or appanages allocated to some members of reigning families ( not just the sovereign and consort ) have come under increased scrutiny by members of the citizenry . Some taxpayers object to these endowments , in their entirety or in part , as in some cases members of dynasties draw hundreds of thousands or millions of euros from national coffers per year , depending on the family member in question . Others express concern that during a period of rising inequality of wealth and , in some cases , growing poverty , royalty should receive no allowances , accept cuts , or pay increased taxes . 
 Organisations which actively campaign to eliminate one or more of Europe 's ten remaining hereditary constitutional monarchies and / or to liquidate assets reserved for reigning families , include Alliance of European Republican Movements , Republic in the United Kingdom and <unk> . Also , some political parties ( e.g. <unk> in Spain ) have stepped up and called for national referenda to abolish monarchies .

 = HMS Cambrian ( 1916 ) = 
 HMS Cambrian was a C @-@ class light cruiser built for the Royal Navy during World War I. She was the name ship of her sub @-@ class of four ships . Assigned to the Grand Fleet , the ship played only a small role during the war . Cambrian was assigned to the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleets during the 1920s and was sent to support British interests in Turkey during the Chanak Crisis of 1922 – 23 . The ship was placed in reserve in late 1929 . She was sold for scrap in 1934 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The C @-@ class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range . Ordered as part of the 1914 – 15 Naval Programme , the Cambrian sub @-@ class were a slightly larger and improved version of the preceding Calliope sub @-@ class ; Cambrian , the last ship of her sub @-@ class to be completed , differed from her sister ships as she had a more powerful armament . The ships were 446 feet ( 135 @.@ 9 m ) long overall , with a beam of 41 feet 6 inches ( 12 @.@ 6 m ) and a mean draught of 14 feet 10 inches ( 4 @.@ 5 m ) . Displacement was 4 @,@ 320 long tons ( 4 @,@ 390 t ) at normal and 4 @,@ 799 long tons ( 4 @,@ 876 t ) at deep load . Cambrian was powered by four direct @-@ drive Parsons steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , which produced a total of 40 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) . The turbines used steam generated by six Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) . She carried 841 long tons ( 854 t ) tons of fuel oil . The ship had a crew of 368 officers and other ranks . 
 Cambrian 's main armament consisted of three BL 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline . One gun was forward of the bridge and the last two were in the stern , with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun . Her secondary armament consisted of six QF 4 in ( 102 mm ) Mk IV guns , three on each side , one pair abaft the bridge on the forecastle deck and the other two pairs one deck lower amidships . For anti @-@ aircraft defence , she was fitted with one QF 4 in ( 102 mm ) Mk V gun . The ship also mounted two submerged 21 in ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . The <unk> were protected by a waterline belt amidships that ranged in thickness from 1 @.@ 5 – 3 inches ( 38 – 76 mm ) with a 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) deck . The walls of their conning tower were 6 inches thick . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 During 1917 – 18 , her pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director . In January 1919 , Cambrian had her 4 @-@ inch guns removed and an additional 6 @-@ inch gun added abaft the funnels . At the same time , her AA gun was replaced by a pair of QF 3 in ( 76 mm ) 20 @-@ cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns . Sometime between 1919 and 1924 the ship received a pair of 2 @-@ pounder ( 40 mm ) Mk II " pom @-@ pom " guns on single mounts . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Cambrian , the fourth ship of her name in the Royal Navy , was laid down by Pembroke Dockyard in Pembroke Dock , Wales , on 8 December 1914 , launched on 3 March 1916 , and completed in May 1916 . She was commissioned into service that same month and was assigned to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet in which she served through the end of World War I and until 1919 . The squadron was generally tasked with screening the battleships of the Grand Fleet during the war . The ship did not participate in the inconclusive Action of 19 August 1916 with the rest of her squadron . The squadron was briefly detached from the Grand Fleet in March 1917 to fruitlessly patrol off the Norwegian coast when news of a blockade runner was received by the Admiralty . 
 At the beginning of 1919 , Cambrian was refitted in Rosyth before she sailed for Devonport where she was visited by the Edward , Prince of Wales on 13 June . The ship was assigned to the North American and West Indies Station the following month , where she served until 1922 . Cambrian 's crew spent several days in August trying to tow off the schooner Bella Scott after she had run aground near Kingston , Jamaica and received a brief refit in Bermuda in March – April 1920 . The Prince of Wales again visited the ship on 26 September in Dominica . On 25 January 1921 , she was inspected by Vice @-@ Admiral Sir William Pakenham at Bermuda and again on 17 June . The ship arrived at Plymouth , Massachusetts to participate in the Pilgrim Tercentenary celebrations on 31 July . 
 She was part of the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet from August 1922 until June 1924 , and was detached to support British interests during the Chanak Crisis of 1922 – 23 . She escorted the seaplane carrier Ark Royal from the UK to Turkey from 27 September to 8 October and was later guard ship at Smyrna in December . 
 The ship was decommissioned in June 1924 and began a refit that lasted into 1926 , during which her aft control tower and searchlight platform was removed , when she was recommissioned to serve in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet where she participated in a fleet exercise in March 1929 . After transporting troops to China in 1929 , she was decommissioned in November 1929 and assigned to the Nore Reserve . She was recommissioned as the flagship of the Nore Reserve in March 1931 and was then decommissioned in July 1933 at Sheerness and listed for sale . Cambrian was sold for scrap on 28 July 1934 . 
 = Usama ibn Munqidh = 
 Majd ad @-@ Dīn <unk> ibn Murshid ibn ʿAlī ibn Munqidh al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Kalbi ( also Usamah , <unk> , etc . ; Arabic : <unk> بن <unk> ) ( July 4 , 1095 – November 17 , 1188 ) was a medieval Muslim poet , author , <unk> ( knight ) , and diplomat from the Banu Munqidh dynasty of Shaizar in northern Syria . His life coincided with the rise of several medieval Muslim dynasties , the arrival of the First Crusade , and the establishment of the crusader states . 
 He was the nephew and potential successor of the emir of Shaizar , but was exiled in 1131 and spent the rest of his life serving other leaders . He was a courtier to the Burids , Zengids , and Ayyubids in Damascus , serving the Zengi , Nur ad @-@ Din , and Saladin over a period of almost fifty years . He also served the Fatimid court in Cairo , as well as the Artuqids in Hisn Kayfa . He travelled extensively in Arab lands , visiting Egypt , Syria , Palestine and along the Tigris River , and went on pilgrimage to Mecca . He often meddled in the politics of the courts in which he served , and he was exiled from both Damascus and Cairo . 
 During and immediately after his life , he was most famous as a poet and <unk> ( a " man of letters " ) . He wrote many poetry anthologies , such as the Kitab al- ' Asa ( " Book of the Staff " ) , Lubab al @-@ Adab ( " Kernels of Refinement " ) , and al @-@ Manazil wa 'l @-@ Diyar ( " Dwellings and Abodes " ) , and collections of his own original poetry . In modern times , he is remembered more for his Kitab al @-@ I 'tibar ( " Book of Learning by Example " or " Book of Contemplation " ) , which contains lengthy descriptions of the crusaders , whom he interacted with on many occasions , and some of whom he considered friends . 
 Most of his family was killed in an earthquake at Shaizar in 1157 . He died in Damascus in 1188 , at the age of 93 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Usama was the son of Murshid , and the nephew of Nasr , emir of Shaizar . 
 Shaizar was seen as a strategically important site and the gateway to enter and control inner Syria . The Arabs initially conquered Shaizar during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637 . Due to its importance it exchanged hands numerous times between the Arabs and Byzantines , who regained it in 999 . In 1025 the Banu <unk> tribe were given an allocation of land beside Shaizar by the ruler of Hama , Saleh al @-@ <unk> . Over time they expanded their lands building fortifications and castles until <unk> grandfather Iz Al @-@ Dawlah Al @-@ <unk> Nasr retook it in 1180 . 
 When Nasr died in 1098 , Usama 's father , Majd Al @-@ Deen Abi <unk> Murshed ( <unk> 1137 ) became the emir of Shaizar and the surrounding cities . However he soon gave up his position to Usama 's Uncle ( Iz Al @-@ Deen Abi Al @-@ <unk> Sultan <unk> ) , Sultan , since Murshid was more interested in studying religion , writing the Quraan and hunting than matters of politics . 
 During <unk> life and when his uncle ruled <unk> was attacked numerous times by Bani <unk> in Aleppo , the Assassins sect , the Byzantines and the crusaders . It was struck with siege engines for 10 days in 1137 by the Byzantines and the crusaders attempted on many occasions to storm it . However , due to its natural fortifications along with castles and walls it never fell . 
 As a child , Usama was the second of four boys and raised by his nurse , Lu 'lu 'a , who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama 's own children . He was encouraged by his father to memorize the Qur 'an , and was also tutored by scholars such as Ibn <unk> of <unk> and Abu Abdullah al @-@ <unk> of Toledo . He spent much of his youth hunting with his family , partly as recreation and certainly as warrior ( <unk> ) training for battle as part of <unk> . He also had much direct experience of battle , against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch , hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama , Homs , and elsewhere , and <unk> who had established a base near Shaizar . 
 Sultan did not initially have any male heirs and it is possible that Usama expected to succeed him . He certainly singled him out among his brothers by teaching him , tutoring him in the ways of war and hunting . He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative . However , after Sultan had his own son , he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid 's other sons . According to Usama , Sultan was jealous after a particularly successful lion @-@ hunt in 1131 when he entered the town with a large lion head in his arms as a hunting trophy . When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect this could have on his uncle . However , despite this he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions . Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129 and after his father died in 1137 his exile became permanent . 
 His uncle died in 1154 and his son , Taj Al @-@ Dawlah Naser Al @-@ Deen Mohammad , inherited the castle . However he was the last of the line when an earthquake in 1157 struck the area killing scores . 
 = = Damascus and Egypt = = 
 Usama went to Homs , where he was taken captive in a battle against Zengi , the atabeg of Mosul and Aleppo , who had just captured nearby Hama . After his capture he entered Zengi 's service , and travelled throughout northern Syria , Iraq , and Armenia fighting against Zengi 's enemies , including the Abbasid caliph outside Baghdad in 1132 . In 1135 he returned to the south , to Hama , where one of Zengi 's generals , al @-@ <unk> , was appointed governor . He returned to Shaizar when his father died in May 1137 , and again in April 1138 when Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus besieged the city . 
 The emperor 's siege of Shaizar was unsuccessful , but Shaizar was heavily damaged . After the siege , Usama left Zengi 's service and went to Damascus , which was ruled by Mu 'in ad @-@ Din Unur , the atabeg of the Burid dynasty . Zengi was determined to conquer Damascus , so Usama and Unur turned to the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem for help . Usama was sent on a preliminary visit to Jerusalem in 1138 , and in 1139 Zengi captured Baalbek in Damascene territory . In 1140 Unur sent Usama back to Jerusalem to conclude a treaty with the crusaders , and both he and Unur visited their new allies numerous times between 1140 and 1143 . Afterwards , Usama was suspected of being involved in a plot against Unur , and he fled Damascus for Fatimid Cairo in November , 1144 . 
 In Cairo he became a wealthy courtier , but he was involved in plots and conspiracies there as well . The young az @-@ Zafir became caliph in 1149 , and Ibn as @-@ Sallar became vizier , with Usama as one of his advisors . As @-@ Sallar sent Usama to negotiate an alliance against the crusaders with Zengi 's son Nur ad @-@ Din , but the negotiations failed . Usama took part in battles with the crusaders outside of Ascalon on his way back to Egypt , and after he left , his brother ' Ali was killed at Gaza . 
 Back in Egypt , as @-@ Sallar was assassinated in 1153 by his son Abbas , Abbas 's son Nasr , and caliph az @-@ Zafir , who , according to Usama , was Nasr 's lover . Thirteenth @-@ century historian Ibn al @-@ Athir says that Usama was the instigator of this plot . Usama may also have been behind the assassination of az @-@ Zafir by Abbas , in 1154 . Az @-@ Zafir 's relatives called upon a supporter , Ibn <unk> , who chased Abbas out of Cairo , and Usama followed him . He lost his possessions in Cairo , and on the way to Damascus his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads , but in June 1154 he safely reached Damascus , which had recently been captured by Nur ad @-@ Din . Ibn <unk> tried to persuade him to come back , as the rest of his family was still in Cairo , but Usama was able to bring them to Damascus , through crusader territory , in 1156 . The crusaders promised to transport them safely , but they were attacked and pillaged , and Usama lost his entire library . 
 = = Later years = = 
 In 1157 , Shaizar was destroyed by an earthquake , killing almost all of Usama 's relatives . They were there for the circumcision of the son of his cousin Muhammad , who had recently succeeded Sultan as emir . The only survivor was Muhammad 's wife . Usama had remained in Damascus , and after the destruction of his homeland he remained there in semi @-@ retirement . He went on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1160 , then went on campaign against the crusaders with Nur ad @-@ Din in 1162 , and was at the Battle of Harim in 1164 . That year , Usama left Nur ad @-@ Din 's service and went north to the court of Kara Arslan , the <unk> emir of Hisn Kayfa . 
 Usama 's life in Hisn Kayfa is very obscure , but he travelled throughout the region , and probably wrote many of his works there . In 1174 Usama was invited to Damascus to serve Saladin , who had succeeded Nur ad @-@ Din earlier that year and was a friend of Usama 's son <unk> . Usama lived in semi @-@ retirement , as he did in Hisn Kayfa , and often met with Saladin to discuss literature and warfare . He may have also taught poetry and hadith in Damascus , and held poetry salons for Saladin and his chief men , including al @-@ Qadi al @-@ Fadl and Imad ad @-@ Din al @-@ Isfahani . He died on November 17 , 1188 . He was buried in Damascus on Mount <unk> , although the tomb is now lost . 
 = = Family = = 
 Usama had three brothers , Muhammad , ' Ali , and Munqidh ; his cousin , also named Muhammad , succeeded Usama 's uncle Sultan as emir of Shaizar . He had a son , <unk> , in 1126 , and another son , Abu Bakr , who died as a child . He had a daughter , Umm <unk> , in Hisn Kayfa in 1166 . He mentions other children , but their names , and the name of his wife or wives , are unknown . 
 The picture he painted of his father was of a pious religious man who was not interested in the affairs of this world . He would spend most of his time reading the Quraan , fasting and hunting during the day and at night would copy the Quraan . He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al <unk> . 
 = = Religion = = 
 It is sometimes assumed that Usama was Shi 'ite , because he often writes about ' Ali , his family cooperated with the Fatimids and other Shi 'ite dynasties , and he himself served the Fatimids in Egypt . Philip K. Hitti thought he had a " secret sympathy " with the Shi 'ites . Paul M. Cobb does not think there is enough evidence one way or the other , but believes he was probably Sunni with " acceptable Shi 'ite tendencies . " Robert Irwin thinks the Banu Munqidh were Twelver Shi 'ites ( unlike the Fatimids who were <unk> ) , and that another clue to Usama 's Shi 'ism is his dislike of jihad , which was not a Shi 'ite doctrine . Usama also admired Christian monks and holy men , and was disturbed that Muslims were not as pious as Christians . He was very fond of Sufis when he first learned about them late in his life in Damascus . 
 = = Works = = 
 Around 1171 in Hisn Kayfa , Usama wrote the Kitab al- ' Asa ( " Book of the Staff " ) , a poetry anthology about famous walking sticks and other staffs , and al @-@ Manazil wa 'l @-@ Diyar ( " Dwellings and Abodes " ) . In Damascus in the early 1180s he wrote another anthology , the Lubab al @-@ Adab ( " Kernels of Refinement " ) , instructions on living a properly cultured life . He is most famous for the Kitab al @-@ I 'tibar ( translated various ways , most recently as the Book of Contemplation ) , which was written as a gift to Saladin around 1183 . It is not exactly a " memoir " , as Philip Hitti translated the title , although it does include many autobiographical details that are incidental to the main point . It was meant to be " a book of examples ( ' <unk> ) from which to draw lessons . " 
 In 1880 , Hartwig Derenbourg was the first to discover the Kitab al @-@ I 'tibar , which survived in only one manuscript , in the possession of the Escorial Monastery near Madrid . Derenbourg was also the first to produce an Arabic edition ( 1886 ) , a biography of Usama ( 1889 ) , and a French translation ( 1895 ) . In 1930 , Hitti produced an improved Arabic edition , and an English translation . Qasim as @-@ <unk> produced another Arabic edition in 1987 . 
 Usama wrote in " Middle Arabic " , a less formal style of classical Arabic . 
 = = Reputation = = 
 Usama was known for meddling in the business of others , rather than commanding any power of his own . As the Encyclopaedia of Islam says , " his career was a troubled one , and for this his own actions were surely responsible in large part . " 
 To contemporary and later medieval Muslims , however , he was best remembered for his poetry and his poetry anthologies . Ibn Khallikan , author of a fourteenth @-@ century biographical dictionary , calls him " one of the most powerful , learned , and intrepid members of the [ Munqidh ] family " and speaks at great length about his poetry . 
 He was also known for his military and hunting exploits . Ibn al @-@ Athir described him as " the ultimate of bravery " , regarding his presence at the Battle of Harim . 
 For modern readers he is most famous for the Kitab al @-@ I 'tibar and his descriptions of life in Syria during the early crusades . The disjointed nature of the work has given him a reputation as a senile rambler , although it is actually written with an anthological structure , with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically , as a true autobiography would . Since this style of literature , <unk> in Arabic , does not necessarily have to be factual , historians are quick to point out that Usama 's historical material cannot always be trusted . Usama 's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes , exaggerating their " otherness " to entertain his Muslim audience . As Carole Hillenbrand wrote , it would be " dangerously misleading to take the evidence of his book at its face value . "

 = Battle of Hulao = 
 The Battle of Hulao ( <unk> ) on 28 May 621 was a decisive victory for the Tang Dynasty prince Li Shimin , through which he was able to subdue two rival warlords , Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong . The battle was fought at the strategically important Hulao Pass , east of Luoyang . Li Shimin led a siege on the city of Luoyang , seat of the self @-@ declared emperor Wang Shichong , who solicited help from Dou Jiande from the east . However , Dou Jiande delayed and when he finally arrived , Li Shimin brought forces to meet the new threat . Li Shimin 's army avoided conflict until the troops of Dou Jiande were exhausted and then led a cavalry charge , breaking the opposing army and capturing Dou Jiande . Afterwards , Wang Shichong , seeing no other choice , surrendered Luoyang , and both his and Dou Jiande 's states were absorbed by the Tang . Dou Jiande was later executed , resulting in some of his followers , led by Liu <unk> , raising an unsuccessful rebellion against the Tang . Hulao marked the decisive turning point in the civil wars that followed the collapse of the Sui Dynasty , after which the eventual victory of the Tang was never in doubt . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the later reign of the second emperor of the Sui Dynasty , Yang ( reigned 604 – 618 ) , the dynasty 's authority began to wane : the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo , coupled with natural disasters , caused unrest in the provinces , while the successive military failures eroded the emperor 's prestige and legitimacy ( " Mandate of Heaven " ) among the provincial governors . Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns , and by the time he realized the gravity of the situation , it was too late : as revolts spread , in 616 , he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu , where he remained until his assassination in 618 . 
 Local governors and magnates rose to claim power in the wake of Yang 's withdrawal . Nine major contenders emerged , some claiming the imperial title , others <unk> themselves , for the time being , with more modest titles . Among the most well @-@ positioned contenders was Li Yuan , Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest ( modern Shanxi ) . A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty , and with a distinguished career behind him , Li Yuan was an obvious candidate for the throne . His province possessed excellent natural defences , a heavily militarized population and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng ( Chang 'an ) and Luoyang . In autumn 617 Li Yuan and his sons , Li Shimin and Li Jiancheng , led their troops south . In a lightning campaign they defeated the Sui forces that tried to bar their way and , on 9 November , Li Yuan 's troops stormed the capital . Li Yuan was now firmly placed as a major contender for the empire , and on 16 June 618 he proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Tang Dynasty . 
 In a series of campaigns in 618 – 620 the Tang , led by the talented Li Shimin , managed to eliminate their rivals in the northwest and repel an attack by Liu Wuzhou , who had taken control of Shanxi , but they still had to expand their control to the northeastern plain and the modern provinces of Hebei and Henan , which , in the words of historian Howard J. Wechsler , would decide whether the new dynasty " would remain a regional regime or whether they would succeed in uniting the country under its control " . By early 620 , two major regimes had established themselves over this region . Henan was controlled by the Luoyang @-@ based Wang Shichong , a former Sui general who declared himself the first emperor of the Zheng dynasty after defeating another rebel leader , Li Mi , at the Battle of Yanshi and absorbing his army and territories . Hebei was ruled by the one @-@ time bandit leader Dou Jiande , who had risen in revolt against the Sui already in 611 . From his base in central Hebei he had expanded his control south to the Yellow River , claiming the title of " King of Xia " . Like Wang and the Tang , he too made use of the pre @-@ existing Sui officialdom and administrative apparatus to maintain his realm . 
 = = Li Shimin 's campaign against Wang and Dou Jiande 's march west = = 
 Fresh from his crushing victory over Liu Wuzhou , in August 620 Li Shimin , with an army of 50 @,@ 000 men , began his advance from Shanxi towards Luoyang . His progress was swift : by September Tang troops had begun to establish a ring of fortified camps around the city , while detachments had penetrated further south , east and north , triggering the defection of most of central Henan from Wang 's control . The monks of the nearby Shaolin Monastery also sided with Li Shimin , defeating a detachment of Wang 's army at Mount <unk> and capturing his nephew , Wang <unk> . Wang Shichong was now isolated in his capital and the territory immediately around it . The Tang were able to defeat his repeated attempts to break through the siege , and the supply situation in Luoyang grew steadily worse as the siege continued into winter and then spring . By March , people were reportedly shifting through dirt to find traces of food , or ate cakes of rice and mud . 
 By this time , Wang 's only hope for rescue was an intervention by Dou Jiande , to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620 . For Dou , the situation , as presented by his councillor Liu Bin , offered both danger and opportunity : if Luoyang fell , the Tang would next turn against Dou , but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang , it would be easy to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state . It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April , when Wang 's situation was critical , before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang . Dou 's army was a huge force , reportedly over 100 @,@ 000 strong , and the two earliest sources report 120 @,@ 000 men . Although possibly exaggerated , an army of this size was well within the capabilities of the time . The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train , comprising both carts and boats . 
 At the news of his approach , some of Li Shimin 's generals suggested that he abandon the siege and retire west to Guanzhong , but the Tang prince refused to heed them . He left most of his army to maintain the siege , and with the rest he marched to the Hulao Pass , some 60 miles ( 97 km ) to the east , which he occupied on 22 April . The Hulao Pass was formed by the ravine of the Sishui river . Lined on both banks by escarpments and steep hills , rising in the south to the <unk> mountains , it possessed major strategic importance — it has been described as a " Chinese Thermopylae " — as the east – west road along the Yellow River 's south bank crossed it . 
 = = Standoff at Hulao and Dou 's strategic dilemma = = 
 When Dou Jiande 's army arrived before the pass , it found the walled town and the western heights behind strongly held by the Tang . Dou encamped his forces at <unk> , a plain 10 miles ( 16 km ) east of the pass , and over the next weeks , repeatedly marched to Hulao and offered battle . Li Shimin , however , was content to remain in his powerful defensive position from which his numerically inferior force could easily hold the Xia at bay . The Tang prince knew that time worked in his favour , as each day the standoff continued only brought the garrison of Luoyang closer to starvation and surrender , and when this happened he would be able to launch his strike with the entire strength of the Tang army . 
 Other passes were available through the hills near Hulao , but they were smaller and equally defensible ; given the size of the Xia army , the only other alternatives for Dou would have been to bypass the Tang position entirely , either by crossing the Yellow River to the north or by venturing further south to the <unk> Pass . Indeed , one of Dou 's civil officials , Ling Jing , suggested a different strategic approach , namely to avoid any engagement with Li Shimin , cross to the northern bank of the Yellow River and strike at the Tang heartland in Shanxi , thereby both weakening the Tang and forcing them to abandon the siege of Luoyang without the Xia incurring any casualties . The plan was supported by Dou 's wife , but was not adopted due to the vehement opposition of the Xia generals . Aside from the natural disregard of the military professionals towards a suggestion from someone whom they regarded as an " armchair general " , however , this opposition is attributed by some sources to bribery of some Xia generals by Wang Shichong 's agents , to ensure that Dou remained committed to the relief of Luoyang . 
 Whatever the true events , military historian David A. Graff opines that logistical concerns played the major role in Dou 's decision to stay at <unk> , as his huge army was utterly dependent on proximity to the Yellow River and its canal network for its supplies . In addition , the heterogeneous nature of the Xia army , containing as it did the forces of various rebel leaders Dou had defeated over the past few years , and whose loyalty was doubtful , prevented Dou from dividing his army and sending various detachments on independent missions . 
 = = Battle of Hulao Pass = = 
 In the event , after a month had passed , the Tang prince decided to force a confrontation . Li Shimin 's reasons for this move are unknown ; Graff suggests that it is " possible that he believed the morale of Dou 's men had deteriorated , and it is very likely that he did not wish to allow the exposed Xia army to withdraw to safety in Hebei after Luoyang had fallen " , or that he was frustrated at Luoyang 's unexpectedly long resistance . At the same time , Li Shimin was evidently determined to exploit the opportunity offered by the tactical situation to score a crushing victory against Dou , which would result in the rapid absorption of his domains by the Tang . 
 To entice his enemy to accept battle , Li Shimin sent his cavalry to raid Dou 's supply lines , and positioned his troops at Hulao so as to suggest that only a small force was present . Dou took the bait , and on the early morning hours of 28 May led a large part of his army against Hulao , deploying his troops for battle along the eastern shore of the Sishui river . Per Li Shimin 's plan , the Tang troops did not come forth to deploy for battle ; instead they remained in their strong defensive positions , waiting for the Xia army to tire and begin its withdrawal . Then the Tang , according to Graff , " would rush out and fall upon the by now demoralized and disorganized Xia army " . This conformed to Li Shimin 's usual blueprint , which he had already employed to prevail over Xue <unk> and Liu Wuzhou : the Tang prince let the enemy advance , stretching their supply lines , and chose a suitable , highly defensible position where to confront them ; he avoided a direct confrontation , instead launching raids on his opponent 's supply lines , awaiting either signs of weakness or the beginning of a retreat ; he then launched an all @-@ out attack aiming at a crushing battlefield success , which he rendered decisive by following it up with a " relentless cavalry pursuit " , in Graff 's words , to exploit it and bring about the collapse of his opponent 's entire regime . 
 Li Shimin 's plan was successful : apart from skirmishes between the two armies ' cavalry , the two armies maintained their standoff from about 08 : 00 until noon , when the Xia troops began to show signs of thirst and weariness . Li Shimin , from a high vantage point , saw this and sent 300 cavalry in a probing attack . When he saw that the demoralized Xia recoiled from this assault , he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou 's left flank from the south . Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley , but this manoeuvre created confusion in the Xia lines , breaking their battle order . Awaiting this opportunity , Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia , himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry . Li Shimin always led from the front — accompanied by an elite force of 1000 black @-@ clad , black @-@ armoured horsemen — as indeed did most of the contemporary Chinese military leaders , who were expected to prove their personal bravery on the battlefield and motivate their men by their example , rather than stay in the rear and co @-@ ordinate their army . 
 The ensuing battle was bloody , but was decided when Li Shimin and a part of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment , planting the Tang banners in full view of both armies . Possibly coupled with the arrival of the flanking Tang cavalry , this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army : trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs , 3 @,@ 000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit , but more than 50 @,@ 000 were taken prisoner . These included Dou Jiande himself , who was wounded and captured while trying to find a way to cross the Yellow River . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Tang victory at Hulao spelled the end for Luoyang too : bereft of any hope of rescue , Wang Shichong surrendered on 4 June , after Li Shimin displayed the captured Dou Jiande and his generals before the city walls . In stark contrast to the leniency with which the Tang treated most of their defeated rivals , Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong were soon eliminated : Dou was sent to Chang 'an , where he was executed , while Wang was ostensibly allowed to retire in exile , but was killed on his way there . Dou 's wife and senior officials managed to escape the Xia camp and reach the safety of Hebei , but although some wanted to continue fighting under Dou 's adopted son , most , including the influential Qi <unk> , regarded the outcome of the battle as a sign that the Tang possessed the " Mandate of Heaven " , the divine right to rule . On 10 June , the Xia formally surrendered to the Tang , with Dou 's ally Xu <unk> and Wang Shichong 's brother <unk> following suit over the next days . 
 As David A. Graff writes , " the great victory at Hulao was the single most decisive engagement of the civil wars that separated the Sui collapse from the consolidation of Tang authority " . By defeating Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong , the Tang eliminated their two strongest rivals and brought the vital north @-@ eastern plain under their control , thereby securing an unchallenged ascendancy over all other competing factions . Tang authority had not yet encompassed all of China , and new rebellions continued to occur for a few more years . The most notable of these occurred in late 621 , when the former Xia officials in Hebei rose up in reaction to the execution of Dou Jiande , under the leadership of Dou 's cavalry commander Liu <unk> . Nevertheless , the eventual outcome of the civil war had been decided at Hulao , and the various rebel leaders were overcome one by one . The last of them , Liang <unk> of <unk> , was defeated in June 628 , marking the end of the civil war . 
 In late 629 , Li Shimin , by now Emperor of China , ordered the erection of Buddhist monasteries on the sites of seven of the battles he had fought during the civil war . In a gesture that illustrated the emperor 's desire to bridge and heal the divisions of the conflict , for Hulao he chose the name " Temple of Equality in <unk> " .

 In early April 1900 , a movement among prominent West Virginia Democratic Party members in Charleston began to coalesce around Flournoy in support of his candidacy for West Virginia governor . Flournoy was considered a William Jennings Bryan Democrat with conservative positions , and Charleston Democrats felt he would receive wide support and would not antagonize corporations . Flournoy took the matter under advisement and on April 25 , 1900 , he announced his candidacy for West Virginia governor . In his announcement , Flournoy stated that he was unwilling to engage in a heated contest for the nomination and that he would be content with the outcome of the Democratic Party state convention , no matter the decision . He further stated that he trusted the state convention would craft a ticket that would command the support of the people of West Virginia . Following his announcement , the Spirit of Jefferson newspaper in Charles Town stated of Flournoy on May 1 , 1900 : " Mr. Flournoy is a most estimable gentleman , well and favorably known here , would doubtless make an excellent governor , and as the nominee of the Democratic party would receive a hearty support in the Eastern panhandle . " Flournoy also received the support of the Democratic Party in Mineral County in May 1900 . 
 At the West Virginia Democratic Party State Convention held in Parkersburg on June 6 , 1900 , Flournoy competed for the party 's nomination for gubernatorial candidacy against Lewis N. <unk> of Parkersburg , John H. Holt of Huntington , and Virgil G. Lewis of Mason City . Prior to the convention , Daniel B. Lucas of Jefferson County had been a candidate for nomination . Holt won the Democratic Party 's nomination on the first ballot , but lost in the general election to Republican candidate Albert B. White .

 = Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 = 
 Ireland participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 after Radio Telefís Éireann ( RTÉ ) held a national final , Eurosong 2008 , to select the Irish entry for the contest , held in Belgrade , Serbia . For 2008 , RTÉ reverted to their multi @-@ song multi @-@ singer format that had previously been used to select the Irish entry at Eurovision . Six artists competed in the final , with the Irish public choosing the winner through televoting and SMS . Residents of Northern Ireland could also take part in the voting through televoting and SMS . The winner was Dustin the Turkey with the song " Irelande Douze Pointe " . At Eurovision , he placed 15th in the semi @-@ final , failing to qualify for the final of the contest .

 Ireland first entered the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 and has since entered a total of 41 entries up to 2007 with its 42nd contribution in 2008 . 
 Ireland has won the contest seven times in total , with no other country beating or equalling that record . The country 's first win came in their sixth entry , in 1970 , with then @-@ 18 @-@ year @-@ old Dana winning with " All Kinds of Everything " . Ireland holds the record for being the only country to win the country three times in a row ( in 1992 , 1993 and 1994 ) , as well as having the only three @-@ times winner ( Johnny Logan , who won in 1980 as a singer , 1987 as a singer @-@ songwriter , and again in 1992 as a songwriter ) . In recent years , however , Ireland 's impressive record at Eurovision has taken a turn , with only two Top 10 results during the 2000s , and Ireland 's first last place finish in 2007 . 
 The Irish national <unk> , Radio Telefís Éireann ( RTÉ ) broadcasts the event each year and organizes the selection process for the selection its entry . Many methods of selection have been used , with the most common method used by RTÉ being a national final featuring a multi @-@ artist , multi @-@ song selection in which regional juries , and later the public , choosing the winner . In recent years the artist has sometimes been selected internally by RTÉ , with the song being chosen by the public , and previously a talent show format , You 're a Star , was used between the years 2003 and 2005 .

" RTÉ reached a consensus and agreed to change the selection process and revert to the " National Song Contest " format that was used in Ireland before 2001 , resulting in seven Irish winners . 
 Eurosong 2008 was the name of the Irish national final that replaced 2007 's selection process for 2008 . An open call for songs by RTÉ was conducted , with the deadline for submissions set at 23 January 2008 . A judging panel , including Irish Eurovision winner Linda Martin , reduced the shortlist of entries from the 150 songs submitted to RTÉ to just six entries . Of the 150 songs submitted , many were by previous Irish national final songwriters , including Karl Broderick ( Ireland 2005 songwriter ) , Niall Mooney ( You 're A Star 2004 songwriter ) and Marc Roberts ( Ireland 1997 ) . Similar to the " National Song Contest " that Ireland adopted until 2001 , the contest not only took song quality into account , but also visual presentation and proposed performance details . Three judges were present at the contest , giving their views on the songs , as well as their personal opinions . They were Louis Walsh , Irish music manager and X Factor judge , Dana Rosemary Scallon , Irish Eurovision winner of 1970 , and Marija Šerifović , winner of the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 for Serbia .

When the list of songs that was issued by RTÉ , it did in fact include Dustin , who was then tipped as the favourite to win the contest . Dustin 's entry , " Irelande Douze Pointe " , is a mock entry , making fun of the Eurovision Song Contest , with lyrics such as " Drag acts and bad acts and Terry Wogan 's wig " . The title of the song also mocks the contest , mimicking the famous phrase from Eurovision " douze points " . The song was composed by Darren Smith , Simon Fine and Dustin ( aka Johnny Morrison ) . Dustin was present on stage in a trolley , with Kitty B ( Kathleen Burke ) and Ann Harrington singing backing vocals , along with three male back @-@ up dancers .

 Since Ireland came last in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 , Dustin was obliged to perform his song in one of the two semi @-@ finals of the 2008 contest . The EBU split up countries with a friendly voting history into the two different semi @-@ finals , to give a better chance to other countries to win .

 Dana , one of the judges at Eurosong , spoke out against Dustin 's entry , calling it a " mockery of the competition " and calling for Dustin and RTÉ to withdraw from the contest . The entry was also said to have been in breach of the rules of the contest , due to the mocking nature that could " bring the Shows or the ESC as such into disrepute " , however , the song was not disqualified . Due to the controversial nature of his entry , Dustin received widespread publicity over his entry before and after his victory .

 = Mihail Kogălniceanu = 
 Mihail Kogălniceanu ( Romanian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ͡ <unk> ̯ anu ] ; also known as Mihail <unk> , Michel de Kogalnitchan ; September 6 , 1817 – July 1 , 1891 ) was a Moldavian @-@ born Romanian liberal statesman , lawyer , historian and publicist ; he became Prime Minister of Romania on October 11 , 1863 , after the 1859 union of the Danubian Principalities under Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza , and later served as Foreign Minister under Carol I. He was several times Interior Minister under Cuza and Carol . A polymath , Kogălniceanu was one of the most influential Romanian intellectuals of his generation . Siding with the moderate liberal current for most of his lifetime , he began his political career as a collaborator of Prince Mihail Sturdza , while serving as head of the Iași Theater and issuing several publications together with the poet Vasile Alecsandri and the activist Ion Ghica . After editing the highly influential magazine Dacia Literară and serving as a professor at Academia Mihăileană , Kogălniceanu came into conflict with the authorities over his Romantic nationalist inaugural speech of 1843 . He was the ideologue of the abortive 1848 Moldavian revolution , authoring its main document , Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova . 
 Following the Crimean War ( 1853 – 1856 ) , with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica , Kogălniceanu was responsible for drafting legislation to abolish Roma slavery . Together with Alecsandri , he edited the unionist magazine Steaua Dunării , played a prominent part during the elections for the ad hoc Divan , and successfully promoted Cuza , his lifelong friend , to the throne . Kogălniceanu advanced legislation to revoke traditional ranks and titles , and to <unk> the property of monasteries . His efforts at land reform resulted in a censure vote , leading Cuza to enforce them through a coup d 'état in May 1864 . However , Kogălniceanu resigned in 1865 , following his own conflicts with the monarch . A decade after , he helped create the National Liberal Party , before playing an important part in Romania 's decision to enter the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 — a choice which consecrated her independence . He was also instrumental in the acquisition , and later colonization , of Northern Dobruja region . During his final years , he was a prominent member and one @-@ time President of the Romanian Academy , and briefly served as Romanian representative to France . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Born in Iași , he belonged to the Kogălniceanu family of Moldavian boyars , being the son of <unk> Ilie Kogălniceanu , and the great @-@ grandson of Constantin Kogălniceanu ( noted for having signed his name to a 1749 document issued by Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos , through which serfdom was disestablished in Moldavia ) . Mihail 's mother , Catinca née <unk> ( or <unk> ) , was , according to Kogălniceanu 's own words , " [ from ] a Romanian family in Bessarabia " . The author took pride in noting that " my family has never searched its origins in foreign countries or peoples " . Nevertheless , in a speech he gave shortly before his death , Kogălniceanu commented that Catinca <unk> had been the descendant of " a Genoese family , settled for centuries in the Genoese colony of Cetatea Albă ( Akerman ) , whence it then scattered throughout Bessarabia " . 
 During <unk> Kogălniceanu 's lifetime , there was confusion regarding his exact birth year , with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806 ; in his speech to the Romanian Academy , he acknowledged this , and gave his exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father . It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was <unk> <unk> , a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family , and was the mother of Mihail Sturdza ( Kogălniceanu 's would @-@ be protector and foe ) . 
 Kogălniceanu was educated at Trei <unk> monastery in Iași , before being tutored by Gherman Vida , a monk who belonged to the Transylvanian School , and who was an associate of Gheorghe <unk> . He completed his primary education in <unk> , where he attended the <unk> boarding school . It was during this early period that he first met the poet Vasile Alecsandri ( they studied under both Vida and <unk> ) , Costache Negri and Cuza . At the time , Kogălniceanu became a passionate student of history , beginning his investigations into old Moldavian chronicles . 
 With support from Prince Sturdza , Kogălniceanu continued his studies abroad , originally in the French city of Lunéville ( where he was cared for by Sturdza 's former tutor , the <unk> <unk> ) , and later at the University of Berlin . Among his colleagues was the future philosopher Grigore Sturdza , son of the Moldavian monarch . His stay in Lunéville was cut short by the intervention of Russian officials , who were supervising Moldavia under the provisions of the Regulamentul Organic regime , and who believed that , through the influence of <unk> ( a participant in the French Revolution ) , students were being infused with rebellious ideas ; all Moldavian students , including Sturdza 's sons and other noblemen , were withdrawn from the school in late 1835 , and reassigned to Prussian education institutions . 
 = = = In Berlin = = = 
 During his period in Berlin , he came in contact with and was greatly influenced by Friedrich Carl von Savigny , Alexander von Humboldt , Eduard Gans , and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke , whose ideas on the necessity for politicians to be acquainted with historical science he readily adopted . In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought , Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian @-@ related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu 's stay . He commented that , in later years , the politician adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel , most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations . 
 Kogălniceanu later noted with pride that he had been the first of Ranke 's Romanian students , and claimed that , in conversations with Humboldt , he was the first person to use the modern equivalents French @-@ language of the words " Romanian " and " Romania " ( <unk> and Roumanie ) — replacing the references to " Moldavia ( n ) " and " Wallachia ( n ) " , as well as the antiquated versions used before him by the intellectual Gheorghe Asachi ; historian Nicolae Iorga also noted the part Kogălniceanu played in popularizing these references as the standard ones . 
 Kogălniceanu was also introduced to Frederica , Duchess of Cumberland , and became relatively close to her son George of Cumberland and Teviotdale , the future ruler of Hanover . Initially hosted by a community of the Huguenot diaspora , he later became the guest of a Calvinist pastor named Jonas , in whose residence he witnessed gatherings of activists in favor of German unification ( see Burschenschaft ) . According to his own recollections , his group of Moldavians was kept under close watch by Alexandru Sturdza , who , in addition , enlisted Kogălniceanu 's help in writing his work Études historiques , <unk> et <unk> ( " Historical , Christian and Moral Studies " ) . During summer trips to the Pomeranian town of <unk> , he met the novelist Willibald Alexis , whom he befriended , and who , as Kogălniceanu recalled , lectured him on the land reform carried out by Prussian King Frederick William III . Later , Kogălniceanu studied the effects of reform when on visit to Alt Schwerin , and saw the possibility for replicating its results in his native country . 
 Greatly expanding his familiarity with historical and social subjects , Kogălniceanu also began work on his first volumes : a pioneering study on the Romani people and the French @-@ language Histoire de la <unk> , de la <unk> et des <unk> <unk> ( " A History of Wallachia , Moldavia , and of Transdanubian Vlachs " , the first volume in a synthesis of Romanian history ) , both of which were first published in 1837 inside the German Confederation . He was becoming repulsed by the existence of Roma slavery in his country , and in his study , cited the example of active abolitionists in Western countries . 
 In addition , he authored a series of studies on Romanian literature . He signed these first works with a Francized version of his name , Michel de Kogalnitchan ( " Michael of Kogalnitchan " ) , which was slightly erroneous ( it used the <unk> case twice : once in the French particle " de " , and a second time in the Romanian @-@ based suffix " -an " ) . 
 Raising the suspicions of Prince Sturdza after it became apparent that he sided with the reform @-@ minded youth of his day in opposition to the Regulamentul Organic regime , Kogălniceanu was prevented from completing his doctorate , and instead returned to Iași , where he became a princely adjutant in 1838 . 
 = = = In opposition to Prince Sturdza = = = 
 Over the following decade , he published a large number of works , including essays and articles , his first editions of the Moldavian chroniclers , as well as other books and articles , while founding a succession of short @-@ lived periodicals : <unk> Românească ( 1838 ) , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> ( 1839 ) , Dacia Literară ( 1840 ) , Arhiva Românească ( 1840 ) , Calendar pentru Poporul Românesc ( 1842 ) , <unk> ( renamed Foaie Științifică și Literară , 1843 ) , and several almanacs . In 1844 , as a Moldavian law was enacting freeing some of the slaves in Orthodox Church property , his articles announced a great triumph for " humanity " and " new ideas " . 
 Both Dacia Literară and Foaie Științifică , which he edited together with Alecsandri , Ion Ghica , and Petre Balș , were suppressed by Moldavian authorities , who considered them suspect . Together with Costache Negruzzi , he printed all of Dimitrie <unk> 's works available at the time , and , in time , acquired his own printing press , which planned to issue the complete editions of Moldavian chronicles , including those of Miron Costin and Grigore <unk> ( after many disruptions associated with his political choices , the project was fulfilled in 1852 ) . In this context , Kogălniceanu and Negruzzi sought to <unk> the Moldavian public , with interest ranging as far as Romanian culinary tastes : the almanacs published by them featured gourmet @-@ themed aphorisms and recipes meant to educate local folk about the refinement and richness of European cuisine . Kogălniceanu would later claim that he and his friend were " originators of the culinary art in Moldavia " . 
 With Dacia Literară , Kogălniceanu began expanding his Romantic ideal of " national specificity " , which was to be a major influence on Alexandru Odobescu and other literary figures . One of the main goals his publications had was expanding the coverage of modern Romanian culture beyond its early stages , during which it had mainly relied on publishing translations of Western literature — according to Garabet Ibrăileanu , this was accompanied by a veiled attack on Gheorghe Asachi and his Albina Românească . Mihail Kogălniceanu later issued clear criticism of Asachi 's proposed version of literary Romanian , which relied on archaisms and Francized phonemes , notably pointing out that it was inconsistent . Additionally , he evidenced the influence foreign poetry had on Asachi 's own work , viewing it as excessive . Tensions also occurred between Kogălniceanu and Alecsandri , after the former began suspecting his collaborator of having reduced and toned down his contributions to Foaie Științifică . During this period , Kogălniceanu maintained close contacts with his former colleague Costache Negri and his sister Elena , becoming one of the main figures of the intellectual circle hosted by the <unk> in <unk> . He also became close to the French teacher and essayist Jean Alexandre Vaillant , who was himself involved in liberal causes while being interested in the work of Moldavian chroniclers . Intellectuals of the day speculated that Kogălniceanu later contributed several sections to Vaillant 's lengthy essay about Moldavia and Wallachia ( La Roumanie ) . 
 In May 1840 , while serving as Prince Sturdza 's private secretary , he became co @-@ director ( with Alecsandri and Negruzzi ) of the National Theater Iași . This followed the monarch 's decision to unite the two existing theaters in the city , one of which hosted plays in French , into a single institution . In later years , this venue , which staged popular comedies based on the French repertory of its age and had become the most popular of its kind in the country , also hosted Alecsandri 's debut as a playwright . Progressively , it also became subject to Sturdza 's censorship . 
 In 1843 , Kogălniceanu gave a celebrated inaugural lecture on national history at the newly founded Academia Mihăileană in Iași , a speech which greatly influenced ethnic Romanian students at the University of Paris and the 1848 generation ( see <unk> pentru <unk> <unk> de istorie <unk> ) . Other professors at the Academia , originating in several historical regions , were Ion Ghica , <unk> <unk> , and Ion Ionescu de la Brad . Kogălniceanu 's introductory speech was partly prompted by Sturdza 's refusal to give him imprimatur , and amounted to a revolutionary project . Among other things , it made explicit references to the common cause of Romanians living in the two states of Moldavia and Wallachia , as well as in <unk> and Russian @-@ ruled areas : 
 " I view as my country everywhere on earth where Romanian is spoken , and as national history the history of all of Moldavia , that of Wallachia , and that of our brothers in Transylvania . " 
 = = = Revolution = = = 
 Around 1843 , Kogălniceanu 's enthusiasm for change was making him a suspect to the Moldavian authorities , and his lectures on History were suspended in 1844 . His passport was revoked while he was traveling to Vienna as the secret representative of the Moldavian political opposition ( attempting to approach Metternich and discuss Sturdza 's ouster ) . Briefly imprisoned after returning to Iași , he soon after became involved in political agitation in Wallachia , assisting his friend Ion Ghica : in February , during a Romantic nationalist celebration , he traveled to Bucharest , where he met members of the secretive Frăția organization and of its legal front , <unk> Literară ( including Ghica , Nicolae Bălcescu , August Treboniu Laurian , Alexandru G. Golescu , and C. A. Rosetti ) . 
 Having sold his personal library to Academia Mihăileană , Kogălniceanu was in Paris and other Western European cities from 1845 to 1847 , joining the Romanian student association ( Societatea <unk> <unk> ) that included Ghica , Bălcescu , and Rosetti and was presided over by the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine . He also frequented La Bibliothèque <unk> ( " The Romanian Library " ) , while affiliating to the Freemasonry and joining the Lodge known as L <unk> des <unk> ( " Foreigners ' Atheneum " ) , as did most other reform @-@ minded Romanians in Paris . In 1846 , he visited Spain , wishing to witness the wedding of Isabella II and the Duke of Cádiz , but he was also curious to assess developments in Spanish culture . Upon the end of his trip , he authored Notes sur l 'Espagne ( " Notes on Spain " ) , a French @-@ language volume combining memoir , travel writing and historiographic record . 
 For a while , he concentrated his activities on reviewing historical sources , expanding his series of printed and edited Moldavian chronicles . At the time , he renewed his contacts with Vaillant , who helped him publish articles in the Revue de l 'Orient . He would later state : " We did not come to Paris just to learn how to speak French like the French do , but also to borrow the ideas and useful things of a nation that is so enlightened and so free " . 
 Following the onset of the European Revolutions , Kogălniceanu was present at the forefront of nationalist politics . Though , for a number of reasons , he failed to sign the March 1848 petition @-@ proclamation which signaled the Moldavian revolution , he was seen as one of its instigators , and Prince Sturdza ordered his arrest during the police roundup that followed . While evading capture , Kogălniceanu authored some of the most vocal attacks on Sturdza , and , by July , a reward was offered for his apprehension " dead or alive " . During late summer , he crossed the Austrian border into Bukovina , where he took refuge on the <unk> brothers ' property ( in parallel , the Frăția @-@ led Wallachian revolution managed to gain power in Bucharest ) . 
 Kogălniceanu became a member and chief ideologue of the Moldavian Central Revolutionary Committee in exile . His manifesto , Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova ( " The Wishes of the National Party in Moldavia " , August 1848 ) , was , in effect , a constitutional project listing the goals of Romanian revolutionaries . It contrasted with the earlier demands the revolutionaries had presented to Sturdza , which called for strict adherence to the Regulamentul Organic and an end to abuse . In its 10 sections and 120 articles , the manifesto called for , among other things , internal autonomy , civil and political liberties , separation of powers , abolition of privilege , an end to corvées , and a Moldo @-@ Wallachian union . Referring to the latter ideal , Kogălniceanu stressed that it formed : 
 " the keystone without which the national edifice would crumble " . 
 At the same time , he published a more explicit " Project for a Moldavian Constitution " , which expanded on how Dorințele could be translated into reality . Kogălniceanu also contributed articles to the Bukovinan journal <unk> , the voice of revolution in Romanian @-@ inhabited Austrian lands . In January 1849 , a cholera epidemic forced him to leave for the French Republic , where he carried on with his activities in support of the Romanian revolution . 
 = = = Prince Ghica 's reforms = = = 
 In April 1849 , part of the goals of the 1848 Revolution were fulfilled by the Treaty of Balta Liman , through which the two suzerain powers of the Regulamentul Organic regime — the Ottoman Empire and Russia — appointed Grigore Alexandru Ghica , a supporter of the liberal and unionist cause , as Prince of Moldova ( while , on the other hand , confirming the defeat of revolutionary power in Wallachia ) . Ghica allowed the instigators of the 1848 events to return from exile , and appointed Kogălniceanu , as well as Costache Negri and Alexandru Ioan Cuza to administrative offices . The measures enforced by the prince , together with the fallout from the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War , were to bring by 1860 the introduction of virtually all liberal tenets comprised in Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova . 
 Kogălniceanu was consequently appointed to various high level government positions , while continuing his cultural contributions and becoming the main figure of the loose grouping Partida Națională , which sought the merger of the two Danubian Principalities under a single administration . In 1867 , reflecting back on his role , he stated : 
 " There is not a single reform , not a single national act , from which my name would be absent . All the major laws were made and countersigned by me . " 
 He inaugurated his career as a legislator under Prince Ghica . On December 22 , 1855 , legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan . This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves , as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844 . Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure . Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of <unk> , an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware that he was not going to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters . 
 Prince Ghica also attempted to improve the peasant situation by outlawing quit @-@ rents and regulating that peasants could no longer be removed from the land they were working on . This measure produced little lasting effects ; according to Kogălniceanu , " the cause [ of this ] should be sought in the all @-@ <unk> of landowners , in the weakness of the government , who , through its very nature , was provisional , and thus powerless " . 
 = = = Ad hoc Divan = = = 
 Interrupted by Russian and Austrian interventions during the Crimean War , his activity as Partida Națională representative was successful after the 1856 Treaty of Paris , when Moldavia and Wallachia came under the direct supervision of the European Powers ( comprising , alongside Russia and Austria , the United Kingdom , the Second French Empire , the Kingdom of Piedmont @-@ Sardinia , and Prussia ) . As he later acknowledged , members of the Divan had begun to consider the Paris agreements , and especially the 1858 convention regarding the two countries , as a Constitution of Romania , in place until 1864 . 
 In addition , Kogălniceanu began printing the magazine Steaua Dunării in Iași : a unionist mouthpiece , it enlisted support from Alecsandri and his România Literară . Kogălniceanu encouraged Nicolae Ionescu to issue the magazine L 'Étoile de Danube in Brussels , as a French @-@ language version of Steaua Dunării which would also serve to popularize Partida Națională 's views . By that time , he was in correspondence with Jean Henri <unk> <unk> , a French essayist and traveler who had played a minor part in the Wallachian uprising , and who supported the Romanian cause in his native country . 
 Elected by the College of landowners in <unk> County to the ad hoc Divan , a newly established assembly through which Moldavians had gained the right to decide their own future , he kept in line with the Wallachian representatives to their respective Divan , and resumed his campaign in favor of union and increased autonomy , as well as the principles of neutrality , representative government , and , as he said later , rule by " a foreign prince " . However , both Kogălniceanu and Alecsandri initially presented themselves as candidates for the regency title of <unk> — Alecsandri , who was more popular , renounced first in order to back Costache Negri . Negri 's candidature was dismissed by the Ottomans , who preferred to appoint Teodor Balș ( June 1856 ) . 
 Following the elections of September 1857 , the entire Partida Națională chose to support Cuza for the Moldavian throne . This came after Nicolae <unk> , the new <unk> , carried out an anti @-@ unionist electoral fraud — a suffrage annulled by the common verdict of Napoleon III and Queen Victoria ( August 9 , 1857 , first announced to the world on August 26 ) . 
 He played the decisive part in the Divan 's decision to abolish boyar ranks and privileges , thus nullifying pieces of legislation first imposed under Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos . The final proposal , effectively imposing one law for all , universal conscription and an end to rank @-@ based tax exemptions , was made by a commission which included Kogălniceanu and Vasile <unk> , and was passed by the Divan on October 29 , 1857 , with 73 out of 77 votes ( the remaining 4 were all abstentions ) . Kogălniceanu noted with pride that " The entire nation has accepted this great reform , and everyone , former Princes , great boyars , low @-@ ranking boyars , privileged strata , have received this <unk> reform , discarding , even without special laws , all that derived from the old regime , and even all that resembled the old regime " . He recorded that only two members of the boyar class had subsequently refused to abide by the new principles — the <unk> Iordache <unk> ( in Moldavia ) and Ioan Manu ( in Wallachia ) . In November , Partida Națională passed legislation forcing the end of religious discrimination against all non @-@ Orthodox Christians in Moldavia ( specifically , against Roman Catholics and Gregorian Armenians ) . The law had been initiated by Negri . 
 Many of Kogălniceanu 's efforts were centered on bringing about an end to the peasant question , but , as he admitted , his boyar electorate threatened to recall him if he was to pursue this path any further . Consequently , he signed his name to the more moderate proposal of Dimitrie <unk> , which prevented boyars from instituting new corvées , while leaving other matters to be discussed by a future permanent Assembly . This project was instantly rejected by a solid majority of the Assembly , which in Kogălniceanu 's view , led to the creation of two poles , " national liberal " and conservative , replacing the unionist @-@ separatist divide and causing political conflicts inside the former unionist majority ( thus forming the National Liberal and Conservative parties ) . 
 <unk> the opposition of <unk> and his group of conservative followers during new elections for the Divan , Kogălniceanu was able to promote Cuza in Moldavia on January 17 , 1859 , leading to Cuza 's election for a similar position in Wallachia ( February 5 ) — the de facto union of the two countries as the United Principalities . In October 1858 , he made a clear proposal regarding the unification , which , as he noted , carried the vote with only two opposing voices ( Alecu Balș and <unk> <unk> , the Orthodox vicar of Roman Bishopric ) , being publicly acclaimed by Ion Roată , the peasant representative for <unk> County . During 1859 , Kogălniceanu again stood in the ad hoc Divan and rallied support for Cuza from all factions of the unionist camp , while promoting his candidature in Bucharest — thus profiting from ambiguities in the Paris Treaty . On the day Cuza took the throne , to begin his rule as Domnitor , Mihail Kogălniceanu welcomed him with an emotional speech . 
 = = = Secularization of monastery estates = = = 
 From 1859 to 1865 , Kogălniceanu was on several occasions the cabinet leader in the Moldavian half of the United Principalities , then Prime Minister of Romania , being responsible for most of the reforms associated with Cuza 's reign . His first term in Moldavia ended during December 1860 , when Kogălniceanu became involved in the scandal involving Metropolitan <unk> Miclescu , who opposed Cuza 's secularization of the monastery estates . In 1863 , secularization was imposed by Cuza , with the land thus freed being divided among peasants — the land reform of 1864 , which came together with the universal abolition of corvées . 
 Although political opposition prevented him from pushing agrarian reform at the time that he proposed it , Mihail Kogălniceanu is seen as the person responsible for the manner in which it was eventually carried out by Cuza . The changes in legislation came at the end of a lengthy process , inaugurated in 1860 , when the institution regulating legislative projects for the two principalities , the Conservative @-@ dominated Common Commission of Focșani , refused to create the basis for land reform . Instead , it provided for an end to corvées , while allowing peasants on boyar estates control over their own houses and a parcel of pasture . Known as Legea Rurală ( the " Rural Law " ) , the project received instant support from the then @-@ Premier Barbu Catargiu , leader of the Conservatives , and the target of vocal criticism on Kogălniceanu 's part . On June 6 , 1862 , the project was first debated in parliament , causing a standstill between Cuza and the Conservatives . As noted by historian L. S. <unk> , the latter considered the project advantageous because , while preserving estates , it created a sizable group of landless and dependent peasants , who could provide affordable labor . 
 Late in the same month , Catargiu was mysteriously assassinated on Mitropoliei Hill , on his way back from Filaret , where he had attended a festivity commemorating the Wallachian revolution ( he was succeeded by Nicolae Kretzulescu , after the interim premiership of Apostol <unk> ) . On June 23 , Legea Rurală was passed by Parliament , but Cuza would not promulgate it . According to Kogălniceanu , the Conservatives <unk> and Kretzulescu were reluctant to propose the law for review by Cuza , knowing that it was destined to be rejected . Discussions then drifted toward the matter of confiscating land from the Greek Orthodox monasteries in Romania ( their sizable properties and traditional tax exemptions had been the subject of controversy ever since the Phanariote period ) . In late 1862 , their revenues were taken over by the state , and , during the summer of the following year , a sum of 80 million piasters was offered as compensation to the Greek monks , in exchange for all of the monasteries ' land . 
 As the Ottoman Empire proposed international mediation , Cuza took the initiative , and , on October 23 , 1863 , deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet , nominating instead his own selection of men : Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister , Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs . In order to prevent further international tensions , they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates , Greek as well as those of the incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries . The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes . Later , the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation , which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients , including Patriarch <unk> III . Consequently , the Romanian state considered the matter closed . As a direct consequence , one third of the arable land in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made available for a future land reform ( one fifth to one fourth of the total arable land in the state as a whole ) . 
 = = = Cuza 's personal regime = = = 
 In the spring of 1864 , the cabinet introduced a bill providing for an extensive land reform , which proposed allocating land based on peasant status . The <unk> ( " foremost people " ) , who owned 4 or more oxen , were to receive 5 <unk> of land , or approx . 7 @.@ 5 hectares ; <unk> ( " middle people " ) , with two oxen — approx . 6 hectares ; <unk> ( " manual laborers " ) , with no oxen — approx . 3 hectares . Peasants were to own their plots after making 14 yearly payments to their respective landowner . This caused uproar in Parliament , which represented around 4 @,@ 000 mostly boyar electors , and voices from among the Conservatives deemed it " insane " . The latter party prepared a censure vote , based on the fact that Kogălniceanu had publicized the project through <unk> Oficial in contradiction with the one endorsed by the Focșani Commission , thus going against the letter of the law — he later justified himself saying : " Publication was necessary in order to quell the rural population , agitated by the [ alternative project ] " . The cabinet handed in its resignation , but Cuza refused to <unk> it . 
 Tensions mounted and , on May 14 , 1864 , Cuza carried out a coup d 'état , coinciding with the moment when Conservatives imposed a censure vote . Kogălniceanu read in Parliament the monarch 's decision to dissolve it , after which Cuza introduced a new constitution , titled <unk> <unk> al <unk> de la Paris ( " Statute Expanding the Paris Convention " ) . Together with a law virtually establishing a system of universal male suffrage , it was submitted to the 1864 plebiscite , gaining support from 682 @,@ 621 voters out of 754 @,@ 148 . 
 The new regime passed its own version of Legea Rurală , thus effectively imposing land reform , as well as putting an end to corvées . This was accomplished through discussions in August 1864 by the newly established Council of State , where the law was advanced by , among others , Kogălniceanu , Bolintineanu , George D. <unk> , Gheorghe <unk> and Alexandru Papadopol @-@ Callimachi . Kogălniceanu 's other measures as minister included : the establishment of Bucharest University , the introduction of identity papers , the establishment of a national police corps ( comprising <unk> units ) , the unification of Border Police . 
 More reserved members of the Council asked for the land reform law not to be applied for a duration of three years , instead of the presumed April 1865 deadline , and Cuza agreed . Arguing that Cuza 's decision was " the very condemnation and crushing of the law " , Kogălniceanu worried that peasants , informed of their future , could no longer be persuaded to carry out corvées . He threatened Cuza with his resignation , and was ultimately able to persuade all parties involved , including the opposition leader Kretzulescu , to accept the law 's application as of spring 1865 ; a proclamation by Cuza , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " To the Rural Inhabitants " ) accompanied the resolution , and was described by Kogălniceanu as " the political testament of Cuza " . Despite this measure , factors such as a growing population , the division of plots among descendants , peasant debts and enduring reliance on revenues from working on estates , together with the widespread speculation of estate leaseholders and instances where political corruption was detrimental to the allocation of land , made the reform almost completely ineffectual on the long term , and contributed to the countryside unrest which culminated in the Peasants ' Revolt of 1907 . 
 With Kogălniceanu 's participation , the authoritarian regime established by Cuza succeeded in promulgating a series of reforms , notably introducing the Napoleonic code , public education , and state monopolies on alcohol and tobacco . At the same time , the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides , especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal . In early 1865 , Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu , whom he dismissed soon after . Over the following months , the administration went into financial collapse , no longer able to provide state salaries , while Cuza came to rely on his own <unk> ( courtiers ) . 
 After 1863 , relations between Mihail Kogălniceanu and his friend Vasile Alecsandri soured dramatically , as the latter declared himself disgusted with politics . Alecsandri withdrew to his estate in <unk> , where he wrote pieces critical of the political developments . 
 = = = Carol 's ascent and Mazar Pașa Coalition = = = 
 Domnitor Cuza was ultimately ousted by a coalition of Conservatives and Liberals in February 1866 ; following a period of transition and maneuvers to avert international objections , a perpetually unified Principality of Romania was established under Carol of Hohenzollern , with the adoption of the 1866 Constitution . Two years later , in recognition of his scholarly contributions , Kogălniceanu became a member of the newly created Romanian Academy Historical Section . 
 In November 1868 – January 1870 , he was again Minister of the Interior under Dimitrie Ghica . In this capacity , he regulated the design of police uniforms , and investigated the murder of Cuca @-@ <unk> peasants by rogue Gendarmes . 
 He was at the time involved in a new diplomatic effort : the Ghica government was aiming to receive formal recognition of the name " Romania " , as opposed to " United Principalities " . The bid was successful , after the Ottomans gave their approval , but marked a slump in Romania 's relationship with Prussia — its Minister President , Otto von Bismarck , abstained on the matter . Such tensions were only worsened when Prussian money was attracted by Ghica into the development of a Romanian Railways system : later Romanian governments confronted themselves with the " <unk> Affair " , a volatile combination of investment scheme failure and anti @-@ Prussian sentiment ( see Republic of Ploiești ) . Although generally depicted as Prussian @-@ friendly , the Conservatives were also opposed to such dealings , and their daily <unk> referred to Kogălniceanu as the guilty party . Overall , however , the Francophile Ghica and his minister were not only hostile to Prussia , but also tried to help the national cause of Romanians living in Austria @-@ Hungary ( Transylvania , Bukovina , etc . ) . Reportedly , these pitted them against Domnitor Carol , the Prussian @-@ born Germanophile . 
 Kogălniceanu 's term was confirmed by the 1869 election , after which he was able to persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman . The poet , who had been nominated without expressing his consent , cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu 's main supporters in the chamber . Also then , Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica , the acting Premier . When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems , Kogălniceanu gathered together the party 's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch . 
 Even after Cuza left the country and settled in Baden , relations between him and Kogălniceanu remained respectful , but distant : in summer 1868 , when both of them were visiting Vienna , they happened to meet , and , without exchanging words , raised their hats as a form of greeting . On May 27 , 1873 , Kogălniceanu , alongside Alecsandri , Costache Negri , Petre <unk> and other public figures , attended Cuza 's funeral in <unk> . Speaking later , he noted : " Cuza has committed great errors , but [ the 1864 <unk> <unk> <unk> ] shall never fade out of the hearts of peasants , nor from Romania 's history " . 
 Kogălniceanu carried on as leader of pragmatic @-@ reformist liberalism in Romania ; in loose opposition to the Conservative Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu ( 1875 ) , he began talks with the radical faction of the liberal trend ( most notably , Ion Brătianu , Dimitrie Sturdza , Ion Ghica , C. A. Rosetti , Dimitrie Brătianu , and Alexandru G. Golescu ) , which were carried at the Bucharest residence of Pasha Stephen Bartlett Lakeman . On May 24 , 1875 , negotiations resulted in the creation of the National Liberal Party — the so @-@ called Coalition of Mazar Pașa . 
 Kogălniceanu also signed his name to the proclamation <unk> Liber ( " The <unk> Voter " ) , which stated the main National Liberal goals . He was however an outspoken adversary of his former collaborator Nicolae Ionescu , who , as leader of the liberal splinter group Fracțiunea liberă și independentă , rejected National Liberal politics . In an 1876 speech in front of Parliament , Kogălniceanu attacked Ionescu and his supporters for their political and academic positions , approval from the conservative literary society Junimea and its anti @-@ liberal gazette <unk> . 
 Like his political career , Kogălniceanu 's tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies . Also in 1875 , he issued from Paris an anti @-@ Austrian brochure about the Romanian cause in Bukovina . Called Rapt de la <unk> d 'après les documents <unk> ( " The Rape of Bukovina , from Genuine Documents " ) , it reused old texts collected by the <unk> . The propaganda effort won support from across the floor : Junimea Conservatives ( Titu Maiorescu , Theodor Rosetti , Ioan Slavici ) , National Liberals ( D. Sturdza ) and independents ( Alexandru Odobescu ) all signed up to the enterprise . 
 Kogălniceanu joined other National Liberals in expressing opposition to the trade convention Catargiu had signed with Austria @-@ Hungary , which was advantageous to the latter 's exports , and which , they claimed , was leading Romanian industry to ruin . He accepted it while in office , but looked into adopting European @-@ like patent laws , as a measure of encouraging local industries . A National Liberal government would repeal the agreement in 1886 . 
 = = = Romanian independence = = = 
 Serving as Foreign Affairs Minister in the Ion Brătianu cabinet ( spring @-@ summer 1876 , and again from April 1877 to November 1878 ) , Mihail Kogălniceanu was responsible for Romania entering the War of 1877 – 1878 on the Russian side , which led the country to proclaim its independence ( see Romanian War of Independence ) . He initially tried to obtain diplomatic recognition from various states , but the European states rejected the offer , and the Ottoman Porte ignored them . The Russian envoy Dimitri Stuart received instructions to " halt " Kogălniceanu 's initiatives , so as not to aggravate the " Eastern Question " . 
 Upon his return to office , Kogălniceanu personally organized conspiratorial meetings with the Russian diplomat Aleksandr <unk> , and approved Russian demands in exchange for co @-@ belligerency . With C. A. Rosetti and Brătianu , he supported the transit of Russian troops and persuaded Carol to accept the Russian alliance , contrary to the initial advice of the Crown Council . He also sought advice on this matter from the French Third Republic , who was still one of the powers supervising Romania ; Louis , duc <unk> , the French Foreign Minister , declined to give him a reassuring answer , and pointed that , were Romania to join up with Russia , the other powers would cease offering their protection . Making note of this , Kogălniceanu expressed his hope that France would still support his country at the decisive moment . 
 In the end , the Russian declaration of war came as a surprise to both Carol and Kogălniceanu , who had not been informed of the exact date ( April 23 ) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia — hence , Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion . Also alarming for Kogălniceanu , the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as <unk> of the Empire . Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and , later , by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania ; addressing a discontented Parliament , Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country 's only choice . 
 On May 9 , 1877 , it was through Kogălniceanu 's speech in Parliament that Romania acknowledged she was discarding Ottoman suzerainty . He was rewarded by Carol , becoming one of the first three statesmen received into the Order of the Star of Romania . The Minister also negotiated the terms under which the Romanian Land Forces were to join the war effort in Bulgaria , specifically demanding Russian reparations and indemnities . 
 Over the following year , he coordinated efforts to have the act recognized by all European states , and stated that his government 's policies were centered on " as rapid as possible , the transformation of foreign diplomatic agencies and consulates in Bucharest into legations " . Late in 1877 , he traveled to Austria @-@ Hungary and met Austrian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy . He recorded a mood of opposition to the Romanian military effort , but received guarantees of border security . The main challenge was convincing Bismarck , who had since become Chancellor of the German Empire , and who was very reserved on the issue of Romanian independence . 
 = = = Congress of Berlin and Northern Dobruja = = = 
 Upon the war 's end , Mihail Kogălniceanu and Ion Brătianu headed the Romanian delegation to the Congress of Berlin . In this capacity , they protested Russia 's offer to exchange the previously Ottoman @-@ ruled Northern Dobruja for Budjak , a portion of southern Bessarabia that Romania had received under the 1856 Treaty of Paris . This came after months of tension between Romania and Russia , generated over the territorial issue and the Russian claim to be representing Romania at Berlin : Kogălniceanu 's envoy ( <unk> Arion ) had even threatened the Russians with a Romanian denunciation of their alliance , and 60 @,@ 000 Romanian soldiers were prepared for Budjak 's defense . The Conference 's ultimate decision ( Berlin Treaty ) was in favor of Russia 's proposal , largely due to support from Andrássy and William Henry Waddington , the French Minister of Foreign Affairs . Additional pressures came from Bismarck . The Russians themselves did register some setbacks by the end of the Conference . Their demands for Romania to allow indefinite military transit through Northern Dobruja were made ineffectual by the opposition of other European states , and Kogălniceanu was able to obtain the retrocession of Snake Island . 
 As an effect of Waddington 's intervention , Romania also agreed to resolve the issue of Jewish Emancipation . The government pledged itself to naturalize all of its non @-@ Christian residents ( see History of the Jews in Romania ) . Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision , and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise . The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year , and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922 – 1923 . 
 This outcome was the subject of controversy in Romania , where the territorial exchange was generally considered unfair , with some voices even arguing that the country could again accept Ottoman suzerainty as a means to overturn the state of affairs . Unbeknown to them , the Budjak cession had been secretly agreed upon with <unk> in early 1877 . Even then , against his subordinates in the diplomatic corps , but in consonance with the Domnitor , Kogălniceanu privately noted that he " fully agreed " with it , and that he regarded the new province as a " splendid acquisition " . However , in April 1877 , Kogălniceanu had explicitly assured Parliament that no real threat loomed over the Budjak . By that point in time , both the Germans and the Austrians had begun suspecting that Kogălniceanu was in fact a favorite and agent of influence of the Russians , and , reportedly , he even encouraged the rumor to spread . Andrássy reportedly commented : " Prince Carol is really unfortunate to have people like Mr. Kogălniceanu in his service " . 
 Opposition came from both Conservative and National Liberal legislators , who viewed Northern Dobruja as an inhospitable , <unk> and non @-@ Romanian territory . Contrarily , with his proclamation to the peoples of Northern Dobruja , Kogălniceanu enshrined the standard patriotic narrative of the events : he asserted that the region had been " united " with Romania , as a " Romanian land " , because of the people 's wishes and sacrifices . During the heated parliamentary sessions of late September 1878 , he helped swing the vote in favor of the annexation , with speeches which also helped transform the public 's mood , and which promised a swift process of <unk> . These addresses are credited with having first backdated the Romanian claim to ca . 1400 , when Wallachia briefly held the Principality of Karvuna . 
 In 1879 , again head of Internal Affairs , Kogălniceanu began organizing the administration of Northern Dobruja , through decrees . He supported a distinct legal regime , as a transition from Ottoman administration , and a period of rebuilding — in effect , a colonial rule , aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream , but respectful of Dobrujan Islam . Unlike other partisans of colonization ( including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad ) , Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders . His intercession played a part in the ethnic policies : he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists ( <unk> ) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes , offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land . This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates , the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan , and the appropriation of uncultivated plots ( <unk> ) .

 Kogălniceanu subsequently represented his country in France ( 1880 ) , being the first Romanian envoy to Paris , and having Alexandru Lahovary on his staff . The French state awarded him its Legion of Honour , with the rank of Grand Officier . In January 1880 – 1881 , Kogălniceanu oversaw the first diplomatic contacts between Romania and Qing China , as an exchange of correspondence between the Romanian Embassy to France and Zeng <unk> , the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom . 
 Upon his return to the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania , Kogălniceanu played a prominent part in opposing further concessions for Austria , on the issue of international Danube navigation . By 1883 , he was becoming known as the speaker of a liberal conservative faction of the National Liberal group . Kogălniceanu and his supporters criticized Rosetti and others who again pushed for universal ( male ) suffrage , and argued that Romania 's fragile international standing did not permit electoral divisiveness . 
 After withdrawing from political life , Kogălniceanu served as Romanian Academy President from 1887 to 1889 ( or 1890 ) . Having fallen severely ill in 1886 , he spent his final years editing historical documents of the <unk> <unk> fund , publicizing Ancient Greek and Roman archeological finds in Northern Dobruja , and collecting foreign documents related to Romanian history . One of his last speeches , held in front of the Academy and witnessed by both Carol , who had since become King of Romania , and his wife Elisabeth of Wied , was a summary of his entire career as a politician , intellectual , and civil servant . In August 1890 , while traveling through the Austrian region of Vorarlberg , he was troubled by news that Alecsandri had died at his home in <unk> . Writing to Alecsandri 's wife Paulina , he asked : " I could not be present at his funeral , [ therefore ] you 'll allow me , my lady , since I have unable to kiss him either alive or dead , to at least kiss his grave ! " 
 Mihail Kogălniceanu died while undergoing surgery in Paris , and was succeeded in his seat at the Academy by Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol . He was buried in his native Iași , at the <unk> cemetery .

 Mihail Kogălniceanu 's contributions as a leader of opinion and statesman have won acclaim for their role in shaping the development of modern Romania before and after 1848 . Nicolae Iorga , a major historian of the 20th century , celebrated Kogălniceanu as " the founder of modern Romanian culture , the thinker who has seen in clarity the free and complete Romania [ ... ] , the redeemer of peasants thrown into serfdom [ a reference to corvées ] , the person understanding all the many , secretive , and indissoluble connections linking the life of a people to the moral quality and the energy of its soul " . 
 Kogălniceanu was a democratic and nationalist politician who combined liberalism with the conservative principles acquired during his education , taking inspiration from the policies of the Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg . German statesmen were however disinclined to consider him one of their own : Bernhard von Bülow took for granted rumors that he was an agent of the Russians , and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham . 
 Supportive of constitutionalism , civil liberties , and other liberal positions , Kogălniceanu prioritized the nation over individualism , an approach with resonated with the tendencies of all his fellow Moldavian revolutionaries . In maturity , Kogălniceanu had become a skeptic with respect to the French Revolution and its Jacobin legacy , arguing : " civilization stops when revolutions begin " . At the same time , his connections within Freemasonry , mirroring the conviction and affiliation of most 1848 revolutionaries , were an important factor in ensuring the success of Romanian causes abroad , and arguably played a part in the election of Cuza , who was himself a member of the secretive organization . 
 Inside the Romanian liberal faction , and in contrast to his moderation on other topics , he was among the very few to tie together modernization , democracy , and the need to improve the situation of peasants ( other notable politicians to do so were Nicolae Bălcescu , who died in late 1852 , and Rosetti , who advocated a strict adherence to <unk> ) . Kogălniceanu praised Bălcescu 's manifestos and activism in favor of the peasantry , indicating that they formed a precedent for his own accomplishments , while deploring the Wallachian uprising 's failure to advance a definitive land reform . When faced with a negative response in the census @-@ elected Parliament just prior to Cuza 's coup , he defended his land reform project with the words : 
 " Two thousand boyars do not a nation make ; that is an undeniable truth . " 
 Late in his life , while crediting the University of Berlin and its notions of patriotism with having provided him with " the love for the Romanian motherland and the liberal spirit [ emphasis in original ] " , he stressed : 
 " In my lengthy combats and actions , in the grim persecutions that have more than once been exercised as a means to crush me , I always had before my eyes those beautiful words which [ ... ] Prince Hardenberg indicated as the strongest means to reawaken the character and manliness of the German people in order to liberate it from the foreign yoke , to raise and increase Germany : « Democratic principles as part of a monarchic government ! » " 
 = = = Antisemitism = = = 
 Like many of his fellow Romanian liberals , Kogălniceanu advocated a series of antisemitic policies . He used his position as Internal Affairs Minister in the Dimitrie Ghica executive to resume the expulsions of Jewish community members from the countryside ( thus denying them various sources of income ) . When faced with the official protests of European states , he replied that the matter was nobody 's business but Romania 's . He usually referred to the Jewish community in general with the insulting term <unk> , and accepted their presence on Romanian soil as a concession to their alleged " too numerous and too powerful presence in Europe " . During the 1930s , such attitudes , together with Kogălniceanu 's involvement in peasant causes , were cited as a precedent by politicians of the fascist National Christian Party and Iron Guard , who , while promoting rural traditionalism , advocated restricting civil rights for the Jewish community . 
 Nevertheless , Kogălniceanu 's antisemitic discourse was nuanced and less violent than that of some of his contemporaries . According to historian George Voicu , he stood for " a complicated balance in dealing with the ' Jewish question ' " , one between " antisemitic intransigence " and " concessions " . The more radical antisemite and National Liberal Bogdan <unk> Hasdeu expressed much criticism of this moderate stance ( which he also believed was represented within the party by Rosetti and Ion Ghica ) , and he even claimed that Kogălniceanu was a secret " faithful " of the Talmud . In 1885 , Kogălniceanu strongly objected to a National Liberal cabinet decision to expel Moses <unk> , a renowned Jewish scholar , stating that the latter was " [ the ] only man who works in this country " ( he would later celebrate him as the man " to whom Romanian literature owes so much " ) . Five years later , as rapporteur on naturalization issues , he conferred citizenship upon Marxist thinker Constantin <unk> @-@ Gherea , who was a Russian @-@ born Jewish immigrant . Shortly before his death , he reportedly endorsed a similar measure for Jewish scholar Lazăr Șăineanu , expressing condemnation for those antisemites within his own party who made efforts to block it .

 In his polemical history tracing the development of literary criticism and its role in Romanian culture , the 20th century author Garabet Ibrăileanu made ample mention of Kogălniceanu 's role in combating nationalist excesses , in particular the post @-@ 1840 attempts by Transylvanian and Wallachian intellectuals to change the fabric of the Romanian language by introducing strong influences from Latin or other modern Romance languages . To illustrate this view , he cited Kogălniceanu 's <unk> pentru <unk> <unk> de istorie <unk> , which notably states : 
 " In me you shall find a Romanian , but ever to the point where I would contribute in increasing <unk> , that is to say the mania of calling ourselves Romans , a passion currently reigning foremost in Transylvania and among some of the writers in Wallachia . " 
 Ibrăileanu additionally credited the Moldavian faction , Kogălniceanu included , with having helped introduce spoken Romanian into the literary language , at a time when both Ion Heliade Rădulescu and successors of the Transylvanian School made use of the dialect prevalent in Orthodox and Greek @-@ Catholic religious culture . This was in connection with Kogălniceanu 's advocacy of pragmatic Westernization : " Civilization never does banish the national ideas and habits , but rather improves them for the benefit of the nation in particular and of humanity in general " . He was adverse to fast cultural reforms , stressing that acclimatization was always required . 
 A generation younger than Ibrăileanu , George Călinescu also noted the contrast between Mihail Kogălniceanu and his predecessors , as two sets of " <unk> " intellectuals — in this contrast , Heliade Rădulescu was " hazy and egotistic " , whereas Kogălniceanu and others had " a mission which they knew how to translate into positive terms " . As a historian , Kogălniceanu notably introduced several more or less influential Romantic nationalist theses : after 1840 , he was noted for stressing the image of the 17th @-@ century Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave as a unifier of Romania , although this view had not been at all present in his earlier essays ; he proposed that the Romanian folk was among the first European peoples to record history in their national language , although the earliest Romanian @-@ language chronicles date back to the 17th century ; additionally , he argued that the Second Bulgarian Empire was a Romanian state . In some of his works , he claimed that Romanians traditionally practiced endogamy to preserve their purity . His 1837 study of the Romani people ( <unk> sur l 'histoire , les <unk> et la langue des <unk> , or " Sketch of the History , Mores and Language of the <unk> " ) is however still seen as a groundbreaking work in its field . According to historian <unk> Achim , while it " does not reach the standards of scientific research " , the book is still " a genuine contribution " to " <unk> " , and " a work of reference " . 
 As early as 1840 , Mihail Kogălniceanu was urging writers to seek inspiration for their work in Romanian folklore in creating a " cultured literature " . In 1855 , after the Wallachian revolution was defeated and most of its leaders went into exile , he noted that the lighter toll Russian intervention had in Moldavia contributed to the preservation of literature ; alongside similar statements made by Vasile Alecsandri , this allowed Ibrăileanu to conclude that , after 1848 , Moldavia played a bigger part in shaping the cultural landscape of Romania . Writing more than half a century after the critic , historian Lucian Boia also noted that , while Kogălniceanu stressed national unity , his discourse tended to place emphasis on Moldavian particularities . Also according to Ibrăileanu , Kogălniceanu and Alecu Russo have set the foundation for the local school of literary criticism , and , together , had announced the cultural professionalism advocated by Junimea after the 1860s . The latter conclusion was partly shared by Călinescu , Tudor Vianu and literary researcher Z. Ornea . Nevertheless , in its reaction against the 1848 generation , Junimea , and especially its main figure Titu Maiorescu , tended to ignore or outright dismiss Kogălniceanu 's causes and the attitudes he expressed . 
 While commenting on the differences between Moldavian and Wallachian literature , Paul Zarifopol gave a more reserved assessment of Kogălniceanu 's position , arguing that the emphasis he had placed on " national taste " would occasionally result in acclaim for mediocre writers such as Alexandru <unk> . Călinescu observed that much of Kogălniceanu 's own prose works imitated the style of his friend Costache Negruzzi , without carrying the same artistic weight , while noting that his few works of autobiography featured " pages of gracious [ and ] good @-@ natured melancholy " , which he attributed to the author 's traditional upbringing . Also among Kogălniceanu 's <unk> writings was <unk> <unk> în Iași ( " The Physiology of the Parochial Man in Iași " ) , closely based on a French model by Pierre Durand and , through it , echoing Jean <unk> Brillat @-@ Savarin 's Physiologie du goût . It was part of a series of such texts , popular in his generation and deemed " the first age of Romanian realism " by researcher Maria <unk> . Among the other pieces were two comedy plays , both written in 1840 , when he was co @-@ director of the National Theater Iași : <unk> <unk> <unk> unui <unk> ( " Two Women against One Man " ) and <unk> <unk> ( " The Happy Blind Man " ) . Kogălniceanu 's Notes sur l 'Espagne was published decades after his death , and received much critical acclaim .

 Mihail Kogălniceanu was married to Ecaterina <unk> ( 1827 – 1907 ) , the widow of Iorgu <unk> , a Moldavian Militia colonel ; they had more than eight children together ( three of whom were boys ) . The eldest son , Constantin , studied Law and had a career in diplomacy , being the author of an unfinished work on Romanian history . Ion , his brother , was born in 1859 and died in 1892 , being the only one of Mihail Kogălniceanu 's male children to have heirs . His line was still surviving in 2001 . Ion 's son , also named Mihail , established the Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation in 1935 ( in 1939 – 1946 , it published a magazine named Arhiva Românească , which aimed to be a new series of the one published during the 1840s ; its other projects were rendered ineffectual by the outbreak of World War II ) . 
 Vasile Kogălniceanu , the youngest son , was noted for his involvement in agrarian and left @-@ wing politics during the early 20th century . A founder of Partida <unk> ( which served as an inspiration for the Peasants ' Party after 1918 ) , he was a collaborator of Vintilă Rosetti in campaigning for the universal suffrage and legislating Sunday rest . A manifesto to the peasants , issued by him just before the Peasants ' Revolt of 1907 , was interpreted by the authorities as a call to rebellion , and led to Kogălniceanu 's imprisonment for a duration of five months . A member of the Chamber of Deputies for Ilfov County , he served as a rapporteur for the Alexandru Averescu executive during the 1921 debates regarding an extensive land reform . 
 Vasile 's sister Lucia ( or Lucie ) studied at a boarding school in Dresden during the late 1860s @-@ early 1870s . Her third husband , Leon Bogdan , was a local leader of the Conservatives in Neamț County ( according to the memoirist Constantin Argetoianu , Lucia was the one exercising real control over the organization 's branch ) . After the Conservative Party faded out of politics as a result of World War I , she came to support the People 's Party . Argetoianu later speculated that she was the most intelligent of the Kogălniceanu children , and claimed that Mihail Kogălniceanu had himself acknowledged this ( quoting him as saying , " too bad Lucie is not a boy " ) . She was the mother of eight ; one of her daughters , Manuela , married into the Ghica family . 
 Kogălniceanu 's nephew , Grigore , himself a local leader of the Conservative Party and a major landowner , married to Adela Cantacuzino @-@ <unk> , a member of the Cantacuzino family . He died in 1904 , leaving his wife a large fortune , which she spent on a large collection of jewels and fortune @-@ telling séances . Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920 ; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son , but this path was never pursued by authorities , who were quick to cancel the investigation ( at the time , they were faced with the major strikes of 1920 ) . 
 = = = Landmarks and portrayals = = = 
 Mihail Kogălniceanu 's residence in Iași is kept as a memorial house and public museum . His vacation house in the city , located in <unk> area and known locally as Casa cu turn ( " The House with a Tower " ) , was the residence of composer George Enescu for part of the Romanian Campaign , and , in 1930 , was purchased by the novelist Mihail Sadoveanu ( in 1980 , it became a museum dedicated to Sadoveanu 's memory ) . The Kogălniceanu property in <unk> , Bacău County , was sold and divided during the early 20th century . 
 Chronicles edited by Kogălniceanu and Costache Negruzzi were the source of inspiration for several historical novelists , beginning with Alexandru Odobescu . His relationship with the peasant representative to the ad hoc Divan , Ion Roată , is briefly mentioned in an anecdote authored by Ion Creangă ( Moș Ion Roată ) . He is also the subject of a short writing by Ion Luca Caragiale ( first published by <unk> in 1894 ) . Symbolist poet Dimitrie Anghel , whose father , the National Liberal parliamentarian Dimitrie A. Anghel , had been well acquainted with Kogălniceanu , authored a memoir detailing the fluctuating relationship between the two political figures , as well as detailing one of the former Premier 's last speeches . 
 Kogălniceanu is the subject of many paintings , and features prominently in Costin Petrescu 's fresco at the Romanian Athenaeum ( where he is shown alongside Cuza , who is handing a deed to a peasant ) . In 1911 , Iași became host to Kogălniceanu bronze statue by Raffaello <unk> , purported to have been recast from one of the sculptor 's older works . In 1936 , the Mihail Kogălniceanu Cultural Foundation commissioned Oscar Han to create a monument dedicated to Kogălniceanu , which was erected in Bucharest during the same year . Actors have portrayed Kogălniceanu in several Romanian films — most notably , Ion Niculescu in the 1912 <unk> României , and George Constantin in Sergiu Nicolaescu 's 1977 <unk> Independenței . During the latter stages of the Romanian Communist regime , under Nicolae Ceaușescu , Mihail Kogălniceanu 's image was present in official propaganda , alongside those of other historical figures who were considered progressive . 
 The historian 's name was given to several places and landmarks ; these include downtown Bucharest 's Mihail Kogălniceanu Square ( near the Izvor metro station , and housing Han 's sculpture ) and Mihail Kogălniceanu Boulevard , the Mihail Kogălniceanu commune in Constanța County , the Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport ( situated 26 km northwest of Constanța , and serving that city , the airport also houses a U.S. Military Forces base ) , and the Mihail Kogălniceanu University in Iași ( the first private university in Moldavia , founded in 1990 ) . In Lunéville , a plaque was dedicated to him by the French state .

 = Little Applegate River = 
 The Little Applegate River is a 21 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 34 km ) tributary of the Applegate River located in the U.S. state of Oregon . It is part of the Rogue River watershed , draining approximately 113 square miles ( 293 km2 ) of Jackson County . Rising in the Siskiyou Mountains , the river flows generally northwest to meet the Applegate about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northwest of Buncom and 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of Ruch . 
 The Little Applegate River 's watershed was originally settled about 11 @,@ 000 years ago by the Latgawa , Shasta , and Dakubetede Native American tribes . The first non @-@ indigenous settlers arrived in the early 19th century . Two boomtowns — Sterlingville and Buncom — were founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly as gold and other precious metals were discovered . They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted ; only three buildings remain in Buncom , while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed . 
 Despite low water quality , the Little Applegate watershed supports populations of coho and Chinook salmon , along with 138 known and 134 suspected species of other vertebrates . Sixty @-@ four percent of the watershed is forested , although its health is slowly declining due to fire suppression . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Little Applegate River arises at several springs near Siskiyou Peak , in the Siskiyou Mountains . It flows north , receiving McDonald Creek on the right , and Glade Creek on the left . Water is diverted into Sterling Ditch near the Little Applegate 's confluence with Glade Creek . Sterling Ditch is an approximately 23 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 37 km ) aqueduct , built in 1877 to provide water for hydraulic mining in the now destroyed town of Sterlingville . 
 About one mile past Sterling Ditch , the river turns west . It receives another major tributary , Yale Creek , on the left . Yale Creek drains nearly 24 square miles ( 62 km2 ) , making it the largest of the Little Applegate 's tributaries by watershed area . From Yale Creek , the Little Applegate flows northwest , receiving water from Sterling Creek on the right . The town of Buncom is located at the mouth of Sterling Creek . 
 The stream empties into the Applegate River about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northwest of Buncom and 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of Ruch , 34 miles ( 55 km ) above the Applegate 's confluence with the Rogue River . For fish swimming upstream , the Little Applegate is the last major tributary of the Applegate before the unpassable Applegate Dam . The Little Applegate River 's average discharge is 226 cubic feet per second ( 6 @.@ 40 m3 / s ) , but can range anywhere from 25 to 424 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 708 to 12 @.@ 0 m3 / s ) depending on the season and the amount of precipitation . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The Little Applegate drains approximately 113 square miles ( 293 km2 ) of southern Oregon . It makes up just under 15 percent of the Applegate River 's watershed , and just over 2 percent of the Rogue River basin . The Bureau of Land Management controls 40 percent of the watershed , and another 32 percent is owned by the United States Forest Service . Twenty @-@ seven percent is privately owned , and the state of Oregon controls less than one percent . Approximately 96 percent of the land is either forested or woodlots , while farmland and rural areas make up the remaining 4 percent . 
 The Little Applegate watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate ; the average annual precipitation in the watershed is 38 inches ( 970 mm ) , however as much as 55 inches ( 1 @,@ 400 mm ) and as little as 20 inches ( 510 mm ) have been recorded . Precipitation in the area consists of mostly rain , and occasionally snow in the higher elevations . 
 The primary rock types in the watershed are early Mesozoic metamorphosed sediments and volcanics , ultramafic deposits , and <unk> intrusions , like much of the Siskiyou Mountains . Elevations range from 1 @,@ 440 feet ( 438 @.@ 9 m ) at the river 's mouth to 7 @,@ 418 feet ( 2 @,@ 261 m ) at Dutchman Peak . Streams above about 5 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 700 m ) have lower gradients because those areas were heavily eroded by glaciers ; they then drop quickly until they reach the Little Applegate Valley at about 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) , which is fairly flat due to a high amount of alluvial deposits . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The watershed is covered predominantly by temperate coniferous forest , which makes up approximately 64 percent of the total area . The primary species in these areas are Douglas @-@ fir , ponderosa pine , madrone , and incense @-@ cedar . Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions . Several rare plants including Gentner 's fritillary , <unk> stonecrop , Siskiyou <unk> , clustered lady 's slipper , and <unk> Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed . Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified : three species of thistles , <unk> rye , Scotch broom , St. Johns wort , and tansy ragwort . 
 Prior to the 1940s , wildfires burned through the Little Applegate River watershed frequently . The United States Forest Service began fire suppression efforts in the 1920s , and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later . Species that depend on fire to reproduce — such as ponderosa pine — declined in population , while Douglas @-@ fir and white fir spread . Buckbrush and manzanita , normally chaparral plants , encroached on the oak savanna regions . The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser , making it more susceptible to insect infestations and disease . 
 One hundred thirty @-@ eight species of vertebrates are known to live in the Little Applegate 's watershed , while another 134 are suspected . Some 37 square miles ( 96 km2 ) of the watershed have been designated as Critical Habitat Units for the northern spotted owl , a critically endangered species . Two other species known to live in the watershed are included in the IUCN Red List : the endangered Siskiyou Mountains salamander , and the vulnerable western pond turtle . Bighorn sheep , gray wolves , grizzly bears , and pronghorns once inhabited the region , but are now considered extirpated . 
 The most common fish inhabiting the river include Chinook salmon , threatened coho salmon , and rainbow trout . Fish populations are declining , however , due to low water quality and barriers such as dams and culverts . 
 = = History = = 
 Humans have lived in the Little Applegate River watershed for approximately 11 @,@ 000 years , based on Clovis points discovered in the area . The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa , Shasta , and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans , descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia . They fished for salmon , trout , and lamprey , and hunted for deer and elk . They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas , and to promote the growth of certain crops . The fires were limited by the Native Americans , creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land , thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed . 
 The first European Americans to visit the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827 . The community of Buncom was founded by Chinese miners in 1851 when gold , silver , cinnabar , and chromite were discovered in nearby Jacksonville . In the spring of 1854 , James Sterling and Aaron Davis discovered gold in the Sterling Creek area , and hundreds of miners soon arrived . The town of Sterlingville was founded , and by October its population had risen to over 1 @,@ 500 . Mining lasted through the 1850s and 1860s , and much of the riverbeds of Sterling Creek and the lower Little Applegate River were excavated . The Sterling Ditch and several other ditches were constructed in the 1870s , providing water to large hydraulic mining operations in Sterlingville and surrounding regions . The Sterlingville mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon , and possibly the entire western United States . 
 The mining washed hundreds of thousands of tons of earth and sediment into the Little Applegate and its tributaries , devastated the landscape . The Sterlingville post office opened in 1879 , but was closed four years later as the town 's population declined . Buncom 's post office opened in 1896 . By 1910 , however , most mining operations had ended , and it was closed in 1918 . Hydraulic mines were reopened from 1933 to 1957 during the Great Depression . Three buildings remain in Buncom , but Sterlingville was abandoned and destroyed . 
 In the late 1990s , 41 irrigators in the lower watershed agreed to transfer their water rights to the nearby Applegate River ( supplemented by Applegate Lake ) , allowing for the removal of two large fish barriers on the Little Applegate River . The first , the Buck and Jones irrigation dam near Buncom , was removed in 2006 . The second , the Farmers Ditch irrigation dam , was removed in 2012 . Altogether , the removal of the two dams returned 15 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 42 m3 / s ) of water back to the Little Applegate River and opened up 35 miles ( 56 km ) of streams to migrating fish . 
 = = Pollution = = 
 The water quality of the Little Applegate River watershed is generally poor due to high temperatures , sedimentation , and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region . Most of these problems are created by human activity ; forests and riparian zones have been cleared to make way for agriculture , and high road densities cause slope failures . Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape , leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream . Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century ; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed , reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread . Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion . Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries , sometimes to such an extent that the mouth is left nearly dry . 
 A major contributor to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch , an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek . Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek , the ditch has failed numerous times , sending several tons of dirt and mud downstream . The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $ 10 @,@ 000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010 , and applied for a $ 100 @,@ 000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes . 
 = River Rother , East Sussex = 
 The River Rother flows for 35 miles ( 56 km ) through the English counties of East Sussex and Kent . Its source is near Rotherfield in East Sussex , and its mouth is on Rye Bay , part of the English Channel . Prior to 1287 , its mouth was further to the east at New Romney , but it changed its course after a great storm blocked its exit to the sea . It was known as the <unk> until the sixteenth century . For the final 14 miles ( 23 km ) , the river bed is below the high tide level , and Scots Float sluice is used to control levels . It prevents salt water entering the river system at high tides , and retains water in the river during the summer months to ensure the health of the surrounding marsh habitat . Below the sluice , the river is tidal for 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) . 
 The river has been used for navigation since Roman times , and is still navigable by small boats as far as Bodiam Castle . It flowed in a loop around the northern edge of the Isle of Oxney until 1635 , when it was diverted along the southern edge . Scots Float Sluice was built before 1723 , when the engineer John Reynolds made repairs to it , and later extended it , to try to keep the channel clear of silting , but it was criticised by John Rennie in 1804 , as it was inconvenient to shipping . The river became part of a defensive line to protect England from the threat of invasion by the French in the early 1800s , when its lower section and part of the River Brede formed a link between the two halves of the Royal Military Canal . Scots Float Sluice was again rebuilt in 1844 . Some 31 square miles ( 80 km2 ) of the valley were inundated by floodwater in 1960 , which resulted in the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme being implemented between 1966 and 1980 . The river banks were raised , and 20 pumping stations were installed . 
 The river has been managed by a number of bodies , including the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers , the Rye Harbour Commissioners , and the Board of Conservators for the River Rother . After the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930 , it was managed by the Rother and Jury 's Gut Catchment Board , the Kent River Board , the Kent and Sussex River Authorities , the National Rivers Authority and finally the Environment Agency . It is unusual , in that while it is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency , it has been a free river since 1826 , and so no licence is required to use it . Management of the levels adjacent to the river is undertaken by the Romney Marshes Area Internal Drainage Board . The Rother passes by or near the villages of Etchingham , Robertsbridge , Bodiam , <unk> , and Wittersham . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The modern name of the river is comparatively recent , probably dating from around the sixteenth century . It is derived from the village and hundred of Rotherfield , located where the river rises . Rotherfield means ' open land of the cattle ' , based on the Old English <unk> @-@ <unk> . Prior to being called the Rother , it was known as the <unk> throughout its length . This is a Celtic word meaning ' river ' . In several Anglo @-@ Saxon charters , it is suffixed with <unk> , appearing as <unk> , where the suffix also means ' river ' , but in Old English . During the thirteenth century , it was known as the River of Newenden . 
 = = Hydrology = = 
 The Rother rises in the High Weald of Sussex , at around 490 feet ( 150 m ) above ordnance datum ( AOD ) , and descends rapidly . It is joined by the River <unk> at Etchingham and the River Darwell at Robertsbridge , and by the time it reaches Udiam , it is only 7 feet ( 2 m ) AOD . Average annual rainfall in the High Weald is 35 inches ( 900 mm ) , and most of the underlying geology is impermeable , resulting in rain rapidly reaching the river and flowing down to the sea . The river valley is thus prone to winter floods , while during the summer months , the flow can be quite low in dry periods , as there are few groundwater aquifers . Between Udiam and Bodiam , the bed of the river drops below sea level , and the lower river flows slowly . The surrounding land is crossed by networks of canals and ditches , which are pumped into the river during the winter to drain the land . During the summer , water is transferred in the other direction , to manage the habitat of the marshland . 
 Scots Float sluice , some 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 km ) from the mouth of the river , is used to control levels . The river below it is tidal , and it is closed as the tide rises , to prevent salt water passing up the river . During dry years , the sluice may be kept closed for most of the summer , as the water is used to maintain the marsh environment . A navigation lock bypasses the sluice . If heavy rainfall coincides with a high tide , where outflow is tide @-@ locked , the river above the sluice to Bodiam acts as a huge holding reservoir for flood water , and is managed as such . In times of high flow , water is also pumped from the river into Darwell Reservoir , which can hold 167 million cubic feet ( <unk> Ml ) of water . It covers an area of 154 acres ( 62 ha ) and was built between 1937 and 1949 . Since the 1980s , its output has been taken by pipeline to Beauport Park , from where it provides a public water supply for Hastings . 
 = = History = = 
 Near its mouth , the River Rother no longer follows its ancient course , as it once flowed across Romney Marsh and joined the sea at Dungeness . It is widely asserted that in 1287 a hurricane , known as the Great Storm , caused large quantities of shingle and mud to be deposited on the port of Romney and the mouth of the river . The water from the river created a new channel , joining the River Brede and the River Tillingham near Rye , where the combined rivers flow into the sea . However , Tatton @-@ Brown has argued that patterns of occupation on Romney Marsh suggest that the change of route took place at least a century before that date . Rye became part of the Cinque Ports in the thirteenth century , and although it is situated some distance from the sea , its harbour is still visited by commercial shipping and has a fleet of fishing boats . 
 = = = Early developments = = = 
 The river is known to have been used for shipping in Roman times , when it was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream . There are records of small boats reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods . Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the fourteenth century , and iron was shipped from Newenden or Udiam in the sixteenth century . A century later , an iron store was erected at Udiam . Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden , while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe . 
 The Isle of Oxney is an area of higher land to the west of Appledore , which is isolated from high ground to its north and south . The valley around the northern edge of it was known as the Upper Levels , while that to the south was called the Wittersham Levels , and had its own Commission of Sewers . The Rother had been routed around the northern side of the Isle since the 1330s , when the Knelle Dam was built at the western end of the Wittersham Levels . The sea was prevented from entering the levels by the Wittersham Sea Wall , built across the eastern end of the valley . This enabled some of the levels to be used for agriculture all year round , although some was only suitable for summer grazing . A perennial problem with the river was that the tides deposited large quantities of silt in the channel , and during the summer months the flow of the river was insufficient to scour the silt away . As a result , some 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) of the Upper Levels were " drowned lands " by 1629 , meaning that they were persistently flooded , and another 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) were only usable in the summer months . 
 From the 1600s onwards , much effort and expense had been spent trying to drain the Upper Levels , including the construction of the Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore . Its purpose was to limit the inflow of the tide , and to control the outflow of the river . The works were not particularly successful , and negotiations were started with the Commissioners of the Wittersham Levels to divert the river through those levels . After initial reluctance , an agreement was reached in February 1631 . The western end of the levels , from Kent Wall to the Knelle Dam , was to be used as an " <unk> " , essentially a holding reservoir for river water and some sea water , which would be released in a controlled way to scour the main channel . An embanked channel called the New Salt Channel was constructed across the levels between Kent Wall and a new sluice in the Wittersham Sea Wall . The river was flowing to the south of the Isle by 4 May 1635 , an on 4 October , the navigation was also routed along the new channel , reducing its length by 5 miles ( 8 km ) . The former channel to the north became known as the Reading Sewer . 
 Disaster occurred on Lady Day 1644 , when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels , and broke through the walls of the New Salt Channel . The Commissioners authorised the construction of a new sea sluice at Kent Wall , and work began in May 1646 , but in September , they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead . The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted , in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel , and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage . The Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore deteriorated , and failed in 1650 . A new sluice with three channels was built in 1669 . The financial burden on the Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge , as they had to pay rent on all land that was not available to its original owners , and so in 1671 , an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels . Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley , and was largely completed by 1684 . The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother , which was built along the southern edge of the valley . It was called the Craven Channel , and ended at Craven Sluices . 
 When repairs to Craven Sluices were necessary in 1684 , the water was temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel . This worked well , and a regulating <unk> was built , so that water could be routed to Craven Sluices or Scots Float . Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686 , and land above it was reclaimed . In 1696 , New Knock Sluice was built , close to Craven Sluices , and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels . 
 In 1723 , the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels employed the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice , a timber lock on the lower river . He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations , and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725 , for which he would be paid £ 65 per year . He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years . <unk> of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s . Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729 , and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet . Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s , so that all the runoff passed through Scots Float . Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects . 
 = = = Navigation = = = 
 Vessels used on the river were Rye sailing barges , which were about 45 by 12 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 by 3 @.@ 7 m ) in size , with a draught of 2 @.@ 75 feet ( 0 @.@ 84 m ) . A pamphlet published in 1802 announced that there were 16 barges operating on the river , whereas there had only been three some ten years earlier . The main cargoes were manure , fuel and <unk> , and the places served by the river were listed as Appledore , Reading Street , Maytham Wharf , Newenden , Bodiam and Small Hythe . Boats also worked along part of the <unk> Channel towards Tenterden . The river did not have a towing path , and the boats were bow @-@ hauled by men . Scots Float Sluice was <unk> as being " very inconvenient and ill @-@ adapted to the present vessels which navigate the Rother " by the civil engineer John Rennie in 1804 . 
 The end of the eighteenth century was a turbulent period ; Britain was at war with France from 1793 to 1802 . Hostilities between the two countries ceased with the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 , but in 1803 , the Napoleonic Wars began , and there were fears that France would invade England . In order to frustrate such an attack , the Royal Military Canal was proposed . This was initially a small canal near Hythe , but was extended during its planning phase to Cliff End , near Pett in East Sussex . The canal would join the River Rother at Iden and the river would become part of the defence system , as would the course of the River Brede from Rye to Winchelsea . Completion was scheduled for June 1805 , but construction did not start until late 1804 , and by the time it was completed in 1809 , invasion was thought to be unlikely . 
 The Rother Levels Acts were two Acts of Parliament which were obtained in 1826 and 1830 . The Commissioners of the Rother Levels were obliged by the acts to ensure that navigation between Scots Float and Bodiam Bridge was possible , and that all bridges provided at least 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) of headroom . They also enshrined the principle that it was a free river , and no tolls were to be collected for its use . The Rennie brothers , John and George , who had taken over from their father on his death in 1821 , produced two reports on the river in 1830 , as it was difficult to navigate and prone to flooding . They were critical of the way in which tidal water was allowed to enter the river through Scots Float Sluice , and thought that the river channel was too circuitous , which resulted in shoals forming . The Rennie brothers also criticised the angles at which bridges crossed the channel . William Cubitt and James Elliott rebuilt Scots Float Sluice in 1844 . 
 Iden Lock connected the Royal Military Canal to the river . The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture , carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909 . After that , the lock was replaced by a sluice , severing the navigable connection . The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times , when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice , then called Star Lock , to Bodiam Castle were offered . The lower river is currently used for moorings , and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle . 
 = = = Flooding = = = 
 In 1960 , there was extensive flooding of the Rother Valley , with some 31 square miles ( 80 km2 ) inundated , and in some areas the water did not recede for several months . In 1962 the Kent River Board introduced a bill to Parliament , which would authorise improvements to the river banks , with the construction of a sluice and associated lock below Rye , to prevent tidal flooding . At the time , the river was used by a fishing fleet of at least ten trawlers , and a freighter of 250 tons used the river for a trade in timber . There was some concern in the House of Lords that the lock would not be large enough to accommodate the freighter , although it would be possible to open both sets of lock gates when the tide level was suitable . The bill did not become an Act of Parliament , due to lack of parliamentary time , and so the sluice was not constructed . However , the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme began in 1966 , and was completed in 1980 . This involved raising the level of the <unk> along much of the river . Those in the Wet Level , an area of 690 acres ( 280 ha ) between the junction with the Maytham Sewer and Blackwall Bridge , were not raised as much , so that during periods of high flow when the river is tide @-@ locked , the levels can be used for flood storage . The scheme included the installation of 20 pumping stations , which raise water from the low @-@ lying marshes into the embanked river using Archimedes ' screw pumps . Some of the drainage ditches in the marshland had to be reconfigured to deliver the water to the pumping stations . 
 = = Jurisdiction = = 
 Responsibility for the river has resided with a number of legal bodies in the past . The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers , who were established by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531 . The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners , after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731 . In 1872 , the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river . As in many parts of Britain , the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped , and by the early twentieth century , the situation was chaotic . An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930 , with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930 , under which 47 catchment areas were established , and a Catchment Board was then created for each one , with overall responsibility for that area . Thus the Rother and Jury 's Gut Catchment Board was created . While the board had overall responsibility , local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of Internal Drainage Boards , and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of Sewers as Internal Drainage Boards , under the terms of the act . 
 The River Board Act of 1950 sought to replace the Catchment Boards with larger organisations , and from 1950 the East Sussex River Board took over the responsibilities of most of the catchments in East Sussex , but the Rother and Jury 's Gut Catchment Board became part of the Kent River Board . Further changes followed the Water Resources Act 1963 , and responsibility passed to the Kent and Sussex River Authorities in 1964 . Ten years later , these structures were replaced by unitary authorities , who had responsibility for the supply of drinking water and for the drainage function of rivers . This lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989 , which split apart the two functions , and management of the river became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority , Southern Region . Finally in April 1996 , the National Rivers Authority was abolished with the formation of the Environment Agency . The agency has responsibility for drainage and water quality , and in the case of some rivers , it holds the navigation rights . The Rother is unusual , in that while it is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency , it is a free river , and so a licence is not required to use it . The Environment Agency also acts as the harbour authority for Rye Harbour , another unique situation , and the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs acts as a signatory to the Harbour of Rye Bylaws . 
 The Environment Agency has powers to manage flood control on main rivers , which are defined by a series of statutory main river maps , and for water quality on all watercourses . Responsibility for watercourses other than the main rivers resides with Internal Drainage Boards ( IDBs ) . The Rother is a main river below Mayfield . Internal Drainage Boards have tended to amalgamate to cover larger areas , and the Romney Marshes Area IDB formed from the Romney Marsh Levels , the <unk> Marsh , the <unk> and <unk> , the Rother and the Pett IDBs . It manages 220 miles ( 350 km ) of drainage ditches and watercourses , although most of the pumping stations which pump water from the drainage ditches into the Rother are owned by the Environment Agency .

 The River Rother rises from several springs on the south @-@ eastern side of Cottage Hill near Rotherfield in East Sussex . The hill is 653 feet ( 199 m ) above sea level at the top , and the springs are found near the 520 @-@ foot ( 160 m ) and 445 @-@ foot ( 136 m ) contours . The River Medway rises on the north @-@ eastern slopes of the same hill , and flows in the opposite direction . The Rother flows towards the south east , picking up water from other streams , to reach the western edges of Mayfield , where it is crossed by the <unk> road . A little before the bridge is the site of <unk> Furnace , a scheduled ancient monument . 
 The river curves to the east along the southern edge of Mayfield , passing a sewage works on the south bank and crossing under an abandoned railway embankment and a road at St Dunstan 's Bridge . A tributary joins from the south , which once drove Moat Mill . The mill house dates from the seventeenth century , is timber framed and has been faced with red brick on the ground floor while the attached three @-@ storey mill building dates from the following century . It has been converted into a house , although most of the mill machinery is still present , but has been isolated from the living space by glass panels . 
 The river is joined by two more tributaries , one from the north and the second from the south , after which it is crossed by a minor road at <unk> Bridge . It drops below the 148 @-@ foot ( 45 m ) contour soon afterwards . The next bridges are Turks Bridge and <unk> Forge Bridge . Tide Brook joins from the north , and Witherenden Mill , a two @-@ storey building that was originally the mill house is below the junction . In its grounds are two grade II listed <unk> and a two @-@ storey granary . The railway line , which was following the valley of the Tide Brook , runs parallel to the river as it continues eastwards , passing to the north of Burwash . 
 After Crowhurst Bridge , which carries the Burwash to Stonegate road over the river , the railway crosses to the south bank . By Etchingham railway station , the River <unk> joins from the north , the <unk> road crosses , and the River <unk> joins from the southwest . Both the railway and the river turn to the south to reach Robertsbridge . Another tributary , which flows to the northwest from near a gypsum mine at <unk> , turns to the south and runs parallel to the Rother before joining it in Robertsbridge . There is a network of channels , as the River Darwell joins the river , and there was formerly a mill nearby . The mill was called Hodson 's Mill , and was part of Mill Farm . It burnt down in 1902 , and the Georgian farmhouse was subsequently demolished . The only original farm building still standing is part of an <unk> , dating from the late eighteenth century . 
 A little further to the east , the grade I listed Abbot 's House from the former Cistercian Abbey at Robertsbridge stands on the south side of the river . The Abbey was founded by Alured and Alicia de St Martin in 1176 , although the house was probably built between 1225 and 1250 . It was modified in the 1530s by Sir William Sydney , and again in the nineteenth century . An attic bedroom had a wooden fireplace dating from the 1830s , but surrounded by medieval tiles described by the National Heritage List as being of " superlative quality . " There are additional ruins near Abbey Farmhouse . 
 The river turns towards the northeast , passing under an abandoned railway bridge and dropping below the 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) contour to reach Bodiam . A local road crosses the river at Bodiam Bridge , and passes through the site of a Romano @-@ British settlement to the south of the bridge . 
 = = = Navigable section = = = 
 Beyond the bridge is Bodiam railway station , the western terminus of the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 2000 . On the north bank of the river is Bodiam Castle , built soon after 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge . Lord Curzon restored the ruins in 1919 and gave them to the National Trust six years later . The buildings are grade I listed , and the landscaped grounds , which include a millpond and a Second World War pillbox , are a scheduled ancient monument . 
 For the final 14 miles ( 23 km ) from Bodiam to the sea , the bed of the river is below the high @-@ water mark of neap tides , and there are numerous drainage ditches traversing the valley floor . The river is embanked , with sluices and pumping stations along its banks , which discharge water drained from the low @-@ lying land into the river channel . The Kent Ditch joins on the northern bank , and forms the boundary between the counties of Kent and East Sussex . After the junction , the boundary runs along the centre of the river . 
 At Newenden , Newenden Bridge carries the A28 road over the channel . It was built with three arches in 1706 , but in an earlier Medieval style . <unk> lies just to the south . A loop to the south takes the river under the Kent and East Sussex Railway , and into an area known as the Rother Levels . The county boundary now follows a small channel to the north , which was the main channel when the river passed around the northern edge of the Isle on Oxney prior to 1635 . The boundary joins the <unk> Channel near Maytham Wharf , and rejoins the river when the channel does . Next , <unk> 's Heath Channel joins . 
 The short channel splits into <unk> Channel and Reading Sewer a little further to the north , the first flowing southwards , and the second originally flowing northwards , when it was the main channel for the River Rother . A public footpath follows the eastern bank of <unk> 's Heath Channel , and continues along the north bank of the river to Blackwall Bridge , where it becomes part of the Sussex Border Path , a long @-@ distance footpath that follows the county boundary . 
 The low @-@ lying land through which the channel passes is called the Rother Levels . Soon after New Bridge carries Wittersham Road over the river , the channel turns to the south , to run along the eastern edge of <unk> Marsh . The Military Road , which was built along the landward side of the Royal Military Canal , crosses to the western bank of the river just before Iden Lock , the disused entrance to the canal . The lock structure contains a sluice mechanism , which is used to regulate water levels in the canal , but during the summer months , water is pumped from the river into the canal , from where it irrigates the marshes . 
 The Military Road continues to follow the west bank , while the Saxon Shore Way footpath follows the eastern bank . Next comes Scots Float Lock , below which the river is tidal . As it approaches the eastern edge of Rye , it is crossed by a fixed truss bridge which carries the <unk> railway line . The bridge was installed in 1903 , and replaced a swing bridge erected in 1851 during the construction of the railway , which opened in 1852 . Monk Bretton Bridge carries the A259 New Road , and below that , the Rother is joined by the River Brede at the southern edge of Rye . The river channel is quite wide , and is known as Rye Harbour . There is also a village called Rye Harbour , at the southern end of the wide section . 
 There was a wharf on the river in 1874 , served by a railway line , and sidings which were used to collect shingle . By 1909 , the wharf had been replaced by a landing stage slightly further downstream , which was also served by the railway . As it nears the sea , a Martello tower , built in 1806 to protect against French invasion , stands to the west of the channel . It is numbered 28 , and was one of many such structures built at the time . Nearby is an Inshore Rescue station , run by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution The river then enters Rye Bay , part of the English Channel .

 = Harveys Lake ( Pennsylvania ) = 
 Harveys Lake ( also known as Harvey Lake or Harvey 's Lake ) is a natural lake in Luzerne County , Pennsylvania . It has a surface area of approximately 621 @.@ 5 acres , or nearly a square mile . The lake is situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake . By volume , it is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania , and by surface area , is the second @-@ largest lake . It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek , a tributary of the Susquehanna River . The lake has a stone masonry dam . The lake 's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres . The majority of the watershed is forested , but there is some developed land as well . Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself , and the lake is surrounded entirely by a paved road . 
 Harveys Lake was affected by algae blooms from the mid @-@ 20th century onward , and these algae blooms were caused by pollution of nutrients , especially phosphorus . The lake was identified as impaired in 1994 , with an annual phosphorus load of 1 @,@ 019 pounds ( 462 kg ) . However , the phosphorus load has been reduced somewhat since then . The lake is listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory . A number of rare or endangered plant species have been observed in its vicinity . Various species of fish inhabit the lake and a number of bird species have been observed in its vicinity . 
 Harveys Lake was accidentally discovered by Benjamin Harvey in 1781 . The first settlers arrived at the lake in the 1790s and 1800s . Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming , but it became well known as a summer resort in the latter part of the 1800s and into the 1900s . It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s . However , the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994 . Since 1968 , the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake .

 Harveys Lake is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania by volume and the second @-@ largest by surface area . It has a surface area of 621 @.@ 5 acres and an average depth of 36 feet ( 11 meters ) , as well as a maximum depth of 102 feet ( 31 m ) . The lake 's shoreline is 8 @.@ 3 miles ( 13 @.@ 4 km ) long . By surface area , it was approximately twice its current size when it was first surveyed in the late 1700s . 
 Harveys Lake is situated in the borough of Harveys Lake , and it is 12 miles ( 19 km ) northwest of the city of Wilkes @-@ Barre . 
 Harveys Lake is of glacial origin . It is surrounded by steep hills on all sides . At their highest point , to the south of the lake , the hills reach 410 feet ( 120 m ) above the lake 's elevation . The lake has a gravel bottom . 
 The main outflow of Harveys Lake is Harveys Creek , a tributary of the Susquehanna River . The lake 's major inflows include two unnamed streams with widths between 4 and 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 and 2 @.@ 4 m ) and depths of 6 inches ( 15 cm ) . Springs also feed into it . The lake 's elevation is 1 @,@ 253 feet ( 382 m ) above sea level . The lake is located in north @-@ central Luzerne County , in the Lower North Branch Susquehanna drainage basin and the Upper Susquehanna - Lackawanna basin . 
 A 1921 book described the shape of Harveys Lake as " very irregular " . The lake has a maximum length of 15 @,@ 640 feet ( 4 @,@ 770 m ) and a maximum width of 4 @,@ 960 feet ( 1 @,@ 510 m ) . It has a capacity of 7 @.@ 733 billion US gallons ( 29 @.@ 27 million cubic metres ) . Harveys Lake is dammed by a stone masonry dam with two spillways . The dam is 120 feet ( 37 m ) long and 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high . 
 Harveys Lake was described as " one of the most beautiful " lakes in Pennsylvania in Henry C. Bradsby 's 1893 book History of Luzerne County , Pennsylvania . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 Harveys Lake is situated in the United States Geological Survey quadrangles of Harveys Lake and <unk> . The watershed of the lake has an area of 3 @,@ 600 acres ( 1 @,@ 500 ha ) . Most of the watershed is in Luzerne County , but its northeasternmost portion is in Wyoming County . 
 The vast majority ( 2 @,@ 841 acres [ 1 @,@ 150 ha ] ) of the watershed of Harveys Lake is forested land . Developed land and farmland comprise 499 acres ( 202 ha ) and 154 @.@ 7 acres ( 62 @.@ 6 ha ) , respectively . Unpaved roads make up 2 @.@ 5 acres ( 1 @.@ 0 ha ) of the watershed . The majority of the developed land in the watershed is directly on the shoreline and nearly all is within 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) of the lake . Most of the developed land is used for residential and commercial purposes . One developed area in the watershed is known as Hemlock Gardens , which occupies an area of 28 acres ( 11 ha ) and has 26 homes . The development had steep slopes ( 8 to 18 percent grade ) , unpaved roads , and no infrastructure for dealing with stormwater . However , a nutrient @-@ separating baffle box and a water polishing unit were installed in the development , reducing the phosphorus load of Harveys Lake by an estimated 36 pounds ( 16 kg ) per year . 
 The shoreline of Harveys Lake is entirely surrounded by a paved road , which is atypical for a lake shoreline . Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake , and significant development has occurred in the vicinity of the lake . A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake ; its purpose is to control small @-@ scale local road flooding . 
 = = Hydrology = = 
 Although Harveys Lake 's waters were described as having " great purity " in 1893 , the lake has experienced nutrient pollution , especially from phosphorus since at least the mid @-@ 20th century . Algae blooms occurred on the lake and caused a reduction in water quality throughout the latter half of the 20th century . A sewage system was installed in the borough of Harveys Lake in the summer of 1976 , but this did not completely stop the algae blooms . However , the phosphorus load in the lake has been reduced by 29 percent . The lake was identified as impaired in 1994 , with the cause of the impairment being large algae blooms and sedimentation in some areas . It is an anoxic lake . 
 In the 1990s , the concentration of phosphorus in the waters of Harveys Lake was measured to be 0 @.@ 031 milligrams per liter . The annual load of phosphorus was 1 @,@ 019 pounds ( 462 kg ) per year . The lake 's total maximum daily load for phosphorus is 0 @.@ 024 milligrams per liter and 789 pounds ( 358 kg ) per year . 
 In the 1990s , 255 pounds ( 116 kg ) of the annual phosphorus load of Harveys Lake came from internal loading , 233 pounds ( 106 kg ) came from groundwater , 199 pounds ( 90 kg ) came from developed land , and 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) came from shorelines . Smaller sources of phosphorus included farmland ( 95 pounds ( 43 kg ) per year ) , forests ( 51 pounds ( 23 kg ) per year ) , septic systems ( 33 pounds ( 15 kg ) per year ) , and unpaved roads ( 3 @.@ 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) per year ) . 
 The hydraulic residence time of Harveys Lake is 1116 days . The lake causes substantially reduced peak flood flows on Harveys Creek . Visibility in the lake is typically approximately 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . However , it can be as low as 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) or as high as 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) . 
 = = History and recreation = = 
 Harveys Lake was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2 , 1979 . Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is <unk> . Lake Township is named after the lake . 
 Harveys Lake is named after Benjamin Harvey , a member of the Sons of Liberty and among the first settlers of the Wyoming Valley . Harvey inadvertently discovered the lake in 1781 , while returning home after being held as a prisoner of war in Fort Niagara . The first resident in the vicinity of the lake was Matthew <unk> , who arrived in the early 1790s , but the first settlers were the <unk> , who arrived in 1806 . The lake was first surveyed by Christopher <unk> in 1794 , and the first person of European descent to explore the lake by canoe was Andrew Bennett , in 1800 . 
 The early settlers in the vicinity of Harveys Lake mainly engaged in lumbering and farming , which was a common occupation . At one point during the 1800s , the mills of Hollenback & Urquhart were cutting more than a million board feet of lumber annually at the lake . However , by 1853 , summer resorts used by Wyoming Valley residents began appearing near the lake . Hotels such as the Lake House Hotel and later the Rhoads Hotel , the Lake Grove Hotel , and the Grand Hotel Oneonta were among the hotels on the lake in the late 1800s . Grand Hotel Oneonta was especially prominent in the early 1900s , and former United States President Theodore Roosevelt visited the hotel in August 1912 . In the early 1900s , there were three hotels , two hundred cottages , and sixty boathouses on the lake , most of them at least 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) above the water line . 
 The Harvey Lake and Towanda Branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed in the late 1800s . It ran directly from Wilkes @-@ Barre to Harveys Lake . In the 1890s , railroad lines were constructed from the lake to the communities of Pittston and Towanda . 
 Harveys Lake has been popular for recreational purposes since the late 1800s . Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s . Around this time period , there were four steamboats on Harveys Lake . They were used for carrying passengers and freight . Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920 . A 60 @-@ foot ( 18 @-@ meter ) high Shoot the Chute was built in the area by Charles Shelley in 1910 . It was one of the largest attractions in the lake 's vicinity . A casino near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924 , but was demolished in 1980 . Devlin also opened the largest bowling alley in northeast Pennsylvania near the lake . Throughout the 20th century , prior to and after World War II , the lake attracted thousands of visitors yearly . 
 In the early 1900s , Harveys Lake was used as a water supply for Nanticoke , as a private ice supply , and as a summer resort . 
 Harveys Lake has been the subject of scientific studies since the late 1940s , when C. B. Reif conducted <unk> studies on it . By the 1960s , Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems . It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s . These studies indicated that the lake was eutrophic . Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990 . The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002 . 
 In modern times , the main recreational uses of Harveys Lake include swimming , fishing , and boating . However , it lacks public access locations for SCUBA diving . According to its TMDL document , the lake is " one of the most heavily used lakes in the area " . It has been situated within the borough of Harveys Lake since January 1 , 1968 , when the borough was incorporated . In 2004 , a plan to dredge and develop a patch of wetland for 30 boat slips near the lake was opposed due to safety concerns ( poor visibility ) as well as environmental concerns . 
 = = Biology = = 
 Harveys Lake is listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory . 
 Numerous rare or endangered plant species have been observed in the vicinity of Harveys Lake . Plants in the vicinity of the lake include Vasey 's pondweed , flat @-@ leaved pondweed , grassy pondweed , broad @-@ leaved water @-@ <unk> , and Beck 's water @-@ marigold . However , exotic and invasive plants such as <unk> and aquatic <unk> also inhabit the area and have altered the habitat in the vicinity of the lake . Second @-@ growth forests occur in the area surrounding the lake . 
 Algae blooms have occurred on Harveys Lake due to high levels of nutrients in the water . 
 Harveys Lake is inhabited by various species of native fish of Pennsylvania . In 1972 , Field and Stream noted that the lake was inhabited by rainbow trout , sockeye salmon , and some lake trout . As the basin of Harveys Creek upstream of the tributary Pikes Creek is designated as a High @-@ Quality Coldwater Fishery , the lake itself has the same designation . Harveys Lake has regulations permitting a creel limit of three trout per day , with only one being allowed to be more than 18 inches ( 46 cm ) long . 
 Various bird species have been observed in the vicinity of Harveys Lake . These include surf scoters and black scoters , which have been observed there in the winter . Although greater scaups are rare in Pennsylvania away from Lake Erie , one was observed at the lake in July 1992 . Franklin 's gulls have also been observed near the lake , as have snow buntings and black @-@ legged kittiwakes , and ruddy ducks . Nine brant geese were observed on the lake in May 1997 . 
 = LW4 ( classification ) = 
 LW4 is a para @-@ Alpine and para @-@ Nordic standing skiing sport class defined by the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) for skiers who may have a disability in one lower extremity , which may be a result of a leg amputation below the knee , knee arthrodesis or a hip arthrodesis . For international skiing competitions , classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing or IPC Nordic Skiing . A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions . 
 Skiers in this classification compete with one or two skis and two ski poles , except in para @-@ Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles . Skiers in this sport class may have a specially made ski boot with a prosthetic built into it . Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise . This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier . Compared to other skiers in the class , the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly . 
 A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition . The factoring for LW4 alpine skiing classification during the 2011 / 2012 skiing season was 0 @.@ 9961 for slalom , 0 @.@ 995 for giant slalom , 0 @.@ 9901 for Super @-@ G and 0 @.@ 9949 for downhill . In para @-@ Nordic skiing , the percentage for the 2012 / 2013 ski season was 96 % for classic and 96 % for free . While LW4 was not grouped with others classes at an event in the 1980s , it became grouped with other classifications during the 1990s and 2000s . Eligible events for this classification included 1986 World Disabled Ski Championships , 1988 World Winter Games for the Disabled , 1990 Disabled Alpine World Championships , 1992 Winter Paralympics , 1994 Winter Paralympics , 1996 Disabled Alpine World Championships in Lech , Austria , 1998 Winter Paralympics and 2002 Winter Paralympics . Skiers in this classification include Australian Scott Adams and New Zealanders Steve Bayley and Patrick Cooper . 
 = = Definition = = 
 This classification is used in para @-@ Alpine and para @-@ Nordic standing skiing , where LW stands for Locomotor Winter . Skiers in this class have a disability in one lower extremity , which may be a result of a leg amputation below the knee , knee arthrodesis or a hip arthrodesis . If there are functional problems on the leg , the strength of the leg will be 30 or less , where a fully functional leg normally has a strength of 40 . Lower limb monoplegia is a type disability that is comparable to knee amputation for this class . Skiers may be in this class as a result of an amputation , or polio . 
 The International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) defined this classification for para @-@ Alpine as " Competitors with disabilities in a lower limb skiing with two normal skis and two poles ... Typical disability profile of the class is single below @-@ knee amputation . " While skiers with a fused knee and hip are eligible for this classification , skiers with fused ankles are not . In 2002 , the Australian Paralympic Committee described this classification as a standing skiing classification with " Two skis , two poles , disability in one leg below the knee . " For para @-@ Nordic skiing , the IPC defines this classification as " those with impairment in one lower limb below the knee . " Cross Country Canada described this classification as " Impairment in one lower limb below the knee . " 
 For international para @-@ Alpine skiing competitions , classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing . A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions . For para @-@ Nordic skiing events , classification is handled by IPC Nordic Skiing Technical Committee on the international level and by the national sports federation such as Cross @-@ Country Canada on a country by country level . When being assessed into this classification , a number of things are considered including reviewing the skiers medical history and medical information on the skier 's disability , having a physical and an in person assessment of the skier training or competing . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 Skiers in this classification compete with one or two skis and two ski poles , except in para @-@ Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles . Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied . Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions . In training , skiers can also use cants , wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use . The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees , though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class . 
 Some skiers with amputations may require the use of outriggers , a forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base which are fitted for the skier based the height of the skier 's hip joint when the skier is standing . Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight . They are customised for the specific needs of the skier . Skiers in this class may have a specially made ski boot with a prosthetic built into it . In the Biathlon , athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting . 
 = = Technique = = 
 Outriggers are used to stop using a technique that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down . When using the outrigger , skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes the location of the ski on the snow . Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able @-@ bodied skiers . Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise . This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier . Compared to other skiers in the class , the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly . 
 One of the skiing techniques used by this class is called the three track method , and was developed as part of the American Training System . One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle , knee and hip . This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity . The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis . This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill . The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again . The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain , followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop . After this , the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift . This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line , which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge . Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie , beginning turns , parallel turns , short swings and moguls . 
 In the Biathlon , all Paralympic athletes shoot from a prone position . 
 = = Sport = = 
 A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition . The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels , where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number . The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used . 
 In para @-@ Nordic skiing , which includes cross @-@ country skiing and biathlon events , this classification is grouped with other standing classes . For the 2003 / 2004 para @-@ Nordic skiing season , the percentage for the classic technique was 94 or 96 % and percentage for free was 96 % . The percentage for the 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 ski seasons was 96 % for classic and 96 % for free technique . The factoring for LW4 alpine skiing classification during the 2011 / 2012 skiing season was 0 @.@ 9961 for slalom , 0 @.@ 995 for giant slalom , 0 @.@ 9901 for Super @-@ G and 0 @.@ 9949 for downhill . The percentage for the 2012 / 2013 ski season was 96 % for classic and 96 % for free . 
 In para @-@ Alpine skiing events , this classification is grouped with standing classes who are seeded to start after visually impaired classes and before sitting classes in the slalom and giant slalom . In downhill , Super @-@ G and Super Combined , this same group competes after the visually impaired classes and sitting classes . A skier is required to have their ski poles or equivalent equipment planted in the snow in front of the starting position before the start of the race . The IPC advises event organisers to run the men 's standing ski group after the blind men 's group and before the blind women 's group . Women 's standing classes are advised to go last .

For women at the 1998 Winter Paralympics , the LW1 , LW3 , LW4 , LW5 and LW6 classes competed in one group . At the 2002 Winter Paralympics in alpine @-@ skiing , women 's LW3 , LW4 , LW6 / 8 and LW9 were grouped for the women 's Super @-@ G and downhill events , and LW3 , LW4 , and LW9 were grouped for the Slalom and Giant Slalom events .

 = Bharat Ratna = 
 The Bharat Ratna ( Hindi pronunciation : [ <unk> ̪ rt ̪ n ] ; Jewel of India ) is the highest civilian award of the Republic of India . Instituted in 1954 , the award is conferred " in recognition of exceptional service / performance of the highest order " , without distinction of race , occupation , position , or sex . The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts , literature , science , and public services , but the government expanded the criteria to include " any field of human endeavour " in December 2011 . The recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are made by the Prime Minister to the President , with a maximum of three nominees being awarded per year . Recipients receive a Sanad ( certificate ) signed by the President and a peepal @-@ leaf – shaped medallion ; there is no monetary grant associated with the award . Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence . 
 The first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were politician C. Rajagopalachari , philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , and scientist C. V. Raman , who were honoured in 1954 . Since then , the award has been bestowed on 45 individuals , including 12 who were awarded posthumously . The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1955 to permit them . The former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first individual to be honoured posthumously . In 2014 , cricketer Sachin Tendulkar , then aged 40 , became the youngest recipient ; while social reformer <unk> Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday . Though usually conferred on India @-@ born citizens , the Bharat Ratna has been awarded to one naturalised citizen , Mother Teresa , and to two non @-@ Indians , Pakistan national Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and former South African President Nelson Mandela . On 24 December 2014 , the Indian government announced the award to independence activist Madan Mohan Malaviya ( posthumously ) and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee . 
 The Bharat Ratna , along with other personal civil honours , was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980 , during the change in the national government ; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995 , when several public @-@ interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards . In 1992 , the government 's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death , including some members of his extended family . Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision , the press communiqué announcing Bose 's award was cancelled ; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred . 
 Several <unk> of the award have met with criticism . The posthumous awards for K. Kamaraj ( 1976 ) and M. G. Ramachandran ( 1988 ) were considered to have been aimed at placating the voters for the upcoming assembly elections and posthumous awards of Madan Mohan Malaviya ( 2015 ) and Vallabhbhai Patel ( 1991 ) drew criticism for they died before the award was instituted .

 On 2 January 1954 , a press communiqué was released from the office of the secretary to the President announcing the creation of two civilian awards — Bharat Ratna , the highest civilian award , and the three @-@ tier Padma Vibhushan , classified into " <unk> Warg " ( Class I ) , " <unk> Warg " ( Class II ) , and " <unk> Warg " ( Class III ) , which rank below the Bharat Ratna . On 15 January 1955 , the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards ; the Padma Vibhushan , the highest of the three , followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri . 
 There is no formal provision that recipients of the Bharat Ratna should be Indian citizens . It has been awarded to a naturalised Indian citizen , Mother Teresa in 1980 , and to two non @-@ Indians , Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of Pakistan in 1987 and the former South African president Nelson Mandela in 1990 . Sachin Tendulkar , at the age of 40 , became the youngest person and first athlete to receive the honour . In a special ceremony on 18 April 1958 , <unk> Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday . As of 2015 , the award has been conferred upon 45 people with 12 posthumous declarations . 
 The award was briefly suspended twice in its history . The first suspension occurred after Morarji Desai was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister in 1977 . His government withdrew all personal civil honours on 13 July 1977 . The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980 , after Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister . The civilian awards were suspended again in mid @-@ 1992 , when two Public @-@ Interest Litigations were filed , one in the Kerala High Court and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court , challenging the " constitutional validity " of the awards . The awards were reintroduced by the Supreme Court in December 1995 , following the conclusion of the litigation . 
 = = Regulations = = 
 The Bharat Ratna is conferred " in recognition of exceptional service / performance of the highest order " , without distinction of race , occupation , position , or sex . The award was originally confined to the arts , literature , science , and public services , as per the 1954 regulations . In December 2011 , the rules were changed to include " any field of human endeavour " . The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards , but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute , and Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first recipient to be honoured posthumously in 1966 . 
 Although there is no formal nomination process , recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President with a maximum number of three nominees being awarded per year . However , in 1999 , four individuals were awarded the honour . The recipient receives a Sanad ( certificate ) signed by the President and a medallion without any monetary grant . Under the terms of Article 18 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , the recipients cannot use the award as a prefix or suffix to their name , although recipients may use either the expressions " Awarded Bharat Ratna by the President " or " Recipient of Bharat Ratna Award " to indicate that they have been honoured with the award . The holders of the Bharat Ratna rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence . 
 As with many official announcements , recipients are announced and registered in The Gazette of India , a publication released by the Department of Publication , Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices ; without publication in the Gazette , conferral of the award is not considered official . Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored , both of which require the authority of the President , are registered in the Gazette . Recipients whose awards have been revoked are required to surrender their medals , and their names are struck from the register . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The original 1954 specifications of the award was a circle made of gold 1 3 ⁄ 8 inches ( 35 mm ) in diameter with a centred sun burst design on the obverse side . The text " Bharat Ratna " , in Devanagari Script , is inscribed on the upper edge in silver gilt with a wreath set along on the lower edge . A platinum State Emblem of India was placed in the centre of the reverse side with the national motto , " Satyameva Jayate " ( Truth alone triumphs ) in Devanagari Script , inscribed in silver @-@ gilt on the lower edge . 
 A year later , the design was modified . The current medal is in the shape of a peepal leaf , approximately 2 5 ⁄ 16 inches ( 59 mm ) long , 1 7 ⁄ 8 inches ( 48 mm ) wide and 1 ⁄ 8 inch ( 3 @.@ 2 mm ) thick and rimmed in platinum . The embossed sun burst design , made of platinum , on the obverse side of the medal has a diameter of 5 ⁄ 8 inch ( 16 mm ) with rays spreading out from 5 ⁄ 6 inch ( 21 mm ) to 1 ⁄ 2 inch ( 13 mm ) from the center of the Sun . The words " Bharat Ratna " on the obverse side remained the same as the 1954 design as did the emblem of India and " Satyameva Jayate " on the reverse side . A 2 @-@ inch @-@ wide ( 51 mm ) white ribbon is attached to the medal so it can be worn around the neck . In 1957 , the silver @-@ gilt decoration was changed to burnished bronze . The Bharat Ratna medals are produced at Alipore Mint , Kolkata along with the other civilian and military awards like Padma <unk> , Padma Bhushan , Padma Shri , and Param Veer Chakra . 
 = = Controversies = = 
 The Bharat Ratna has been surrounded by several controversies and multiple Public @-@ Interest Litigations ( PIL ) had been filed against the conferral of the award . 
 Subhas Chandra Bose ( 1992 ) 
 On 23 January 1992 , a press release was published by the President 's Secretariat to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose . The decision triggered much criticism and a PIL was filed in the Calcutta High Court to revoke the award . The petitioner took objection to the conferral of the award and its posthumous mention of Bose , saying that honouring a personality higher than the award is " ridiculous " , and it was an act of " carelessness " to classify such a person with past and future recipients . It said that the award cannot be conferred to Bose posthumously as the Government had not officially accepted his death on 18 August 1945 . The petitioner requested the whereabouts of Bose from 18 August 1945 till date , based on the information collected by the 1956 Shah Nawaz Committee and the 1970 Khosla Commission . Bose 's family members expressed their unwillingness to accept the award . 
 To deliver the judgement , the Supreme Court formed a Special Division Bench with Judge Sujata V. Manohar and G. B. Pattanaik . The Solicitor General noted that to confer the award per the appropriate regulations pertaining to the Bharat Ratna , Padma Vibhushan , Padma Bhushan , and Padma Shri , the name of the recipient must be published in The Gazette of India and entered in the recipients register maintained under the direction of the President . It was noted that only an announcement had been made by press communiqué , but the government had not proceeded to confer the award by publishing the name in the Gazette and entering the name in the register . Furthermore , the then presidents , R. Venkataraman ( 1987 – 92 ) and Shankar Dayal Sharma ( 1992 – 97 ) , had not conferred a Sanad ( certificate ) with their signature and seal . 
 On 4 August 1997 , the Supreme Court delivered an order that since the award had not been officially conferred , it cannot be revoked and declared that the press communiqué be treated as cancelled . The court declined to pass any judgement on the posthumous mention of Bose and his death . 
 Civilian awards as " Titles " ( 1992 ) 
 In 1992 , two PILs were filed in the High Courts ; one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 by Balaji Raghavan and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court ( Indore Bench ) on 24 August 1992 by Satya Pal Anand . Both petitioners questioned the civilian awards being " Titles " per an interpretation of Article 18 ( 1 ) of the Constitution . On 25 August 1992 , the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards . A Special Division Bench of the Supreme Court was formed comprising five judges ; A. M. Ahmadi C. J. , Kuldip Singh , B. P. Jeevan Reddy , N. P. Singh , and S. Saghir Ahmad . On 15 December 1995 , the Special Division Bench restored the awards and delivered a judgement that the " Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution " . 
 C. N. R. Rao and Sachin Tendulkar ( 2013 ) 
 Following the announcement , in November 2013 , that C. N. R. Rao and Sachin Tendulkar were to be awarded the Bharat Ratna , multiple PILs were filed challenging the conferring of the award . The PIL filed against Rao declared that other Indian scientists , such as Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai , had contributed more than Rao and his claim of publishing 1400 research papers was " physically impossible " . The suit stated that as Rao had proven cases of plagiarism , he should not be presented with the award but rather should be annulled . The PIL filed against Tendulkar to the Election Commission under the Right to Information Act indicated that the awarding him the Bharat Ratna was a violation of the model code of conduct . The petitioner noted that as Tendulkar was an Indian National Congress nominated Member of Rajya Sabha , the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna would influence the voters of Delhi , Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , and Mizoram where the election process was underway at the time . Another PIL was filed against Tendulkar and a few ministers , " alleging a conspiracy to ignore " an Indian field hockey player Dhyan Chand . " 
 On 4 December 2013 , the Election Commission rejected the petition stating that conferring the award on people from non @-@ polling states did not amount to a violation of the code . Other High Courts as well rejected the petitions raised against Rao and Tendulkar . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 In 1988 , then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi ( 1984 – 89 ) conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously on film actor and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu , M. G. Ramachandran , in a bid to influence voters prior to the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1989 . The decision was criticised for awarding Ramachandran before independence activist B. R. Ambedkar and Vallabhbhai Patel , who were bestowed the honour in 1990 and 1991 respectively . While Ravi Shankar was accused of lobbying for the award , the decision by Indira Gandhi to posthumously honour K. Kamaraj was considered to have been aimed at placating Tamil voters for the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1977 . The seventh Prime Minister V. P. Singh was criticised for posthumously honouring B. R. Ambedkar to please Dalits . 
 The posthumous conferments of the award on the recipients who died before the Indian independence in 1947 or the award was instituted in 1954 have been criticised by historians . It was noted that such conferments could lead to more demands to honour people like Maurya Emperor Ashoka , Mughal Emperor Akbar , Maratha Emperor Shivaji , Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore , Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda , and independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak . The then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao ( 1991 – 96 ) was criticised for bestowing the award upon Vallabhbhai Patel in 1991 , 41 years after his death in 1950 ; and upon Subhas Chandra Bose in 1992 , who went missing since 18 August 1945 . Similarly in 2015 , the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's decision to award Madan Mohan Malaviya , who died in 1946 , met with the criticism . <unk> Dwivedi , politician of the Indian National Congress , said that Malaviya , who worked predominantly in Varanasi , was " deliberately chosen " by the Prime Minister Modi , who is the incumbent Member of Parliament from Varanasi . 
 A few of the conferments have been criticised for honouring personalities only after they received global recognition . The award for Mother Teresa was announced in 1980 , a year after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Satyajit Ray received an Academy Honorary Award in 1992 followed by the Bharat Ratna the same year . In 1999 , Amartya Sen was awarded the Bharat Ratna , a year after his 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences . The award was proposed by President K. R. Narayanan to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who agreed to the proposal . 
 = = Popular demands = = 
 Though , as per the statutes for the Bharat Ratna , the recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President , there have been several demands from various political parties to honour their leaders . In January 2008 , Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) leader L. K. Advani wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommending Singh 's predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the award . This was immediately followed by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) lobbying for their leader , Jyoti Basu , former Chief Minister of West Bengal . Basu , India 's longest @-@ serving chief minister , said that he would decline the honour , even if awarded . Similar such demands were made by Telugu Desam Party , Bahujan Samaj Party , and Shiromani Akali Dal for their respective leaders N. T. Rama Rao , Kanshi Ram , and <unk> Singh Badal . In September 2015 , a regional political party Shiv Sena demanded the award for the independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar stating that he had been " deliberately neglected by previous governments " but their family clarified that they are not making such demand and that the freedom fighter is known for his contribution towards independence movement and did not need an award for recognition . 
 Per the original statutes , sportspersons were not eligible for the Bharat Ratna ; however , a revision of the rules in December 2011 made eligible " any field of human endeavour " . Subsequently , several sportspersons ' names were discussed ; among the most talked @-@ about of these was field @-@ hockey player Dhyan Chand , who was recommended multiple times for the posthumous honour . In 2011 , 82 members of parliament recommended Chand 's name for the award to the Prime Minister 's Office . In January 2012 , the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports forwarded his name again , this time along with 2008 Summer Olympics gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra and mountaineer Tenzing Norgay . Bindra had earlier been recommended for the award in May 2013 by the National Rifle Association of India . In July 2013 , the ministry again recommended Dhyan Chand . However , in November 2013 , cricketer Sachin Tendulkar became the first sports @-@ person to receive the honour and this garnered much criticism for the government . 
 A PIL was filed in the Karnataka High Court where in the petitioner requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi . On 27 January 2014 , a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner , they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple times in the past and were forwarded to the Prime Minister 's Office . A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. <unk> and Justice B.V. <unk> dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government .

 Posthumous recipients 
 = Orator Shafer = 
 George W. Shafer [ sometimes spelled Shaffer or Schaefer ] ( October 1851 – January 21 , 1922 ) was an outfielder in Major League Baseball . Nicknamed " Orator " , because he was an avid speaker , Shafer played for 10 teams in four different major leagues between 1874 and 1890 . Though he was a good hitter who batted over .300 three times , Shafer was best known for his defensive abilities . He led the National League 's outfielders in assists four times . In 1879 , he set an MLB single @-@ season record with 50 outfield assists , which is a mark that has stood for over 130 years . He was considered by some to be the greatest right fielder of his era . 
 Shafer was 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) tall and weighed 165 pounds ( 75 kg ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 Shafer was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in 1851 . He was a " promising young Philadelphia amateur " before starting his professional baseball career in 1874 in the National Association . That year , he played in nine games for the Hartford Dark Blues and in one game for the New York Mutuals , with a cumulative batting average of .225 . His fielding percentage was a career @-@ low <unk> . The following season , he played 19 games for the Philadelphia Whites and batted .243 . 
 Shafer was known during his playing career by the nickname " Orator " . According to Alfred Henry Spink , founder of The Sporting News , he received the nickname because he " was a great stickler for his rights and talked to himself when not talking to the Umpire . " Another player of the era , future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Orator Jim O 'Rourke , shared the same nickname . 
 = = Major league regular = = 
 Shafer joined the National League 's Louisville Grays in 1877 . He earned a job as the team 's starting right fielder , and he led the league in games played ( 61 ) , outfield assists ( 21 ) , and outfield errors ( 28 ) . He also batted .285 and had the second @-@ most home runs in the league with three . ( Lip Pike had four homers . ) In 1878 , Shafer had one of his best seasons at the plate for the Indianapolis Blues . He batted .338 to finish sixth in the batting race and also ranked among the league leaders in on @-@ base percentage ( third ) , slugging percentage ( third ) , and total bases ( fourth ) . His OPS + total of 186 led the league , and his 3 @.@ 8 wins above replacement was the highest among all position players . Shafer also had 28 assists in the outfield . 
 In 1879 , Shafer signed with Cap Anson 's Chicago White Stockings . However , he had left Indianapolis the previous year with some unpaid debts . The White Stockings traveled to Indianapolis to play an exhibition game in June , and the local sheriff was waiting for both him and teammate Silver Flint . After the game , Shafer and Flint escaped the ballpark in a horse @-@ drawn carriage to avoid arrest , and only their manager , Anson , was taken to jail . 
 Shafer batted .304 for Chicago in 1879 and also set a career high by getting 50 assists . The 50 outfield assists was 20 more than any other NL player and established a major league record that has never been broken . 
 In 1880 , Shafer joined the Cleveland Blues and was their regular right fielder for the next three seasons . He continued his good hitting and fielding during his first year with the club , batting .266 with an OPS + of 125 and leading the league again with 35 assists . However , his batting average dropped to .257 the following season and then to .214 in 1882 . His fielding percentage dropped as well , from .901 in 1880 ( fourth in the league ) to <unk> in 1882 . 
 Shafer played for the Buffalo Bisons in 1883 . He batted .292 and led the NL in outfield assists for the fourth and final time , with 41 . He then signed with the St. Louis Maroons in the new Union Association for the 1884 season . Playing in a career @-@ high 106 games in 1884 , Shafer also batted a career @-@ high .360 and was one of the best hitters in the UA . He led the league with 40 doubles , and he finished second only to teammate Fred Dunlap in several other offensive categories , including batting average , on @-@ base percentage ( .398 ) , slugging percentage ( .501 ) , runs scored ( 130 ) , hits ( 168 ) , and total bases ( 234 ) . The Maroons went 94 – 19 and finished first in the Union Association . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Shafer stayed with St. Louis as they moved to the National League in 1885 ; his batting average fell to .195 . The following season , he played 21 games for the American Association 's Philadelphia Athletics , hit .268 , and then spent the next few years in the minor leagues . In 1887 , he played for Lincoln of the Western League until he was suspended in September for punching an umpire in the face . Shafer moved on to the Western Association 's Des Moines team in 1888 , and he played well , batting .338 and leading the league in hits . In 1889 , he was the captain of the Detroit Wolverines , which won the International League championship . 
 Shafer then rejoined the Philadelphia Athletics in 1890 . In his final major league season , he played in 100 games , batted .282 , and led the AA 's outfielders with a .958 fielding percentage . He was the second @-@ oldest player in the league , at 38 years old . Shafer 's younger brother , Taylor , also played for the 1890 Athletics . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Over his 13 @-@ season Major League Baseball career , Orator Shafer played a total of 871 games . He had 1 @,@ 000 hits in 3 @,@ 552 at bats , a .282 batting average , 11 home runs , 601 runs scored , and 317 runs batted in . He also had 290 career outfield assists , which is the 10th highest total in MLB history . 
 Shafer was an outstanding fielder . Fellow major league right fielder Paul Radford , when writing about how to play the position , said : " I always considered ' Orator ' Shaffer a splendid right fielder , because of his skill in throwing out men at the initial bag . I know he threw me out thus in two successive games at Buffalo . " According to The Sporting Life , Shafer " was for years considered the best man in his position . " In 2001 , statistician Bill James ranked Shafer as the 99th greatest right fielder of all @-@ time . 
 After his baseball career ended , Shafer worked at a race track as a book @-@ writer . He died in Philadelphia in 1922 and was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd , Pennsylvania . 
 = 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens = 
 On May 18 , 1980 , a major volcanic eruption occurred at Mount St. Helens , a volcano located in the state of Washington , United States . The eruption ( a VEI 5 event ) was the only significant volcanic eruption to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California . The eruption was preceded by a two @-@ month series of earthquakes and steam @-@ venting episodes , caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a huge bulge and a fracture system on the mountain 's north slope . 
 An earthquake at 8 : 32 : 17 a.m. PDT ( UTC − 7 ) on Sunday , May 18 , 1980 , caused the entire weakened north face to slide away , creating the largest landslide ever recorded . This suddenly exposed the partly molten <unk> and steam @-@ rich rock in the volcano to lower pressures . The rock responded by exploding a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock toward Spirit Lake so fast that it overtook the avalanching north face . 
 An eruption column rose 80 @,@ 000 feet ( 24 km ; 15 mi ) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states . At the same time , snow , ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted , forming a series of large lahars ( volcanic mudslides ) that reached as far as the Columbia River , nearly 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the southwest . Less severe outbursts continued into the next day , only to be followed by other large , but not as destructive , eruptions later that year . 
 Approximately fifty @-@ seven people were killed directly , including innkeeper Harry R. Truman , photographer Reid Blackburn and geologist David A. Johnston . Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland , causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ( $ 2 @.@ 89 billion in 2015 dollars ) , thousands of game animals were killed , and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side . At the time of the eruption , the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad , but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service . The area was later preserved , as it was , in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument . 
 = = Build @-@ up to the eruption = = 
 Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980 . Several small earthquakes , apparently beginning on March 15 , indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano . Then on March 20 , at 3 : 45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time ( all times will be in PST or PDT ) , a shallow magnitude 4 @.@ 2 earthquake ( the initial reading was 4 @.@ 1 ) , centered below the volcano 's north flank , signaled the volcano 's violent return from 123 years of hibernation . A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25 , reaching peak levels in the next two days , including an earthquake registering 5 @.@ 1 on the Richter scale . A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2 @.@ 6 or greater were recorded during those two days . 
 Shocks of magnitude 3 @.@ 2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April , and eight per day the week before May 18 . Initially there was no direct sign of eruption , but small earthquake @-@ induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations . 
 At 12 : 36 p.m. on March 27 , phreatic eruptions ( explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater ) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater , excavating a new crater 250 feet ( 75 m ) wide and sending an ash column about 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) into the air . By this date a 16 @,@ 000 @-@ foot long ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) eastward @-@ trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area . This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10 @,@ 000 to 11 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 400 m ) above their vent . Most of this ash fell between 3 and 12 miles ( 5 and 19 km ) from its vent , but some was carried 150 miles ( 240 km ) south to Bend , Oregon or 285 miles ( 459 km ) east to Spokane , Washington . 
 A second , new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29 . The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases . Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to 2 miles ( 3 km ) long . Ninety @-@ three separate outbursts were reported on March 30 , and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1 , alarming geologists and prompting Governor <unk> Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3 . Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a " red zone " around the volcano ; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $ 500 fine or six months in jail . This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property . 
 By April 7 the combined crater was 1 @,@ 700 feet long by 1 @,@ 200 ft wide and 500 ft deep ( 520 × 370 × 150 m ) . A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ diameter ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) section of St. Helens ' north face was displaced outward by at least 270 feet ( 82 m ) . For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew by 5 to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) per day , and by mid @-@ May it extended more than 400 feet ( 120 m ) north . As the bulge moved northward , the summit area behind it progressively sank , forming a complex , down @-@ dropped block called a graben . Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption . These changes in the volcano 's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by 0 @.@ 03 cubic miles ( 0 @.@ 13 km3 ) by mid @-@ May . This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface . Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible , it was called a <unk> , in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface . 
 On May 7 , eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed , and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size . All activity had been confined to the 350 @-@ year @-@ old summit dome and did not involve any new magma . A total of about 10 @,@ 000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event , with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1 @.@ 6 miles ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) directly below the bulge . Visible eruptions ceased on May 16 , reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area . Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry . Another trip was scheduled for 10 a.m. the next day . Because that next day was Sunday , more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area . By the time of the climactic eruption , dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500 feet ( 150 m ) and heated the volcano 's groundwater system , causing many steam @-@ driven explosions ( phreatic eruptions ) . 
 = = North face slides away = = 
 As May 18 dawned , Mount St. Helens ' activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month . The rate of bulge movement , sulfur dioxide emission , and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption . USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post approximately 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of the volcano : as of 6 a.m. , Johnston 's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity . 
 At 8 : 32 a.m. , a magnitude 5 @.@ 1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide , approximately 7 – 20 seconds ( about 10 seconds seems most reasonable ) after the shock . The landslide , the largest in recorded history , travelled at 110 to 155 miles per hour ( 177 to 249 km / h ) and moved across Spirit Lake 's west arm . Part of it hit a 1 @,@ 150 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 350 m ) ridge about 6 miles ( 10 km ) north . Some of the slide spilled over the ridge , but most of it moved 13 miles ( 21 km ) down the North Fork Toutle River , filling its valley up to 600 feet ( 180 m ) deep with avalanche debris . An area of about 24 square miles ( 62 km2 ) was covered , and the total volume of the deposit was about 0 @.@ 7 cubic miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km3 ) . 
 Scientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist , who was camping 11 miles ( 18 km ) away from the blast . Rosenquist , his party and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) short of his location . 
 Most of St. Helens ' former north side became a rubble deposit 17 miles ( 27 km ) long , averaging 150 feet ( 46 m ) thick ; the slide was thickest at 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin . Thousands of trees were torn from the surrounding hillside after the lake was sloshed 800 feet ( 240 m ) up the hillside . All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide , sending 600 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 180 m ) waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake , adding 295 feet ( 90 m ) of new avalanche debris above the old lakebed , and raising its surface level by about 200 feet . As the water moved back into its basin , it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super @-@ heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that had overtaken the landslide seconds before . Three decades after the eruption , mats of floating or stranded trees on the nearby Spirit Lake , St. Helens Lake , and Coldwater Lake remained visible on Google Earth satellite images .

 = = = Initial lateral blast = = = 
 The landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens ' neck to much lower pressure , causing the gas @-@ charged , partially molten rock and high @-@ pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started . Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide , blasting rock debris northward . The resulting blast laterally directed the pyroclastic flow of very hot volcanic gases , ash and pumice formed from new lava , while the pulverized old rock hugged the ground , initially moving at 220 miles per hour ( 350 km / h ) but quickly accelerating to 670 mph ( 1 @,@ 080 km / h ) , and it might have briefly passed the speed of sound . 
 Pyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward , devastating a fan @-@ shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long ( 37 km × 31 km ) . In total about 230 square miles ( 600 km2 ) of forest was knocked down , and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow @-@ down zone . At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30 seconds , but the northward @-@ radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute . 
 <unk> flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam , creating a larger , secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia , Montana , Idaho and Northern California . Yet many areas closer to the eruption ( Portland , Oregon , for example ) did not hear the blast . This so @-@ called " quiet zone " extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption 's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and , to a lesser extent , local topography . 
 Later studies indicated that one @-@ third of the 0 @.@ 045 cubic miles ( 0 @.@ 19 km3 ) of material in the flow was new lava , and the rest was fragmented , older rock . 
 = = = Lateral blast result = = = 
 Everyone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens ' northern foot . The near @-@ supersonic lateral blast , loaded with volcanic debris , caused devastation as far as 19 miles ( 31 km ) from the volcano . The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones : 
 Direct blast zone , the innermost zone , averaged about 8 miles ( 13 km ) in radius , an area in which virtually everything , natural or artificial , was obliterated or carried away . For this reason , this zone also has been called the " tree @-@ removal zone " . The flow of the material carried by the blast was not deflected by topographic features in this zone . The blast released energy equal to 24 Megatons of TNT . 
 Channelized blast zone , an intermediate zone , extended out to distances as far as 19 miles ( 31 km ) from the volcano , an area in which the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography . In this zone , the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees , broken off at the base of the trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a scythe . This zone was also known as the " tree @-@ down zone " . <unk> and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades . Where the blast struck open land directly , it scoured it , breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil , thereby delaying revegetation for many years . Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres , it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained , permitting faster revegetation with scrub and herbaceous plants , and later with saplings . Trees in the path of such higher @-@ level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights , whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long @-@ term harm . 
 <unk> zone , also called the " standing dead " zone , the outermost fringe of the impacted area , a zone in which trees remained standing but were singed brown by the hot gases of the blast . 
 By the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims , it was still as hot as 360 ° C ( 680 ° F ) and filled with suffocating gas and flying angular material . Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day 's eruption succumbed to asphyxiation while several died from burns . Lodge owner Harry R. Truman was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material . Volcanologist David A. Johnston was one of those killed , as was Reid Blackburn , a National Geographic photographer . Robert Landsburg , another photographer , was killed by the ash cloud . He was able to protect his film with his body , and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption . 
 = = = Later flows = = = 
 Subsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks . The resulting deposits formed a fan @-@ like pattern of overlapping sheets , tongues and lobes . At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption , and their aggregate volume was about 0 @.@ 05 cubic miles ( 210 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) . 
 The flow deposits were still at about 300 to 420 ° C ( 572 to 788 ° F ) two weeks after they erupted . Secondary steam @-@ blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic @-@ flow deposits , at the south shore of Spirit Lake , and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River . These steam @-@ blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows , and at least one occurred a year later , on May 16 , 1981 . 
 = = Ash column grows = = 
 As the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing , a huge ash column grew to a height of 12 miles ( 19 km ) above the expanding crater in less than 10 minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours . Near the volcano , the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning , which in turn started many forest fires . During this time , parts of the mushroom @-@ shaped ash @-@ cloud column collapsed , and fell back upon the earth . This fallout , mixed with magma , mud and steam , sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens ' flanks . Later , slower flows came directly from the new north @-@ facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot <unk> ash . Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam , creating craters up to 65 feet ( 20 m ) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6 @,@ 500 feet ( 2 @,@ 000 m ) into the air . 
 Strong high @-@ altitude wind carried much of this material east @-@ northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . By 9 : 45 a.m. it had reached Yakima , Washington , 90 miles ( 140 km ) away , and by 11 : 45 a.m. it was over Spokane , Washington . A total of 4 to 5 inches ( 100 to 130 mm ) of ash fell on Yakima , and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) and 0 @.@ 5 inches ( 13 mm ) of ash fell . Continuing eastward , St. Helens ' ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10 : 15 p.m. and was seen on the ground in Denver , Colorado , the next day . In time , ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma , and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2 weeks . 
 During the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity , about 540 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22 @,@ 000 square miles ( 57 @,@ 000 km2 ) . The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0 @.@ 3 cubic miles ( 1 @.@ 3 km3 ) . The volume of the <unk> ash is equivalent to about 0 @.@ 05 cubic miles ( 210 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of solid rock , or about 7 % of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche . By around 5 : 30 p.m. on May 18 , the vertical ash column declined in stature , but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days . 
 = = Ash properties = = 
 Generally , given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions , a certain variation of the ash type will occur , as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption . The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception , and hence the ash properties will have large uncertainties . 
 = = = Chemical composition = = = 
 The bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be approximately : 65 % for silicon dioxide , 18 % for aluminium oxide , 5 % for ferric oxide , 4 % each for calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2 % for magnesium oxide . Trace chemicals were also detected , their concentrations varying as shown : 0 @.@ 05 @-@ 0 @.@ 09 % for chlorine , 0 @.@ 02 @-@ 0 @.@ 03 % for fluorine and finally , 0 @.@ 09 @-@ 0 @.@ 3 % for sulphur . 
 = = = Index of refraction = = = 
 The index of refraction is an important property of volcanic ash . Its imaginary part presents an important point of interest since it dictates how radiation is attenuated , while the real part is concerned with the refraction . 
 It is known that the silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1 @.@ 5 and 1 @.@ 6 for visible light . However , there is a spectrum of colours associated with samples of volcanic ash , from very light to dark gray . This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light . 
 In the case of Mount St. Helens , the ash settled in three main layers on the ground : 
 the bottom layer was dark grey and was found to be abundant in older rocks and crystal fragments 
 the middle layer consisted of a mixture of glass shards and pumice 
 the top layer was ash consisting of very fine particles 
 For example , when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15 km and 18 km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700 nm ( around 0 @.@ 009 ) , while they differ significantly around 300 nm . Here , the 18 km ( k was found to be around 0 @.@ 009 ) sample was much more absorbent than the 15 km sample ( k was found to be around 0 @.@ 002 ) . 
 = = Mudslides flow downstream = = 
 The hot , exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain 's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow . As in many previous St. Helens ' eruptions , this created huge lahars ( volcanic mudflows ) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain , and which started to move as early as 8 : 50 a.m. Lahars travelled as fast as 90 miles per hour ( 140 km / h ) while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about 3 miles per hour ( 4 @.@ 8 km / h ) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers . <unk> from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River , Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River . Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir , which rose 2 @.@ 6 feet ( 0 @.@ 79 m ) by noon to accommodate the nearly 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 14 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of additional water , mud and debris . 
 Glacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano 's northeast slope to create much larger lahars . These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock , Washington , at 1 : 00 p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption , the first mudflow had moved 27 miles ( 43 km ) upstream where observers at Weyerhaeuser 's Camp Baker saw a 12 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 4 m ) wall of muddy water and debris pass . Near the confluence of the Toutle 's north and south forks at Silver Lake , a record flood stage of 23 @.@ 5 feet ( 7 @.@ 2 m ) was recorded . 
 A large but slower @-@ moving mudflow with a mortar @-@ like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork . By 2 : 30 p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker , and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away . Part of the flow backed up for 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) soon after entering the Cowlitz River , but most continued downstream . After traveling 17 miles ( 27 km ) further , an estimated 3 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material were injected into the Columbia River , reducing the river 's depth by 25 feet ( 8 m ) for a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 km ) stretch . The resulting 13 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean @-@ going freighters , costing Portland , Oregon , an estimated five million US dollars . Ultimately more than 65 million cubic yards ( 50 million cubic metres ) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers .

 = = = Direct results = = = 
 The May 18 , 1980 event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States . Approximately fifty @-@ seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses , 47 bridges , 15 miles ( 24 km ) of railways and 185 miles ( 298 km ) of highway were destroyed ; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility , and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash . U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape . A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction . However their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost . A second eruption occurred the next day ( see below ) , but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that . The eruption ejected more than 1 cubic mile ( 4 @.@ 2 km3 ) of material . A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash , pumice and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented , older rock . The removal of the north side of the mountain ( 13 % of the cone 's volume ) reduced Mount St. Helens ' height by about 1 @,@ 280 feet ( 390 m ) and left a crater 1 to 2 miles ( 2 to 3 km ) wide and 2 @,@ 100 feet ( 640 m ) deep with its north end open in a huge breach . 
 More than 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 board feet ( 9 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 m3 ) of timber was damaged or destroyed , mainly by the lateral blast . At least 25 % of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980 . Downwind of the volcano , in areas of thick ash accumulation , many agricultural crops , such as wheat , apples , potatoes and alfalfa , were destroyed . As many as 1 @,@ 500 elk and 5 @,@ 000 deer were killed , and an estimated 12 million Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed . Another estimated 40 @,@ 000 young salmon were lost when they swam through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators after reservoir levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters . 
 In total Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy , 7 of which were a direct result of the blast . This is equivalent to 1 @,@ 600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima . 
 = = = = Disputed death toll = = = = 
 There is a minor controversy in regards to the exact death toll . The most common figure commonly cited is fifty @-@ seven . However , there are two points of dispute . 
 The first point regards two officially listed victims , Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer . They were reported missing after the explosion . In the aftermath , investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well . However , they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing , and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn 't the one who had done so . Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing , the names remain listed among the presumed dead . 
 The second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims : Robert <unk> , Steven Whitsett and Mark Melanson . Cowlitz County Emergency Services Management lists them as " Possibly Missing — Not on [ the official ] List " . According to Melanson 's brother , in October 1983 , Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson " is believed [ ... ] a victim of the May 18 , 1980 eruption " and that after years of searching , the family eventually decided " he 's buried in the ash " . 
 Taking these two points of dispute into consideration , the direct death toll could be as low as fifty @-@ five or as high as sixty . When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier , those numbers range from fifty @-@ nine to sixty @-@ four . 
 = = = Digging out = = = 
 The ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation , sewage disposal , and water treatment systems . Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall , closing many highways and roads . Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half . Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks , as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility . Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures . Fine @-@ grained , gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal @-@ combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment . The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters , and scratched moving surfaces . Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers , which in turn caused power blackouts . 
 Removing and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some eastern Washington communities . State and federal agencies estimated that over 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 m3 ) of ash , equivalent to about 900 @,@ 000 tons in weight , were removed from highways and airports in Washington . The ash removal cost $ 2 @.@ 2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima . The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites . Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills ; others created dump sites wherever expedient . To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps , the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass . In Portland , the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots . 
 = = = Cost = = = 
 A refined estimate of $ 1 @.@ 1 billion ( $ 2 @.@ 74 billion in 2007 dollars ) was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of the United States Congress . A supplemental appropriation of $ 951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress , of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration , U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency . 
 There were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption . Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption , and then returned to near @-@ normal levels once timber @-@ salvaging and ash @-@ cleanup operations were underway . Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption . Several months after May 18 , a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems , even though they had coped successfully during the crisis . Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people . 
 Initial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism , an important industry in Washington . Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens – Gifford Pinchot National Forest area , but conventions , meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption . The adverse effect on tourism and <unk> , however , proved only temporary . Mount St. Helens , perhaps because of its reawakening , has regained its appeal for tourists . The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano 's devastation . 
 = = Later eruptions = = 
 St. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980 . Through early 1990 at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred . The volcano remains active , with smaller , dome @-@ building eruptions continuing into 2008 . 
 = = = 1980 – 1991 = = = 
 An eruption occurred on May 25 , 1980 , at 2 : 30 a.m. that sent an ash column 9 miles ( 14 km ) into the atmosphere . The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm . <unk> wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west , lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon . Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris , lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption . 
 At 7 : 05 p.m. on June 12 , a plume of ash billowed 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) above the volcano . At 9 : 09 p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 miles ( 16 km ) skyward . This event caused the Portland area , previously spared by wind direction , to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival . A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor , growing to a height of 200 feet ( 61 m ) and a width of 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) within a week . 
 A series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet . The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area , heightened earthquake activity , and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide . The first hit at 5 : 14 p.m. as an ash column shot 10 miles ( 16 km ) and was followed by a faster blast at 6 : 25 p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7 @.@ 5 minutes . The final explosion started at 7 : 01 p.m. and continued for over two hours . When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington , the dome built in June was gone . 
 Seismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August , and on August 7 at 4 : 26 p.m. , an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles ( 13 km ) into the sky . Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater . This continued until 10 : 32 p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air , proceeding due north . A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later . 
 Two months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18 . This event obliterated the second dome , sent ash 10 miles ( 16 km ) in the air and created small , red @-@ hot pyroclastic flows . A third dome began to form within 30 minutes after the final explosion on October 18 , and within a few days , it was about 900 feet ( 270 m ) wide and 130 feet ( 40 m ) high . In spite of the dome growth next to it , a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater . 
 All of the post @-@ 1980 eruptions were quiet dome @-@ building events , beginning with the December 27 , 1980 , to January 3 , 1981 , episode . By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) wide and 800 feet ( 240 m ) high . 
 Further eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991 . 
 = = = 2004 – 2008 = = = 
 The 2004 – 08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano . Starting in October 2004 there was a gradual building of a new lava dome . The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption . This activity lasted until January 2008 .

 = Turquoise parrot = 
 The turquoise parrot ( Neophema pulchella ) is a species of parrot in the genus Neophema native to Eastern Australia , from southeastern Queensland , through New South Wales and into north @-@ eastern Victoria . It was described by George Shaw in 1792 . A small lightly @-@ built parrot at around 20 cm ( 8 in ) long and 40 g ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 oz ) in weight , it exhibits sexual dimorphism . The male is predominantly green with more yellowish underparts and a bright turquoise blue face . Its wings are predominantly blue with red shoulders . The female is generally duller and paler , with a pale green breast and yellow belly , and lacks the red wing patch . 
 Found in grasslands and open woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris species , the turquoise parrot feeds mainly on grasses and seeds and occasionally flowers , fruit and scale insects . It nests in hollows of gum trees . Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites lost . Predominantly sedentary , the turquoise parrot can be locally nomadic . Populations appear to be recovering from a crash in the early 20th century . The turquoise parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century , and several colour variants exist . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Well known around the Sydney district at the time of European settlement in 1788 , the turquoise parrot was described by George Shaw as Psittacus pulchellus in 1792 , the species name pulchellus being Latin for " very pretty " and referring to its plumage . He called it the <unk> after its turquoise face patch . The holotype likely ended up in the Leverian collection in England , and was lost when the collection was broken up and sold . German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein gave it the scientific name Psittacus edwardsii in 1811 , based on François Levaillant 's description of the species as la <unk> Edwards in his 1805 work Histoire Naturelle des <unk> . Levaillant named it in honour of the English naturalist George Edwards . William Swainson used Shaw 's name in 1823 in his work Zoological Illustrations , noting that it was " impossible to represent this superb little creature in its full beauty " . Drawing on the previous works , René Primevère Lesson described it as <unk> <unk> in 1830 , the species name being the Medieval Latin word <unk> " blue " . 
 Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori defined the new genus Neophema in 1891 , placing the turquoise parrot within it and giving it its current scientific name . There is little geographical variation , with some minor local differences in the amount of orange on the belly . In 1915 , Gregory Mathews described a subspecies <unk> from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars ; however , this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens , and hence no subspecies are recognised . One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema , it is most closely related to the scarlet @-@ chested parrot . The two are an allopatric species pair , and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism — namely the male and female being different in appearance . 
 The English common name of the turquoise parrot has varied between chestnut @-@ shouldered parakeet , chestnut @-@ shouldered grass @-@ parakeet , chestnut @-@ shouldered grass @-@ parrot , chestnut @-@ winged grass @-@ parakeet , chestnut @-@ winged grass @-@ parrot , and <unk> grass parrot , this last name commonly used in aviculture . The name red @-@ shouldered parakeet was incorrectly applied to this species , as it was an alternative name for the paradise parrot . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ranging from 20 to 22 cm ( 8 – 83 ⁄ 4 in ) long with a 32 cm ( 12 1 ⁄ 2 in ) wingspan , the turquoise parrot is a small and slightly @-@ built parrot weighing around 40 g ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 oz ) Both sexes have predominantly green upperparts and yellow underparts . The male has a bright turquoise @-@ blue face which is darkest on the crown and slightly paler on the lores , cheeks and ear coverts . The neck and upperparts are grass @-@ green , and the tail is grass @-@ green with yellow borders . The wing appears bright blue with a darker leading edge when folded , with a band of red on the shoulder . The underparts are bright yellow , slightly greenish on the breast and neck . Some males have orange patches on the belly , which may extend to the breast . When extended , the wing is dark blue with red on the trailing edge on the upper surface , and black with dark blue leading coverts underneath . The upper mandible of the bill is black and may or may not fade to grey at the base , while the lower mandible is cream with a grey border in the mouth . The cere and orbital eye @-@ ring are grey and the iris is dark brown . The legs and feet are grey . 
 Generally duller and paler , the female has a more uniform and paler blue face , with highly contrasting cream bare skin around the eye . It lacks the red shoulder band , and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct . The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow . The upper mandible is paler brown @-@ grey with a darker tip , and has been recorded as black while nesting . The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white . When flying , the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing . 
 Juvenile birds of both sexes have less extensive blue on their faces , the coloration not extending past the eye . The upperparts resemble those of the adult female . Both sexes have the white wing @-@ stripe , which disappears with maturity in males . The immature male has a red patch on the wing and may also have an orange wash on the belly .
