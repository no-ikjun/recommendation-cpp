 St. Clair Streett joined the United States Army after high school . By 1916 , he was a sergeant in the Signal Corps , Enlisted Reserve . , This is after the start of the World War I in Europe 1914 @-@ 1918 and before America 's entry into the war . In December 1916 , Streett signed up as an aviation cadet and was trained at the Curtis School at Newport News , Virginia and at Wright Field in Ohio . America entered the world war in April 1917 . On September 27 , 1917 , St. Clair Streett was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Signal Officers ' Reserve Corps . 
 In December 1917 , Streett was posted to Issoudun , France , as an air training instructor . The majority of the United States Army troops and pilots would arrive later , in 1918 . He was then assigned to the 5th Pursuit Group operating out of Lay @-@ Saint @-@ Remy Aerodrome , France . Later , after the Allied victory in November 1918 , he served in Germany with the American occupation forces , and returned to the United States in August 1919 . On July 1 , 1920 , Streett was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Regular Army Officers ' Reserve Corps , Air Service .

 In early 1920 , Streett made a five @-@ week , 4 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 6 @,@ 400 km ) survey flight to assess field conditions in eleven states . Then , at the suggestion of General Billy Mitchell who wished to strengthen the American air presence in Alaska Territory , Streett commanded the Alaskan Flying Expedition , an exploratory flight made by the Air Service between July 15 and October 20 , 1920 , from Mitchel Field on Long Island to Nome , Alaska . Dubbed the " Black Wolf Squadron " for the logo painted on the fuselage sides of their four De Havilland DH @-@ 4B biplanes , the eight men flew 8 @,@ 690 miles ( 14 @,@ 000 km ) in 110 hours of flying time , dividing the route into 15 legs across the northern United States and the western provinces of Canada , then north to Fairbanks , Alaska via Dawson City , Yukon , the flight reached Nome on August 23 , 1920 , after a flying time of 56 hours . An advance party scouted weather conditions , cut landing strips out of virgin forest in the legs north of Jasper , Alberta , and stocked fuel and provisions to replenish the flyers and their aircraft . 
 Afterward , Streett speculated , " Some day this trip may be made overnight — who knows ? " For this pioneering effort demonstrating that Alaska could be linked by air to the United States , Streett was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Mackay Trophy , the later given to the " most meritorious flight of the year " made by a U.S. military airman .

 Following this successful publicity flight , Streett was appointed assistant to General Billy Mitchell , the deputy chief of the Air Service . When Mitchell formed the 1st Provisional Air Brigade in May 1921 for the purpose of demonstrating that a bomber could sink a battleship , Streett was closely connected . Mitchell sent Streett to Air Corps headquarters to inform his superior Charles T. Menoher that the battleships could not be sunk as planned , with the bombers flying at 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) . Streett informed Menoher that Mitchell intended to break the rules and fly much lower to ensure a newsworthy sinking , but that the Navy should not know of this change . During the June and July bombing demonstrations , Streett flew in the back seat as navigator in Osprey , Mitchell 's personal DH @-@ 4B heavy bomber as they bombed from heights of about 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 600 to 900 m ) . Mitchell also planned to sink the target ship with several very close near @-@ miss explosions that would cause severe damage to the ship 's hull below the waterline . The US Navy 's rules for the bombing limited the actual number of direct hits allowed on the target ship . The US Navy had intended to inspect the damage to these ships after the bombings , and US Navy gunfire to learn as much as possible about the effects of shell & bomb hits on battleship armor and structure . The target ship , the former German World War I battleship Ostfriesland was sunk with only a few direct hits , and several intentional very near @-@ misses . The US Navy leadership was shocked and angry over the target 's sinking . In late July after the battleship Ostfriesland had been sunk , Mitchell carried out a 19 @-@ bomber mock raid against Manhattan . About the stunt , Streett wrote an article entitled " 14th Heavy Bombardment Squadron Attacks New York City " for the Army and Navy aviation magazine U.S. Air Service . 
 During this time , Streett wrote an article about the Alaskan venture entitled " The First Alaskan Air Expedition " for the National Geographic magazine , with the issue appearing in May 1922 . In July , he became commanding officer of the headquarters detachment at Bolling Field .

 Flying an Army Orenco D on November 27 , 1920 , Streett finished in fourth place in the first Pulitzer Trophy Air Race , held at Mitchel Field on Long Island . On October 14 , 1922 , Streett participated in the third Pulitzer race flown out of Selfridge Field near Detroit but an oil line burst in his Verville @-@ Sperry R @-@ 3 and forced him to abandon the race on the fifth and final lap . 
 In January 1924 , Streett was named assistant chief of the Airways Section in the Office of the Chief of Air Corps . In this role he helped gather prevailing weather data , airfield locations , maps and reports of flying conditions for the Air Corps men undertaking the first aerial circumnavigation during March – September 1924 . He planned for and ordered caches of oil and fuel to be kept at likely locations during the multistage voyage . Streett 's preparations were praised as " very complete and of greatest assistance " in carrying out the feat . In September 1925 , he entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field , Virginia , graduating the following June .

 Streett was transferred to Selfridge Field , Michigan , in August 1926 , and appointed commanding officer of the First Pursuit Group Headquarters . He was assigned to Wright Field , Ohio in March 1928 as test pilot and chief of the Flying Branch . Flying the <unk> @-@ 5 on October 10 , 1928 , Streett and Albert William Stevens achieved an unofficial altitude record for aircraft carrying more than one person : 37 @,@ 854 feet ( 11 @,@ 538 m ) ; less than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) short of the official single @-@ person altitude record . At that height they measured a temperature of − 78 ° F ( − 61 ° C ) , cold enough to freeze the aircraft controls . With frozen controls , Streett was unable to reduce altitude or to turn off the engine until some twenty minutes later when it ran out of fuel , after which he piloted the fragile experimental biplane down in a gentle glide and made a deadstick landing . An article about the feat appeared in Popular Science in May 1929 , entitled " Stranded — Seven Miles Up ! " During July 1932 , he was on special assignment as assistant in the preparation of data on performance tests of aircraft . 
 Streett spent the following three years at service schools . He entered the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , In August 1932 . After graduation In June 1934 , he began a course at the Chemical Warfare School at Edgewood Arsenal , Maryland , which he completed in August . He was then transferred to the Army War College , from which he graduated in June 1935 . 
 Streett 's next assignment was with the War Department General Staff where he served as a member of the Miscellaneous and Operations Section of the War Plans Division . He became a student at the Naval War College at Newport , Rhode Island , in June 1939 , and in July 1940 reported to Hickam Field , Hawaii , for duty as commanding officer of the 11th Bombardment Group , where the group operated B @-@ 18 Bolo medium bombers . On December 1 , the 11th was redesignated a heavy bombardment group , and Streett prepared them to receive B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress heavies , the first ones arriving in April 1941 with Lieutenant Colonel Albert Francis <unk> to command them . Streett shifted to become plans and training officer for the Hawaiian Department at Fort Shafter , and then was attached to the Army Air Forces division of the War Department as deputy chief of operations .

 In March 1942 , Streett became chief of the Theater Group of the Operations Division in the Office of the Chief of Staff . When United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) Chief of Staff Henry H. " Hap " Arnold proposed to George Marshall in October 1942 that an Army man be named supreme commander for the whole Allied effort in the Pacific , suggesting Douglas MacArthur , Lesley McNair or airman Joseph T. McNarney for the position , Marshall without comment passed the request to his staff for analysis . There , Albert Wedemeyer and Streett examined the problem . Wedemeyer , an Army officer , thought the supreme commander should be an airman ; either Arnold or McNarney . Streett , too , was in favor of one supreme commander but he recognized the political challenges — he projected that the president would have to make the appointment , not a committee of military men prone to interservice rivalry . For supreme commander in the Pacific , Streett suggested McNarney or Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , depending on whether an air or a naval strategy was considered most important . About MacArthur , Streett wrote that " [ a ] t the risk of being considered naive and just plain country @-@ boy dumb , " he thought that MacArthur would have to be removed from the Pacific in order for there to be any sound cooperation in the theater . Streett suggested MacArthur be appointed ambassador to " Russia " or some similar position of high stature but low military influence . Of this analysis work , nothing was enacted ; Marshall did not bring the problem and its suggested solutions to either the Navy or the president . 
 = = = Tampa = = = 
 In November 1942 , Arnold assigned Streett to take charge of the Third Air Force , a medium bomber training command based at Tampa , Florida . The unit had seen enough B @-@ 26 Marauder training accidents that grim @-@ humored airmen coined the phrase " one a day in Tampa Bay . " ( The oft @-@ repeated line was an exaggeration ; ignoring crashes into land , 13 Marauders ditched in Tampa Bay in the 14 months between the first one on August 5 , 1942 and the final one on October 8 , 1943 . ) Streett implemented a tightening of training policy to reduce losses through human error , and he initiated research into solutions for the technical problems the bomber was having . 
 At the time , Tampa was rated the worst U.S. city for syphilis infections among USAAF personnel , and the city with the most rampant prostitution . USAAF Captain Robert Dyer , charged with protecting the country 's airmen from venereal disease ( VD ) , had no success getting Tampa authorities to address the problem . When Streett arrived at his command and saw the extent of the VD crisis at MacDill Field , he threatened to close certain areas of Tampa to all military personnel if the city 's police were unable to curb prostitution . This action would have ruined a number of legitimate local businesses , and a campaign was initiated to arrest prostitutes and to bar unmarried couples from renting a room together . Police arrests , however , were limited to misdemeanor charges of vagrancy or loitering — there were no state or local laws specific to prostitution . In response to complaints from Streett and other military leaders , in January 1943 Florida 's Department of Health mounted a statewide media blitz encouraging testing and treatment for VD . Later that year , the state passed a law giving police wide latitude to arrest prostitutes for hire and also unmarried persons participating in " licentious sexual intercourse without hire . "

 In September 1943 , Streett assumed command of the Second Air Force at Peterson Field , Colorado Springs , Colorado , training heavy bomber crews to fly the B @-@ 24 Liberator . 
 In January 1944 , he was assigned to the Southwest Pacific Area and assumed command of the Thirteenth Air Force when it was consolidated into an offensive stance in June . Streett served under George Kenney , who was the USAAF theater commander subordinate to MacArthur . At the end of September and in early October , Streett mounted a series of 2 @,@ 500 @-@ mile ( 4 @,@ 000 km ) round trip air raids by heavy bombers flying from Hollandia , New Guinea to attack Balikpapan , a major center of Japanese petroleum processing and storage . In U.S. media reports , the raids were compared to the <unk> raids of 1943 , with strong Japanese resistance on the second raid said to be responsible for downing seven B @-@ 24s — a loss of 70 aircrew . Streett guided the Thirteenth through their part of the initial phases of the Philippines Campaign , in concert with the Fifth Air Force as part of United States Far East Air Forces . 
 = = Postwar career = = 
 When Arnold needed to solve a thorny problem , he was known to demand " Where is Bill Streett ? " In January 1945 as victory in the war appeared certain , Arnold was faced with postwar reorganization of the Army Air Forces . Arnold ordered Streett to return stateside to form for him the Continental Air Forces ( CAF ) at Bolling Field . Streett served under Arnold as deputy commander of the CAF , but Arnold held at that time two major commands : Air Staff and CAF , with Air Staff taking his full attention . In effect , Streett was left in charge of CAF . In November 1945 , Streett proposed a reorganization of United States air power into separate commands : Eastern and Western air defense commands , a tactical air support command and a training command . His proposal placed strategic bombers in a task force under the commander of the Army Air Forces . When the Continental Air Forces became Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) in March 1946 , he retained his nominal position as deputy commander , and actually commanded the new organization until October when Kenney 's prior obligations to the United Nations came to an end and he could finally take the reins of the SAC as originally intended by General Carl Andrew Spaatz . 
 On October 22 , 1946 , Streett delivered a lecture entitled The Strategic Air Command to the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama . He revealed to the students that the SAC was not yet very powerful — only two strike groups were fully operational and that three months in the future after a rush of preparation , there still would be only four B @-@ 29 Superfortress groups and two long @-@ range fighter aircraft groups . This was in contrast to the then @-@ current public relations statements by the SAC which proclaimed " quick retaliation will be our answer [ to any future aggressor ] in the form of an aerial knockout ... " Streett described how General MacArthur , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , U.S. Far East Command , refused to release to SAC the control of one very heavy bombardment group and one very long @-@ range reconnaissance group of the Twentieth Air Force . Streett offered his opinion that the SAC should stage into the Far East and take operational control of those units . 
 In January 1947 , Streett was assigned to the adjutant general 's office as chief of the Military Personnel Procurement Service . He was appointed the air inspector in the newly established Office of the Inspector General in January 1948 , and two months later became deputy inspector general . Streett was named deputy commander of Air Materiel Command at Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base , Ohio , in October 1949 . In December 1951 , he became special assistant to the commanding general of Air Materiel Command . Streett retired from the USAF in February 1952 with the rank of Major General , having flown numerous aircraft from early biplanes to the early jets . 
 In October 1952 , Streett was named to the Citizens Advisory Commission on Manpower Utilization in the Armed Services , popularly known as the Sarnoff Commission for its chairman Brigadier General David Sarnoff , the long @-@ serving chairman of RCA . Defense Secretary Robert A. Lovett established the commission for the purpose of identifying and eliminating excess military spending without reducing combat effectiveness . Robert Wood Johnson II , chairman of Johnson & Johnson , resigned from the commission because of the strain it took on his health , but he noted that the USAF represented by Commissioner Streett was " cooperative and open to greater progress " with the commission , directly contrasting with the U.S. Navy which he rated as " militantly resistant . " The Sarnoff Commission 's 85 @-@ page report was delivered to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services and Charles Erwin Wilson , President Dwight D. Eisenhower 's new defense secretary , on February 17 , 1953 . It called for a ten percent reduction in military spending , amounting to the elimination of 500 @,@ 000 civilian and military personnel and the cutting of $ 5B from the military 's annual budget . After studying the report , Wilson appointed a commission to heed its main points and streamline the Defense Department so that it could more efficiently wage a war . Instead of Streett , Wilson selected retired General Spaatz to represent the USAF .

 In 1922 , Streett married Mary Lois Williams ( 1895 – 1999 ) , a personal friend of " Hap " Arnold and his wife " Bee " . The <unk> had one child , a son in 1927 , St. Clair Streett , Jr . , also nicknamed " Bill " , who graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point with the Class of 1949 and took part in the infantry Battle of Old Baldy during the Korean War . General Streett 's son , St. Clair Streett , Jr. married Edith Peake Boatner ( youngest daughter of USAF Lt. Gen. Bryant L.

General Streett 's son retired from the US Army after 21 years of service in the Infantry and the Engineers . Besides serving in combat in Korea , and in South Vietnam as an advisor , St. Clair Jr. had participated in the US Army Corps of Engineer construction projects for NASA ( in the race to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade ) at Cape <unk> , Florida and Huntsville , Alabama .

 New York State Route 375 ( NY 375 ) , locally known as West Hurley Road for its entire length , is a short highway in the Catskill Park located entirely within Ulster County , New York , in the United States . It primarily allows for more direct access from nearby Kingston to Woodstock . It runs north – south from NY 28 at West Hurley to near the business district of Woodstock , where it terminates at another state highway , NY 212 .

 = Olaf the Peacock = 
 Olaf the Peacock ( Old Norse : Ólafr <unk> ) or Olaf <unk> ( Ólafr <unk> ) ( c . 938 – 1006 ) was a merchant and chieftain of the early Icelandic Commonwealth , who was nicknamed " the Peacock " because of his proud bearing and magnificent wardrobe . He is a major character in the Laxdæla saga and is mentioned in a number of other Icelandic sources . The son of a slave woman , Olaf became one of the wealthiest landowners in Iceland and played a major role in its politics and society during the latter half of the tenth century . In addition to the Laxdæla Saga in which he takes a leading role , Olaf also is mentioned in Egils saga , Njáls saga , <unk> saga , <unk> saga , <unk> saga and the Landnámabók , among others . 
 = = Birth and upbringing = = 
 Olaf was the son of Hoskuld <unk> @-@ <unk> , a chieftain who lived in the <unk> region . According to Laxdæla Saga , Hoskuld purchased a mute thrall @-@ woman from a Rus ' merchant on <unk> while on a trading expedition to Norway , and made her his concubine while away from his wife Jorunn <unk> . When Hoskuld returned home to Iceland , he took the concubine with him . Despite Jorunn 's irritation , the concubine was accepted into Hoskuld 's household , though he remained faithful to Jorunn while in Iceland . The following winter the concubine gave birth to a son , to whom they gave the name Olaf after Hoskuld 's uncle , Olaf <unk> , who had recently died . Landnámabók mentions that Hoskuld and Melkorka had another son , Helgi , but he does not appear in Laxdæla . According to Laxdæla saga , Olaf was a precocious child , and could speak and walk perfectly by the age of two . One day Hoskuld discovered Olaf 's mother speaking to her son ; she was not , in fact , mute . When he confronted her she told him that she was an Irish princess named Melkorka carried off in a Viking raid , and that her father was an Irish king named " Myrkjartan " ( Muirchertach ) . Shortly thereafter squabbling between Jorunn and Melkorka forced Hoskuld to move his concubine and his son by her to a different farm , which thereafter was known as <unk> . 
 At the age of seven , over his mother 's objections , Olaf became the foster son and heir of a wealthy but childless goði named Thord , who was at the time engaged in complex litigation with the kinsmen of his ex @-@ wife Vigdis <unk> ( another descendent of Thorstein the Red ) . Olaf 's adoption complicated the issues in the suit and threatened to lead to a blood feud , but Hoskuld arranged a settlement and compensated Vigdis ' kinsmen with gifts . By fostering Olaf Thord gained the protection of the powerful Hoskuld , and Hoskuld secured an inheritance for his illegitimate son beyond the limited amount he was permitted to leave to Olaf under Icelandic law . Olaf accompanied Thord to the Althing when he was twelve years old , and his fancy clothing earned him the admiring nickname " the Peacock . " 
 = = Career abroad = = 
 Around 956 , Olaf , at Melkorka 's urging , decided to go abroad to seek his fortune . Hoskuld was opposed and would not provide trade wares , and the property of Olaf 's foster @-@ father Thord was mostly in immobile goods and land . In part to arrange financing for his expedition , his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the <unk> , a farmer who had previously assisted her in the management of <unk> . Melkorka and Thorbjorn had a son named <unk> . Olaf sailed to Norway with Orn , a sea @-@ captain and <unk> of King Harald <unk> . He gained great honor at Harald 's court , and was a favorite of the king 's mother Gunnhild , who had , according to Icelandic sources , been the lover of Olaf 's uncle <unk> <unk> . When Olaf expressed a desire to find his mother 's people in Ireland , Gunnhild financed his voyage . 
 Olaf set sail for Ireland with Orm to find his mother 's people , taking with him tokens and gifts from Melkorka to her father and her nursemaid . During the voyage , their ship became lost in a fog . When the fog lifted , an argument arose between Orn and most of the rest of Olaf 's men about the proper course to reach Ireland . When ask if the decision should be put to a vote of the majority , Olaf is supposed to have said , " I want only the shrewdest to decide ; in my opinion the counsel of fools is all the more dangerous the more of them there are . " With those words , the matter was accepted as settled , and Orn took charge of the navigation . 
 Upon arriving in Ireland they were stranded far outside the protection of the Norse – Gaelic <unk> . The ship was attacked by local Irishmen , despite the efforts of Olaf , who spoke the Gaelic language , to negotiate safe passage with them . 
 As luck would have it , the local king arrived on the scene , and proved to be Olaf 's alleged grandfather Myrkjartan . Olaf remained with Myrkjartan for a time , and the king , according to <unk> Saga , even offered to make Olaf his heir . Olaf , however , ultimately returned to Norway , afraid of provoking Myrkjartan 's sons . Olaf returned to the court of King Harald , where he was greatly honored by both the king and his mother Gunnhild . 
 = = Return to Iceland = = 
 Olaf returned home around 957 with great wealth . Upon his return , his father Hoskuld arranged a marriage for him with Thorgerd <unk> , the daughter of Egill Skallagrímsson . Thorgerd was initially reluctant to marry the son of a slave , refusing to believe that Olaf 's mother was a princess . However , she ultimately agreed to the match after an hours @-@ long private conversation with Olaf . At the wedding Olaf gave Egil an ornate sword from Ireland . Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily together at <unk> for some time . Around 962 Olaf 's foster father Thord died , leaving Olaf his property and <unk> Olaf bought land and built a new homestead at <unk> , which , according to the saga , he had to cleanse of the draugr of its former owner , Killer @-@ Hrapp . As time went on people began to settle near Olaf 's hall and regarded him as their goði . Olaf 's ever @-@ increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld 's wife Jorunn . Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter , Thurid . <unk> was renowned for its rich decorations ; some two decades later , the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa , about certain mythological scenes illustrated on the walls of Olaf 's hall . 
 Olaf 's half @-@ sister <unk> <unk> married Gunnar <unk> , a chieftain who lived at <unk> in southern Iceland , during this period . Olaf and Gunnar became close friends . 
 Hoskuld died around 965 , leaving Olaf a full mark of gold , causing tension between Olaf and Hoskuld 's legitimate sons , Bard and Thorleik . As an illegitimate son , Olaf was entitled to one mark of his father 's wealth ; this was , however , customarily understood to be a mark of silver and not gold . Olaf eased the tension by paying one @-@ third of the communal funeral feast for Hoskuld . 
 Olaf and Thorgerd had a number of children after Thurid , the sons Kjartan ( named after King Myrkjartan ) , <unk> , <unk> , Helgi , and Hoskuld and the daughters <unk> , Thorgerd and <unk> . The ill @-@ fated Kjartan would be his father 's favorite .

 Around 975 , over his wife 's objections , Olaf went on a second expedition to Norway . There he stayed with a Viking named Geirmund the Noisy and visited Haakon Jarl , the latter of whom gave him a cargo of timber to take home as a gift . On his return Olaf reluctantly brought Geirmund with <unk> and Geirmund fell in love with Olaf 's daughter Thurid . Though Olaf was opposed to the match , Geirmund bribed Thorgerd to be his advocate , and Olaf relented . The marriage was an unhappy one , and after three years Geirmund decided to return home without leaving any money for the support of his ex @-@ wife and daughter . Enraged , Thurid boarded his ship before he departed , stole his famous sword " Leg @-@ Biter , " and left their infant daughter <unk> on the ship . Geirmund cursed the sword , and on his return to Norway he and all of his shipmates , including little <unk> , were drowned . 
 = = Later years = = 
 During the closing years of the tenth century , Olaf 's kinsman and friend Gunnar became embroiled in a blood feud with several neighboring landowners . A settlement was reached whereby Gunnar would accept " lesser outlawry , " a three @-@ year exile , but after agreeing to the settlement Gunnar refused to leave Iceland . Olaf tried to protect his kinsman but was unsuccessful , and Gunnar was killed by his enemies . Olaf 's favorite son Kjartan traveled abroad with his beloved cousin Bolli Þorleiksson . The two were very close . Ultimately , however , they grew apart when Bolli married Kjartan 's lover Guðrún <unk> . According to Oddr Snorrason , Olaf had predicted that strife would ensue between Kjartan and Bolli . Tensions between the cousins grew until a full @-@ blown blood feud ended with Kjartan being killed by Bolli in 1003 . Ironically , Bolli killed Kjartan with the sword " Leg @-@ biter , " which had been given to him as a gift by his cousin Thurid , Kjartan 's sister . Olaf refused to prosecute Bolli for the killing , and arranged for him to pay a fine instead ; by sharp contrast , he had Gudrun 's brothers , who had goaded Bolli to fight his cousin , driven into exile . Jesse Byock contrasted Olaf 's magnanimity towards Bolli with the blood feud mentality of his wife Thorgerd : 
 Olaf knows that Kjartan , who was involved in a love triangle with Bolli and Bolli 's wife Gudrun <unk> , caused his own downfall by acting aggressively . In Icelandic terms , Kjartan had surpassed the acceptable limits of <unk> . Whereas Olaf wants to maintain the solidarity of the larger family , keeping workable relations with his siblings and their children , Thorgerd 's concerns are different . She focuses more narrowly on the honour of her nuclear family . 
 Olaf died in 1006 , and Olaf 's widow Thorgerd subsequently directed a number of revenge @-@ killings herself , including that of Thorkel , a man who had witnessed Kjartan 's death but been indifferent to it and had not intervened . Bolli was killed by Olaf 's sons and their allies in a raid led by Thorgerd . Some twelve years later , Gudrun , with the help of her friend Snorri Goði , had a number of Bolli 's murderers killed in revenge . 
 = <unk> stingray = 
 The sixgill stingray ( Hexatrygon bickelli ) is a species of stingray and the only extant member of the family <unk> . Although several species of sixgill stingrays have been described historically , they may represent variations in a single , widespread species . This flabby , heavy @-@ bodied fish , described only in 1980 , is unique among rays in having six pairs of gill slits rather than five . Growing up to 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) long , it has a rounded pectoral fin disc and a long , triangular , and flexible snout filled with a gelatinous substance . It is brownish above and white below , and lacks dermal denticles . 
 Benthic in nature , the sixgill stingray is usually found over upper continental slopes and seamounts at depths of 500 – 1 @,@ 120 m ( 1 @,@ 640 – 3 @,@ 670 ft ) . It has been recorded from scattered locations in the Indo @-@ Pacific from South Africa to Hawaii . This species probably uses its snout to probe for food in the bottom sediment . Its jaws are greatly protrusible , allowing it to capture buried prey . The sixgill stingray gives live birth , with litters of two to five pups . The IUCN has assessed this ray as Least Concern , because it faces minimal fishing pressure across most of its range . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The first known sixgill stingray , an intact female 64 cm ( 25 in ) across , was found on a beach near Port Elizabeth , South Africa . It was described as a new species and placed in its own family by Phillip <unk> and Margaret Smith , in a 1980 article for the <unk> Bulletin of the J. L. B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology . The generic name Hexatrygon is derived from the Greek hexa ( " six " ) and trygon ( " stingray " ) , referring to the number of gill slits . The specific name bickelli honors Dave Bickell , a journalist who discovered the original specimen . 
 Following the description of H. bickelli , four additional species of sixgill stingray were described on the basis of morphological differences . However , their validity was brought into question after comparative studies revealed that traits such as snout shape , body proportions , and tooth number vary greatly with age and among individuals . Taxonomists therefore concluded tentatively that there is only a single species of sixgill stingray , though genetic analysis is needed to determine whether this is truly the case . Phylogenetic studies using morphological and genetic data have generally concurred that the sixgill stingray is the most basal member of the stingray lineage . An extinct relative , H. <unk> , lived during the Middle Eocene ( 49 – 37 million years ago ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The sixgill stingray has a bulky , flabby body with a rounded pectoral fin disc that is longer than wide . The triangular snout is much longer in adults than in juveniles ( making up almost two @-@ fifths of the disc length ) , and is filled with a clear gelatinous material ; because of this , the snout of a dead specimen can shrink significantly when exposed to air or preservatives . The tiny eyes are placed far apart and well ahead of the larger spiracles . Between the widely spaced nostrils are a pair of short and fleshy flaps that are joined in the middle to form a curtain of skin . The mouth is wide and nearly straight . In either jaw are 44 – 102 rows of small , blunt teeth arranged in a quincunx pattern ; the teeth are more numerous in adults . Six pairs of small gill slits occur on the underside of the disc ; all other rays have five pairs ( a few sharks also have six or more pairs of gill slits , for example in the genus Hexanchus ) . One recorded specimen had six gill slits on the left side and seven on the right . Their pelvic fins are rather large and rounded . 
 The tail is moderately thick and measures about 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 times as long as the disc . One or two serrated stinging spines are present on its dorsal surface , well back from the base . The end of the tail bears a long , low leaf @-@ shaped caudal fin that is nearly symmetrical above and below . The skin is delicate and entirely lacking dermal denticles . The disc is purplish to pinkish brown above , darkening slightly at the fin margins ; the skin is easily abraded , leaving white patches . The underside of the disc is white with dark margins on the pectoral and pelvic fins . The snout is translucent , and the tail and caudal fin are almost black . The largest known specimen is a female 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) long . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The sixgill stingray has been recorded at widely scattered locations in the Indo @-@ Pacific . In the Indian Ocean , it has been reported from South Africa off Port Elizabeth and Port Alfred , southwestern India , several islands of Indonesia , and Western Australia from Exmouth Plateau to Shark Bay . In the Pacific Ocean , it has been found from Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines , as well as off Flinders Reef in Queensland , New Caledonia , and Hawaii . This bottom @-@ dwelling species typically inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts at depths of 500 – 1 @,@ 120 m ( 1 @,@ 640 – 3 @,@ 670 ft ) . However , it occasionally ventures into shallower water , with one ray observed feeding at a depth of 30 m ( 98 ft ) off Japan . It can be found over sandy , muddy , or rocky bottom substrates . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The long snout of the sixgill stingray is very flexible both vertically and horizontally , suggesting that the ray uses it to probe for food in the bottom sediment . The underside of the snout is covered by well @-@ developed ampullae of Lorenzini arranged in longitudinal rows , which are capable of detecting the minute electric fields produced by other organisms . The mouth can be protruded downward farther than the length of the head , likely allowing the ray to extract buried prey . The jaws are poorly mineralized , suggesting that it does not feed on hard @-@ shelled animals . There is a record of a specimen with a wound from a cookiecutter shark ( Isistius brasiliensis ) . Reproduction in the sixgill stingray is viviparous , with documented litter sizes of between two and five pups . Newly born rays measure around 48 cm ( 19 in ) long . Both males and females mature sexually at approximately 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) long . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 For the most part , little fishing activity occurs at the depths occupied by the sixgill stingray , thus the IUCN has listed it as Least Concern . In the waters around Taiwan , it is caught in small numbers as bycatch in bottom trawls . The catch rate seems to have decreased in recent years , leading to concerns that it may be locally overfished , though quantitative data are lacking . 
 = Swedish language = 
 Swedish ( svenska [ ² <unk> ] ) is a North Germanic language , spoken natively by about 9 million people predominantly in Sweden and parts of Finland , where it has equal legal standing with Finnish . It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish ( see the section " Classification " ) . Along with the other North Germanic languages , Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse , the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era . It is currently the largest of the North Germanic languages by number of speakers . 
 Standard Swedish , spoken by most Swedes , is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century . While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist , the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized . 
 The standard word order is , as in most Germanic languages , V2 , which means that the finite verb appears in second position of a declarative main clause . Swedish morphology is similar to English ; that is , words have comparatively few inflections . There are two genders , no grammatical cases , and a distinction between plural and singular . Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well . Adjectives are compared as in English , and are also inflected according to gender , number and definiteness . The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes ( endings ) , complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles . The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities . The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory . Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso @-@ palatal velar fricative , a highly variable consonant phoneme . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Swedish is an Indo @-@ European language belonging to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages . In the established classification , it belongs to the East Scandinavian languages together with Danish , separating it from the West Scandinavian languages , consisting of Faroese , Icelandic and Norwegian . However , more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups : Insular Scandinavian ( Faroese and Icelandic ) , and Continental Scandinavian ( Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish ) , based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian ( particularly Danish ) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic . 
 By many general criteria of mutual intelligibility , the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language . However , because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden , including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries , and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the languages have separate orthographies , dictionaries , grammars , and regulatory bodies . Danish , Norwegian , and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian ( North Germanic ) , and some of the dialects , such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden , especially parts of Bohuslän , Dalsland , western Värmland , western Dalarna , <unk> , Jämtland and Scania , could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Old Norse = = = 
 In the 8th century , the common Germanic language of Scandinavia , Proto @-@ Norse , had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse . This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia , which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects , Old West Norse ( Norway and Iceland ) and Old East Norse ( Denmark and Sweden ) . The dialects of Old East Norse that were spoken in Sweden are called Runic Swedish while the dialects of Denmark are referred to as Runic Danish . The dialects are described as " runic " because the main body of text appears in the runic alphabet . Unlike Proto @-@ Norse , which was written with the Elder Futhark alphabet , Old Norse was written with the Younger Futhark alphabet , which had only 16 letters . Because the number of runes was limited , some runes were used for a range of phonemes , such as the rune for the vowel u which was also used for the vowels o , ø and y , and the rune for i which was also used for e . 
 From 1200 onwards , the dialects in Denmark began to diverge from those of Sweden . The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries , or <unk> , ranging from Zealand in the south to Norrland , Österbotten and northwestern Finland in the north . 
 An early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the diphthong <unk> to the monophthong é , as in <unk> to <unk> " stone " . This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read stain and the later stin . There was also a change of au as in dauðr into a long open ø as in <unk> " dead " . This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from tauþr into <unk> . Moreover , the øy diphthong changed into a long , close ø , as in the Old Norse word for " island " . By the end of the period , these innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish @-@ speaking area as well , with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of <unk> where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas . 
 = = = Old Swedish = = = 
 Old Swedish ( fornsvenska ) is the term used for the medieval Swedish language . The start date is usually set to 1225 since this is the year that <unk> ( " the <unk> Law " ) is believed to have been compiled for the first time . It is among the most important documents of the period written in Latin script and the oldest Swedish law codes . Old Swedish is divided into <unk> fornsvenska ( 1225 – 1375 ) and <unk> fornsvenska ( 1375 – 1526 ) , " older " and " younger " Old Swedish Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Christian church and various monastic orders , introducing many Greek and Latin loanwords . With the rise of Hanseatic power in the late 13th and early 14th century , Middle Low German became very influential . The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of Low German @-@ speaking immigrants . Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society , and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary . Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare , trade and administration , general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported . The League also brought a certain measure of influence from Danish ( at the time much more similar than today 's language ) . 
 Early Old Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex case structure and yet retained the original Germanic three @-@ gender system . Nouns , adjectives , pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases ; besides the extant nominative , there were also the genitive ( later possessive ) , dative and accusative . The gender system resembled that of modern German , having masculine , feminine and neuter genders . The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den , in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det . The verb system was also more complex : it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number . By the 16th century , the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish . 
 A transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination " ae " as æ – and sometimes as a ' – though it varied between persons and regions . The combination " ao " was similarly rendered ao , and " oe " became oe . These three were later to evolve into the separate letters ä , å and ö . The first time the new letters were used in print was in <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " By the Devil 's temptation " ) published by Johan Gerson in 1495 . 
 = = = Modern Swedish = = = 
 Modern Swedish ( Swedish : <unk> ) begins with the advent of the printing press and the European Reformation . After assuming power , the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible . The New Testament was published in 1526 , followed by a full Bible translation in 1541 , usually referred to as the Gustav Vasa Bible , a translation deemed so successful and influential that , with revisions incorporated in successive editions , it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917 . The main translators were Laurentius <unk> and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri . 
 The Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new ; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day , it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms . It was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish orthography . It established the use of the vowels " å " , " ä " , and " ö " , and the spelling " ck " in place of " kk " , distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible , perhaps intentionally , given the ongoing rivalry between the countries . All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible . 
 Though it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards , spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century . It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed , around the time when the first grammars were written . The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century , and it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards . 
 Capitalization during this time was not standardized . It depended on the authors and their background . Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns , while others capitalized more sparsely . It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible . This typeface was in use until the mid @-@ 18th century , when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface ( often antiqua ) . 
 Some important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into the fricative [ ʃ ] and later into [ ɧ ] . There was also the gradual softening of [ ɡ ] and [ k ] into [ j ] and the fricative [ ɕ ] before front vowels . The velar fricative [ ɣ ] was also transformed into the corresponding plosive [ ɡ ] . 
 = = = Contemporary Swedish = = = 
 The period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed <unk> ( lit . " Now @-@ Swedish " ) in linguistic terminology and started in the last decades of the 19th century . The period saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written form that came closer to the spoken one . The growth of a public schooling system also led to the evolution of so @-@ called <unk> ( literally " book Swedish " ) , especially among the working classes , where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation , particularly in official contexts . With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century , a new breed of authors made their mark on Swedish literature . Many scholars , politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the new national language that was emerging , and among them were prolific authors like the poet Gustaf <unk> , Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf , and radical writer and playwright August Strindberg . 
 It was during the 20th century that a common , standardized national language became available to all Swedes . The orthography was finally stabilized , and was almost completely uniform , with the exception of some minor deviations , by the time of the spelling reform of 1906 . With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax , particularly in the written language , the language was the same as the Swedish of today . The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s , when their use was removed from all official recommendations . 
 A very significant change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s , with the so @-@ called du @-@ <unk> , " the you @-@ reform " . Previously , the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname . The use of <unk> ( " Mr " or " Sir " ) , <unk> ( " Mrs " or " Ma 'am " ) or <unk> ( " Miss " ) was considered the only acceptable mode of initiating conversation with strangers of unknown occupation , academic title or military rank . The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society . In the early 20th century , an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ni ( the standard second person plural pronoun ) , analogous to the French Vous . ( Cf . T @-@ V distinction . ) Ni ( plural second person pronoun ) wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of du ( singular second person pronoun ) used to address people of lower social status . With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s , these previously significant distinctions of class became less important , and du became the standard , even in formal and official contexts . Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decrees , but rather a sweeping change in social attitudes , it was completed in just a few years from the late 1960s to early 1970s . The use of ni as a polite form of address is occasionally encountered today in both the written and spoken language , particularly among younger speakers . 
 = = = Former language minorities = = = 
 From the 13th to 20th century , there were Swedish @-@ speaking communities in Estonia , particularly on the islands ( e.g. , Hiiumaa , Vormsi , <unk> ; in Swedish , known as Dagö , <unk> , <unk> , respectively ) along the coast of the Baltic , communities which today have all but disappeared . The Swedish @-@ speaking minority was represented in parliament , and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates . After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century , around 1 @,@ 000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine , where they founded a village , <unk> ( " Old Swedish Village " ) . A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar , although the dialect is most likely facing extinction . 
 From 1918 – 1940 , when Estonia was independent , the small Swedish community was well treated . Municipalities with a Swedish majority , mainly found along the coast , used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish @-@ Estonian culture saw an upswing . However , most Swedish @-@ speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of World War II , that is , before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944 . Only a handful of older speakers remain . 
 = = Geographic distribution = = 
 Swedish is the official national language of both Sweden and Finland ( in Finland besides Finnish language who is the biggest official language of Finland ) . As of 2006 , it was the first or sole native language of 7 @.@ 5 to 8 million Swedish residents . In 2007 around 5 @.@ 5 % ( c . 290 @,@ 000 ) of the population of Finland were native speakers of Swedish , though the percentage has been declining steadily since Finland became part of Russia after the Finnish War 1808 – 1809 . The Finland Swedish minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western Finland . In some of these areas , Swedish is the predominant language ; in 19 municipalities , 16 of which are located in Åland , Swedish is the sole official language . Åland county is an autonomous region of Finland . 
 According to a rough estimation , as of 2010 there were up to 300 @,@ 000 Swedish @-@ speakers living outside Sweden and Finland . The largest populations were in the United States ( up to 100 @,@ 000 ) , the UK , Spain and Germany ( c . 30 @,@ 000 each ) and a large proportion of the remaining 100 @,@ 000 in the Scandinavian countries , France , Switzerland , Belgium , the Netherlands , Canada and Australia . A considerable majority of Swedish residents born outside Sweden ( c . 1 @.@ 5 million ) speak Swedish and according to the <unk> Project , there were c . 2 @,@ 390 @,@ 000 second @-@ language speakers in Finland . According to a survey by the European Commission , 44 % of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation , for a total of about 5 million second @-@ language speakers . The total number of native speakers could be up to 8 @.@ 6 million with an additional 4 – 5 million second language speakers in Sweden and Finland . Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages , a considerable proportion of speakers of Danish and especially Norwegian are highly fluent in Swedish for a total number of speakers that could be as high as 15 million . 
 There is considerable migration between the Nordic countries , but owing to the similarity between the cultures and languages ( with the exception of Finnish ) , expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group . According to the 2000 United States Census , some 67 @,@ 000 people over the age of five were reported as Swedish speakers , though without any information on the degree of language proficiency . Similarly , there were 16 @,@ 915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census . Although there are no certain numbers , some 40 @,@ 000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom . Outside Sweden and Finland , there are about 40 @,@ 000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses . 
 = = = Official status = = = 
 Swedish is officially the main language of Sweden . Swedish is also one of two official languages of Finland . In Sweden it has long been used in local and state government and most of the educational system but remained only a de facto primary language with no official status in law until 2009 . A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin ( 145 – 147 ) due to a pairing @-@ off failure . A proposal for a broader language law , designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages , was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008 . It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag and entered into effect on 1 July 2009 . 
 Swedish is the sole official language of Åland ( an autonomous province under the sovereignty of Finland ) where the vast majority of the 26 @,@ 000 inhabitants speak Swedish as a first language . In Finland as a whole Swedish is one of the two " national " languages , with the same official status as Finnish ( spoken by the majority ) on the state level and an official language in some municipalities . 
 Swedish is one of the official languages of the European Union and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council . Under the Nordic Language Convention , citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Swedish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs . 
 = = = Regulatory bodies = = = 
 The Swedish Language Council ( <unk> ) is the official regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language , as for instance the Académie française does for French . However , many organizations and agencies require the use of the council 's publication Svenska <unk> in official contexts , with it otherwise being regarded as a de facto orthographic standard . Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council , the Swedish Academy ( established 1786 ) is arguably the most influential . Its primary instruments are the glossary Svenska Akademiens <unk> ( <unk> , currently in its 14th edition ) and the dictionary Svenska Akademiens <unk> , in addition to various books on grammar , spelling and manuals of style . Even though the dictionaries are sometimes used as official decrees of the language , their main purpose is to describe current usage . 
 In Finland a special branch of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland has official status as the regulatory body for Swedish in Finland . Among its highest priorities is to maintain intelligibility with the language spoken in Sweden . It has published <unk> <unk> , a dictionary about the differences between Swedish in Finland and Sweden . 
 = = Dialects = = 
 According to a traditional division of Swedish dialects , there are six main groups of dialects : 
 Norrland dialects 
 Finland Swedish 
 Svealand dialects 
 Gotland dialects 
 Götaland dialects 
 South Swedish dialects 
 The traditional definition of a Swedish dialect has been a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse . Many of the genuine rural dialects , such as those of <unk> in Dalarna or <unk> in Österbotten , have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features , such as plural forms of verbs or archaic case inflections . These dialects can be near @-@ incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes , and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish . The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual parishes and are referred to by Swedish linguists as <unk> ( lit . " parish speech " ) . They are generally separated into six major groups , with common characteristics of prosody , grammar and vocabulary . One or several examples from each group are given here . Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects , the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately . 
 This type of classification , however , is based on a somewhat romanticized nationalist view of ethnicity and language . The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered " genuine " is not generally accepted by modern scholars . No dialects , no matter how remote or obscure , remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language , especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of mass media and advanced forms of transport . The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from " standard language " to " rural dialect " where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation . All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in Dalarna , Norrbotten and , to some extent , Gotland can be considered to be part of a common , mutually intelligible dialect continuum . This continuum may also include Norwegian and some Danish dialects . 
 The samples linked below have been taken from <unk> , a research project on Swedish modern dialects available for download ( though with information in Swedish only ) , with many more samples from 100 different dialects with recordings from four different speakers : older female , older male , younger female and younger male . The dialect groups are those traditionally used by dialectologists .

 = = = Standard Swedish = = = 
 Standard Swedish is the language used by virtually all Swedes and most Swedish @-@ speaking Finns . It is called rikssvenska or <unk> ( " Standard Swedish " ) in Sweden . In Finland <unk> ( " High Swedish " ) is used for the Finnish variant of standard Swedish and rikssvenska refers to Swedish as spoken in Sweden in general . The word <unk> is seldom used in Sweden . 
 There are many regional varieties of the standard language that are specific to geographical areas of varying size ( regions , historical provinces , cities , towns , etc . ) . In mass media it is no longer uncommon for journalists to speak with a distinct regional accent , but the most common pronunciation and the one perceived as the most formal is still Central Standard Swedish . 
 Though this terminology and its definitions have long been established among linguists , most Swedes are unaware of the distinction and its historical background , and often refer to the regional varieties as " dialects " . In a poll that was conducted in 2005 by the Swedish Retail Institute ( <unk> <unk> ) , the attitudes of Swedes to the use of certain dialects by salesmen revealed that 54 % believed that rikssvenska was the variety they would prefer to hear when speaking with salesmen over the phone , even though several dialects such as <unk> or <unk> were provided as alternatives in the poll . 
 = = = Finland Swedish = = = 
 Finland was a part of Sweden from the 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809 . Swedish was the sole administrative language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917 . The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then . The Swedish @-@ speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia , Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high , with Swedish being spoken by more than 90 % of the population in several municipalities , and on Åland , where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language . Swedish is an official language also in the rest of Finland , though , with the same official status as Finnish . The country 's public broadcaster , Yle , provides two Swedish @-@ language radio stations , Yle Radio Vega and Yle <unk> , as well a TV channel , Yle <unk> . 
 = = = Immigrant variants = = = 
 Rinkeby Swedish ( after Rinkeby , a suburb of northern Stockholm with a large immigrant population ) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malmö . These varieties could alternatively be classified as <unk> , because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers . However , some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish ( after Rosengård in Malmö ) , a variant of Scanian . A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla @-@ Britt <unk> showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm . The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish ; only 1 @.@ 8 % guessed his native language correctly . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 Swedish dialects have either 17 or 18 vowel phonemes , 9 long and 9 short . As in the other Germanic languages , including English , most long vowels are phonetically paired with one of the short vowels , and the pairs are such that the two vowels are of similar quality , but with the short vowel being slightly lower and slightly centralized . In most dialects , the short vowel sound pronounced [ ɛ ] or [ æ ] has merged with the short / e / ( transcribed 〈 ɛ 〉 in the chart below ) . 
 There are 18 consonant phonemes , two of which , / ɧ / and / r / , vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker . In many dialects , sequences of / r / with a dental consonant result in retroflex consonants . / r / has a guttural or " French @-@ R " pronunciation in the South Swedish dialects ; consequently , these dialects lack retroflex consonants . 
 In stressed syllables , there are two tones , which give Swedish much of its characteristic sound . Prosody is often one of the most noticeable differences between its dialects . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 The vocabulary of Swedish is mainly Germanic , either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German , Middle Low German , and to some extent , English . Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are mus ( " mouse " ) , kung ( " king " ) , and <unk> ( " goose " ) . A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of Latin or Greek origin , often borrowed from French and , lately , English . Some 1 – 200 words are also borrowed from <unk> or Romani , often as slang varieties ; a commonly used word from Romani is <unk> ( " girl " ) . 
 A large number of French words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century . These words have been transcribed to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced recognizably to a French @-@ speaker . Most of them are distinguished by a " French accent " , characterized by emphasis on the last syllable . For example , <unk> ( fr. <unk> , " level " ) , <unk> ( fr. <unk> , " armchair " ) and <unk> ( " shop ; affair " ) , etc . Cross @-@ borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common , at first from Middle Low German , the lingua franca of the Hanseatic league and later from standard German . Some compounds are translations of the elements ( calques ) of German original compounds into Swedish , like <unk> from German <unk> ( " cotton " , literally tree @-@ wool ) . 
 As with many Germanic languages , new words can be formed by compounding , e.g. nouns like <unk> ( " nail polish remover " ) or verbs like <unk> ( " to film in secret " ) . Similar to German or Dutch , very long , and quite impractical , examples like <unk> ( " production controller system software update " ) are possible , but it is seldom this ungainly , at least in spoken Swedish and outside of technical writing . Compound nouns take their gender from the head , which in Swedish is always the last morpheme . New words can also be coined by derivation from other established words , such as the <unk> of nouns by the adding of the suffix -a , as in bil ( " car " ) and <unk> ( " travel ( recreationally ) by car " ) . The opposite , making nouns of verbs , is also possible , as in <unk> ( " way of thinking ; concept " ) from <unk> ( " to think " ) . 
 = = Writing system = = 
 The Swedish alphabet is a 29 @-@ letter alphabet , using the 26 @-@ letter ISO basic Latin alphabet plus the three additional letters Å / å , <unk> / ä , and <unk> / ö constructed in the 16th century by writing " o " and " e " on top of an " a " , and an " e " on top of an " o " . Though these combinations are historically modified versions of A and O according to the English range of usage for the term diacritic , these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application , but rather separate letters , and are independent letters following z . Before the release of the 13th edition of Svenska Akademiens <unk> in April 2006 , w was treated as merely a variant of v used only in names ( such as " Wallenberg " ) and foreign words ( " bowling " ) , and so was both sorted and pronounced as a v. Other diacritics ( to use the broader English term usage referenced here ) are unusual in Swedish ; é is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing e , especially when the stress changes the meaning ( ide vs. <unk> , " winter lair " vs. " idea " ) as well as in some names , like <unk> ; occasionally other acute accents and , less often , grave accents can be seen in names and some foreign words . The letter à is used to refer to unit cost ( a loan from the French ) , equivalent to the at sign ( @ ) in English . 
 The German ü is treated as a variant of y and sometimes retained in foreign names and words , e.g. <unk> ( " <unk> / granola " ) . A proper diaeresis may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style ( for instance : " <unk> " ) . The German convention of writing ä and ö as ae and oe if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish . Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national top @-@ level Internet domain and other such domains , Swedish sites are frequently labelled using a and o , based on visual similarity ( mainly to avoid lingering technical problems with the use of characters which are outside of the limited 7 @-@ bit ASCII set ) . 
 The Swedish alphabet is completely identical to the Finnish alphabet . 
 In Swedish orthography , the colon is used in a similar manner as in English , with some exceptions : the colon is used for some abbreviations , such as 3 : e for <unk> ( " third " ) and S : t for Sankt ( " Saint " ) , and for all types of endings that can be added to numbers , letters and abbreviations , such as a : et ( " the a " ) and CD : n ( " the CD " ) , or the genitive form USA : s ( " USA 's " ) . 
 = = Grammar = = 
 Swedish nouns and adjectives are declined in genders as well as number . Nouns belong to one of two genders — common for the en form or neuter for the ett form — which also determine the declension of adjectives . For example , the word fisk ( " fish " ) is a noun of common gender ( en fisk ) and can have the following forms : 
 The definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix ( -en , -n , -et or -t ) , depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not . The definite articles den , det , and de are used for variations to the <unk> of a noun . They can double as demonstrative pronouns or demonstrative determiners when used with adverbs such as här ( " here " ) or där ( " there " ) to form den / det här ( can also be " denna / <unk> " ) ( " this " ) , de här ( can also be " <unk> " ) ( " these " ) , den / det där ( " that " ) , and de där ( " those " ) . For example , den där fisken means " that fish " and refers to a specific fish ; den fisken is less definite and means " that fish " in a more abstract sense , such as that set of fish ; while fisken means " the fish " . In certain cases , the definite form indicates possession , e.g. , jag <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " I must wash my hair " ) . 
 Adjectives are inflected in two <unk> — indefinite and definite — and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number . The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix ( -t or -a ) to the common form of the adjective , e.g. , en <unk> <unk> ( a green chair ) , ett <unk> hus ( a green house ) , and gröna <unk> ( " green chairs " ) . The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form , e.g. , den gröna stolen ( " the green chair " ) , det gröna huset ( " the green house " ) , and de gröna <unk> ( " the green chairs " ) . 
 Swedish pronouns are similar to those of English . Besides the two natural genders han and hon ( " he " and " she " ) , there are also the two grammatical genders den and det , usually termed common and neuter . Unlike the nouns , pronouns have an additional object form , derived from the old dative form . Hon , for example , has the following nominative , possessive , and object forms : 
 hon – hennes – henne 
 Swedish also uses third @-@ person possessive reflexive pronouns that refer to the subject in a clause , a trait which is restricted to North Germanic languages : 
 Anna <unk> Maria sin bok . ; " Anna gave Maria her [ Anna 's ] book . " ( reflexive ) 
 Anna <unk> Maria hennes bok . ; " Anna gave Maria her [ Maria 's ] book . " ( not reflexive ) 
 Swedish used to have genitive that was placed at the end of the head of a noun phrase . In modern Swedish , it has become an enclitic -s , which attaches to the end of the noun phrase , rather than the noun itself . 
 hästen ; " the horse " — <unk> " the horse 's " 
 hästen på den <unk> <unk> <unk> man ; " the horse in the flowering meadow 's black mane " 
 In formal written language , it used to be considered correct to place the genitive -s after the head of the noun phrase ( hästen ) , though this is today considered dated , and different grammatical constructions are often used . 
 Verbs are conjugated according to tense . One group of verbs ( the ones ending in -er in present tense ) has a special imperative form ( generally the verb stem ) , but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the infinitive form . Perfect and present participles as adjectival verbs are very common : 
 Perfect participle : en stekt fisk ; " a fried fish " ( <unk> 
 = to fry ) 
 Present participle : en <unk> fisk ; " a stinking fish " ( <unk> = 
 to stink ) 
 In contrast to English and many other languages , Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect . Rather , the auxiliary verb har ( " have " ) , hade ( " had " ) is followed by a special form , called supine , used solely for this purpose ( although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle ) : 
 Perfect participle : målad , " painted " – supine <unk> , present perfect har <unk> ; " have painted " 
 Perfect participle : stekt , " fried " – supine stekt , present perfect har stekt ; " have fried " 
 Perfect participle : <unk> , " written " – supine <unk> , present perfect har <unk> ; " have written " 
 When building the compound passive voice using the verb att <unk> , the past participle is used : 
 den <unk> målad ; " it 's being painted " 
 den <unk> målad ; " it was painted " 
 There exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding -s , replacing the final r in the present tense : 
 den <unk> ; " it 's being painted " 
 den <unk> ; " it was painted " 
 In a subordinate clause , the auxiliary har is optional and often omitted , particularly in written Swedish . 
 Jag ser att han ( har ) stekt fisken ; " I see that he has fried the fish " 
 <unk> mood is occasionally used for some verbs , but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs ( as for instance : <unk> , <unk> ) as separate conjugations , most of them remaining only as set of idiomatic expressions . 
 Where other languages may use grammatical cases , Swedish uses numerous prepositions , similar to those found in English . As in modern German , prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish , but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like till <unk> ( " on foot " , genitive ) . 
 As Swedish is a Germanic language , the syntax shows similarities to both English and German . Like English , Swedish has a subject – verb – object basic word order , but like German , it utilizes verb @-@ second word order in main clauses , for instance after adverbs , adverbial phrases and dependent clauses . ( <unk> phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence . ) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place – manner – time order , as in English ( but not German ) . Adjectives precede the noun they modify .

 = Compliance requirements = 
 In the United States , compliance requirements are a series of directives United States federal government agencies established that summarize hundreds of federal laws and regulations applicable to federal assistance ( also known as federal aid or federal funds ) . They are currently incorporated into the OMB A @-@ 133 Compliance Supplement , which was created by the US Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) . 
 To facilitate a recipients ' compliance with federal laws and regulations , and as well as its annual Single Audit , the OMB created fourteen basic and standard compliance requirements that recipients must comply with when receiving and using such federal assistance . The OMB also provides detailed explanations , discussions , and guidance about them in the OMB A @-@ 133 Compliance Supplement . Compliance requirements are only guidelines for compliance with the hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to the specific type assistance used by the recipient , and their objectives are generic in nature due to the large number of federal programs . Each compliance requirement is identified by a letter , in alphabetical order . 
 = = Activities allowed or <unk> ( A ) = = 
 This compliance requirement establishes that each program operates for a specific purpose ( such as the care of elderly persons or the education of children ) , and that funds provided for the program must only be used in activities that benefit that purpose . Therefore , federal assistance provided to a recipient for a specific purpose must be expended for such purpose only . 
 = = Allowable costs / cost principles ( B ) = = 
 This compliance requirements is one of the most important sections , because it covers cost accounting policies , expenses and expenditures , and actual use of federal funds to administer a federal assistance program . In other words , it provides the basis and principles recipients must adhere to when spending federal funds . 
 The federal government categorizes recipient types into three groups : * State , local , and Indian tribal governments 
 Institutions of higher education 
 Non @-@ profit organizations 
 Prior to December 26 , 2014 , each group has a separate set of cost principles to follow . The cost principles applicable to a recipient type apply to all federal assistance received by that entity , regardless of whether the awards are received directly from the federal government or indirectly through a pass @-@ through entity . 
 The OMB issues a Cost Principle Circular for each category . This is a guide for spending federal assistance in accordance with laws and regulations : 
 OMB Circular A 87 , “ Cost Principles for State , Local , and Indian Tribal Governments ” ( 2 CFR part 225 ) – This circular includes the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia ( Washington , D.C. ) , any agency or instrumentality of these governments — and any county , parish , municipality , city , town , State @-@ designated Indian tribal government , school district , United States territories and possessions , and any agency or instrumentality of these governments . 
 OMB Circular A @-@ 21 , “ Cost Principles for Educational Institutions ” ( 2 CFR part 220 ) - All institutions of higher education ( e.g. , Colleges , Universities , etc . ) are subject to the cost principles contained in this circular . 
 OMB Circular A @-@ 122 , “ Cost Principles for Non @-@ Profit Organizations ” ( 2 CFR part 230 ) - Non @-@ profit organizations are subject to this circular , except those non @-@ profit organizations listed in OMB Circular A @-@ 122 , Attachment C that are subject to the commercial cost principles contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation ( FAR ) . 
 The three circulars list various types of cost or expense item ( such as travel expense , maintenance expense , payroll salaries , lobbying costs , purchase of materials , payment of utility bills , etc . ) , and establishes whether each is either allowable or unallowable . Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance . <unk> costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance . Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable , such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs , but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient . As a general rule , any assistance used inappropriately , such as incurring unallowable costs , requires reimbursement to the federal government . 
 The Uniform Administrative Requirements , Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards was issued by the Office of Management and Budget on December 26 , 2013 . This final guidance superseded and streamlined the requirements from OMB Circulars A @-@ 21 , A @-@ 87 , A @-@ 110 , and A @-@ 122 ( which have been placed in OMB guidance ) ; Circulars A @-@ 89 , A @-@ 102 , and A @-@ 133 ; and the guidance in Circular A @-@ 50 on Single Audit Act follow @-@ up . 
 In order for cost to be considered allowable , they must be supported by adequate documentation . 
 = = = Documentation standards - payroll costs = = = 
 Charges to federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed . These records must : ( i ) Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate , allowable , and properly allocated ; [ 2 CFR § 200 @.@ 430 ( i ) ] Documenting time worked on federally funded activities is commonly referred to as Time and Effort Reporting . 
 = = = Documentation standards - non @-@ payroll costs = = = 
 The nature of documentation required for <unk> costs will vary by the nature of the transaction . 
 Per 2 CFR § 200 @.@ 403 , Except where otherwise authorized by statute , costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under federal awards : 
 ( a ) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the federal award and be <unk> thereto under these principles . 
 ( b ) <unk> to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the federal award as to types or amount of cost items . 
 ( c ) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally financed and other activities of the non @-@ federal entity . 
 ( d ) Be accorded consistent treatment . A cost may not be assigned to a federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the federal award as an indirect cost . 
 ( e ) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) , except , for state and local governments and Indian tribes only , as otherwise provided for in this Part . 
 ( f ) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of any other federally financed program in either the current or a prior period . 
 ( g ) Be adequately documented . 
 = = Cash management ( C ) = = 
 This section covers the actual management , or handling , of funds pertaining to a federal program , specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the funds until disbursement . The actual transfer of funds , commonly referred to as “ drawdowns ” , is usually done electronically by requesting the funds to the federal agency via website or a network . The funds are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient ’ s bank account . Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods , also called “ funding techniques ” : by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds . 
 Advances of funds – Advances are federal funds provided to a recipient before the program activity is performed . Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure ( e.g. , through budget process ) and request the amount to the federal government ( or in the case of subrecipients to the pass @-@ through entity , see Subrecipient Monitoring below ) . The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity ( e.g. , purchase good or service or for payroll ) . However , laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed , and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement . Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program . 
 Reimbursement of funds – This funding technique requires the recipient to pay program expenditures with their own funds , and then request a reimbursement for those expenses from the federal government or pass @-@ through entity . Recipients prepare and send reimbursement requests , and maintain supporting documentation showing that the costs for which reimbursement was requested were paid prior to the date of the reimbursement request . 
 = = Davis @-@ Bacon Act ( D ) = = 
 As part of the US Department of Labor ’ s ( DOL ) <unk> implementation of the Davis @-@ Bacon Act , federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $ 2 @,@ 000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location ( i.e. , the prevailing wage ) . This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige contractors to comply with the Davis @-@ Bacon Act , by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement to comply with the Davis @-@ Bacon Act and the DOL regulations . The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly ( e.g. , for each week in which any contract work is performed ) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance . This report is commonly referred to as “ certified payrolls ” , and is often done using Optional Form WH @-@ 347 ( OMB No. 1215 @-@ 0149 ) , a standard form pre @-@ designed by the OMB . 
 = = Eligibility ( E ) = = 
 The main objective of this compliance requirement is that only eligible individuals or organizations participate in federal assistance programs . While the criterion for determining eligibility may vary from program to program , the objective that only eligible individuals or organizations participate is consistent across all federal programs , which forms the basis of this compliance requirement . To comply with this objective , recipients must first assure that proper eligibility determinations are made , which means that the recipient must determine the parameters and limitations to define eligibility for a specific program in accordance with the program ’ s purpose . Many federal programs already contain eligibility requirements based on laws , agency regulations , grant agreements , etc . , and recipients must assure that their eligibility determination complies with such requirements . An example includes federal programs that offer HIV / Aids treatment and require that the participants be victims of such diseases . It is usually the recipient ’ s responsibility to determine how to determine such eligibility , such as establishing policy that requires an in @-@ house doctor or laboratory to diagnose each prospective participant , accepting diagnoses from third @-@ party doctors or laboratories , etc . However , certain agencies have included specific parameters for which the recipient should follow , as in the case of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) which states in the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) that recipients of certain HUD housing subsidy programs must obtain specific income verification documents to prove participant eligibility , such as W @-@ 2 payroll forms , a federal income tax return , etc . 
 After determining which eligibility requirements participation in a program requires , the recipient must also assure that individual program participant or group eligibility was correctly determined by keeping evidence of such compliance , such as maintaining documentation in participant files ( e.g. , copies of HIV / Aids diagnosis , copies of federal income tax returns , etc . ) . Furthermore , the recipient must assure that only eligible individuals or groups participated in the program by establishing strict controls of program funds to avoid non @-@ eligible persons from receiving the specific assistance . 
 = = Equipment and real property management ( F ) = = 
 This section established directives on how a recipient should manage equipment and real property of a federal program . 
 = = = Equipment management = = = 
 Equipment means tangible , non @-@ expendable property acquired with federal assistance funds , that has a useful life of more than one year , and an acquisition cost of $ 5 @,@ 000 or more per unit ( though , consistent with a recipient ’ s own equipment policy , lower cost limits may be established ) . Basically , this section requires that , as per A @-@ 102 Common Rule and OMB Circular A @-@ 110 regulations , equipment must be used in the federal program it was bought for , or — when appropriate — other federal programs . Additionally , the recipient must keep equipment records , perform a physical equipment inventory at least once every two years , and implement an appropriate internal control system to safeguard and maintain the equipment . When equipment with a current fair market value of $ 5 @,@ 000 or more is no longer needed , it may be retained or sold , as a proportionate share is provided to the federal government amount of the current fair market value , based on the percent of federal funds to own recipients fund used to buy the item . 
 = = = Real property management = = = 
 Title to real property acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient . It must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose . Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the <unk> property was bought for , as long as the federal government authorizes it . However it may not dispose of or <unk> the title to real property without prior federal government consent . When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects , the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government . Just like equipment , if the property is sold , a proportionate share is provided to the federal government amount of the current fair market value , based on the percent of federal funds to own recipients fund used to acquire the item . 
 = = Matching , level of effort , earmarking ( G ) = = 
 This section covers 3 compliance requirements concerning recipient performance . They may require that recipients provide a level of contributions to a federal program , maintain specific levels of performance or achievement , or restrict the amount of federal funds used for a specific purpose . Failure to meet these requirements may result in either limitation of future funds or termination of assistance . Specific requirements for matching , level of effort , and earmarking are unique to each federal program , and are described in the laws , regulations , and contract or grant provisions that pertain to the program . 
 = = = Matching = = = 
 Matching , also referred to as “ cost sharing ” , is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations ( usually non @-@ federal ) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received . In other words , when the recipient participates in a federal program ( e.g. it receives federal assistance ) and an operating budget is prepared , the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program ’ s operations . The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100 % and that , although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses , the recipient must still cover a portion of them . Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government , but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses , so long as the contribution is verifiable , generally does not originate from another federal program , and is considered in the operating budget . The expenses must be necessary and reasonable , allowed under cost principles ( see B section above ) , and not used for another federal program . Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient ’ s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs ( e.g. , paying program utility bills , paying part of program personnel payroll , etc . ) or , in some cases , in the form of in @-@ kind contributions , which are donations of non @-@ monetary objects such as services , materials , property , etc . 
 Examples of matching include the Head Start program , which requires that recipients provide 20 % of the total annual expenses in either monetary or in @-@ kind contributions . Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll , or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms . However , the federal government requires that in @-@ kind contributions be properly valued and evidenced ( such as estimating the value of a building to make sure that it meets the 20 % of the program budget ) , and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only . 
 = = = Level of effort = = = 
 Level of effort defines particular goals or objectives the recipient must achieve with the assistance received , and includes recipient requirements for a specified level of service , specified level of expenditures for designated activities , and federal funds to supplement and not supplant non @-@ federal services . Some examples are programs that establish that a recipient must provide medical services to 1 @,@ 000 patients daily and programs that require that a recipients spend over 50 % of its annual budget on capital projects , among other . 
 = = = Earmarking = = = 
 Earmarking is a requirement that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program ’ s assistance that must ( minimum ) or may ( maximum ) be used for specified activities . Examples of this include limits imposed on the federal government on the amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses , or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients . Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered ( e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to ) . 
 = = Period of availability of federal funds ( H ) = = 
 This section establishes the fact that , although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan , the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period , usually one year . Federal regulations prohibit the use of funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency , and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only . For example , a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1 , 2006 and ends on December 31 , 2006 cannot be used after December 31 , because its lifespan has terminated . This surplus must be returned to the federal agency unless otherwise authorized . 
 = = Procurement and suspension and debarment ( I ) = = 
 This section covers compliance of laws and regulations when obtaining a good or services from a vendor , supplier , or provider . The procurement requirement is established to ensure that such goods and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance laws and regulations , including the prohibition of conflicts of interest , the fair selection of vendors , provide open and free competition among vendors , etc . The suspension and debarment requirement establishes that certain non @-@ federal entities have been prohibited from participating in or receiving federal assistance for various reasons , including prior mismanagement of funds or previous non @-@ compliance of laws and regulations . This prohibition may be temporary ( suspension ) or indefinite ( debarment ; until specifically allowed by the government ) . When performing this purchase , the recipient must verify that the vendor , supplier , provider or their respective principals ( e.g. , owners , top management , etc . ) are not suspended , debarred or otherwise excluded by the federal government . This is done by checking the Excluded Parties List System ( <unk> ) maintained by the General Services Administration or by contacting the federal agency . 
 = = Program income ( J ) = = 
 Program income is sometimes directly generated by the federally funded program . This type of income includes , but is not limited to , income from fees for services performed , the use or rental of property acquired with program funds , the sale of items fabricated under the program , and payments of principal and interest on loans made by the recipient to others with program funds . However , it generally does not include interest on program funds ( which is covered under “ Cash Management ” , see above ) ; nor does it cover rebates , credits , discounts , and refunds ( covered under “ Allowable Costs / Cost Principles ” ) ; nor proceeds from the sale of equipment or real property ( covered under “ Equipment and Real Property Management ” ) . The uses or treatment of program income are either deducted by the federal agency from the current program budget ( e.g. , the program income substitutes part of the original budget ) , added to the current program budget , or used to meet matching requirements . 
 = = Real property acquisition and relocation assistance ( K ) = = 
 This section covers compliance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 ( URA ) . This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes , businesses , or farms , including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation . For example , if the construction of a highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes , the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for , or reimbursement of , relocation expenses incurred by the affected person . The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers , the appraisals are examined by a review appraiser to assure acceptability , and that after acceptance , the review appraiser certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner . 
 = = Reporting ( L ) = = 
 This section establishes that all recipients must submit reports ( whether financial , performance @-@ related , or of special nature ) to the federal government to monitor federal assistance activities and uses . The most common reports are pre @-@ designed by the federal agency , are approved by OMB , and are freely available to all recipients and the general public . The time deadlines for submitting them vary depending on the report . Furthermore , the reporting requirements ( e.g. , which reports must be submitted , the timing of the submission , information in the reports , etc . ) may vary from recipient to recipient , although the federal government has established several reports that apply to all recipients . Some of the most common of these “ universal ” reports include : 
 SF @-@ 269 ( OMB approval no . 0348 @-@ 0039 ) or SF @-@ <unk> ( OMB no . 0348 @-@ <unk> ) , commonly known as the Financial Status Report ( <unk> ) – Used to report the status of funds ( e.g. , amount received , amount expended or used , amount reserved , amount unused , etc . ) 
 SF @-@ 270 ( OMB no . 0348 @-@ 0004 ) , also known as the Request for Advance or Reimbursement - Used to request U.S. Treasury advance payments and reimbursements under non @-@ construction programs . 
 SF @-@ 272 ( OMB no . 0348 @-@ 0003 ) or SF @-@ 272 @-@ A ( OMB No. 0348 @-@ 0003 ) , commonly known as the Federal Cash Transactions Report or Status of Federal Cash Report - Provides accountability of all federal cash received by the recipient . It is partially prepared by the Division of Payment Management ( DPM ) within the Department of Health and Human Services based on data reported to the DPM by recipients and federal agencies , and is completed and certified by the recipient . 
 = = Subrecipient monitoring ( M ) = = 
 This compliance requirement establishes that any non @-@ federal recipient of federal assistance that passes that assistance , whether in part or in total , to another recipient ( known as pass @-@ through entities and subrecipients , respectively ) is responsible to monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient , as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations . This requirement is based on the fact that they are both equally responsible for federal funds received . Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits , regular contact , interviews , meetings and examinations of the subrecipient , as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit . 
 = = Special tests and provisions ( N ) = = 
 Certain programs have unique compliance requirements — established by laws , regulations , and contract or grant agreements — that do not fit into the requirements listed above . This sections covers those requirements . The auditor must review the program ’ s contract and grant agreements and referenced laws and regulations to identify unique compliance requirements , and develop audit objectives and audit procedures under this section .

 = Jocelin of Glasgow = 
 Jocelin ( or Jocelyn ) ( died 1199 ) was a twelfth @-@ century Cistercian monk and cleric who became the fourth Abbot of Melrose before becoming Bishop of Glasgow , Scotland . He was probably born in the 1130s , and in his teenage years became a monk of Melrose Abbey . He rose in the service of Abbot Waltheof , and by the time of the short abbacy of Waltheof 's successor Abbot William , Jocelin had become prior . Then in 1170 Jocelin himself became abbot , a position he held for four years . Jocelin was responsible for promoting the cult of the emerging Saint Waltheof , and in this had the support of Enguerrand , Bishop of Glasgow . 
 His Glasgow connections and political profile were already well @-@ established enough that in 1174 Jocelin succeeded Enguerrand as Glasgow 's bishop . As Bishop of Glasgow , he was a royal official . In this capacity he travelled abroad on several occasions , and performed the marriage ceremony between King William the Lion and Ermengarde de Beaumont , later baptising their son , the future King Alexander II . Among other things , he has been credited by modern historians as " the founder of the burgh of Glasgow and initiator of the Glasgow fair " , as well as being one of the greatest literary patrons in medieval Scotland , commissioning the Life of St Waltheof , the Life of St Kentigern and the Chronicle of Melrose . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Jocelin and his family probably came from the south @-@ east of Scotland . The names of neither his father nor his mother are known , but he had two known brothers , with the names Helia and Henry , and a cousin , also called Helia . The names suggest that his family were of French , or at least Anglo @-@ Norman origin , rather than being a Scot or native Anglo @-@ Saxon . There are some indications that his family held land in South Lanarkshire , namely because they seem to have possessed rights in the church of <unk> . It is unlikely that he would have thought of himself as " Scottish " . For Jocelin 's contemporary and fellow native of the Borders , Adam of Dryburgh , this part of Britain was still firmly regarded as terra Anglorum ( the " Land of English " ) , although it was located inside the regnum Scottorum ( the " Kingdom of the Scots " ) . This would be no obstacle to Jocelin , however . His Anglo @-@ French cultural background was in fact probably necessary for the patronage of the King of Scots . As Walter of Coventry wrote of King William 's era , " the modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen , in race , manners , language and culture ; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following , and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude " . 
 Like that of almost every character from this period , Jocelin 's year of birth is unknown to modern historians . It is known that he entered as a novice monk in Melrose Abbey during the abbacy of Waltheof ( ab . 1148 – 1159 ) , and from documentary evidence it seems likely that Jocelin entered Melrose about 50 years before his death in 1199 . As the rules of the Cistercian order prevented entry as a novice before the age of 15 , it is likely that he was born around the year 1134 . Little is known about Jocelin 's early life or his early career as a Melrose monk . He obviously successfully completed his one @-@ year <unk> , the year in which a prospective monk was introduced to monasticism and judged fit or unfit for admittance . We know that Abbot Waltheof ( <unk> ) thought highly of him and granted him many responsibilities . After the death of Abbot Waltheof , his successor , Abbot William , refused to encourage the rumours which had quickly been spreading about Waltheof 's saintliness . Abbot William attempted to silence such rumours , and shelter his monks from the intrusiveness of would @-@ be pilgrims . However , William was unable to get the better of Waltheof 's emerging cult , and his actions had alienated him from the brethren . As a result , William resigned the abbacy in April 1170 . Jocelin was by this stage the Prior of Melrose , that is , the second in command at the monastery , and thus William 's most likely replacement . 
 = = Abbot of Melrose = = 
 So it was that Prior Jocelin became abbot on 22 April 1170 . Jocelin embraced the cult without hesitation . Under the year of his accession , it was reported in the Chronicle of Melrose that : 
 Promoting saints was something Jocelin would repeat at Glasgow , where he " transferred his enthusiasm to St Kentigern " and commissioned a hagiography of that saint , the saint most venerated by the Celts of the diocese of Glasgow . It is no coincidence that Jocelin of Furness , the man who wrote the Life of St. Waltheof , was the same man later commissioned to write the Life of St. Kentigern . 
 This kind of literary patronage started while Jocelin was abbot of Melrose . Archie Duncan has shown that it was probably Jocelin who first commissioned the writing of the Chronicle of Melrose . Duncan argued that Jocelin commissioned the entries dealing with the period between 731 and 1170 , putting the writing in the hands of a monk named Reinald ( who later became Bishop of Ross ) . This chronicle is one of the few extant chronicles from " Scotland " in this period . G. W. S. Barrow , writing before Duncan advanced these arguments , noted that down to the end of King William 's reign " the chronicle of Melrose Abbey ... represents a strongly ' Anglo @-@ Norman ' as opposed to a native Scottish point of view " . It is thus possible that this anti @-@ Scottish world @-@ view reflected that of Jocelin 's , at least before he left the abbey . 
 After his election to the prestigious bishopric of Glasgow in 1174 , Jocelin would continue exerting influence on his home monastery . Jocelin brought one of his monks from the abbey , a man called Michael , who acted as Jocelin 's chaplain while Bishop of Glasgow . He did not resign his position as abbot until after his consecration in 1175 . Jocelin consecrated his successors as abbot , and continued to spend a great deal of time there . Moreover , he used his position as bishop to offer the monastery patronage and protection . 
 = = Bishop of Glasgow = = 
 After the death of his friend Bishop Enguerrand , Jocelin was elevated to the bishopric of Glasgow . He was elected on 23 May 1174 . The election , like many other Scottish episcopal elections of the period , was done in the presence of the king , William the Lion , at Perth , near Scone , the chief residence of Scotland 's kings . The election was probably done by compromissarii , meaning that the general chapter of the bishopric of Glasgow had selected a small group to which they delegated the power of election . Pope Alexander III was later told that Jocelin was elected by the dean and chapter of the see . The Chronicle of Melrose states that he was elected " by demand of the clergy , and of the people ; and with the consent of the king himself " , perhaps indicating that the decision had already been made by the Glasgow clergy before the formal election at Perth . The election was certainly an achievement . Cistercian bishops were rare in Great Britain , and Jocelin was only the second Cistercian to ascend a Scottish bishopric . Jocelin was required to go to France to obtain permission from the General Chapter of the Cistercian order at <unk> to resign the abbacy . Pope Alexander III had already sanctioned his consecration , and gave permission for the consecration to occur without forcing Jocelin to travel to Rome . Conveniently , it was at Cistercian house of Clairvaux that , sometime before 15 March 1175 , Jocelin was consecrated by the Papal legate Eskil , Archbishop of Lund and Primate of Denmark . Jocelin had returned to the Kingdom of Scotland by 10 April , and it is known that on 23 May he had consecrated a monk named Laurence as his successor at Melrose . 
 He was soon faced with a political challenge to the independence of his church . The challenge came from the English church , and was not new , but had lain dormant for some decades . The reason it was awakened was that in the summer of 1174 King William had invaded northern England , and on 13 July , having been caught <unk> during a siege at Alnwick , was captured and taken into English custody . The capture was disastrous for the king , leading to a revolt by Gilla Brigte , Lord of Galloway , and to many of William 's discontented subjects " ruthlessly " slaying " their English and French neighbours " and perpetrating a " most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway " , that is , of the English and French @-@ speaking settlers William and his predecessors had planted around the castles and towns of his Gaelic @-@ speaking territories in order to increase royal authority . Worse still , and more significantly for Jocelin , in the following year King Henry II of England forced William to sign the Treaty of Falaise , a treaty which made William Henry 's vassal specifically for Scotland and sanctioned the subordination of the kingdom 's bishoprics to the English church . 
 Jocelin did not , in the end , submit either to the Archbishop of York or even the Archbishop of Canterbury and managed to obtain a Papal Bull which declared the see of Glasgow to be a " special daughter " of the Roman Patriarchate . Jocelin , moreover , does not seem to have been interested in the independence of the other " Scottish " sees , but merely to maintain his own episcopal independence , i.e. that of the bishopric of Glasgow . On 10 August 1175 , along with many other Scottish @-@ based magnates and prelates , Jocelin was at Henry 's court giving his obedience to the king as stipulated in the treaty . Jocelin again appeared at King Henry 's court in January 1176 . This time church matters were on the agenda . When the Archbishop of York confronted Jocelin over the subordination of the bishopric of Glasgow to the archbishopric of York , Jocelin refused to acknowledge this part of the treaty , and presented him with the Papal Bull declaring Glasgow to be a " special daughter " . 
 This Bull was confirmed by Pope Alexander 's successor Pope Lucius III . Jocelin had obtained this confirmation while at Rome in late 1181 and early 1182 . He had been sent there by King William , along with abbots of Melrose , Dunfermline and Kelso and the prior of Inchcolm , in order to appeal to the Pope regarding his stance in a struggle over the Bishopric of St Andrews and the sentence of excommunication and interdict the Pope had placed over the king and kingdom . The dispute concerned the election to the bishopric of John the Scot , which had been opposed by the king , who organised the election of his own candidate , Hugh . The mission was successful . The Pope lifted the interdict , absolved the king and appointed two legates to investigate the issue of the St Andrews succession . The Pope even sent the king a Golden Rose , an item usually given to the Prefect of Rome . The issue of the succession , however , did not go away . In 1186 , Jocelin , along with the abbots of Melrose , Dunfermline and Newbattle , excommunicated Hugh on the instructions of Pope Lucius . Hugh travelled to Rome in 1188 , and obtained absolution , but he died of the pestilence in that city a few days later , thus allowing the issue to be resolved . 
 It is certainly obvious that Jocelin was one of the most respected figures in the kingdom . In this era , the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge @-@ delegate ( of the Papacy ) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom . As a bishop and an ex @-@ abbot , various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes , as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements , such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews , and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey . Jocelin had the respect of the secular elite too . He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non @-@ royal charters , including charters issued by David , Earl of Huntingdon ( the brother of King William ) , Donnchadh , Earl of Carrick , and Alan Fitzwalter , High Steward of Scotland . Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186 , and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186 . The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber , and it was to Jocelin 's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland . When a son was born to William and Ermengarde , the future King Alexander II , it was Jocelin who performed the baptism . In April 1194 , Jocelin again travelled to England in King William 's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin 's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage , thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow . 
 = = Legacy and death = = 
 His years at Glasgow left a mark on history that can be compared favourably with any previous or future bishop . Jocelin commissioned his namesake Jocelin of Furness , the same man who had written the Life of St. Waltheof , to write a Life of St. Kentigern , a task all the more necessary because , after 1159 , the Papacy claimed the right to <unk> saints . Kentigern , or Mungo as he is popularly known , was the saint traditionally associated with the see of Glasgow , and his status therefore reflected on Glasgow as a church and cult @-@ centre . There had already been a cathedral at Glasgow before Jocelin 's episcopate . The idea that the ecclesiastical establishment before Jocelin was simply a small church with a larger Gaelic or British monastic establishment has been discredited by scholars . Jocelin did , though , expand the cathedral significantly . As the Chronicle of Melrose reports for 1181 , Jocelin " gloriously enlarged the church of St Kentigern " . However , more work was created for the builders when , sometime between the years 1189 and 1195 , there was a fire at the cathedral . Jocelin thus had to commission another rebuilding effort . The new cathedral was dedicated , according to the Chronicle of Melrose , on 6 July 1197 . It was built in the Romanesque manner , and although little survives of it today , it is thought to have been influenced by the cathedral of Lund , the archbishop of which had consecrated Jocelin as bishop . 
 However , he left a still greater legacy to the city of Glasgow . At some point between the years 1175 and 1178 , Jocelin obtained from King William a grant of <unk> status for the settlement of Glasgow , with a market every Thursday . The grant of a market was the first ever official grant of a weekly market to a burgh . Moreover , between 1189 and 1195 , King William granted the burgh an annual fair , a fair still in existence today , increasing Glasgow 's status as an important settlement . As well as new revenues for the bishop , the rights entailed by Glasgow 's new <unk> status and market privileges brought new people to the settlement , one of the first of whom was one Ranulf de Haddington , a former burghess of Haddington . The new settlement was laid out ( probably under the influence of the burgh of Haddington ) around Glasgow Cross , down the hill from the cathedral and old fort of Glasgow , but above the flood level of the River Clyde . 
 When Jocelin died , he was back at Melrose Abbey , where his career had begun . He may have retired to Melrose knowing his death was near . Jocelin certainly did die at Melrose , passing away on St Patrick 's Day ( 17 March ) 1199 . He was buried in the monks ' choir of Melrose Abbey Church . Hugh de Roxburgh , Chancellor of Scotland , was elected as Jocelin 's replacement . The Chronicle of Melrose has only a short obituary .

Blaine is unhappy , though , when after he and Cooper do an impromptu mashup of two Duran Duran songs in the choir room , Cooper finds fault with Blaine 's singing . Sue recruits Cooper to give an acting master class for the club , which contains such bad advice that Blaine is appalled . Worse , Cooper subsequently criticizes Blaine 's acting in a class scene . 
 Most of New Directions goes on a " senior ditch day " to Six Flags , but Artie takes Quinn to a skate park designed for people with disabilities to enjoy adventurous sports . Quinn has a great time , but when Artie broaches the possibility that she might always need a wheelchair ; she asserts that she will walk again .

Shooting began by February 10 , 2012 , and continued at least through February 21 ; it had ended before February 23 , when shooting on the following episode commenced . 
 The news that Bomer had been cast as Blaine 's brother appeared on January 27 , 2012 . Bomer had suggested to Glee co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy that he consider using Gotye 's song featuring Kimbra , " Somebody That I Used to Know " , as a duet on the show . Murphy had already thought of doing the song , and a week later Bomer received a text from Murphy asking if he " wanted to come on the show to sing it " . Bomer 's scenes as Cooper were shot starting February 13 . In addition , it was reported in early February that there would be a flashback scene featuring Cooper and Blaine when they were children ; young actors were then being cast for the roles . 
 In addition to duetting on " Somebody That I Used to Know " , Bomer and Criss perform a mashup of the Duran Duran songs " Hungry Like the Wolf " and " Rio " early in the episode . Criss also sings Christina Aguilera 's " Fighter " . These songs were released as singles available for digital download , along with two others from the episode , " Up Up Up " and " I 'm Still Standing " , both performed by Agron and McHale . 
 The amusement park scenes in the episode were shot at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia , California . The roller coaster sequences were shot on the Viper ride .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The episode received mixed to positive reviews , though most reviewers expressed enthusiasm for guest star Bomer as the elder Anderson brother . Jeff Dodge of BuddyTV wrote that the episode was " very strong " , while The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff , although he gave the episode a " B " grade , called it " forgettable " aside from Bomer 's performance , which he described as " absolutely terrific " . Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly characterized the episode as a " laugh @-@ out @-@ loud funny " and Rae Votta of Billboard expressed similar sentiments , though she also said there was " definitely room for improvement " after a show that was " more fluff than substance " , albeit " delicious fluff " . Washington Post 's Jen Chaney described it as a " pretty lackluster episode " . 
 Bomer received plaudits from most reviewers . Crystal Bell of the Huffington Post called his appearance " perfect casting " and Bomer as one of her favorite guest stars . Strecker and VanDerWerff praised the " hilariously bad acting advice " in Cooper 's master class , and VanDerWerff said that the storyline of Blaine being " overshadowed by his charismatic older brother " worked " because the actors were so damn committed to it " . Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson was not fond of Cooper 's appearance , and described it as " an old @-@ school sitcom cliche to introduce long @-@ lost or oft @-@ neglected family members " . Dodge noted that Bomer 's role " didn 't overshadow everyone else , like some guest stars do " . 
 Quinn 's storyline received widely divergent commentary . Hankinson thought the writers had missed an opportunity to " do something hugely daring " and also reduce the size of the cast . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized their message as " Move on , folks , nothing to see here " , added that " there wasn ’ t even a scratch on her face " and concluded that it was " nice to know that touches of irony haven ’ t left the show " . Strecker called Quinn " a walking wheeling PSA about texting dangers in general " . Dodge said that one of his " favorite scenes " of the episode was " when Artie tries to get Quinn to wheel herself up a steep ramp outside McKinley " . VanDerWerff noted the pair 's " chemistry " as friends , and Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman described " Quinn 's kids @-@ in @-@ wheelchairs bonding scenes with Artie " as the " second best thing about the episode " . Michael Slezak of TVLine expressed the wish that the extras in the scene in the skateboard park " had actually gotten a chance to , um , speak like real humans , not just like props for a kicky musical number " . VanDerWerff 's summation was that the episode " gave Dianna Agron more shades to play than she ’ s usually asked to , and that was a good thing " . 
 While Sue 's pregnancy storyline continued to be unpopular with some reviewers , Bell included , the discovery that her daughter might have Down syndrome and her telling Becky about it led Bell to state that she had " always felt that the relationship between Sue and Becky was one of Glee 's finest accomplishments " . Strecker noted that " their scenes together are always some of my favorites " , and commended the episode 's " poignant heart @-@ to @-@ heart " — which Dodge also praised as " very touching " — where Becky gave Sue the advice to " work on her patience " . VanDerWerff thought that Sue 's storyline was one of several in the episode beyond the two main ones — Blaine and Cooper 's conflict and Quinn 's post @-@ accident return — that the show " kept piling " on , to its detriment . Another , described by MTV 's Kevin Sullivan as " silly " , had Puck trying to recruit Finn to clean pools with him in California . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The musical performances were given a middling to positive response overall , and the final song , " Somebody That I Used to Know " , received the most enthusiastic reception . Bell called it the " highlight of the episode " , and it was Hankinson 's favorite performance : " Bomer and Criss did a fantastic job bringing it to life " . Futterman said that " it was initially disconcerting to envision " two brothers singing about a " former love " , but she noted that it " was less weird in context " . Flandez felt that with the song 's conversion to a " Cain @-@ and @-@ Abel therapy session " , despite being " gorgeously sung " , it was nevertheless " the most disappointing duet ever " , but Slezak gave the performance an " A − " , and wrote , " I bought the sibling angst in the room , and Matt Bomer really is a charismatic fella , no ? " Strecker gave the song an " A " and stated , " Shout @-@ out to the Glee writers this episode for not only picking fun songs , but also tracks that were all really great lyrically in terms of moving the plot forward . " 
 Gotye was initially reported to have been unimpressed with the Glee rendition of his song , but later stated that his words had been taken out of context . On April 22 , 2012 , two Australian newspapers , the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Herald Sun , quoted him as having said , " They did such a faithful arrangement of the instrumentals but the vocals were that pop Glee style " . The Mail 's quote continued after a comma with " ultra @-@ dry , sounded pretty tuned and the rock has no real sense , like it 's playing to you from a cardboard box . " The Herald Sun 's continuation of the quote came after a period : " It made it sound dinky and wrong . " Gotye said in an interview the next day that he had been referring to " this xylophone hook in my song — it 's kind of dinky not just in the cover version but the original song " . He added , " I thought it was really clever to transpose the song to two guys ... It was a great idea . " In an interview published ten days later , Glee 's executive music producer Adam Anders said that although the iTunes version of the song that the show released was " very true " to Gotye 's , that in the episode itself , " the reality is , it was drier " . 
 The two songs performed by Artie and Quinn were not reviewed as enthusiastically . Both Futterman and Slezak approved of the harmonies in " I 'm Still Standing " , though Futterman thought the number felt " more subdued than we 'd expect " , and Slezak wrote that " the song choice was a little bit of a <unk> " before he appended a " B " grade . Chaney gave the song a " C " and said that " something about this segment wasn ’ t as dynamic as it should have been " . Votta and Strecker both described the performance as " pleasant " , the latter also added a " B − " grade . Strecker gave a " B " to the other song , " Up Up Up " , which she said was " mostly background music " and the song itself " not particularly memorable " . Chaney 's " B " was far more complimentary : she characterized the performance as " the most energetic set piece of the night " which " made nice use of the infectious <unk> song " . Futterman thought that " the sugary vocals work well for Artie and Quinn " , but Votta wrote that " the vocal is so indistinct it could be anyone " . 
 The other performance by Criss and Bomer , the Duran Duran mashup of " Hungry Like the Wolf " and " Rio " , was given a modestly positive reception . Strecker gave it an " A − " and called it a " real treat " with " some truly fun choreography " . Slezak , on the other hand , described the choreography as " peculiar " , and graded the song a " B " . Sullivan wrote , " On paper it may not have seemed like the best idea , but honestly , it kind of rocked . " Chaney noted that " they were fun to watch " , but gave the performance a " C " ; she said that " something about this cover sucked all the cherry ice cream smile out of the originals " , though she wondered whether she was biased by her " lifelong appreciation of Duran Duran " . The solo by Criss on " Fighter " received a wider range of opinions . Both Chaney and Slezak gave the song a " B − " : Chaney said he sang the song " with conviction " and complimented the " visually alluring " boxing and shower scenes , as did Slezak . Strecker wrote that " the energy and emotional punch totally resonated " and gave the song an " A − " , though she also stated that " the talk @-@ singing at the beginning was a little weird " . Votta said that " vocally , Darren Criss embodies the song " , but she characterized the staging as " too jagged and haphazard to make an impact " , and the transitions not " as smooth as they could be " . Flandez called the song choice " unsuitable " and " puzzling " , and VanDerWerff said the performance was " completely ridiculous " .

 = Bullet Rogan = 
 Charles Wilber " Bullet " Rogan , also known as " Bullet Joe " ( July 28 , 1893 – March 4 , 1967 ) , was an American pitcher and outfielder for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro baseball leagues from 1920 to 1938 . Renowned as a two @-@ way player who could both hit and pitch successfully , one statistical compilation shows Rogan winning more games than any other pitcher in Negro leagues history and ranking fourth highest in career batting average . He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 . 
 Rogan 's early baseball career took place in the U.S. Army , where he played for a famous team in the all @-@ black 25th Infantry . After joining the Kansas City Monarchs , he was the top pitcher and one of the best hitters on a team that won three pennants from 1923 to 1925 and the Negro League World Series in 1924 . He became a playing manager in 1926 and led his team to another league title in 1929 . 
 " Charleston was everything — but Rogan was more " , said William " Big C " Johnson , one of Rogan 's Army teammates . " Rogan could do everything , everywhere . " " He was the <unk> pitcher I ever saw , I ever heard of in my life , was pitching and hitting in the cleanup place " , said Satchel Paige . According to Rogan 's longtime catcher Frank Duncan , " If you had to choose between Rogan and Paige , you 'd pick Rogan , because he could hit . The pitching , you 'd as soon have Satchel as Rogan , understand ? But Rogan 's hitting was so terrific . Get my point ? " Casey Stengel called Rogan " one of the best — if not the best — pitcher that ever lived . "

 Wilber Rogan was born in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . After the death of his mother and his father 's remarriage , he moved with his family to Kansas City , Kansas . He began his baseball career there in 1911 as a catcher with Fred Palace 's Colts , a semipro team composed mostly of teenagers . Also joining the Colts that season was Dick Whitworth , who would , like Rogan , go on to pitch for many years in the Negro leagues . 
 Friction with his stepmother and unhappiness with the segregated high school he attended led Rogan to drop out of school before graduation and enlist in the Army on October 19 , 1911 . He lied about his age to do so . This would cause later confusion about Rogan 's age , as some records ( along with his Hall of Fame plaque ) give his birth year as 1889 , others as 1893 ; recent histories , such as Phil Dixon 's , conclude that the latter date is correct . 
 = = U.S. Army and the 25th Infantry Wreckers = = 
 Rogan served in the Philippines with the 24th Infantry , an all @-@ black regiment , for three years . He was honorably discharged in 1914 . Before returning to the United States , Rogan reenlisted , this time with the 25th Infantry , another African American unit , at that time stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii . He was specifically recruited to play for the regiment 's famous baseball team , known as the " Wreckers . " He made his debut with the Wreckers on July 4 , 1915 . 
 His Army teammates included a number of later Negro league stars , such as Dobie Moore , Heavy Johnson , Bob Fagan , Lemuel Hawkins , and William " Big C " Johnson . Over the next three seasons , the Wreckers won the Post League championship , the United States Army Series , and the Oahu League . In February 1917 Rogan twice defeated the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League , who were visiting the islands for spring training . On furlough for several months in 1917 , Rogan played professionally for the Los Angeles White Sox , the Kansas City , Kansas , Giants , and J. L. Wilkinson 's All Nations Club , but returned to the army for three more years . 
 In August 1918 Rogan and the rest of the 25th Infantry were moved to Camp Stephen D. Little in Nogales , Arizona . Researchers John Holway and James Riley report that in 1919 , Casey Stengel played against Rogan in Arizona , and subsequently recommended him to Wilkinson for his new Negro National League team , the Kansas City Monarchs . However , Rogan had already played in the California Winter League and for Wilkinson 's All @-@ Nations team in 1917 , and had already been noted by Negro sports reporters as early as 1916 . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 In July 1920 , Rogan and Dobie Moore joined the Monarchs . Rogan quickly became the premier pitcher and biggest box @-@ office draw in the young league . By his third season with the Monarchs , 1922 , he hit .390 , and his 13 home runs were good for second in the league . On August 6 , 1923 , Rogan combined with teammate and manager José Méndez to pitch a no @-@ hitter against the Milwaukee Bears , Méndez pitching the first five innings and Rogan the last four . That season he hit .364 with a league @-@ leading 16 wins and 151 strikeouts to lead the Monarchs to their first pennant . 
 In 1924 Rogan hit .395 while compiling an 18 – 6 record and leading the Monarchs to their second league title . He starred in the first Black World Series , leading the Monarchs with 13 hits and winning two games as Kansas City defeated the Eastern Colored League champion <unk> . That winter he led the 1924 / 25 Cuban League with nine victories for the champion <unk> club . 
 Rogan may have reached his peak in 1925 , leading Kansas City to its third straight league championship with a 17 – 2 record and a .381 batting average . In the playoffs against the St. Louis Stars he hit .450 and won three more games , including one shutout . However , before the World Series rematch with <unk> , Rogan suffered a knee injury while playing with his young son . Forced to undergo surgery , he missed the series . Without their star , the Monarchs went down to defeat in six games . 
 The following season , Rogan took over from José Méndez as manager of the Kansas City Monarchs . In that season 's NNL playoffs against the Chicago American Giants , he pitched and lost both games of a series @-@ deciding doubleheader to the younger Bill Foster . As late as 1928 at the age of 34 , Bullet Rogan was the best hitter ( .358 ) and arguably the best pitcher ( 10 – 2 ) on the Monarchs . That year he slammed three home runs in a game against the Detroit Stars . 
 Rogan continued at the Monarchs ' helm in 1929 when they won their fourth NNL championship and recorded the best record ( 62 – 17 ) in the history of the league . On April 29 , 1930 , in Enid , Oklahoma , Rogan played for the Monarchs in baseball 's first night game . In August he was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness . He remained out of the lineup for more than a year , finally returning on September 28 , 1931 . 
 When Wilkinson did not organize a Kansas City Monarchs team for 1932 , Rogan joined a white independent team in Jamestown , North Dakota , where he played until August . He batted .315 and went 20 – 3 as a pitcher before returning to the reorganized Monarchs in September . In the winter of 1933 and 1934 , Rogan returned to Hawaii and the Philippines as a member of the Philadelphia Royal Giants , a black all @-@ star team . The Royal Giants toured Japan and China as well . In 1936 , at the age of 43 , Rogan appeared in the East @-@ West All @-@ Star Game . 
 = = Rogan as player and manager = = 
 Relatively small ( 5 foot 7 , 180 pounds ( 82 kg ) ) , Rogan was solidly built and strong , with thin legs and a narrow waist but broad shoulders . He threw and batted right @-@ handed , and used an unusually heavy bat . " You saw Ernie Banks hit in his prime , then you saw Rogan " , said Buck O 'Neil . " He could hit that ball ... He was the type of guy that stood a long way from the plate . Not too close , because they 'd jam you . " According to his longtime teammate Frank Duncan , " Rogan was one of the best low @-@ ball hitters I ever saw , and one of the best curve @-@ ball hitters . Rogan taught Bob and Irish Meusel how to hit curve balls . " While not extremely fast , he ran the bases well and stole when necessary . 
 As a pitcher , Rogan used a no @-@ windup delivery and both overhand and sidearm motions , and relied on an array of curveballs , a spitball , a palmball , a forkball , and the fastball that gave him his nickname . According to the sportswriter A.S. " Doc " Young , " Joe Rogan possessed as much natural ability as Smokey Joe or <unk> , but his control was not up to theirs . " Frank Duncan , who caught both Paige and Rogan , said , 
 Satchel was easier to catch . He could throw it in a quart cup . But Rogan was all over the plate — high , low , inside , outside . He 'd walk five @-@ six men , but he didn 't give up many runs . Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige — and he had a better @-@ breaking curve . The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden , it would break sharply for a strike . I would rank him with today 's best . I have never seen a pitcher like him , and I have caught some of the best pitchers in the business . 
 Another Monarchs teammate , George Carr , said , 
 Rogan was the greatest pitcher that ever threw a ball . He had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with . Rogan was a smart pitcher with a wonderful memory . Once Rogan pitched to a batter , he never forgot that batter 's weaknesses and strong points . And don 't think Rogan was nicknamed " Bullet " for nothing . That guy had a ball that was almost too fast to catch . He would really burn ' em in there . 
 As a manager , he was a strict disciplinarian , possibly a result of his military background . Carroll " Dink " <unk> maintained that " Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army . He liked to give orders too much , even before he was managing . He used to bawl players out for different things . I could take it , but we had ball players , when he 'd get on them , they 'd go into a shell , resented it , and didn 't give him their best . " Another Monarchs pitcher , Chet Brewer , said that " Rogan wasn 't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself . He couldn 't teach pitchers much , because he 'd say , ' All you have to do is go out and throw the man what I threw ' . " According to historian Phil Dixon , " In Rogan 's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch @-@ hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends . " He didn 't trust younger players , often inserting himself to pitch or pinch @-@ hit for them . He sometimes treated rookies harshly . Eventually Rogan " discarded his distant approach " and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players .

 On October 22 , 1922 , Wilber Rogan married Kathrine McWilliams , a Colorado farm girl . Their son Wilber Rogan , Jr . , was born right after the 1924 World Series . Between the 1923 and 1924 seasons , it was reported that Rogan spent the winter writing life insurance . After his retirement as a player , Rogan became an umpire in the Negro American League until 1946 , then worked in the post office . He died in Kansas City , Missouri on March 4 , 1967 at age 73 . The Baseball Hall of Fame first admitted Negro league players in the 1970s , but did not honor Bullet Rogan until 1998 , 31 years after his death .

 = Welding = 
 Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials , usually metals or thermoplastics , by causing fusion , which is distinct from lower temperature metal @-@ joining techniques such as brazing and soldering , which do not melt the base metal . In addition to melting the base metal , a filler material is often added to the joint to form a pool of molten material ( the weld pool ) that cools to form a joint that can be as strong , or even stronger , than the base material . Pressure may also be used in conjunction with heat , or by itself , to produce a weld . 
 Although less common , there are also solid state welding processes such as friction welding or shielded active gas welding in which metal does not melt . 
 Some of the best known welding methods include : 
 Shielded metal arc welding ( SMAW ) – also known as " stick welding or electric welding " , uses an electrode that has flux around it to protect the weld puddle . The electrode holder holds the electrode as it slowly melts away . Slag protects the weld puddle from atmospheric contamination . 
 Gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) – also known as TIG ( tungsten , inert gas ) , uses a non @-@ consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld . The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas such as argon or helium . 
 Gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) – commonly termed MIG ( metal , inert gas ) , uses a wire feeding gun that feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon @-@ based shielding gas or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) over the weld puddle to protect it from atmospheric contamination . 
 Flux @-@ cored arc welding ( FCAW ) – almost identical to MIG welding except it uses a special tubular wire filled with flux ; it can be used with or without shielding gas , depending on the filler . 
 Submerged arc welding ( SAW ) – uses an automatically fed consumable electrode and a blanket of granular fusible flux . The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being " submerged " under the flux blanket . 
 <unk> welding ( ESW ) – a highly productive , single pass welding process for thicker materials between 1 inch ( 25 mm ) and 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in a vertical or close to vertical position . 
 Many different energy sources can be used for welding , including a gas flame , an electric arc , a laser , an electron beam , friction , and ultrasound . While often an industrial process , welding may be performed in many different environments , including in open air , under water , and in outer space . Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns , electric shock , vision damage , inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes , and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation . 
 Until the end of the 19th century , the only welding process was forge welding , which blacksmiths had used for centuries to join iron and steel by heating and hammering . Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first processes to develop late in the century , and electric resistance welding followed soon after . Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods . Following the wars , several modern welding techniques were developed , including manual methods like SMAW , now one of the most popular welding methods , as well as semi @-@ automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW , SAW , FCAW and ESW . Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding , electron beam welding , magnetic pulse welding ( MPW ) , and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century . Today , the science continues to advance . Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings , and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of joining metals goes back several millennia . Called forge welding , the earliest examples come from the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe and the Middle East . The ancient Greek historian Herodotus states in The Histories of the 5th century BC that Glaucus of Chios " was the man who single @-@ handedly invented iron welding " . Welding was used in the construction of the Iron pillar of Delhi , erected in Delhi , India about 310 AD and weighing 5 @.@ 4 metric tons . 
 The Middle Ages brought advances in forge welding , in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred . In 1540 , Vannoccio Biringuccio published De la <unk> , which includes descriptions of the forging operation . Renaissance craftsmen were skilled in the process , and the industry continued to grow during the following centuries . 
 In 1800 , Sir Humphry Davy discovered the short @-@ pulse electrical arc and presented his results in 1801 . In 1802 , Russian scientist Vasily Petrov created the continuous electric arc , and subsequently published " News of Galvanic @-@ Voltaic Experiments " in 1803 , in which he described experiments carried out in 1802 . Of great importance in this work was the description of a stable arc discharge and the indication of its possible use for many applications , one being melting metals . In 1808 , Davy , who was unaware of Petrov 's work , rediscovered the continuous electric arc . In 1881 – 82 inventors Nikolai <unk> ( Russian ) and Stanisław Olszewski ( Polish ) created the first electric arc welding method known as carbon arc welding using carbon electrodes . The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 1800s by a Russian , Nikolai Slavyanov ( 1888 ) , and an American , C. L. Coffin ( 1890 ) . Around 1900 , A. P. Strohmenger released a coated metal electrode in Britain , which gave a more stable arc . In 1905 , Russian scientist Vladimir <unk> proposed using a three @-@ phase electric arc for welding . In 1919 , alternating current welding was invented by C. J. <unk> but did not become popular for another decade . 
 Resistance welding was also developed during the final decades of the 19th century , with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885 , who produced further advances over the next 15 years . <unk> welding was invented in 1893 , and around that time another process , oxyfuel welding , became well established . Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy , but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900 , when a suitable torch was developed . At first , oxyfuel welding was one of the more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost . As the 20th century progressed , however , it fell out of favor for industrial applications . It was largely replaced with arc welding , as metal coverings ( known as flux ) for the electrode that stabilize the arc and shield the base material from impurities continued to be developed . 
 World War I caused a major surge in the use of welding processes , with the various military powers attempting to determine which of the several new welding processes would be best . The British primarily used arc welding , even constructing a ship , the " <unk> " with an entirely welded hull . Arc welding was first applied to aircraft during the war as well , as some German airplane fuselages were constructed using the process . Also noteworthy is the first welded road bridge in the world , the <unk> Bridge designed by Stefan <unk> of the Lwów University of Technology in 1927 , and built across the river <unk> near Łowicz , Poland in 1928 . 
 During the 1920s , major advances were made in welding technology , including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920 , in which electrode wire was fed continuously . Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention , as scientists attempted to protect welds from the effects of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere . <unk> and brittleness were the primary problems , and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen , argon , and helium as welding atmospheres . During the following decade , further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium . This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding , alternating current , and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II . In 1930 , the first all @-@ welded merchant vessel , M / S Carolinian , was launched . 
 During the middle of the century , many new welding methods were invented . 1930 saw the release of stud welding , which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction . Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today . In 1932 a Russian , Konstantin <unk> successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding . Gas tungsten arc welding , after decades of development , was finally perfected in 1941 , and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948 , allowing for fast welding of non @-@ ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases . Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s , using a flux @-@ coated consumable electrode , and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process . In 1957 , the flux @-@ cored arc welding process debuted , in which the self @-@ shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment , resulting in greatly increased welding speeds , and that same year , plasma arc welding was invented . <unk> welding was introduced in 1958 , and it was followed by its cousin , <unk> welding , in 1961 . In 1953 the Soviet scientist N. F. <unk> proposed the diffusion bonding method . 
 Other recent developments in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding , making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source . Following the invention of the laser in 1960 , laser beam welding debuted several decades later , and has proved to be especially useful in high @-@ speed , automated welding . Magnetic pulse welding ( MPW ) is industrially used since 1967 . Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute ( <unk> , UK ) and found high @-@ quality applications all over the world . All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment , and this has limited their applications .

 = = = Arc = = = 
 These processes use a welding power supply to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point . They can use either direct ( DC ) or alternating ( AC ) current , and consumable or non @-@ consumable electrodes . The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi @-@ inert gas , known as a shielding gas , and filler material is sometimes used as well . 
 = = = = Power supplies = = = = 
 To supply the electrical power necessary for arc welding processes , a variety of different power supplies can be used . The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies . In arc welding , the length of the arc is directly related to the voltage , and the amount of heat input is related to the current . Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding , because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies . This is important because in manual welding , it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady , and as a result , the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate . Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current , and as a result , are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding , flux cored arc welding , and submerged arc welding . In these processes , arc length is kept constant , since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current . For example , if the wire and the base material get too close , the current will rapidly increase , which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt , returning it to its original separation distance . 
 The type of current used plays an important role in arc welding . <unk> electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current , but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively . In welding , the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration , and as a result , changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties . If the electrode is positively charged , the base metal will be hotter , increasing weld penetration and welding speed . Alternatively , a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds . <unk> electrode processes , such as gas tungsten arc welding , can use either type of direct current , as well as alternating current . However , with direct current , because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material , a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds , while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds . Alternating current rapidly moves between these two , resulting in medium @-@ penetration welds . One disadvantage of AC , the fact that the arc must be re @-@ ignited after every zero crossing , has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave , making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem . 
 = = = = Processes = = = = 
 One of the most common types of arc welding is shielded metal arc welding ( SMAW ) ; it is also known as manual metal arc welding ( MMA ) or stick welding . Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod , which is made of filler material ( typically steel ) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) gas during the welding process . The electrode core itself acts as filler material , making a separate filler unnecessary . 
 The process is versatile and can be performed with relatively inexpensive equipment , making it well suited to shop jobs and field work . An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience . Weld times are rather slow , since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag , the residue from the flux , must be chipped away after welding . Furthermore , the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials , though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron , nickel , aluminum , copper , and other metals . 
 Gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) , also known as metal inert gas or MIG welding , is a semi @-@ automatic or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi @-@ inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination . Since the electrode is continuous , welding speeds are greater for GMAW than for SMAW . 
 A related process , flux @-@ cored arc welding ( FCAW ) , uses similar equipment but uses wire consisting of a steel electrode surrounding a powder fill material . This cored wire is more expensive than the standard solid wire and can generate fumes and / or slag , but it permits even higher welding speed and greater metal penetration . 
 Gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) , or tungsten inert gas ( TIG ) welding , is a manual welding process that uses a <unk> tungsten electrode , an inert or semi @-@ inert gas mixture , and a separate filler material . Especially useful for welding thin materials , this method is characterized by a stable arc and high quality welds , but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds . 
 GTAW can be used on nearly all weldable metals , though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals . It is often used when quality welds are extremely important , such as in bicycle , aircraft and naval applications . A related process , plasma arc welding , also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc . The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc , making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process . Because of its stable current , the method can be used on a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster . It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium , and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process . A variation of the process is plasma cutting , an efficient steel cutting process . 
 Submerged arc welding ( SAW ) is a high @-@ productivity welding method in which the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux . This increases arc quality , since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux . The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself , and combined with the use of a continuous wire feed , the weld deposition rate is high . Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes , since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced . The process is commonly used in industry , especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels . Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding , <unk> welding , <unk> welding , and stud arc welding . 
 = = = Gas welding = = = 
 The most common gas welding process is oxyfuel welding , also known as oxyacetylene welding . It is one of the oldest and most versatile welding processes , but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications . It is still widely used for welding pipes and tubes , as well as repair work . 
 The equipment is relatively inexpensive and simple , generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen to produce a welding flame temperature of about 3100 ° C. The flame , since it is less concentrated than an electric arc , causes slower weld cooling , which can lead to greater residual stresses and weld distortion , though it eases the welding of high alloy steels . A similar process , generally called oxyfuel cutting , is used to cut metals . 
 = = = Resistance = = = 
 Resistance welding involves the generation of heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces . Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current ( 1000 – 100 @,@ 000 A ) is passed through the metal . In general , resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution , but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high . 
 Spot welding is a popular resistance welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3 mm thick . Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets . The advantages of the method include efficient energy use , limited workpiece deformation , high production rates , easy automation , and no required filler materials . Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods , making the process suitable for only certain applications . It is used extensively in the automotive industry — ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots . A specialized process , called shot welding , can be used to spot weld stainless steel . 
 Like spot welding , seam welding relies on two electrodes to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets . However , instead of pointed electrodes , wheel @-@ shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece , making it possible to make long continuous welds . In the past , this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans , but now its uses are more limited . Other resistance welding methods include butt welding , flash welding , projection welding , and upset welding . 
 = = = Energy beam = = = 
 Energy beam welding methods , namely laser beam welding and electron beam welding , are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications . The two processes are quite similar , differing most notably in their source of power . Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam , while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam . Both have a very high energy density , making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area . Both processes are extremely fast , and are easily automated , making them highly productive . The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs ( though these are decreasing ) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking . Developments in this area include laser @-@ hybrid welding , which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties , laser cladding , and x @-@ ray welding . 
 = = = Solid @-@ state = = = 
 Like the first welding process , forge welding , some modern welding methods do not involve the melting of the materials being joined . One of the most popular , ultrasonic welding , is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure . The equipment and methods involved are similar to that of resistance welding , but instead of electric current , vibration provides energy input . Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials ; instead , the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure . When welding plastics , the materials should have similar melting temperatures , and the vibrations are introduced vertically . Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper , and it is also a very common polymer welding process . 
 Another common process , explosion welding , involves the joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure . The energy from the impact <unk> the materials , forming a weld , even though only a limited amount of heat is generated . The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials , such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates . Other solid @-@ state welding processes include friction welding ( including friction stir welding ) , magnetic pulse welding , co @-@ extrusion welding , cold welding , diffusion bonding , exothermic welding , high frequency welding , hot pressure welding , induction welding , and roll welding . 
 = = Geometry = = 
 <unk> can be geometrically prepared in many different ways . The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint , lap joint , corner joint , edge joint , and T @-@ joint ( a variant of this last is the cruciform joint ) . Other variations exist as well — for example , double @-@ V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one @-@ half their height . Single @-@ U and double @-@ U preparation joints are also fairly common — instead of having straight edges like the single @-@ V and double @-@ V preparation joints , they are curved , forming the shape of a U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick — depending on the process used and the thickness of the material , many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry . 
 Many welding processes require the use of a particular joint design ; for example , resistance spot welding , laser beam welding , and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints . Other welding methods , like shielded metal arc welding , are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint . Some processes can also be used to make <unk> welds , in which one weld is allowed to cool , and then another weld is performed on top of it . This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single @-@ V preparation joint , for example . 
 After welding , a number of distinct regions can be identified in the weld area . The weld itself is called the fusion zone — more specifically , it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process . The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used , and its compatibility with the base materials . It is surrounded by the heat @-@ affected zone , the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld . These properties depend on the base material 's behavior when subjected to heat . The metal in this area is often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone , and is also where residual stresses are found . 
 = = Quality = = 
 Many distinct factors influence the strength of welds and the material around them , including the welding method , the amount and concentration of energy input , the weldability of the base material , filler material , and flux material , the design of the joint , and the interactions between all these factors . To test the quality of a weld , either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects , have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion , and have acceptable heat @-@ affected zone ( HAZ ) properties . Types of welding defects include cracks , distortion , gas inclusions ( porosity ) , non @-@ metallic inclusions , lack of fusion , incomplete penetration , lamellar tearing , and undercutting . 
 The metalworking industry has instituted specifications and codes to guide welders , weld inspectors , engineers , managers , and property owners in proper welding technique , design of welds , how to judge the quality of Welding Procedure Specification , how to judge the skill of the person performing the weld , and how to ensure the quality of a welding job . Methods such as visual inspection , radiography , ultrasonic testing , phased @-@ array ultrasonics , dye penetrant inspection , magnetic particle inspection , or industrial computed tomography can help with detection and analysis of certain defects . 
 = = = Heat @-@ affected zone = = = 
 The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental — depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used , the HAZ can be of varying size and strength . The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role — if the diffusivity is high , the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small . Conversely , a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ . The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well , as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an <unk> heat input and increase the size of the HAZ . Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated , limited amount of heat , resulting in a small HAZ . Arc welding falls between these two extremes , with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input . To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures , the following formula can be used : 
 <formula> 
 where Q 
 = heat input ( kJ / mm ) , V = 
 voltage ( V ) , I 
 = current ( A ) , and S = 
 welding speed ( mm / min ) . The efficiency is dependent on the welding process used , with shielded metal arc welding having a value of 0 @.@ 75 , gas metal arc welding and submerged arc welding , 0 @.@ 9 , and gas tungsten arc welding , 0 @.@ 8 . 
 = = = Lifetime extension with <unk> methods = = = 
 The durability and life of dynamically loaded , welded steel structures is determined in many cases by the welds , particular the weld transitions . Through selective treatment of the transitions by grinding ( abrasive cutting ) , shot <unk> , High Frequency Impact Treatment , etc. the durability of many designs increase significantly . 
 = = Metallurgy = = 
 Most solids used are engineering materials consisting of crystalline solids in which the atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive geometric pattern which is known as a lattice structure . The only exception is material that is made from glass which is a combination of a supercooled liquid and polymers which are aggregates of large organic molecules . 
 Crystalline solids cohesion is obtained by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms . Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent . To form an ionic bond , either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions . The bonding in the static position is when the ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero . When the ions are exerted in tension force , the inter @-@ ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force , while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant . 
 Covalent bonding takes place when one of the constituent atoms loses one or more electrons , with the other atom gaining the electrons , resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole . In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other , thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle . 
 Metallic bonding can be classified as a type of covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond . Atoms will lose an electron ( s ) forming an array of positive ions . These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile , as the electrons are free to move as well as the ions . For this , it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile . 
 Three of the most commonly used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body @-@ centred cubic , face @-@ centred cubic and close @-@ packed hexagonal . <unk> steel has a body @-@ centred cubic structure and austenitic steel , non @-@ ferrous metals like aluminum , copper and nickel have the face @-@ centred cubic structure . 
 <unk> is an important factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture . In addition , structures are required to be of an acceptable strength , which is related to a material 's yield strength . In general , as the yield strength of a material increases , there is a corresponding reduction in fracture toughness . 
 A reduction in fracture toughness may also be attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities , or for body @-@ centred cubic metals , from a reduction in temperature . Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch @-@ ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle . Within the range , the materials behavior is unpredictable . The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance . When above the transition , the fracture is primarily due to micro @-@ void coalescence , which results in the fracture appearing fibrous . When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets . These two appearances are visible by the naked eye . Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope . These arrow @-@ like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture . 
 Fracture toughness is measured using a notched and pre @-@ cracked rectangular specimen , of which the dimensions are specified in standards , for example ASTM E23 . There are other means of estimating or measuring fracture toughness by the following : The <unk> impact test per ASTM A370 ; The crack @-@ tip opening displacement ( <unk> ) test per BS 7448 @-@ 1 ; The J integral test per ASTM <unk> ; The <unk> drop @-@ weight test per ASTM <unk> . 
 = = Unusual conditions = = 
 While many welding applications are done in controlled environments such as factories and repair shops , some welding processes are commonly used in a wide variety of conditions , such as open air , underwater , and vacuums ( such as space ) . In open @-@ air applications , such as construction and outdoors repair , shielded metal arc welding is the most common process . Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations , because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld . Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships , offshore platforms , and pipelines , but others , such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding , are also common . Welding in space is also possible — it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts , when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding , plasma arc welding , and electron beam welding in a depressurized environment . Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades , and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space , such as laser beam welding , resistance welding , and friction welding . Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station , which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth . 
 = = Safety issues = = 
 Welding can be dangerous and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken . However , using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding . Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame , the risk of burns and fire is significant ; this is why it is classified as a hot work process . To prevent injury , welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long @-@ sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames . Additionally , the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes . Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV @-@ filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure . Since the 2000s , some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light . To protect bystanders , the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains . These curtains , made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film , shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc , but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets . 
 Welders are often exposed to dangerous gases and particulate matter . Processes like flux @-@ cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides . The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes , with smaller particles presenting a greater danger . This is because smaller particles have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier . Fumes and gases , such as carbon dioxide , ozone , and fumes containing heavy metals , can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training . Exposure to manganese welding fumes , for example , even at low levels ( < 0 @.@ 2 mg / m3 ) , may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs , liver , kidneys , or central nervous system . Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis . The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk . Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air , and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace . 
 = = Costs and trends = = 
 As an industrial process , the cost of welding plays a crucial role in manufacturing decisions . Many different variables affect the total cost , including equipment cost , labor cost , material cost , and energy cost . Depending on the process , equipment cost can vary , from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding , to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding . Because of their high cost , they are only used in high production operations . Similarly , because automation and robots increase equipment costs , they are only implemented when high production is necessary . Labor cost depends on the deposition rate ( the rate of welding ) , the hourly wage , and the total operation time , including time spent fitting , welding , and handling the part . The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material , and the cost of shielding gases . Finally , energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand . 
 For manual welding methods , labor costs generally make up the vast majority of the total cost . As a result , many cost @-@ saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time . To do this , welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected , and weld parameters can be fine @-@ tuned to increase welding speed . Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs , but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time . Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary , and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost . 
 In recent years , in order to minimize labor costs in high production manufacturing , industrial welding has become increasingly more automated , most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding ( especially in the automotive industry ) and in arc welding . In robot welding , mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first , spot welding was its most common application , but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances . Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials ( such as steel and aluminum , for example ) and new welding processes , such as friction stir , magnetic pulse , conductive heat seam , and laser @-@ hybrid welding . Furthermore , progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications , such as in the aerospace and automotive industries . Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds , especially microstructure , residual stresses , and a weld 's tendency to crack or deform . 
 The trend of accelerating the speed at which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection . Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld , a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation . This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members . Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites . Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection , but this is under review by the American Welding Society . 
 = = Glass and plastic welding = = 
 Glasses and certain types of plastics are commonly welded materials . Unlike metals , which have a specific melting point , glasses and plastics have a melting range , called the glass transition . When heating the solid material into this range , it will generally become softer and more pliable . When it crosses through the glass transition , it will become a very thick , sluggish , viscous liquid . Typically , this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension , becoming a sticky , honey @-@ like consistency , so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together . The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact . Upon cooling through the glass transition , the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material . 
 = = = Glass welding = = = 
 Glass welding is a common practice during glassblowing . It is used very often in the construction of lighting , neon signs , <unk> , scientific equipment , and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware . It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds , making items such as bottles and jars . Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition , turning it into a thick , <unk> , liquid mass . Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy @-@ gas torch , or a furnace , because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high . This temperature may vary , depending on the type of glass . For example , lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around 1 @,@ 600 ° F ( 870 ° C ) , and can be welded with a simple propane torch . On the other hand , quartz glass ( fused silica ) must be heated to over 3 @,@ 000 ° F ( 1 @,@ 650 ° C ) , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated , so an <unk> torch must be used . Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass , allowing it to be blown into various shapes , such as bulbs , bottles , or tubes . When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together , they will usually weld very readily . Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease . However , when welding a tube to another tube , a combination of blowing and suction , and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal , to shape the glass , and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself . Sometimes a filler rod may be used , but usually not . 
 Because glass is very brittle in its solid state , it is often prone to cracking upon heating and cooling , especially if the heating and cooling are uneven . This is because the brittleness of glass does not allow for uneven thermal expansion . Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition , in a process called annealing , to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient . 
 There are many types of glass , and it is most common to weld using the same types . Different glasses often have different rates of thermal expansion , which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently . For instance , quartz has very low thermal expansion , while soda @-@ lime glass has very high thermal expansion . When welding different glasses to each other , it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion , to ensure that cracking does not occur . Also , some glasses will simply not mix with others , so welding between certain types may not be possible . 
 Glass can also be welded to metals and ceramics , although with metals the process is usually more adhesion to the surface of the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials . However , certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals . For example , lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum , but not to aluminum . Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass , so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass , which bonds to both tungsten and quartz . However , care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again . Special alloys are often used for this purpose , ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match , and sometimes thin , metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass . 
 = = = Plastic welding = = = 
 Plastics are generally divided into two categories , which are " thermosets " and " thermoplastics . " A thermoset is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic , and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic . <unk> cannot be melted , therefore , once a thermoset has set it is impossible to weld it . Examples of thermosets include epoxies , silicone , vulcanized rubber , polyester , and polyurethane . 
 Thermoplastics , by contrast , form long molecular chains , which are often coiled or intertwined , forming an amorphous structure without any long @-@ range , crystalline order . Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous , while others have a partially crystalline / partially amorphous structure . Both amorphous and <unk> thermoplastics have a glass transition , above which welding can occur , but <unk> also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition . Above this melting point , the viscous liquid will become a free @-@ flowing liquid ( see <unk> weldability for thermoplastics ) . Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene , polypropylene , polystyrene , <unk> ( PVC ) , and <unk> like Teflon and <unk> . 
 Welding thermoplastic is very similar to welding glass . The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition , turning the weld @-@ interface into a thick , viscous liquid . Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together , allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion , joining them as one . Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition , allowing the weld to solidify . A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints . The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods , the much lower melting temperatures , and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated . Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it . Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic . Ultrasonic , laser , or friction heating are other methods . Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic , which respond to induction heating . Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition , so welding can be performed by blowing a heated , inert gas onto the plastic , melting it while , at the same time , shielding it from oxygen . 
 Many thermoplastics can also be welded using chemical solvents . When placed in contact with the plastic , the solvent will begin to soften it , bringing the surface into a thick , liquid solution . When two melted surfaces are pressed together , the molecules in the solution mix , joining them as one . Because the solvent can permeate the plastic , the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic , causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify . A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ) pipes during plumbing , or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models . Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition , but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition .

 For a statistical breakdown by season , see Gillingham F.C. seasons 
 Gillingham F.C. is an English football club based in Gillingham , Kent . The history of Gillingham F.C. covers the years from the club 's formation to the present day . The club was formed in 1893 , and played in the Southern League until 1920 , when that league 's top division was absorbed into the Football League as its new Division Three . The club was voted out of the league in favour of Ipswich Town at the end of the 1937 – 38 season , but returned 12 years later , when that league was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs . 
 Twice in the late 1980s Gillingham came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football , but a decline then set in and in 1993 the club narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference . In 2000 , the " Gills " reached the second tier of the English league for the first time in the club 's history and went on to spend five seasons at this level , achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in 2002 – 03 . The club has twice won the division comprising the fourth level in the football league pyramid : the Football League Fourth Division championship in 1963 – 64 and the Football League Two championship in 2012 @-@ 13 .

 The local success of a junior football side , Chatham Excelsior F.C. , encouraged a group of businessmen to meet at the Napier Arms pub on 18 May 1893 , with a view to creating a football club that could compete in larger competitions . To do this , the club required an enclosed playing area where an admission fee could be charged , which Excelsior lacked . New Brompton F.C. was formed at the meeting , incorporating a number of Excelsior players . The gentlemen also purchased the plot of land which would later become Priestfield Stadium , where a pitch was quickly laid and a pavilion constructed . New Brompton 's first team played their first match on 2 September 1893 , with the new team , sporting Excelsior 's black and white stripes , being defeated 1 – 5 by Woolwich Arsenal 's reserve team in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 . As a " curtain @-@ raiser " immediately prior to this match , New Brompton 's own reserves played a match against Grays , which was therefore technically the first match played by a team representing the club . 
 New Brompton joined the Southern League upon its creation in 1894 , being placed in Division Two because it was one of the last clubs to be invited to join the league . Upon joining the league , New Brompton turned professional , with the players agreeing to be paid 12 shillings per match , and promptly won the Division Two championship in the 1894 – 95 season . With a record of one defeat and eleven victories from twelve matches , the team concluded the season with a " test match " against Swindon Town , who had finished bottom of Division One . As 5 – 1 winners , New Brompton gained promotion to Division One the following season . In 1896 the club appointed its first manager when William Ironside Groombridge , who had previously served as the club 's financial secretary , took charge of team affairs . Groombridge served the club , as secretary and sometimes manager , until well after the First World War . 
 New Brompton struggled in Division One , generally finishing close to the foot of the table , but did reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in 1899 – 1900 , losing 1 – 0 to Southampton . In the same season the club was forced to play a league fixture at the home ground of Woolwich Arsenal when Priestfield was closed due to crowd trouble in a match against Millwall . 
 In the 1907 – 08 season , under the management of the former England international Stephen Smith , New Brompton finished bottom of the table , avoiding relegation only due to the expansion of the league , but did achieve a cup victory over First Division Sunderland , remembered for a hat @-@ trick from Charlie McGibbon . 
 In 1912 the directors passed a resolution to change the club 's name to Gillingham F.C. , and the team played under this name throughout the 1912 – 13 season , although the change was not officially ratified by the shareholders until the following year . To coincide with the change , the team began sporting a new kit of red shirts with blue sleeves . The side again finished bottom of the division in the 1914 – 15 season , but avoided relegation for a second time when the league was suspended due to the escalation of the First World War . 
 Once the competition resumed after the war Gillingham , once again wearing black and white , continued to fare poorly , again finishing bottom of Division One in the 1919 – 20 season . For a third time , however , the club avoided relegation , due to the subsequent elevation of all Southern League Division One clubs to form the new Football League Division Three .

 In the club 's first match in the newly created Football League Division Three , Gillingham held Southampton to a 1 – 1 draw in front of a new record Priestfield crowd of 11 @,@ 500 , with Tom Gilbey scoring the club 's first goal in league competition . Under new manager John McMillan the team struggled and finished the 1920 – 21 season bottom of the table , and in the years to follow there was little improvement , with the club regularly finishing in the lower reaches of the bottom division . Gillingham did not manage to finish in the top half of the table until 1925 – 26 , when the team finished in 10th place , due mainly to the goals of Dick <unk> , who was promptly signed by Liverpool for a fee of £ 1 @,@ 750 , a new Gillingham record . Manager Harry Curtis departed soon afterwards to take over at Brentford , and former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Albert Hoskins stepped down a division to manage the club , but he could do little to change the team 's fortunes and left in 1929 after Gillingham finished bottom of the table once again . 
 Striker Fred <unk> set a new club record in the 1929 – 30 season when he scored six goals in a match against Merthyr Town . This remains the highest number of goals scored by a Gillingham player in a professional match , but was a rare high point in a season which saw Gillingham forced to apply for re @-@ election to the league . The following year the club abandoned its traditional black and white striped shirts in favour of blue shirts and white shorts , colours which have remained associated with Gillingham ever since , although the black and white stripes are still visible in the current version of the club 's badge . In 1932 – 33 former Crystal Palace manager Fred Maven led the club to its highest league finish to date , finishing the season in 7th place , but it was a feat which could not be repeated and the team returned to struggling at the foot of the table the following season . 
 In the 1934 – 35 season centre @-@ forward Sim Raleigh , the club 's top scorer the previous season and a player seen as a future star , suffered a brain haemorrhage following a blow to the head in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 December . Although he played on he collapsed during the second half and died in hospital later the same day . The club launched a fund which raised over £ 250 for his widow and child . 
 In 1938 the Gills finished bottom of the now @-@ regionalised Third Division South once more , and were required to apply for re @-@ election to the Football League for the fifth time since joining it in 1920 . This time the club 's bid for re @-@ election failed , with Ipswich Town registering 36 votes to Gillingham 's 28 and being promoted into the League . At the time it was considered a distinct possibility that Gillingham , saddled with heavy debts incurred during the preceding unsuccessful seasons , might not survive , but the club carried on , and returned to the Southern League the following season , albeit without manager Alan Ure , who was replaced by Bill Harvey . 
 = = The wilderness years : 1938 – 1950 = = 
 The club 's second stint in the Southern League was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , which saw newly appointed manager Archie Clark and most of the players assigned to work at the local dockyards . When competitive football resumed , Gillingham played in the first incarnation of the Kent League , winning the title in both 1944 – 45 and 1945 – 46 . In the second of these seasons the team also won the Kent Senior Cup , Kent County Challenge Cup and Kent League Cup , to complete a clean sweep of every senior trophy in the county . Following their Kent League triumphs , the Gills returned to the Southern League for the 1946 – 47 season , in which the team again won two trophies , claiming both the Southern League Cup and the Southern League title itself , and registered a club record 12 – 1 victory over Gloucester City . Striker Hughie Russell scored nine goals in the match , and missed out on double figures when he hit the bar late in the game . 
 Although Gillingham missed out on the Southern League title the following season , finishing as runners @-@ up , the team again captured the Kent Senior Cup , as well as setting a club record attendance of 23 @,@ 002 for a cup match against Queens Park Rangers . Gillingham applied for re @-@ election to the Football League in the summer of 1948 but , despite producing a glossy brochure detailing the team 's achievements , the club saw its application rejected , with only one vote cast in its favour . Despite this disappointment , the team continued to perform strongly in the Southern League and successfully regained the league title in 1948 – 49 . In 1950 plans were announced to expand the Third Division South from 22 to 24 teams and , based on the team 's local success in the interim , Gillingham gained re @-@ election to the Football League , receiving the highest number of votes amongst the candidate clubs . 
 = = Return to the Football League : 1950 – 1974 = = 
 Gillingham 's first game back in the Football League saw the Kent club hold fellow new entrants Colchester United to a 0 – 0 draw at Priestfield in front of 19 @,@ 542 fans . The 1950 – 51 season saw the Gills both concede and score nine goals in individual matches , and finished with them bottom of the table , a performance which was repeated the following season . In 1952 striker Jimmy Scarth set a Football League record when he scored a hat @-@ trick in approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds against Leyton Orient , which was officially recognised as the fastest hat @-@ trick in the history of the Football League until February 2004 . 
 Gillingham 's fortunes on the field gradually improved and the team finished in the top half of the Third Division South on three occasions , helped by the goals of Ernie Morgan , who in 1954 – 55 set a new club record by scoring 31 league goals . In 1956 – 57 and 1957 – 58 , however , the Gills found themselves once again rooted firmly to the bottom of the table , and this meant that with the restructuring of the league system for the 1958 – 59 season , the team was placed in the newly created Fourth Division – a top @-@ half finish would have led to placement in the new national Third Division . 1958 also saw the departure of long @-@ serving manager Archie Clark , who had held the post since before the Second World War , with Harry Barratt taking over . 
 The Gills were still in the Fourth Division in 1962 when Barratt was replaced as manager by Freddie Cox , who inherited a team which had just finished 20th in the table . Cox set about fashioning a new team noted for its formidable defensive capabilities . After finishing in 5th place in 1962 – 63 Gillingham went on to gain promotion the following year , winning the only championship in the club 's history . With goalkeeper John Simpson setting a new club record by conceding only 30 goals all season , the team finished level on 60 points with Carlisle United , but with a fractionally better goal average , and so claimed the championship in the tightest finish in Football League history . 
 Gillingham initially performed well at the higher level , twice coming close to promotion , but performances then declined and the club was relegated back to the Fourth Division in 1970 – 71 . The Gills quickly bounced back , however , and were promoted back to the Third Division in 1973 – 74 under the management of Andy Nelson . With the help of players such as Brian Yeo , who equalled Ernie Morgan 's record for most league goals in a season with 31 , Gillingham scored a club record total of 90 league goals and finished as runners @-@ up to Peterborough United .

 After guiding the club to promotion Andy Nelson left to take over as manager of Charlton Athletic and was replaced by Len Ashurst , but his managerial reign lasted only 16 months . Gerry Summers took over and was to take the club the closest it had ever come to promotion to Division Two when , in 1978 – 79 , Gillingham finished just one point off a promotion place , but two years later Summers was replaced by Keith Peacock . Peacock put together a team which developed a reputation for exciting , attacking play , and also brought through the ranks a number of young players who went on to achieve success at a higher level , including Micky Adams , Steve Bruce , and Tony Cascarino , who was famously bought from non @-@ league <unk> in exchange for a set of tracksuits . Gillingham came close to promotion several times during Peacock 's reign , with four top @-@ six finishes in six years , and in 1986 – 87 reached the play @-@ offs ( in their first year of existence ) only to lose in the final to Swindon Town . Deadlocked at 2 – 2 after the home and away legs of the final , the two teams had to play a third match at a neutral venue , which Swindon won 2 – 0 . 
 The club 's failure to gain promotion meant that it was unable to hang on to the ambitious Cascarino , who was sold to Millwall for £ 225 @,@ 000 , but despite the loss of the team 's star striker the Gills ' 1987 – 88 season began with a flurry of goals . On consecutive Saturdays Gillingham beat Southend United 8 – 1 and Chesterfield 10 – 0 ( the latter a new club record for a professional match ) , but the early @-@ season promise faded and in December Peacock was controversially sacked after a 6 – 0 defeat to Aldershot . His assistant , Paul Taylor , was promoted to manager , but after an unsuccessful spell in charge Taylor was himself replaced in October 1988 by former Tottenham Hotspur manager Keith Burkinshaw . Burkinshaw was unable to turn the team 's fortunes around , however , and departed shortly before the club 's relegation to Division Four was confirmed at the end of the 1988 – 89 season . 
 Former Gillingham player Damien Richardson became the club 's next manager , with veteran goalkeeper Ron Hillyard as his assistant , but the club 's financial situation was poor and the pair struggled to produce results with a squad composed of ageing journeymen and untried youngsters , and both men were sacked in September 1992 , with Glenn Roeder taking over as manager . Gillingham 's league status was in jeopardy for most of the 1992 – 93 Division Three campaign , with relegation to the Football Conference a distinct possibility until the last home match of the season , when a 2 – 0 win over Halifax Town ensured the club 's survival . Nonetheless , the financial crisis continued at Priestfield , and steadily improving league form over the next two seasons did little to disguise the fact that the club was in real danger of going out of existence . 
 The club eventually went into receivership in January 1995 , and by the end of the 1994 – 95 season , with Gillingham facing the threat of being expelled from the Football League and closed down , fans were wondering whether they had seen the last ever Gills match . However , help was on its way in the form of a last @-@ ditch purchase of the club . 
 = = Revival : 1995 – 2000 = = 
 In June 1995 a London @-@ based former office supplies salesman , Paul Scally , stepped in and bought the club for a nominal fee . Scally brought in new manager Tony Pulis , who signed almost a complete new team and led Gillingham to promotion in his first season , finishing second in Division Three ( now Football League Two ) . This season was also notable for the fact that the team only conceded 20 league goals – a league record for a 46 @-@ game season . In 1999 Gillingham reached the playoffs , but lost in the Second Division play @-@ off final against Manchester City . Following goals by the prolific partnership of Robert Taylor and Carl Asaba , the Gills led 2 – 0 with less than two minutes left , only to see Manchester City score twice , the equaliser in injury time , and then win a penalty shoot @-@ out 3 – 1 . 
 Soon after the play @-@ off loss , Pulis was sacked for gross misconduct , with Peter Taylor replacing him as manager . In the 1999 – 00 season Gillingham went on a club record breaking FA Cup run , beating then @-@ Premiership teams Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday before losing 5 – 0 to Chelsea in the quarter @-@ finals . The team also finished in third place in the league and thus qualified for the play @-@ offs again , facing Wigan Athletic at Wembley Stadium in the final . The game finished 1 – 1 after 90 minutes but thanks to goals in extra time from Gillingham substitutes Steve Butler and Andy Thomson the club was promoted to the second tier of the English league ( Division One ) for the first time . As Taylor had only signed a one @-@ year deal , Leicester City , then in the Premiership , approached him to be their new manager . 
 = = The Division One years : 2000 – 2005 = = 
 Former team captain Andy Hessenthaler was appointed player @-@ manager , having previously served as player @-@ coach , and led the club to league finishes of 13th , 12th and 11th in his first three seasons in charge . In contrast , the 2003 – 04 season saw the club escape relegation by the narrowest of margins , with a last day goalless draw keeping Gillingham above Walsall on goal difference , with just one goal separating the two teams . John Gorman was appointed to help Hessenthaler as the side started the 2004 – 05 season poorly , but as the team continued to struggle at the wrong end of the table Hessenthaler resigned as manager in late November . Somewhat unusually he continued to be employed as a player . Gorman succeeded Hessenthaler in a caretaker capacity but left the club to take the manager 's job at Wycombe Wanderers . Gillingham then appointed former Burnley boss Stan Ternent as manager , but despite a late run of positive results , he couldn 't prevent the Gills ' relegation to League One on the last day of the season . In a reversal of the previous season 's fortunes , Crewe Alexandra , the team immediately above Gillingham in the table , survived by just one goal . 
 = = <unk> : 2005 – present = = 
 The 2005 – 06 season started with Neale Cooper being appointed as the new manager , but despite achieving a 3 – 2 victory over Premiership side Portsmouth in the Football League Cup , the team struggled in the league , and shortly after defeat in the first round of the FA Cup by Northern Premier League side Burscough , Cooper resigned . He was replaced by Ronnie Jepson , who led the team to a mid @-@ table finish , which he repeated in 2006 – 07 . After a poor start to the 2007 – 08 season Jepson resigned , and Mick Docherty and Iffy Onuora were appointed joint caretaker managers . Docherty left the club a month later , but Onuora remained in charge until the appointment of Mark Stimson on 1 November 2007 . At the end of the 2007 – 08 season the club was relegated from League One . The following season the Gills earned promotion through the play @-@ offs after finishing fifth in the league , Simeon Jackson scoring the only goal in the final against Shrewsbury Town at Wembley Stadium . In the 2009 – 10 season , however , the Gills were relegated back to League Two , with Stimson leaving the club by mutual consent two days after the end of the season . Within two weeks , Andy Hessenthaler returned for a second spell as manager . 
 For two consecutive seasons the Gills finished just outside the play @-@ off places in League Two , following which Hessenthaler was moved to the position of Director of Football and Martin Allen appointed as manager . In the 2012 – 13 season , helped by a new club record of eleven away wins in a season , the club once again gained promotion back to League One , winning the League Two championship , only the second title the club had ever won at a professional level . The following October , however , Allen was sacked after a poor start to the season and Peter Taylor was appointed manager for a second time .

 Grabbed by the Ghoulies is an action @-@ adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox . It was first released in North America on 21 October 2003 , in Europe on 21 November 2003 and in Japan on 29 April 2004 . It was re @-@ released worldwide on the Xbox 360 as a downloadable Xbox Live Originals title on 16 February 2009 , before being removed from the store on 16 June 2015 . However , it was later released as part of the compilation Rare Replay for Xbox One . The game follows a young boy , Cooper Chance , who sets out to rescue his girlfriend from a mansion haunted by supernatural creatures . 
 Having originally been in development for the GameCube , Grabbed by the Ghoulies was the first Rare game to be published by Microsoft after Rare was bought out from Nintendo . The game was met with mixed reviews upon release . Criticism was directed at the art style and gameplay , but the game 's graphics were praised . Grabbed by the Ghoulies was nominated for the Cons 
 = = Plot = = 
 A young boy named Cooper and his girlfriend , Amber , are seen searching frantically for civilisation after they take a wrong turn . They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter . Once outside , Cooper checks his map , but is unaware that someone is watching . Baron von Ghoul , the game 's main antagonist , looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber . Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the <unk> Mansion , with Cooper in pursuit . Once inside the mansion , Cooper realises that Amber is nowhere to be seen in the Grand <unk> . <unk> , the mansion 's butler , tells him to go to the archives where Amber is held . On the way , a huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match , with Cooper emerging victorious . Upon reaching the archives , Cooper finds Amber being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. <unk> . <unk> then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature . 
 Cooper runs for help and goes into the kitchen . Ma Soupswill , the cook , is delighted to help , but Cooper must retrieve three ingredients : <unk> , a giant egg , and a sprig of <unk> . After retrieving the ingredients , Ma Soupswill creates a potion to reverse the effects on Amber . However , she unwittingly transforms Amber into an even more hideous monster , having added the wrong spice , and Amber attacks Cooper in anger . Cooper defeats the mutated Amber and Ma Soupswill arrives with the correct spice , finally transforming Amber back to herself . Afterward , Cooper and Amber attempt to escape the mansion but are stopped by Mr. Ribs ( Ma Soupswill 's assistant ) .

To get to his room , Cooper must collect three pieces of a rhyme which opens the door to the Baron 's room . Once there , a battle ensues , and Cooper emerges victorious . 
 Cooper allies with Mr. Ribs to free the imprisoned children before finally reaching the exit of the mansion . Once outside , imps knock Cooper and Mr. Ribs out , but Ma Soupswill arrives and defeats them . Cooper regains consciousness and he and Amber leave the mansion , but the household staff prefer to stay . As Cooper and Amber walk towards a small town , the Baron can be seen flying his plane towards it . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action @-@ adventure game with platforming elements . Breaking with the style of previous Rare platformers , the gameplay is simple in design , utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game 's mansion and completing the required beat ' em up challenges in each room . Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room , beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player @-@ character , Cooper , can continue . All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks , whereas the game 's camera can be rotated by both triggers . When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one , the Grim Reaper chases after the player @-@ character ; the Reaper will rip out Cooper 's soul if the character does not leave the room in time . Standard enemies in the game include zombies , mummies , imps , skeletons and zombie pirates . There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance . Many objects in the game with which the character can interact — including chairs , knives , and axes — can be used as weapons . 
 The game also features various Bonus Challenges . When Cooper collects five Rare books ( there are 100 Rare books in total ) during his adventure in <unk> Hall , a Bonus Challenge is unlocked . The main objective of the Bonus challenges is to revisit one of the rooms and perform a different task within it , such as defeating a number of enemies in a certain amount or time or surviving a duel with the Grim Reaper . Upon completing a Bonus Challenge , the player is awarded with a bronze , silver , gold or platinum medal based on their performance . For every platinum medal earned , a piece of the game 's concept art is unlocked . If the player collects all 100 Rare books and earns all 20 platinum medals , the player is given the option to reset the game with Amber unlocked as the new playable character . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 The development of Grabbed by the Ghoulies began after the release of Conker 's Bad Fur Day . The idea for the game began with the name which comes from the slang term for being " grabbed by the testicles " . According to designer Gregg Mayles , the name of the game materialised after he overheard someone mention " being grabbed by the <unk> " , and thought that it would make a suitable name for an upcoming Rare game . Before any details of the game were publicised , it was rumoured that Grabbed by the Ghoulies would be the subtitle to the next Conker the Squirrel game . After Microsoft purchased Rare for £ 375 million in 2002 , development of the game for the GameCube was delayed until Rare converted it to the Xbox console . 
 Development of the game took under three years . It was originally conceived as a larger , non @-@ linear open platform game for the GameCube . However , a simpler design and simpler concept were adopted due to the Microsoft buyout and increasing time constraints . After Microsoft 's purchase of Rare , the studio re @-@ affirmed their " simple design " of the game so that players would be able to easily adapt and devote less commitment to it . In a retrospective interview , Mayles stated that the change from GameCube to Xbox was difficult and required a lot of changes as Grabbed by the Ghoulies was " an original game that started life as a Nintendo product " . 
 According to Mayles , Grabbed by the Ghoulies was not inspired by Rare 's similar @-@ themed Atic Atac . The cel @-@ shaded art style and design of the characters in Grabbed by the Ghoulies were inspired by Hanna @-@ Barbera cartoons , and the various character personalities were based both on historical figures and people from Mayles ' childhood . Antagonist Baron von Ghoul was " a mix " of the Red Baron and British aristocracy , whereas supportive characters , such as Ma Soupswill , were loosely based on staff from a school . Mayles considered the conversion of the game to the Xbox to be one of the hardest challenges during development , as Rare had less than a year to finish the game once it was converted . 
 The game was revealed at E3 2003 , with a playable demo being a mostly complete version of the game , albeit with a few levels missing . Grabbed by the Ghoulies was released in North America on 21 October 2003 , in Europe on 21 November 2003 and in Japan on 29 April 2004 , becoming Rare 's first game to be released under Microsoft . It was later re @-@ released as an Xbox Originals game for the Xbox 360 on 16 February 2009 , later being removed from the store on 16 June 2015 . At Microsoft 's E3 2015 press conference , the compilation title Rare Replay was unveiled . Rare Replay has a selection of thirty games from Rare 's lifetime game library , including Grabbed by the Ghoulies . The game was remastered to run natively on the Xbox One , increasing its resolution and framerate relative to the original Xbox release . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game was met with mixed reviews from critics upon release . It holds average score of 70 % at GameRankings , based on an aggregate of 71 reviews and an average score of 66 / 100 at Metacritic , based on an aggregate of 42 reviews . 
 The graphics and animation were praised by critics . Kevin Gifford of 1UP stated that the cel @-@ shaded graphics were " perfect " for the " spooky " theme of the game , and that the smooth animation resulted in the enemies appearing " endearing " . Ronan Jennings of Eurogamer was less impressed by the graphics , stating that the game " never blew him away " but always kept a high standard of creativity . However , Jennings did praise the animation and character designs . Reviewers of Game Revolution gave praise to the game 's visuals , comparing them to be sharper and clearer to the visuals of Banjo @-@ Kazooie . However , they noted that the character designs still seemed " tied down to the past " , being more suited to the Nintendo 64 than to the Xbox . 
 The game was criticised for its simplistic gameplay and lack of innovation . Gifford noted that the game 's " biggest problem " was its unchallenging gameplay , stating that it was " repetitive " ; he compared it to gameplay of the 16 @-@ bit era . Game Revolution stated that the gameplay appeared " interesting " at first , but grew tiresome the longer the game is played , despite its short length . Jennings noted that the gameplay was not " groundbreaking " and similarly stated that the game relied heavily on " what is practically 16 @-@ bit gameplay " . The camera controls were another criticised aspect of the game , due to the control sticks being allocated for attack functions . Gifford labelled the " forced shunt " idea as a " terrible drag " which became troublesome during the latter half of the game . Game Revolution 's review also criticised the camera controls , stating that the use of triggers to rotate the camera was " on the clunky side " . Jennings , however , felt that the camera was " fine " and did not provide any obstruction . 
 Grabbed by the Ghoulies was nominated for the Console Family Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition at the 2004 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Annual Interactive Achievement Awards . The awards were given to SCE London Studio 's EyeToy : Play and Electronic Arts ' The Sims : Bustin ' Out , respectively .

 = George Mackinolty = 
 Air Vice Marshal George John William Mackinolty , OBE ( 24 March 1895 – 24 February 1951 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Commencing his service in the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) as a mechanic during World War I , he rose to become the RAAF 's chief logistics officer for more than twenty years . Mackinolty was born in Victoria and joined the AFC in 1914 . He first saw active duty the following year in the Middle East with No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps ( formerly the Mesopotamian Half Flight ) . In 1916 he was mentioned in despatches and posted to No. 2 Squadron AFC . By the end of the war he had been commissioned a second lieutenant . 
 Joining the newly formed RAAF in August 1921 , Mackinolty established himself as the service 's senior logistician between the wars , first as Director of Transport and Equipment from 1929 to 1935 , and thereafter as Director of Equipment . He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1937 . Soon after the outbreak of World War II , he became Director of Supply and was promoted to group captain . In June 1942 he was raised to acting air commodore and appointed the Air Member for Supply and Equipment ( AMSE ) . Promoted to air vice marshal in 1948 , Mackinolty continued to serve as AMSE until his sudden death from cancer in February 1951 , aged fifty @-@ five . 
 = = Early life and World War I = = 
 Born on 24 March 1895 at Leongatha , Victoria , Mackinolty was the son of labourer James <unk> Mackinolty and his wife Mary . He went to public schools , obtaining his merit certificate before undertaking formal engineering and business courses in Melbourne . Commencing his working life as a coach and motor @-@ body builder , he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces on 17 August 1914 , soon after the outbreak of World War I. His experience in the motor industry led to assignment as an air mechanic with the Aviation Instructional Staff at Central Flying School ( CFS ) , Point Cook . He was soon promoted from private to corporal and later , having gained a reputation for his skill with timber , raised to sergeant and given command of the school 's woodworking team . 
 On 1 August 1915 , Mackinolty transferred to the Australian Imperial Force , to lead a team of thirteen other mechanics as reinforcements for an Australian Flying Corps contingent serving in the Mesopotamian campaign . He departed Melbourne nine days later aboard RMS Persia , and arrived at Basra on 1 September . Mackinolty 's team immediately joined No. 30 Squadron Royal Flying Corps ( originally the Mesopotamian Half Flight AFC ) , which moved into the city of Kut after its capture by British Empire troops in the Battle of Es Sinn . The unit took part in the Battle of Ctesiphon in November , and organised supply drops to the British and Indian garrison in Kut during the siege that lasted from December 1915 until the following April . 
 Mackinolty was promoted in the field to flight sergeant in June 1916 , and mentioned in despatches on 19 October . When the Australian members of No. 30 Squadron were dispersed , he was posted to Kantara , Egypt , where he joined the newly established No. 2 Squadron AFC ( also numbered No. 68 Squadron RFC by the British ) . Commanded by Major Oswald Watt , the unit relocated to England in January 1917 . Following his service with No. 2 Squadron , Mackinolty was assigned to No. 5 ( Training ) Squadron AFC , which formed at Shawbury , Shropshire , in June 1917 . Praised for his organisational and leadership abilities , he was commissioned as an equipment officer in March 1918 , with the rank of second lieutenant . The following month he was given command of an aircraft repair unit in Minchinhampton , Gloucestershire , home of two squadrons of the AFC 's 1st Training Wing . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 Mackinolty remained in England following the end of hostilities , serving as " officer in charge of Australian packing " at RAF Hendon , near London , from December 1919 to September 1920 . In this role he was responsible for <unk> and shipping to Point Cook the 128 aircraft and associated spares , weaponry , vehicles , hangars and other equipment that made up Britain 's post @-@ war Imperial Gift of Royal Air Force surplus to Australia , which eventually filled 19 @,@ 000 cases . Mackinolty also completed formal training in aeronautical engineering before returning to Melbourne in October 1920 . Discharged from the AIF in January 1921 , he worked in the automotive industry and took a correspondence course on internal combustion engines . 
 On 8 August 1921 , Mackinolty was commissioned as a flying officer in the newly formed Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . A member of the Stores and Accounting Branch , he commenced service with No. 1 Aircraft Depot at Point Cook in December . He was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne , in 1924 . On 20 November that year , he married Eileen Moore at Christ Church , South Yarra ; the couple had a son and a daughter . In 1925 , Mackinolty was posted as Equipment Officer to No. 3 Squadron at the recently established RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales . Promoted flight lieutenant , he was appointed Director of Transport and Equipment at RAAF Headquarters in 1929 , effectively making him the Air Force 's senior supply officer , a role he would occupy for the next twenty @-@ two years . His continuous tenure in essentially the one post was comparable to the RAAF 's other chief logistician , Squadron Leader ( later Air Vice Marshal ) Ellis Wackett , who served as its senior engineer for twenty @-@ four years , from 1935 to 1959 . 
 Mackinolty 's position was redesignated Director of Equipment in April 1935 . At around this time , he collaborated with Squadron Leader George Jones , then Director of Training , on an investigation into the state of aircraft production in Australia to highlight shortfalls in local defence in the face of possible future conflict with Japan . Though the report was reviewed enthusiastically by the Air Member for Personnel , Wing Commander Bill Anderson , it apparently went no further in the chain of command and thus was effectively ignored . Raised to squadron leader , Mackinolty was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Coronation Honours on 11 May 1937 , in recognition of his achievements in stores and accounting . In February the following year he was promoted to wing commander . The punctilious Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal Richard Williams , sometimes complained that Mackinolty did not pay enough attention to his personal appearance , but never failed to acknowledge his " professional excellence " . 
 = = World War II and after = = 
 In April 1940 Mackinolty became Director of Supply , reporting to the Director @-@ General of Supply and Production on the Air Board , the RAAF 's controlling body . Responsible for all stores and equipment , Mackinolty also represented his service at the Federal Contract Board , Department of Supply , and Oil Board . He was promoted to temporary group captain in June that year . With the formation in 1942 of Allied Air Forces Headquarters , which assumed the operational functions of the Chief of the Air Staff , the Air Board was reorganised . The offices of Air Member for Organisation and Equipment , once held by Air Marshal Richard Williams , and Director @-@ General of Supply and Production , a civilian position , were dissolved and replaced by those of the Air Member for Supply and Equipment ( AMSE ) and Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance ( <unk> ) to focus on the two key logistical functions of supply and engineering , respectively . Promoted to acting air commodore , Mackinolty became the inaugural AMSE in June . Air Commodore Ellis Wackett became <unk> at the same time . Norman Ashworth , in How Not to Run an Air Force ! , observed that splitting the logistical functions of the Air Board in this manner appeared to be a " uniquely Australian " experiment , and it was not inconceivable that the organisation had been " tailored " to suit these " two very capable officers " . Serving as AMSE for the remainder of the war , Mackinolty was credited with successfully managing the supply requirements of personnel and aircraft for an organisation that by 1945 had grown by a factor of fifty from its pre @-@ war size , to become the world 's fourth largest air force . 
 Following the end of hostilities , Mackinolty was personally responsible for disposing of surplus equipment up to an original value of £ 500 , and jointly responsible ( with the Business and Finance Members of the Air Board ) for disposing of equipment valued between £ 500 and £ 10 @,@ 000 . His duties as AMSE extended to setting the peacetime meal rations for RAAF personnel . In May 1946 , he joined the Australian Battlefields Memorial Committee , convened to advise the Federal government regarding commemoration of the armed forces for their wartime achievements . Later that year , Mackinolty visited British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) headquarters in Japan , and subsequently arranged for the RAAF to assume responsibility for the supply of spare parts to its air component , British Commonwealth Air Group ( <unk> ) . He was raised to acting air vice @-@ marshal in January 1947 ( substantive in October 1948 ) . By this time , Mackinolty and the Chief of the Air Staff , No. 4 Squadron AFC veteran Air Vice @-@ Marshal George Jones , were the only remaining RAAF officers who had served in both world wars . Other senior commanders and veterans of the Australian Flying Corps had been summarily retired in 1946 , a " purge " that was ostensibly designed to make way for the advancement of younger and equally proficient officers . 
 During 1947 , the RAAF prepared for the introduction of an apprentice engineering scheme . Against a harsh post @-@ war economic climate , Mackinolty personally intervened to improve the planned accommodation for trainees , arguing that the youths could not be expected to live in the austere conditions to which other members of the Air Force were used . He further noted in his submission to the Minister for Air , Arthur Drakeford , that " the parents of apprentices will , from time to time , be permitted to visit their sons and it would be in the interest of both the Apprentice Scheme and the Service generally if all reasonable efforts were made to create a favourable impression in the minds of the parents " . Shortly after the first intake of engineer apprentices in January 1948 , Mackinolty formally proposed that a similar scheme be set up for apprenticeships in the supply and clerical trades . Although initially rejected by the Minister , after some refinements the plan came to fruition three years later as the Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme . 
 In January 1951 , Mackinolty was struck down suddenly with cancer and admitted to hospital at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria . He died there on 24 February , survived by his wife and children . At the time of his death , he had served for a decade as honorary treasurer of the Returned Sailors ' , Soldiers ' and <unk> ' Imperial League of Australia , and was the last member of the original staff of the AFC in 1914 still serving . He was succeeded as AMSE by Air Vice @-@ Marshal Joe Hewitt . Described by Air Force historian Alan Stephens as " the most significant logistics officer in the history of the RAAF " , Mackinolty was accorded an Air Force funeral with full honours at Bathurst Memorial Chapel , Elsternwick , and cremated at Springvale Crematorium . 
 = HMS Prince of Wales ( 53 ) = 
 HMS Prince of Wales was a King George V @-@ class battleship of the Royal Navy , built at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead , England . She was involved in several key actions of the Second World War , including the battle of Denmark Strait against the German battleship Bismarck , operations escorting convoys in the Mediterranean , and her final action and sinking in the Pacific in 1941 . 
 Prince of Wales had an extensive battle history , first seeing action in August 1940 while still being outfitted in her drydock , being attacked and damaged by German aircraft . Her brief but storied career ended 10 December 1941 , when Prince of Wales and battlecruiser HMS Repulse became the first capital ships to be sunk solely by air power on the open sea , a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was subsequently to play in naval warfare . The wreck lies upside down in 223 feet ( 68 m ) of water , near Kuantan , in the South China Sea . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In the aftermath of the First World War , the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain , Japan , France , Italy and the United States . This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the tonnage of all capital ships at 35 @,@ 000 tons . These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the Treaty of London , however , by the mid @-@ 1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties , and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy . As a result , the Admiralty ordered the construction of a new battleship class : the King George V class . Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the Treaty of London , both of which were still in effect when the King George Vs were being designed , the main armament of the class was limited to the 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) guns prescribed under these instruments . They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty , and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements , it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937 . 
 Prince of Wales was originally named King Edward VIII but upon the abdication of Edward VIII the ship was renamed even before she had been laid down . This occurred at Cammell Laird 's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937 , although it was not until 3 May 1939 that she was launched . She was still fitting out when war was declared in September , causing her construction schedule , and that of her sister , King George V , to be accelerated . Nevertheless , the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting . 
 During early August 1940 , while she was still being outfitted and was in a semi @-@ complete state , Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft . One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall , narrowly missing a 100 @-@ ton dockside crane , and exploded underwater below the bilge keel . The explosion took place about six feet from the ship 's port side in the vicinity of the after group of 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch guns . Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage , causing a ten @-@ degree port list . The flooding was severe , due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation . 
 The water was pumped out through the joint efforts of a local fire company and the shipyard , and Prince of Wales was later dry docked for permanent repairs . This damage and the problem with the delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion . As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships , and so her completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests , ventilation tests and a thorough testing of her bilge , ballast and fuel @-@ oil systems . 
 = = Description = = 
 Prince of Wales displaced 36 @,@ 727 long tons ( 37 @,@ 300 t ) as built and 43 @,@ 786 long tons ( 44 @,@ 500 t ) fully loaded . The ship had an overall length of 745 feet ( 227 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 103 feet ( 31 @.@ 4 m ) and a draught of 29 feet ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) . Her designed metacentric height was 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) at normal load and 8 feet 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 46 m ) at deep load . 
 She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving four propeller shafts . Steam was provided by eight Admiralty boilers which normally delivered 100 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 75 @,@ 000 kW ) , but could deliver 110 @,@ 000 shp ( 82 @,@ 000 kW ) at emergency overload . This gave Prince of Wales a top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . The ship carried 3 @,@ 542 long tons ( 3 @,@ 600 t ) of fuel oil . She also carried 180 long tons ( 200 t ) of diesel oil , 256 long tons ( 300 t ) of reserve feed water and 444 long tons ( 500 t ) of freshwater . During full power trials on 31 March 1941 , Prince of Wales at 42 @,@ 100 tons displacement achieved 28 knots with 111 @,@ 600 shp at 228 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0 @.@ 73 lb per <unk> of Wales had a range of 3 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 700 km ; 3 @,@ 600 mi ) at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Prince of Wales mounted 10 BL 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) Mk VII guns . The 14 @-@ inch guns were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets , one forward and one aft . The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees . Training arcs were : turret " A " , 286 degrees ; turret " B " , 270 degrees ; turret " X " , 270 degrees . Training and elevating was done by hydraulic drives , with rates of two and eight degrees per second , respectively . A full gun broadside weighed 15 @,@ 950 pounds ( 7 @,@ 230 kg ) , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds . The secondary armament consisted of 16 QF 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 133 mm ) Mk I guns which were mounted in eight twin mounts , weighing 81 tons each . The maximum range of the Mk I guns was 24 @,@ 070 yards ( 22 @,@ 009 @.@ 6 m ) at a 45 @-@ degree elevation , the anti @-@ aircraft ceiling was 49 @,@ 000 feet ( 14 @,@ 935 @.@ 2 m ) . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees . The normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute , but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute . Along with her main and secondary batteries , Prince of Wales carried 32 QF 2 pdr ( 1 @.@ 575 @-@ inch , 40 @.@ 0 mm ) Mk.VIII " pom @-@ pom " anti @-@ aircraft guns . She also carried 80 UP projectors , which were short range rocket firing anti @-@ aircraft weapons used extensively in the early days of the Second World War by the Royal Navy .

 = = = Action with Bismarck = = = 
 On 22 May 1941 , Prince of Wales , the battlecruiser Hood and six destroyers were ordered to take station south of Iceland and intercept the German battleship Bismarck if she attempted to break out into the Atlantic . Captain John Leach knew that main @-@ battery breakdowns were likely to occur , since Vickers Armstrongs technicians had already corrected some that took place during training exercises in Scapa Flow . These technicians were personally requested by the captain to remain aboard . They did so and played an important role in the resulting action . 
 The next day Bismarck , in company with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen , was reported heading south @-@ westward in the Denmark Strait . At 20 : 00 Vice @-@ Admiral Lancelot Holland , in his flagship Hood , ordered the force to steam at 27 knots , which it did most of the night . His battle plan called for Prince of Wales and Hood to concentrate on Bismarck , while the cruisers Norfolk and Suffolk would handle Prinz Eugen . However the two cruisers were not informed of this plan because of strict radio silence . At 02 : 00 , on 24 May , the destroyers were sent as a screen to search for the German ships to the north , and at 02 : 47 Hood and Prince of Wales increased speed to 28 knots and changed course slightly to obtain a better target angle on the German ships . The weather improved , with ten @-@ mile ( 16 km ) visibility , and crews were at action stations by 05 : 10 . 
 At 05 : 37 an enemy contact report was made , and course was changed to starboard to close range . Neither ship was in good fighting trim . Hood , designed twenty @-@ five years earlier , lacked adequate horizontal protection and would have to close the range quickly , as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges . She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained . Prince of Wales , with thicker armour , was less vulnerable to 15 @-@ inch shells at ranges greater than 17 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 200 m ) , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency . The British ships made their last course change at 05 : 49 , but they had made their approach too fine ( the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow ) and their aft turrets could not fire . Prinz Eugen , with Bismarck astern , had the Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam , and both ships could deliver full broadsides . 
 At 05 : 53 , despite seas breaking over the bows , Prince of Wales opened fire on Bismarck at 26 @,@ 500 yards . There was some confusion among the British as to which ship was Bismarck and thirty seconds earlier Hood had mistakenly opened fire on Prinz Eugen as the German ships had similar profiles . Hood 's first salvo straddled the enemy ship , but Prinz Eugen , in less than three minutes , scored 8 @-@ inch @-@ shell hits on Hood . The first shots by Prince of Wales – two three @-@ gun salvoes at ten second intervals – were 1 @,@ 000 yards over . The turret rangefinders on Prince of Wales could not be used because of spray over the bow and fire was instead directed from the 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) rangefinders in the control tower . 
 The sixth , ninth and thirteenth salvos were straddles and two decisive hits were made on Bismarck . One shell holed her bow and caused Bismarck to lose 1 @,@ 000 tons of fuel oil , mostly to salt @-@ water contamination . The other fell short , and entered Bismarck below her side armour belt , the shell exploded and flooded the auxiliary boiler machinery room and forced the shutdown of two boilers due to a slow leak in the boiler room immediately aft . The loss of fuel and boiler power were decisive factors in the Bismarck 's decision to return to port . In Prince of Wales , " A1 " gun ceased fire after the first salvo due to a defect . Sporadic breakdowns occurred until the decision to turn away was made , and during the turn " Y " turret jammed . 
 Both German ships initially concentrated their fire on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15 @-@ inch shells . An 8 @-@ inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors , and a fire blazed high above the first superstructure deck . At 05 : 58 at a range of 16 @,@ 500 yards , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck . As the turn began , Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four @-@ gun salvoes and at 06 : 01 the fifth salvo hit her , causing a large explosion . Flames shot up near Hood 's masts , then an orange @-@ coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship . On Prince of Wales , it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships , and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled . Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris and in doing so further closed the range between her and the German ships . In the four @-@ minute action , Hood , the largest battlecruiser in the world , had been sunk . 1 @,@ 419 officers and men were killed . Only three men survived . 
 Prince of Wales fired unopposed until she began a port turn at 05 : 57 , when Prinz Eugen took her under fire . After Hood exploded at 06 : 01 , the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales , with 15 @-@ inch , 8 @-@ inch and 5 @.@ 9 @-@ inch guns . A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through the wreckage of Hood . At 06 : 02 , a 15 @-@ inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed the majority of the personnel there . The navigating officer was wounded , but Captain Leach was unhurt . Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell 's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform . A 15 @-@ inch diving shell penetrated the ship 's side below the armour belt amidships , failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms . The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth . 
 At 06 : 05 Captain Leach decided to disengage and laid down a heavy smokescreen to cover Prince of Wales 's escape . Following this , Leach radioed the Norfolk that the Hood had been sunk and then proceeded to join the Norfolk roughly 15 to 17 miles astern of the Bismarck . Throughout the day the British ships continued to chase the Bismarck until at 18 : 16 when Suffolk sighted the Bismarck at 22 @,@ 000 yards . Prince of Wales then proceeded to open fire on Bismarck at an extreme range of 30 @,@ 300 yards , she fired twelve salvos but owing to the range all of them missed . At 01 : 00 on 25 May Prince of Wales once again regained contact and proceeded to open fire at a radar range of 20 @,@ 000 yards , after observers believed that she had scored a hit on Bismarck , Prince of Wales 's " A " turret temporarily jammed , leaving her with only six operational guns . After losing the Bismarck owing to poor visibility and after searching for twelve hours , Prince of Wales headed for Iceland and would take no further part in actions against the Bismarck . 
 = = = Atlantic Charter meeting = = = 
 Following repairs at Rosyth , Prince of Wales transported Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic for a secret conference with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt . On 5 August Roosevelt boarded the cruiser USS Augusta from the presidential yacht Potomac . Augusta proceeded from Massachusetts to Placentia Bay and Argentia in Newfoundland in company with the cruiser USS Tuscaloosa and five destroyers , arriving on 7 August while the presidential yacht played a decoy role by continuing to cruise New England waters as if the President were still on board . On 9 August Winston Churchill arrived in the bay aboard Prince of Wales , escorted by the destroyers HMS Ripley , HMCS Assiniboine and HMCS Restigouche . At Placentia Bay , Newfoundland , Roosevelt transferred to the destroyer USS McDougal to meet Winston Churchill on board Prince of Wales . The conference continued from 10 to 12 August aboard the heavy cruiser USS Augusta , and at the end of the conference , the Atlantic Charter was proclaimed . Following the declaration of the charter , Prince of Wales arrived back at Scapa Flow on 18 August . 
 = = = Mediterranean duty = = = 
 In September following the meeting with President Roosevelt Prince of Wales was assigned to Force H , in the Mediterranean . On 24 September Prince of Wales formed part of Group II , led by Vice @-@ Admiral Alban Curteis and consisting of the battleships Prince of Wales and Rodney , the cruisers Kenya , Edinburgh , Sheffield and Euryalus , and twelve destroyers . The force provided an escort for Operation Halberd , a supply convoy from Gibraltar to Malta . On 27 September the convoy was attacked by Italian aircraft , with Prince of Wales shooting down several with her 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 133 mm ) guns . Later that day there were reports that units of the Italian Fleet were approaching . Prince of Wales , the battleship Rodney and the aircraft carrier Ark Royal were despatched to intercept , but the search proved fruitless . The convoy arrived in Malta without further incident , and Prince of Wales returned to Gibraltar , before sailing on to Scapa Flow , arriving there on 6 October . 
 = = = Far East = = = 
 On 25 October Prince of Wales and a destroyer escort left home waters bound for Singapore , there to rendezvous with the battlecruiser Repulse and the aircraft carrier Indomitable . Indomitable however ran aground off Jamaica a few days later and was unable to proceed . Calling at Freetown and Cape Town South Africa to refuel and generate publicity , Prince of Wales also stopped in Mauritius and the Maldive Islands . Prince of Wales reached Colombo , Ceylon , on 28 November , joining Repulse the next day . On 2 December the fleet docked in Singapore . Prince of Wales then became the flagship of Force Z , under the command of Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Tom Phillips . 
 Japanese troop convoys were first sighted on 6 December . Two days later , Japanese aircraft raided Singapore ; although the Prince of Wales 's anti @-@ aircraft batteries opened fire , they scored no hits and had no effect on the Japanese aircraft . A signal was received from the Admiralty in London ordering the British squadron to commence hostilities , and that evening , confident that a protective air umbrella would be provided by the RAF presence in the region , Admiral Phillips set sail . Force Z at this time comprised the battleship Prince of Wales , the battlecruiser Repulse , and the destroyers Electra , Express , Tenedos and HMAS Vampire . 
 The object of the sortie was to attack Japanese transports at Kota Bharu , but in the afternoon of 9 December the Japanese submarine I @-@ 56 spotted the British ships , and in the evening they were detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance . By this time it had been made clear that no RAF fighter support would be forthcoming . At midnight a signal was received that Japanese forces were landing at Kuantan in Malaya . Force Z was diverted to investigate . At 02 : 11 on 10 December the force was again sighted by a Japanese submarine and at 08 : 00 arrived off Kuantan , only to discover that the reported landings were a diversion . 
 At 11 : 00 that morning the first Japanese air attack began . Eight Type 96 " Nell " bombers dropped their bombs close to Repulse , one passing through the hangar roof and exploding on the 1 @-@ inch plating of the main deck below . The second attack force , comprising seventeen " <unk> " armed with torpedoes , arrived at 11 : 30 , divided into two attack formations . Despite reports to the contrary , Prince of Wales was struck by only one torpedo , although this was enough to prove fatal , ( while Repulse avoided the seven torpedoes aimed at her , as well as bombs dropped by six other " <unk> " a few minutes later ) . 
 The torpedo struck Prince of Wales on the port side aft , abaft " Y " Turret , wrecking the outer propeller shaft on that side and destroying bulkheads to one degree or another along the shaft all the way to B Engine Room . This caused rapid uncontrollable flooding and put the entire electrical system in the after part of the ship out of action . Lacking effective damage control , she soon took on a heavy list . 
 A third torpedo attack developed against Repulse and once again she avoided taking any hits . 
 A fourth attack , conducted by torpedo @-@ carrying Type 1 " Bettys " , developed . This one scored hits on Repulse and she sank at 12 : 33 . Six aircraft from this wave also attacked Prince of Wales , hitting her with three torpedoes , causing further damage and flooding . Finally , a 500 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) bomb hit Prince of Wales 's catapult deck , penetrated to the main deck , where it exploded , causing many casualties in the makeshift aid centre in the Cinema Flat . Several other bombs from this attack scored very ' near misses ' , <unk> the hull , popping rivets and causing hull plates to ' split ' along the seams and intensifying the flooding . At 13 : 15 the order to abandon ship was given , and at 13 : 20 Prince of Wales capsized and sank ; Vice @-@ Admiral Phillips and Captain Leach were among the 327 fatalities . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Prince of Wales and Repulse were the first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea ( albeit by land @-@ based rather than carrier @-@ based aircraft ) , a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter . It is often pointed out , however , that a contributing factor to the sinking of Prince of Wales was her surface @-@ scanning radar being inoperable , depriving Force Z of one of its most potent early @-@ warning devices and the early critical damage she sustained from the first torpedo . Another factor which led to Prince of Wales 's demise was the additional loss of dynamos , depriving Prince of Wales of many of her pumps . Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding . The sinking was the subject of an inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice <unk> , but the true causes of the ship 's loss were only established when divers examined the wreck after the war . The Director of Naval Construction 's report on the sinking claimed that the ship 's anti @-@ aircraft guns could have " inflicted heavy casualties before torpedoes were dropped , if not preventing the successful conclusion of attack had crews been more adequately trained in their operation . 
 = = = The wreck = = = 
 The wreck lies upside down in 223 feet ( 68 m ) of water at 3 ° 33 ′ 36 ″ N 104 ° 28 ′ 42 ″ E. A Royal Navy White Ensign attached to a line on a buoy tied to a propeller shaft is periodically renewed . The wreck site was designated a ' Protected Place ' in 2001 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 , just prior to the 60th anniversary of her sinking . The ship 's bell was manually raised in 2002 by British technical divers with the permission of the Ministry of Defence and blessing of the Force Z Survivors Association . It was restored , then presented for permanent display by First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff , Admiral Sir Alan West , to the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool . It is currently traditional for every passing Royal Navy ship to perform a remembrance service over the site of the wrecks . 
 In May 2007 , Expedition ' Job 74 ' , a dedicated survey of the exterior hull of both Prince of Wales and Repulse , was conducted . The expedition 's findings sparked considerable interest among naval architects and marine engineers around the world ; as they detailed the nature of the damage to Prince of Wales and the exact location and number of torpedo hits . Consequently , the findings contained in the initial expedition report and later supplementary reports were analysed by the <unk> ( Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers ) Marine Forensics Committee , and a resultant paper was drawn up entitled " Death of a Battleship : A Reanalysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS Prince of Wales " . This paper was subsequently presented at a meeting of <unk> ( Royal Institution of Naval Architects ) and <unk> ( Institute of Marine Engineering , Science & Technology ) members in London by Mr. William Garzke . 
 In October 2014 , the Daily Telegraph reported that both Prince of Wales and Repulse were being " extensively damaged " with explosives by scrap metal dealers .

 Mary Abigail " Abby " Wambach ( born June 2 , 1980 ) is an American retired soccer player , coach , two @-@ time Olympic gold medalist and FIFA Women 's World Cup champion . A six @-@ time winner of the U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year award , Wambach has been a regular on the U.S. women 's national soccer team since 2003 earning her first cap in 2001 . As a forward , she currently stands as the highest all @-@ time goal scorer for the national team and holds the world record for international goals for both female and male soccer players with 184 goals . Wambach was awarded the 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year , becoming the first American woman to win the award in ten years . She was included on the 2015 Time 100 list as one of the most influential people in the world . 
 Wambach played college soccer for the Florida Gators women 's soccer team while attending the University of Florida and helped the team win its first NCAA Division I Women 's Soccer Championship . She played at the professional level for Washington Freedom , magicJack , and the Western New York Flash . Wambach has competed in four FIFA Women 's World Cup tournaments : 2003 in the United States , 2007 in China , 2011 in Germany , and 2015 in Canada , being champion of the last edition ; and two Olympics tournaments : 2004 in Athens and 2012 in London , winning the gold medal on both . All together , she has played in 29 matches and scored 22 goals at these five international tournaments . 
 Known for scoring goals with diving headers , a technique she began honing as a youth in her hometown of Rochester , New York , one of her most notable header goals occurred in the 122nd minute of the 2011 FIFA Women 's World Cup quarterfinal match against Brazil . Wambach scored the equalizer in stoppage time helping the Americans to eventually progress to the championship final against Japan after defeating Brazil in penalty kicks . Her last @-@ minute goal set a new record for latest goal ever scored in a match and was awarded ESPN 's 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year . Following her performance at the 2011 World Cup , she was awarded the tournament 's Bronze Boot and Silver Ball . In 2011 , she became the first ever soccer player of either gender to be named Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press . 
 Wambach announced her retirement on October 27 , 2015 . Her last game was played on December 16 in New Orleans when the United States played its last match of its 10 @-@ game Victory Tour following its win at the 2015 FIFA Women 's World Cup . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Rochester , New York , Wambach was raised in the Rochester suburb of Pittsford . She is the youngest of seven siblings ( with two sisters and four brothers ) born to Pete and Judy Wambach . She began playing soccer at the age of four after her sister decided she wanted to try the sport . Their mother checked out a book from the library explaining how to play the game , and from then on soccer became part of their family tradition . " I think I was bred to do what I do now " , Wambach said in an interview . " Growing up as the youngest of seven was like being in a team environment , you learn all kinds of things ... I learned how to compete , my brothers and sisters always played with me on the same level and they never let me win until I was better than them and deserved it . Being in such a big family makes you humble . You might have a certain skill or talent but there is always someone who is better at something than you . " 
 Wambach recalls being toughened up by her elder brothers firing hockey pucks at her for target practice . While playing in her first youth soccer league at age five , she was transferred from the girls ' team to the boys ' after scoring 27 goals in only three games . As a pre @-@ teen , she began eluding defenders by heading the ball over them and running around them . 
 Wambach attended Our Lady of Mercy High School in Rochester from 1994 to 1998 , where she lettered in soccer and basketball . During her high school career , she scored 142 goals , including 34 in 1997 alone . Mercy 's soccer coach , Kathy Boughton , recalled that Wambach would stay after practice to practice diving headers – a skill that would later become her signature as an international player . Following her senior season , Wambach was named to Parade Magazine 's High School All @-@ America Team . She was also voted national high school player of the year by Umbro and the National Soccer Coaches Association of America ( NSCAA ) . In 1997 , she was named NSCAA Regional Player of the Year , NSCAA State of New York Player of the Year , Gatorade Circle of Champions New York Player of the Year , and cited by USA Today as one of the nation 's top 10 recruits . 
 Wambach was a three @-@ year captain for the Rochester Spirit club team and named All @-@ Greater Rochester Player of the Year in 1995 and 1997 . She was a member of the Olympic Development Program ( ODP ) U @-@ 16 National Team in 1996 , the 1997 National U @-@ 20 Player Pool , and trained and played with the U.S. women 's national soccer team while competing in the 1997 U.S. Soccer Festival in Blaine , Minnesota . In 1997 , she traveled to Beijing , China , as a member of the first American youth soccer team to ever compete there .

 Considered the top college recruit in 1997 , Wambach was intensely sought after by numerous colleges , including top soccer programs such as the University of North Carolina , UCLA , the University of Portland , and the University of Virginia . After sticking with her commitment to her parents to visit five schools , Wambach accepted a full athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville , where she would play for coach Becky Burleigh 's Florida Gators women 's soccer team from 1998 to 2001 . Florida 's program had only been in existence for three years ; however , the challenge of joining a less established team over a team like North Carolina with a long history of championship titles appealed to Wambach . As a freshman in 1998 , Wambach helped lead the Gators to their first NCAA national championship over the 15 @-@ time champion North Carolina Tar Heels .
