 By the late 1990s Mattel had dominated the fashion doll market since the 1959 release of their Barbie doll . At the 1997 peak they held more than 90 % of the market . MGA Entertainment released Bratz in 2001 . With big heads and pouty lips they appealed to the 8- to 12 @-@ year @-@ old tween market group . Bratz achieved great success and gradually took over some of the more wholesome Barbie doll 's market share . Meanwhile , the market for Barbie grew younger . By 2003 the main market was 3- to 6 @-@ year @-@ olds and Barbie 's share of the fashion doll market had dropped to about 70 % . In fall 2002 Mattel released My Scene , a line of redesigned Barbie dolls , in a bid to appeal to tweens and compete with Bratz . But they failed to reverse the company 's faltering sales . Less than a year after the My Scene release , Flavas were launched in summer 2003 in a second attempt to appeal to the tween market and offer competition to Bratz . Production began only three months after Flavas were designed , and The New York Times described their launch as being rushed . The New York Times said that Flavas " appeared to be heavily inspired " by Bratz while Newsweek described Bratz as the " anti @-@ Barbie " and Flavas as Mattel 's " anti @-@ Barbie of its own . " Wall Street Journal commented that the Bratz success pushed Mattel to release Flavas in direct competition with its own Barbie dolls . 
 Flavas , which per Mattel should be pronounced <unk> @-@ <unk> , were marketed with the slogan " What ’ s Your Flava ? " Mattel described them as " the first reality @-@ based fashion doll brand " with " authentic style , attitude and values . " Jerry <unk> , a Mattel senior vice president said : " Older girls want a doll that represents realistic aspirations . " Mattel representative Julia Jensen said : " Our research told us that a lot of young girls are now aspiring to the world of rap and hip @-@ hop music . " The song " What 's Your Flava ? " from R & B artist Craig David was used in Flavas television commercials , which aired during teen @-@ targeted programming . Jensen said that " by aligning with a real song by an incredible artist like Craig David " they strengthened their position of " authenticity and reality . " Coinciding with the US release , the Flavas brand sponsored Christina Aguilera 's 2003 summer tour . In the UK Flavas were launched by the British hip hop group Mis @-@ Teeq .

 Kyra Kyles from the Chicago Tribune described the Flavas dolls as out of touch and questionable role models for children , calling them " unimaginative stereotypes " and saying that one of the dolls looks like a " drug @-@ dealing pimp . " Toy industry analyst Sean McGowan said that they look like " hip @-@ hop as designed by committee . " Raquel Wilson , editor in chief of hip @-@ hop e @-@ zine <unk> said : " They completely misrepresent the culture . " Dr John Richer , a clinical child psychologist in Oxford , England said : " This has the same sort of flavour as beauty contests in America where little kids get <unk> up as teenagers . " Miriam <unk> , the editor in chief of Child described the dolls ' multiculturalism as positive : " a very nice way of helping children all over the country realize that people look many different ways . " Several British toy industry analysts expected the Flavas dolls to sell well , one of them saying that " the risqué nature of these dolls would guarantee their success . " But they sold poorly — Wall Street Journal described their results as " disastrous " . According to AP some analysts believed Flavas were just " too edgy . " Businessweek said that the " clunky jewelry and graffiti on the packaging ... scared away mothers and left kids cold . " They ended up being taken off the market after less than a year . Several Mattel executives were let go following the discontinuation . Moe <unk> of Slate described Flavas as " ridiculous , but in a cute way " and questioned if their hasty withdrawal had been premature , suggesting they could have found a niche market .

She and her immediate family , father Max ( Wood ) , mother Tanya ( Joyner ) and older sister Lauren ( Duggan , recast to Jossa in 2010 ) , are an extension of the Branning family , who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993 . Fitzgerald , in her first major television role , began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on @-@ screen appearance in July . Fitzgerald 's mother commented on her daughter 's casting : " Personally , I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way . At first , it is just the look they go for . Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script . By the second audition , she was still up against 60 or 70 people . You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition , but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling . You don 't know what it means until that point " . Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition . As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part , she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton , and learning lines . In 2012 , she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition , and did not realise how big the show was until she was older . In 2014 , she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner , her on @-@ screen parents , she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition , because she looked like them both . Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming , and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing , and she was unable to produce tears , but was " just making noises " . Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16 . 
 Abi has been described by the official EastEnders website as the family 's " golden girl " compared to Lauren , hinting that she knows how to get her own way . She has been described as " bubbly " and " self @-@ assured " with a nose for mischief . She has also been described as having the biggest heart in Walford , bringing out the best in the people around her . Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Abi is a " real soft touch " .

The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011 and aired on 14 April 2011 . After these minor storylines , Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012 . She said , " I think it 's going to be an exciting year for Lorna . She 's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger , and I think she 's one of our best actresses . What 's lovely about this year is that she 'll be doing her GCSEs , and then once that 's out of the way , she can get something that 's a bit heavier and a bit bigger . She 'll be old enough to work longer hours , so I think they 'd be mad if they didn 't give her something to sink her teeth into at some point this year " . 
 In November 2010 , after sister Lauren was recast to Jossa , Jossa stated that she enjoys working with Fitzgerald , adding the two have a lot in common . Jossa , in 2012 , wanted Lauren and Abi to bond more . She commented : " I think realistically they would when they 're going through a family problem like this . It would bring the family a little bit closer . I think they are quite close already and they have a lot of family banter ! They may not like each other as people , but they love each other as family " . In December 2012 , Fitzgerald conducted her first magazine interview and spoke of a storyline where Abi comforts Lauren over a relationship break up , saying " It 's nice to see the little [ sister ] taking care of the bigger one .

 Fitzgerald was nominated for the " Best Young Actor " at the 2010 Inside Soap Awards for her portrayal of Abi though lost out to Coronation Street 's , Alex Bain , who plays Simon Barlow . Fitzgerald won the award for Best Dramatic Performance from a Young Actor or Actress at the 2012 British Soap Awards an award which Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said was " well deserved " . Fitzgerald said she did not expect to win the award . In January 2012 , Kate White of Inside Soap praised both Fitzgerald and her character , saying " In Fitzgerald , EastEnders has the brightest young star in soap . The rest of her family are getting all the juicy stuff right now , but Abi 's destined for great dramatic things . Mark our words " . 
 Stewart said , due to Max 's past events with his family , what Abi might say when Max objects to her relationship with Jay , " It won 't be her setting a gerbil on him " , calling her a " goody @-@ two @-@ shoes " . A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning / Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like " Walford 's answer to Romeo and Juliet " . Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica . One said , " An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica . But in the tiny micro @-@ world of EastEnders , even the three @-@ mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey . So Central America is simply out of the question " with another saying , " Abi was a little girl arranging tearful funerals for her pets . But now she 's a young teenager , secretly engaged to boyfriend Jay and planning to run away together . He then gives Abi an ultimatum : him or her trip to Costa Rica . Best pass her the <unk> , then " . However , Abi , along with the younger members of the cast were thought to be the blame of declining ratings for the show ; " In the last two months , viewers have seen lots of Lauren , Lucy Beale ( Hetti Bywater ) , Whitney Dean ( Shona McGarty ) , Fatboy ( Ricky Norwood ) , Ben Jay , Abi and Anthony Moon ( Matt Lapinskas ) - but not nearly so much of the classic characters " . Inside Soap noted that Abi and Jay 's relationship was popular with viewers . 
 The 2016 storyline in which Abi lies that she has suffered a miscarriage to cover up a pregnancy lie was criticised by Zoe Clark @-@ Coates , co @-@ founder and CEO of The Mariposa Trust , who said , " To regularly see TV shows using fake miscarriages as light entertainment could make people question genuine losses .

Numbered either Business Loop Interstate 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) or Business Spur Interstate 75 ( BS I @-@ 75 ) depending if they are a full business loop or a business spur , these highways are former routings of I @-@ 75 's predecessor highways in the state . They were designated as I @-@ 75 was completed through the various areas of Michigan . The business loop in Pontiac runs through that city 's downtown along a section of Woodward Avenue and a segment of roadway formerly used by M @-@ 24 . The former Saginaw business loop was once a part of US Highway 23 ( US 23 ) , as was most of the original Bay City business loop . The roadways that make up the business loops in West Branch and Roscommon were previously part of M @-@ 76 , I @-@ 75 's predecessor through that part of the state . In Northern Michigan , the Grayling and Gaylord BL I @-@ 75s were part of US 27 , and the two business routes in St. Ignace and Sault Ste . Marie in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were part of US 2 . Each of the business loops connects to I @-@ 75 on both ends and runs through their respective cities ' downtown areas . The two business spurs only connect to I @-@ 75 on one end and run into the appropriate downtown . 
 = = Pontiac = = 
 Business Loop I @-@ 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) is a business loop serving Pontiac and Auburn Hills . It uses portions of former Business M @-@ 24 ( Bus . M @-@ 24 ) through town . The highway starts as an eight @-@ lane freeway at an interchange on I @-@ 75 in Bloomfield Township . The freeway continues past an interchange with Opdyke Road to end at Square Lake Road , dropping to six lanes . BL I @-@ 75 continues to M @-@ 1 at Woodward Avenue . Square Lake Road continues to the west as Bus . US 24 , BL I @-@ 75 turns northwesterly along the eight @-@ lane divided Woodward Avenue , running concurrently with Bus . US 24 into downtown Pontiac . At the south side of downtown , Woodward drops to six lanes the two directions of Woodward Avenue split and form a four @-@ lane loop . The Woodward Avenue Loop encircles downtown Pontiac , and it is crossed by the eastbound direction of M @-@ 59 running on Huron Street . One block north , the westbound direction of M @-@ 59 runs along University Drive and turns to follow BL I @-@ 75 / Bus . US 24 ( Woodward Avenue Loop ) . The loop intersects Perry Street another block further north , and BL I @-@ 75 turns northeasterly onto the two @-@ way Perry Street . BL I @-@ 75 passes through residential areas and a minor business area along the four @-@ lane Perry Street . Outside of the downtown area , Perry Street widens to include a center turn lane . North of Walton Boulevard in Auburn Hills , the street name changes to Lapeer Road . BL I @-@ 75 intersects Opdyke Road a couple hundred feet west of I @-@ 75 before crossing the freeway . Lapeer Road continues as a six @-@ lane , divided roadway to the ramps of a double trumpet interchange , where the BL I @-@ 75 designation ends . The roadway however , continues as M @-@ 24 providing access to the Palace of Auburn Hills . On average each day in 2013 , 9 @,@ 829 vehicles use the business loop between the two M @-@ 59 junctions , and 73 @,@ 795 vehicles do so on the freeway stub east of Opdyke Road , the lowest and highest traffic counts . 
 In 1919 when the state highway system was first numbered , the main north – south highway through Pontiac was numbered M @-@ 10 , and it was renumbered to US 10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created . By the next year , M @-@ 24 was designated from downtown Pontiac northward to Lapeer . M @-@ 24 was moved to an eastern bypass of town in 1936 , and the former routing in town became M @-@ 24A . This was redesignated Bus M @-@ 24 in 1940 . 
 A number of highway designation and routing changes in the Pontiac were made when US 10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M @-@ 58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown by the middle of 1961 . Before the change , US 10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M @-@ 58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake roads . After the change , US 10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward . The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus . US 10 moniker and M @-@ 58 was decommissioned as a highway designation . Two years later , I @-@ 75 was completed to the east of Pontiac , and the M @-@ 24 bypass of the city was turned over to local control . The former Bus . M @-@ 24 through downtown was renumbered BL I @-@ 75 along with a connection along Square Lake Road out to the freeway . The next year , the streets downtown Pontiac were reconfigured and a loop called Wide Track Drive was created to route traffic around the downtown area . The former routing of BL I @-@ 75 on Perry Street in the downtown core was replaced by routing the business loops on Wide Track Drive . Then in 1966 , an interchange was built to replace the intersection at Opdyke Road and Square Lake Road . 
 In 1985 , the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US 10 to Bay City , and when the change was made the following year , US 24 replaced US 10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road , and Bus . US 10 through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 24 , including the segment concurrent with BL I @-@ 75 . Wide Track Drive through downtown was renamed as the Woodward Avenue Loop in 2000 . 
 The section of BL I @-@ 75 that follows Woodward Avenue has a pair of special designations attached to it . In 1999 , it was designated by MDOT as what is now called a Pure Michigan Byway . Three years later , it was named a National Scenic Byway by the Federal Highway Administration National Scenic Byways Program on June 13 , 2002 , the only urban road at the time with that classification . It was later upgraded to All @-@ American Road status on October 16 , 2009 .

 = = Saginaw = = 
 Business Loop I @-@ 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) was a business loop in Saginaw that was previously Business US Highway 23 ( Bus . US 23 ) . It started at an interchange between I @-@ 75 / US 23 and M @-@ 46 ( Holland Road ) in Buena Vista Township . From there , it ran concurrently with M @-@ 46 westward into Saginaw . East of 17th Street , the highway split to form a one @-@ way pairing with Remington Street , which carried westbound traffic . About three blocks further west , BL I @-@ 75 split from M @-@ 46 to follow Genesee Avenue northwesterly into the downtown area . At an intersection between Genesee Avenue , Janes Street and 2nd Avenue , the northbound BL I @-@ 75 followed 2nd Avenue while southbound continued on Genesee Avenue . Northbound traffic traveled along 2nd Avenue and Johnson Street to Washington Avenue near the Saginaw River , where the two directions of traffic reunited . Washington Avenue also carried M @-@ 13 / M @-@ 81 , and the three designations ran concurrently together northward and parallel to the river . BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 13 / M @-@ 81 curved northeasterly north of downtown , and M @-@ 81 left the business loop at an intersection with Veterans Memorial Parkway ; BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 13 turned north on the parkway and M @-@ 81 continued easterly on Washington Avenue . The business loop proceeded northward running parallel to the river and ended at an interchange with I @-@ 75 / US 23 in Zilwaukee Township ; M @-@ 13 continued along Bay City Road north of the interchange . 
 When the state highway system was signposted in 1919 , the north – south highway through Saginaw was part of the original M @-@ 10 . This highway was later redesignated as part of US 23 when the United States Numbered Highway System was created in 1926 . US 23 was initially routed on the western side of the Saginaw River through the city , but it was moved in 1929 to run along the eastern side . In 1953 , the initial eastern bypass of Saginaw was built as a two @-@ lane highway , and the former routing through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 23 . This bypass was upgraded in 1961 to a full freeway as part of I @-@ 75 / US 23 , and the business loop through downtown was redesignated BL I @-@ 75 . In 1971 , I @-@ 675 was completed , and BL I @-@ 75 was decommissioned through Saginaw . The segments of the business loop that were concurrent with M @-@ 13 , M @-@ 46 or M @-@ 81 remained part of those state highways , but the rest of BL I @-@ 75 was returned to local control .

 = = Bay City = = 
 Business Spur Interstate 75 ( BS I @-@ 75 ) is a business spur running through Bay City following a section of the current routing of M @-@ 25 through town . Formerly a full business loop numbered Business Loop Interstate 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) , it followed what is now M @-@ 84 back to end at I @-@ 75 / US 23 at exit 160 south of downtown . The business route also follows streets that previously were numbered Business US Highway 23 ( Bus . US 23 ) . The spur starts at exit 162 on I @-@ 75 / US 23 at the same interchange where M @-@ 25 and US 10 end . BS I @-@ 75 runs concurrently along M @-@ 25 , and for about the first 1 1 ⁄ 3 miles ( 2 @.@ 1 km ) , the spur is a four @-@ lane freeway bounded by residential subdivisions on either side . In Bangor Township , the freeway ends and BS I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 25 splits into a one @-@ way pairing of Thomas Street ( eastbound ) and Jenny Street ( westbound ) . These two three @-@ lane streets continue along a residential area on the west side of Bay City . East of intersections with Henry Street , the opposing sides of traffic merge back together near Veterans Memorial Park to cross the Saginaw River on the four @-@ lane Veterans Memorial Bridge . On the eastern side of the river , BS I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 25 splits again into the one @-@ way pairing of the three @-@ lane McKinley Street ( westbound ) and 7th Street ( eastbound ) . Just three blocks east of the river , BS I @-@ 75 ends at the intersections with M @-@ 84 ( Washington Avenue ) in downtown Bay City . On average each day in 2013 , 11 @,@ 678 vehicles use the business loop east of the M @-@ 13 junction , and 29 @,@ 391 vehicles do so west of the M @-@ 84 junction , the lowest and highest traffic counts . 
 When the state highway system was first signposted in 1919 , the north – south highway through Bay City was part of the original M @-@ 10 , and the east – west highway was numbered as part of M @-@ 20 . When the United States Numbered Highway System was created in 1926 , M @-@ 10 became part of US 23 , although it was routed on the western side of the Saginaw River . The highway was rerouted to the eastern side of the river in 1929 . By early 1941 , US 23 was rerouted to cross the Saginaw River on the southern side of Bay City , and the former routing along Washington Avenue and Midland Street through downtown was renumbered Bus . US 23 . When the I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 freeway bypass west of Bay City opened in late 1961 , the former routing of US 23 was replaced by M @-@ 13 and the former Bus . US 23 , including connections along the former routing of M @-@ 47 southwest and M @-@ 20 west of Bay City , were redesignated as BL I @-@ 75 . The BL I @-@ 75 designation lasted until 1971 when southern half of BL I @-@ 75 was removed , converting the business loop into a business spur ; the southern section was renumbered as part of an M @-@ 84 extension , and BS I @-@ 75 would then run along the section concurrent with M @-@ 25 only .

 = = West Branch = = 
 Business Loop Interstate 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) is a business loop running through West Branch that was originally numbered Business M @-@ 76 ( Bus . M @-@ 76 ) . It starts at exit 212 south on I @-@ 75 south of West Branch . From that interchange , BL I @-@ 75 runs northward along Cooks Road in Horton and West Branch townships past an outlet mall . North of the mall , the roadway has two lanes , one in each direction plus an intermittent center turn lane , and it curves first to the northeast through a rural section of the townships , and then after intersecting Old 76 Road , it turns northwesterly through a commercial area . On the eastern city limits , BL I @-@ 75 turns due west and runs concurrently with M @-@ 55 on the four @-@ lane Houghton Avenue through downtown West Branch . On the western side of downtown , the business loop intersects the northern end of M @-@ 30 and narrows to two lanes . BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 55 continues out of town , running past more businesses before meeting I @-@ 75 at exit 215 . At that interchange , BL I @-@ 75 ends , and M @-@ 55 merges onto the freeway . On average each day in 2013 , 10 @,@ 682 vehicles use the business loop near the southern I @-@ 75 interchange , and 15 @,@ 399 vehicles do so between the M @-@ 55 junction and 5th Street in downtown West Branch , the lowest and highest traffic counts . 
 When the state highway system was signposted in 1919 , the highway running northwest – southeast through West Branch was numbered M @-@ 76 and the east – west highway was M @-@ 55 . In the early 1970s , M @-@ 76 was being converted into a freeway between Standish and the Grayling area . In 1970 , the freeway was built as far as the present @-@ day exit 212 , and the connection along Cook Road was built to allow M @-@ 76 to connect between the new freeway and its former routing . The next year , this freeway was completed to bypass West Branch to the south and west . The former route of M @-@ 76 through town with the connection along Cook Road was renumbered Bus . M @-@ 76 . Two years later , I @-@ 75 was finished in the state , and the M @-@ 76 designation was decommissioned . The former Bus . M @-@ 76 was redesignated as BL I @-@ 75 at the same time .

 Business Loop Interstate 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) is a business loop running through Roscommon . Starting at exit 239 along I @-@ 75 , the business loop runs concurrently with M @-@ 18 northward along the two @-@ lane Roscommon Road through rural Northern Michigan woodlands . When BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 18 enters the village of Roscommon , it follows Lake Street northeasterly into downtown . At the intersection with 5th Street , BL I @-@ 75 turns northwesterly and separates from M @-@ 18 . In the village , the business loop has three lanes , one in each direction with a center turn lane . The business loop continues past several businesses and exits the village as a two @-@ lane road . BL I @-@ 75 curves to run due west along the Roscommon – Crawford county line on Federal Highway . At exit 244 on I @-@ 75 , the business loop terminates while following the county line . On average each day in 2013 , 1 @,@ 531 vehicles use the business loop near the northern I @-@ 75 interchange , and 5 @,@ 987 vehicles do so in downtown Roscommon south of the M @-@ 18 junction , the lowest and highest traffic counts . 
 When the state highway system was originally signposted in 1919 , the highway running northwest – southeast through Roscommon was numbered M @-@ 76 . In 1949 , M @-@ 18 was extended north into Roscommon and then west along M @-@ 76 . During the early 1970s , M @-@ 76 was being converted into a freeway to be used as part of I @-@ 75 . In 1971 , I @-@ 75 was completed southward from the Grayling area to what is now exit 239 . Two years later , I @-@ 75 was completed between Roscommon and West Branch , and M @-@ 76 between the two communities was decommissioned . At the same time , M @-@ 18 was realigned to northeasterly out of Roscommon instead of following M @-@ 76 toward Grayling . BL I @-@ 75 was commissioned at this time to overlap M @-@ 18 from the freeway north into Roscommon and to replace the former M @-@ 18 / M @-@ 76 west of the village to the new freeway .

 Business Loop Interstate 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 ) is a business loop running through Grayling . The southern end is at a partial interchange at exit 254 on I @-@ 75 ; only northbound I @-@ 75 traffic can access northbound BL I @-@ 75 , and southbound BL I @-@ 75 traffic can only access southbound I @-@ 75 . From this interchange , the business loop runs northward as a five @-@ lane divided roadway through a commercial area and past the Grayling Golf Club . At the intersection with Huron Street ( South Down River Road ) , BL I @-@ 75 merges with M @-@ 72 . The two highways run concurrently and turn northwesterly along the five @-@ lane undivided James Street . BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 72 narrows to three lanes and crosses the Au Sable River and runs for about 3 ⁄ 4 mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) before intersecting Lake Street in downtown Grayling . There , M @-@ 72 turns southwesterly onto Lake Street , separating from the business loop . At the same intersection , M @-@ 93 turns north and merges with BL I @-@ 75 as the two run concurrently on the three @-@ lane McClellan Street . BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 93 intersects F @-@ 32 ( North Down River Road ) and then passes the Camp Grayling Airfield . North of the airfield , the highway narrows to two lanes and curves to the northwest , exiting the city . At the intersection with Old 27 and Hartwick Pines Road , BL I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 93 turns northeasterly onto the latter . They continue running concurrently to exit 259 on I @-@ 75 where the BL I @-@ 75 designation terminates . M @-@ 93 continues along Hartwick Pines Road north of the interchange .

 = 1755 Cape Ann earthquake = 
 The 1755 Cape Ann earthquake took place off the coast of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay ( present @-@ day Massachusetts ) on November 18 . At between 6 @.@ 0 and 6 @.@ 3 on the Richter scale , it remains the largest earthquake in the history of Massachusetts . No one was killed , but it damaged hundreds of buildings in Boston and was felt as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina . Sailors on a ship more than 200 miles ( 320 km ) offshore felt the quake , and mistook it at first for their ship running aground . Many residents of Boston and the surrounding areas attributed the quake to God , and it occasioned a brief increase in religious fervor in the city . Modern studies estimate that if a similar quake shook Boston today , it would result in as much as $ 5 billion in damage and hundreds of deaths . 
 It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon , Portugal , a few weeks prior , although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked . 
 = = Epicenter = = 
 The earthquake took place on November 18 , 1755 , at approximately 4 : 30 AM . Its epicenter is believed to have been offshore , approximately 24 miles ( 39 km ) east of Cape Ann . The quake was felt as far north as Halifax , Nova Scotia , south to the Chesapeake Bay and South Carolina , and from Lake George and Lake Champlain in the northwest to a ship 200 miles ( 320 km ) off the east coast . Sailors on the ship reported that the quake was so strong , they had feared that they had run aground . The region experienced several aftershocks , the first of which was a little more than an hour after the quake . Most of these aftershocks could not be felt in Boston , affecting only the northeastern coast of the colony . 
 Modern research has estimated that the quake was between 6 @.@ 0 and 6 @.@ 3 on the Richter scale , and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake in the history of Massachusetts . Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States . There are a number of old faults in the region , but none of them are known to still be active . It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon , Portugal , a few weeks prior , although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked . 
 = = Damage = = 
 Boston and Cape Ann were the most heavily damaged . In Boston , damage was concentrated in areas of infill near the harbor ; infill is less sturdy in earthquakes than solid land . From 1 @,@ 300 to 1 @,@ 600 chimneys in the city were damaged in some way , the gable ends of some houses collapsed , and a number of roofs were damaged by falling chimneys . Stone chimneys and buildings were damaged in Falmouth ( present @-@ day Portland , Maine ) , Springfield , Massachusetts , and New Haven , Connecticut , as well . Some church steeples in Boston were damaged , ending up tilted from vertical . Stone fencing in rural areas was damaged . Observers also reported that several springs dried up , new ones were created , and cracks appeared in the ground near Scituate , Lancaster , and Pembroke . In this last town , observers noted water and fine sand coming from the crack . Non @-@ structural damage was minor ; residents reported damage to china and glassware , and a distiller lost some of his product after a cistern was damaged . The Cape Ann earthquake may also have created the first recorded tsunami in U.S. history . Observers in the Leeward Islands nearly 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) south of Cape Ann , reported a receding of water followed by a large wave that lifted several boats ashore and left fish floundering on the beach . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Many Massachusetts residents of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior . In the days after the earthquake , special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days . A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence , including Jeremiah Newland 's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November , 1755 and Thomas Prince 's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just <unk> . Not all explanations of the event were theological ; John Winthrop , a Harvard professor , proposed an alternate explanation having to do with heat and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth . 
 Since the 1755 earthquake , Boston and its surrounding towns have become a major metropolitan area . Much new construction has been built on infill , especially in the Back Bay area , which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill . Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick , and are likely to collapse completely during a major earthquake . Given this , modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city . A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $ 4 billion and $ 5 billion , and potential loss of life in the hundreds . As a consequence , the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes . 
 Opposition to the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant , about 15 miles off Cape Ann on the New Hampshire shoreline , highlighted the earthquake risk of the area . The plant was built regardless . 
 = Light Tank Mk VIII = 
 The Tank , Light , Mk VIII ( A25 ) , also known as the Harry Hopkins , after American President Roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor , was a British light tank produced by Vickers @-@ Armstrong during World War II . The Mk VIII was the last in the line of light tanks the company had built for the British Army , and was intended to be the successor of the previous light tank designed by Vickers @-@ Armstrong , the Mk VII Tetrarch . A number of changes were made to the Mk VIII , most notably increasing its width , length and weight and also increasing the thickness of the armour . The design of the tank was submitted to the War Office in late 1941 , with an initial order for 1 @,@ 000 models being made by the Tank Board of the War Office in the same month , a number that increased to 2 @,@ 410 in November . Production began in June 1942 but immediately began encountering problems with the tank , and a number of modifications had to be made to the design after complaints were made by the War Office and the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment . These problems were so acute that only 6 tanks had been produced by mid @-@ 1943 , and only 100 when production ended in February 1945 . 
 By mid @-@ 1941 , officials in the War Office and the British Army had taken the decision that light tanks were no longer to be used by the British Army due to their inferior weapons and armour , as well as their poor performance during the conflict . Consequently , the Mk VIII was obsolete by the time that any significant number of the tanks had been produced , and none ever saw combat . A number of plans were made by the War Office for the design in light of this decision , including equipping reconnaissance units with them , or the unsuccessful idea of attaching wings to them so that aircraft could tow them as gliders into position to support airborne forces ; eventually it was decided to hand over those tanks that had been built to the Royal Air Force for use in airfield defence . One variant on the Mk VIII was designed , the Alecto self @-@ propelled gun which was to have mounted a howitzer and used as a close @-@ support vehicle by airborne forces ; however only a few were ever produced and they were never used in combat . 
 = = Development history = = 
 The Mk VIII was the light tank designed by Vickers @-@ Armstrong to be the successor to the Mk VII Tetrarch for the British Army . The company intended that the Mk VIII would improve on the design of the Tetrarch in a number of areas , particularly that of armour protection . It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch , with the frontal hull and turret armour being increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) , and the turret and hull were given more sloping surfaces than the Tetrarch to help deflect shells . The dimensions of the Tetrarch design were also changed , with the Mk VIII being longer by 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) and its weight being increased ; these alterations meant that the tank could no longer be air @-@ portable , as it was too heavy to be carried by the General Aircraft Hamilcar glider . 
 The same 12 @-@ cylinder engine as in the Tetrarch was fitted to the Mk VIII , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) . The armament remained the same as the Tetrarch 's : one machine @-@ gun and a 2 pounder 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) main gun . The tank also kept the unusual steering system used in the Tetrarch design ; this steering and mechanical system accomplished turns by the lateral movement of road wheels , which bowed the tracks . When the driver turned the steering wheel all eight road wheels not only turned but also tilted in order to bend the tracks and make the tank turn ; the idea was to reduce the mechanical strain and waste of power caused by the traditional system used to turn tanks by braking one track . Unlike the Tetrarch , the steering system of the Mk VIII was power @-@ assisted . 
 Vickers @-@ Armstrong submitted the Mk VIII design to the War Office in September 1941 , and in that same month the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1 @,@ 000 tanks , increased in November to 2 @,@ 410 . The Board hoped that production could commence in June 1942 at a rate of approximately 100 per month , to be produced by Metro @-@ Cammell , a subsidiary of Vickers @-@ Armstrong . It was also at this time that the tank was given the specification number A25 and given the name of Harry Hopkins Production began in June 1942 as expected , but immediately began to experience problems ; these are not specified , but it appears that testing of the prototypes of the Mk VIII provided by Vickers @-@ Armstrong raised a number of issues . A minute sent to the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , in September from the Ministry of Supply stated that there would be delays in delivery of the tank due to developmental problems , and a report issued by the War Office in December stated that a number of modifications would be required before production could be continued ; the front suspension system was singled out as requiring extensive modification . Problems were still being encountered in July 1943 , with a report from the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment indicating that serious defects were still being found in the models being tested ; the problems became so acute that trials of the Mk VIII were abandoned earlier than scheduled . By 31 August 1943 only six Mk VIII tanks had been produced , compared to a War Office requirement of 100 by the beginning of the year . Although the War Office persisted in retaining the design and issued an official requirement in November 1943 for 750 tanks to be built , only around 100 had been built when production officially ended in February 1945 . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 By mid @-@ 1941 officials at the War Office and in the Army had finally decided that light tanks as a concept were a liability , and too vulnerable to be used by the British Army . This was due to the poor performance of British light tanks during the Battle of France , caused when a shortage of tanks designed to engage enemy tanks had led to light tanks being deployed against German armour ; the resulting high casualties led to the War Office rethinking the suitability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , had also been found to be better carried out by scout cars which had smaller crews and better cross @-@ country abilities . Consequently , by the time that significant numbers of the Mk VIII were being produced by Metro @-@ Cammell , they had already become obsolete and did not see combat . There was a requirement for a limited number of light tanks within the organization of British armoured divisions , but this had already been met by the American @-@ produced M5 Stuart light tank . A policy report issued in December 1942 suggested that the tank could be issued to reconnaissance regiments or special light tank regiments raised for specialized operations . These suggestions were discussed and discarded , and instead it was decided that those tanks built should be handed over to the Royal Air Force for use in defending airfields and airbases . 
 The Mk VIII was also discussed in terms of another plan known as the Carrier Wing ; in this plan flying surfaces , such as wings , would be fitted to the Mk VIII so that it could be towed by a transport aircraft and then glide into battle in support of airborne forces . The plan was dropped , however , after the prototype crashed after it had taken off . 
 A single variant of the Mk VIII was designed , the Alecto self @-@ propelled gun . Originally known as the Harry Hopkins 1 CS ( for " Close Support " ) , the Alecto was eventually given the General Staff specification number A25 E2 . The Alecto mounted a 95 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 7 in ) howitzer on a lightweight version of the Mk VIII chassis which had the turret removed so that the howitzer could be placed low down in the hull , and the armour was reduced to a thickness of 10 to 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 to 0 @.@ 16 in ) to reduce its weight , resulting in a maximum speed of 31 miles per hour ( 50 km / h ) . The Alecto was designed to replace the half @-@ tracks carrying support weapons , such as howitzers , which British airborne formations used during the conflict , and was first developed in late 1942 . It could also have been used in place of 75mm gun equipped armoured cars . The War Office had ordered 2 @,@ 200 <unk> but only a small number were ever produced , none of which saw service ; many were converted into bulldozers for use by Royal Engineer units . 
 = BLT = 
 A BLT ( Bacon , Lettuce and Tomato ) is a type of bacon sandwich . The standard BLT is made up of four ingredients : bacon , lettuce , tomato and bread . The BLT evolved from the tea sandwiches served before 1900 at a similar time to the club sandwich , although it is unclear when the name BLT became the norm . 
 = = Ingredients and preparation = = 
 While there are variations on the BLT , the essential ingredients are bacon , lettuce , tomato and bread . The quantity and quality of the ingredients are matters of personal preference . The bacon can be well cooked or tender , but as it " carries " the other flavours , chefs recommend using higher quality meat ; in particular , chef Edward Lee states " Your general supermarket bacon is not going to cut the mustard " . 
 Iceberg lettuce is a common choice because it does not add too much flavour whilst adding crunch . Food writer Ed Levine has suggested that BLT does not require lettuce at all , as it is " superfluous " , a suggestion that Jon Bonné , lifestyle editor at MSNBC , described as " shocking " . Michele Anna Jordan , author of The BLT Cookbook , believes the tomato is the key ingredient and recommends the use of the beefsteak tomato as it has more flesh and fewer seeds . 
 The sandwich is sometimes served with dressings , like mayonnaise . The bread can be of any variety , white or <unk> , toasted or not , depending on personal preference . 
 = = = Variations = = = 
 The sandwich has a high sodium and fat content , and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains in an effort to reduce salt and fat . Due to this , low @-@ fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon . In 2009 , seven large cafe chains in the UK made a commitment to reducing salt and fat through similar substitutions . A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon . One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich , a two @-@ layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT . The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat , normally chicken or turkey . 
 The BLT has been deconstructed into a number of forms ; for example , Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock created a BLT salad in The Gift of Southern Cooking by cutting the ingredients into 1 inch ( 25 mm ) pieces and tossing in mayonnaise . This variation was described by New York Times writer Julia Reed as " even more perfect than a BLT " . 
 Vegans and vegetarians may replace bacon with tempeh as meat analogue instead . This recipe is called TLT ( <unk> , Lettuce , and Tomato ) . Alternatively they can use mock bacon . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the ingredients of the BLT have existed for many years , there is little evidence of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900 . In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book , a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon , lettuce , tomato , mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread . Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches , the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato . 
 The BLT became popular after World War II because of the rapid expansion of supermarkets , which allowed ingredients to be available year @-@ round . The initials , representing " bacon , lettuce , tomato " , likely began in the American restaurant industry as shorthand for the sandwich , but it is unclear when this transferred to the public consciousness . For example , a 1951 edition of the Saturday Evening Post makes reference to the sandwich , although it does not use its initials , describing a scene in which : " On the tray , invariably , are a bowl of soup , a toasted sandwich of bacon , lettuce and tomato , and a chocolate milk shake . " 
 A 1954 issue of Modern Hospital contains a meal suggestion that includes : " Bean Soup , <unk> Bacon Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich , Pickles , <unk> Banana Salad , Cream Dressing , and Pound Cake . " By 1958 , Hellmann 's <unk> advertised their product as " traditional on bacon , lettuce , and tomato sandwiches , " suggesting that the combination had been around for some time . However , there are several references to a " <unk> " in the early 1970s , including in one review of Bruce Jay Friedman 's play entitled <unk> titled : " A <unk> for God – hold the mayo . " . The abbreviation used in title references a line of dialogue in the play in which God yells , " Send up a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich , hold the mayo . You burn the toast , I 'll smite you down with my terrible swift sword . " The coexistence of the shortened version and the full name suggests this was a period of transition as the abbreviation was popularized . 
 = = = Popularity = = = 
 According to food historian John Mariani , it is the second most popular sandwich in the US , after the ham sandwich , and a poll by <unk> in 2008 showed that it was the " nation 's favourite " sandwich in the UK . BLT sandwiches are popular especially in the summer , following the tomato harvest . In the USA , the BLT @-@ season is associated with an increase in the price of pork @-@ bellies , which are processed into bacon . 
 = = BLT in culture = = 
 In 1963 , pop art sculptor Claes Oldenburg created Giant BLT a soft sculpture representing the sandwich , now in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art . It measures 32 by 39 inches ( 81 cm × 99 cm ) and uses vinyl , kapok and wood , painted in acrylic . Every time it is moved , it must be <unk> , which means it varies between exhibits . The artist has said that he has not set it up personally since its creation in 1963 . 
 In 2003 , a record for the world 's largest BLT was created by Michele Anna Jordan , measuring 108 feet ( 33 m ) in length . It was prepared at a 2003 tomato festival in Sonoma County , California and had a total area of 14 @,@ 976 square inches ( 96 @,@ 620 cm2 ) . In 2008 , Marie <unk> and Glenda Castelli created a 146 feet ( 45 m ) BLT – a sandwich which was originally planned with Jordan . The record was broken again by the Iron Barley restaurant in St. Louis , Missouri , with a BLT measuring 179 feet ( 55 m ) , and is currently held by Bentley Dining Services for their 2009 attempt , measuring 209 feet 1 inch ( 63 @.@ 73 m ) . 
 In 2004 , the New Statesman reported that the sandwich chosen by a politician as his " favourite " is loaded with political symbolism . For example , it suggested that a chicken tikka sandwich would be a " gentle nod to an imperial past and a firm statement of a multicultural present and future " . The article went on to explain that the then Leader of the Opposition William Hague had accused the then Prime Minister Tony Blair of being a hypocrite with regards to food , telling one portion of society that his favourite meal was fish and chips and another that it was a fresh <unk> dish . The conclusion of the article was that Blair chose the BLT as his favourite sandwich , which appeals to all classes .

 Juan Cespedes Uribe Tena ( born March 22 , 1979 ) is a Dominican professional baseball third baseman for the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He stands 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall and weighs 235 pounds ( 107 kg ) . He previously played in MLB for the Colorado Rockies , Chicago White Sox , San Francisco Giants , Los Angeles Dodgers , Atlanta Braves and New York Mets . He bats and throws right @-@ handed . 
 Uribe began his professional career in 1997 when he was signed by the Colorado Rockies . After advancing through the minors , he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001 . He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity . He missed part of 2003 with an injury and was traded to the Chicago White Sox following the season . After one season as a utility player , Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005 ; he held that position for the next three years . While Uribe was with the White Sox , the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros . Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on @-@ base percentage . He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average with runners in scoring position ( RISP ) . In 2008 , Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second , but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ramírez . He eventually ended the season as the team 's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede . 
 In 2009 , Uribe signed with the Giants and was again used as utility player . He spent most of 2010 as the Giants ' shortstop , hit a career @-@ high 24 home runs , and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series . Following that season , he signed a three @-@ year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers . The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting , but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014 . Uribe was traded to the Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season .

 Uribe was born in <unk> , Dominican Republic . Growing up , he became interested in baseball partly due to José Uribe . José was Juan 's second cousin , although Juan calls him his " uncle " because of their age difference . When Major League Baseball ( MLB ) was not in season , José would come home to the Dominican Republic and tell Juan about his time in the majors playing shortstop for the San Francisco Giants . Juan proved to have baseball ability too . In 1997 , Colorado Rockies scout Jorge Posada , Sr. , spotted Uribe while he was scouting pitcher <unk> Pacheco . Posada offered him a $ 5 @,@ 000 contract , but Uribe and his father tried to get a higher amount from agent Bob Michelin . Eventually , Uribe settled for $ 5 @,@ 000 .

 In October 2006 , Uribe was alleged to have been involved in a shooting in his native Dominican Republic . A farmer named Antonio Gonzalez Perez accused Uribe of wounding him with a pellet gun . Despite claims by the San Cristóbal Province District Attorney that there was no firm evidence that Uribe was involved in the incident , a judge decided to press forward with the case . Although a defense motion to bar him from leaving the country was rejected , it was ruled on January 5 , 2007 , that Uribe must appear before a court on the 15 and the 30 of every month until the case was resolved . Uribe , who denied any involvement in the case , suggested that he might not play baseball until the legal proceedings were concluded . He was confident that he would win in court , and the White Sox expected him to be free for spring training . In February , his name was cleared of any involvement with the shooting , and the court ruled he no longer had to appear on the 15 and 30 of every month . Uribe called the incident " blackmail " , saying it was an attempt by Perez to get money from him . 
 = Battle of Fort Eben @-@ Emael = 
 The Battle of Fort Eben @-@ Emael was a battle between Belgian and German forces that took place between 10 May and 11 May 1940 , and was part of the Battle of Belgium and Fall Gelb , the German invasion of the Low Countries and France . An assault force of German paratroopers , Fallschirmjäger , was tasked with assaulting and capturing Fort Eben @-@ Emael ; a Belgian fortress whose strategic position and strong artillery emplacements dominated several important bridges over the Albert Canal . The easterly roads led into the Belgium heartland and the rest of the Low Countries . These roads were which the German forces intended to use to advance into Belgium . As some of the German airborne forces assaulted the fortress and disabled the garrison and the artillery pieces inside it , others simultaneously captured three bridges over the Canal . Having disabled the fortress , the airborne troops were then ordered to protect the bridges against Belgian counter @-@ attacks until they linked up with ground forces from the German 18th Army . 
 The battle was a strategic victory for the German forces , with the airborne troops landing on top of the fortress via the use of gliders and using explosives and flamethrowers to disable the outer defences of the fortress . The Fallschirmjäger then entered the fortress , killing a number of defenders and containing the rest in the lower sections of the fortress . Simultaneously , the rest of the German assault force had landed near the three bridges over the Canal , destroyed a number of pillboxes and defensive positions and defeated the Belgian forces guarding the bridges , capturing them and bringing them under German control . The airborne troops suffered heavy casualties during the operation , but succeeded in holding the bridges until the arrival of German ground forces , who then aided the airborne troops in assaulting the fortress a second time and forcing the surrender of the remaining members of the garrison . German forces were then able to utilize two bridges over the Canal to bypass a number of Belgian defensive positions and advance into Belgium to aid in the invasion of the country . The bridge at Kanne was destroyed , forcing German engineers to construct a new bridge . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 10 May 1940 , Germany launched Fall Gelb , an invasion of the Low Countries . By attacking through the Netherlands , Luxembourg and Belgium , the German Oberkommando der Wehrmacht believed that German forces could outflank the Maginot Line and then advance through southern Belgium and into northern France , cutting off the British Expeditionary Force and a large number of French forces and forcing the French government to surrender . To gain access to northern France , German forces would have to defeat the armed forces of the Low Countries and either bypass or neutralize a number of defensive positions , primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands . Some of these defensive positions were only lightly defended and intended more as delaying positions than true defensive lines designed to stop an enemy attack . However , a number of them were of a more permanent design , possessing considerable fortifications and garrisoned by significant numbers of troops . The Grebbe @-@ Peel Line in the Netherlands , which stretched from the southern shore of the <unk> to the Belgian border near Weert , had a large number of fortifications combined with natural obstacles , such as marsh @-@ lands and the Geld Valley , which could easily be flooded to impede an attack . The Belgian defences consisted of one delaying position running along the Albert Canal , and then a main defensive line running along the River Dyle , which protected the port of Antwerp and the Belgian capital , Brussels . This delaying position was protected by a number of forward positions manned by troops , except in a single area where the canal ran close to the Dutch border , which was known as the ' Maastricht Appendix ' due to the proximity of the city of Maastricht . The Belgian military could not build forward positions due to the proximity of the border , and therefore assigned an infantry division to guard the three bridges over the canal in the area , a brigade being assigned to each bridge . The bridges were defended by blockhouses equipped with machine @-@ guns . Artillery support was provided by Fort Eben @-@ Emael , whose artillery pieces covered two of the bridges . Having become aware of the Belgian defensive plan , which called for Belgian forces to briefly hold the delaying positions along the Albert Canal and then retreat to link up with British and French forces at the main defensive positions on the River Dyle , the German High Command made its own plans to disrupt this and seize and secure these three bridges , as well as a number of other bridges in Belgium and the Netherlands , to allow their own forces to breach the defensive positions and advance into the Netherlands . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = Belgian Preparation = = = 
 The Belgian 7th Infantry Division was assigned to guard the three bridges over the canal , supplementing the troops who garrisoned Fort Eben @-@ Emael at the time of the battle . The defences for each bridge consisted of four large concrete pillboxes on the western side of the canal , three equipped with machine @-@ guns and a fourth with an anti @-@ tank gun ; the bunker containing the anti @-@ tank gun was positioned close to the road leading from the bridge , with one machinegun @-@ equipped bunker immediately behind the bridge and two others flanking the bridge a short distance either side . A company position existed on the western bank of the canal by each of the bridges , with a small observation post on the eastern side , which could be quickly recalled , and all three bridges could be destroyed with demolition charges set into their structures , triggered by a firing mechanism situated in the anti @-@ tank bunkers . 
 Fort Eben @-@ Emael , which measured 200 by 400 yards ( 180 by 370 m ) , had been built during the 1930s , and completed by 1935 , by blasting the required space out of marl . It possessed walls and roofs composed of 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) thick reinforced concrete , as well as four retractable casemates and sixty @-@ four strongpoints . The fort was equipped with six 120mm artillery pieces with a range of ten miles , two of which could traverse 360 degrees ; sixteen 75mm artillery pieces ; twelve 60mm high @-@ velocity anti @-@ tank guns ; twenty @-@ five twin @-@ mounted machine @-@ guns ; and a number of anti @-@ aircraft guns . One side of the fort faced the canal , whilst the other three faced land and were defended by minefields ; deep ditches ; a 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high wall ; concrete pillboxes fitted with machine @-@ guns ; fifteen searchlights were emplaced on top of the fort ; and 60mm anti @-@ tank guns . A large number of tunnels ran beneath the fort , connecting individual turrets to the command centre and the ammunition stores . The fort also possessed its own hospital and a number of living quarters for the garrison , as well as a power station that provided electricity to power the guns , provide internal and external illumination , and to power the wireless network and air @-@ purifying system used by the garrison . 
 Belgian plans did not call for the garrison of the fort and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force ; it was assumed that sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on the eastern side of the canal could be withdrawn , the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready to fight a delaying action . The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle , where they would link up with other Allied forces . 
 = = = German Preparation = = = 
 The airborne assault on Fort Eben @-@ Emael , and the three bridges it helped protect , was part of a much larger German airborne operation that involved the 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division . The 7th Air Division , comprising three parachute regiments and one infantry regiment , was tasked with capturing a number of river and canal bridges that led to the Dutch defensive positions centered around Rotterdam , as well as an airfield at Waalhaven . The 22nd Airlanding Division , which was composed of two infantry regiments and a reinforced parachute battalion , was tasked with capturing a number of airfields in the vicinity of The Hague at Valkenburg , <unk> and Ypenburg . Once these airfields had been secured by the parachute battalion , the rest of the division would land with the aim of occupying the Dutch capital and capturing the entire Dutch government , the Royal Family and high @-@ ranking members of the Dutch military . The division would also interdict all roads and railway lines in the area to impede the movement of Dutch forces . The intention of the German OKW was to use the two airborne divisions to create a corridor , along which the 18th Army could advance into the Netherlands without being impeded by destroyed bridges . General Kurt Student , who proposed the deployment of the two airborne divisions , argued that their presence would hold open the southern approaches to Rotterdam , prevent the movement of Dutch reserves based in north @-@ west Holland and any French forces sent to aid the Dutch defenders , and deny the use of airfields to Allied aircraft , all of which would aid a rapid advance by the 18th Army . 400 Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft would be used to deploy the parachute elements of the airborne troops , as well as transport the elements of the two airborne divisions not landing by parachute or glider . 
 The force tasked with assaulting the fort and capturing the three bridges was formed from elements of the 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division , and was named Sturmabteilung Koch ( Assault Detachment Koch ) after the leader of the force , Hauptmann Walter Koch . The force , which had been assembled in November 1939 , was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division , as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots . Although the force was composed primarily of parachutists , it was decided that the first landings by the force should be by glider . Adolf Hitler , who had taken a personal interest in the arrangements for the assault force , had ordered that gliders be used after being told by his personal pilot , Hanna Reitsch , that gliders in flight were nearly silent ; it was believed that , since Belgian anti @-@ aircraft defences used sound @-@ location arrays and not radar , it would be possible to tow gliders near to the Dutch border and then release them , achieving a surprise attack as the Belgian defenders would not be able to detect them . Fifty DFS 230 transport gliders were supplied for use by the assault force , and then a period of intensive training began . A detailed study of the fort , the bridges and the local area was made , and a replica of the area was constructed for the airborne troops to train in . Joint exercises between the parachutists and the glider pilots were carried out in the early spring of 1940 , and a number of refinements made to the equipment and tactics to be used , such as barbed wire being added to the nose @-@ skids of the gliders to reduce their landing run , and the airborne troops trained with flamethrowers and specialized explosives , the latter of which were so secret that they were only used on fortifications in Germany and not on fortifications in Czechoslovakia similar to Fort Eben Emael . Secrecy was also maintained in a number of other ways . When exercises were completed gliders and equipment would be broken down and taken away in furniture vans , the sub @-@ units of the force were frequently renamed and moved from one location to another , unit badges and insignia were removed , and the airborne troops were not permitted to leave their barracks or to take leave . 
 Hauptmann Koch divided his force into four assault groups . Group Granite , under Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig , composed of eighty @-@ five men in eleven gliders whose task would be to assault and capture Fort Eben Emael ; Group Steel , commanded by Oberleutnant Gustav Altmann , and formed of ninety @-@ two men and nine gliders , would capture the Veldwezelt bridge ; Group Concrete , commanded by Leutnant Gerhard Schacht and composed of ninety @-@ six men in eleven gliders , would capture the Vroenhoven bridge ; and Group Iron , under Leutnant Martin <unk> , composed of ninety men in ten gliders , who would capture the Kanne bridge . The crucial element for the assault force , and particularly Group Granite , was time . It was believed that the combination of a <unk> approach by the gliders used by the assault force , and the lack of a declaration of war by the German government , would give the attackers the element of surprise . However , German estimates were that this would last , at the most , for sixty minutes , after which the superior numbers of the Belgian forces defending the fort and the bridges , as well as any reinforcements sent to the area , would begin to come to bear against the relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops . The German plan , therefore , was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti @-@ aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible , and at all costs to put out of action the long @-@ range artillery pieces which covered the three bridges . The destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes ; within this time the airborne troops would have to break out of their gliders , cover the distance to the guns , fix the explosive charges to the barrels of the guns and detonate them , all while under enemy fire . 
 The finalized plan for the assault called for between nine and eleven gliders to land on the western bank of the Albert Canal by each of the three bridges just prior to 05 : 30 on 10 May , the time scheduled for Fall Gelb to begin . The groups assigned to assault the three bridges would overwhelm the defending Belgian troops , remove any demolition charges and then prepare to defend the bridges against an expected counter @-@ attack . Forty minutes later , three Ju @-@ 52 transport aircraft would fly over each position , dropping a further twenty @-@ four airborne troops as reinforcements as well as machine @-@ guns and significant amounts of ammunition . Simultaneously , the force assigned to assault Fort Eben @-@ Emael was to land on top of the Fort in eleven gliders , eliminate any defenders attempting to repel them , cripple what artillery they could with explosive charges , and then prevent the Garrison from dislodging them . Having achieved their initial objectives of seizing the bridges and eliminate the long @-@ range artillery pieces possessed by the Fort , the airborne troops would then defend their positions until the arrival of German ground forces . 
 = = Battle = = 
 For reasons of security , Sturmabteilung Koch was dispersed around several locations in the Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben @-@ Emael and the three bridges to begin . Preliminary orders were received on 9 May , ordering the separated detachments to move to a pre @-@ arranged concentration area , and shortly afterwards a second order arrived , informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05 : 25 on 10 May . At 04 : 30 , forty @-@ two gliders carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne , the armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives . The aircraft maintained strict radio silence , forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium ; the radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow @-@ ropes on one of the gliders had snapped , forcing the glider to land inside Germany . Another pilot of a second glider released his tow @-@ rope prematurely , and was unable to land near its objective . Both gliders were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and were destined to assault Fort Eben @-@ Emael , thereby leaving the group understrength ; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig 's second @-@ in @-@ command , as Witzig was in one of the gliders forced to land . The remaining gliders were released from their tow @-@ ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) , which was deemed high enough for the gliders to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort , and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly . After the Ju @-@ 52 's released the gliders and began turning away , Belgian anti @-@ aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire . This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the gliders . 
 = = = Bridges = = = 
 All nine gliders carrying the troops assigned to Group Steel landed next to the bridge at Veldwezelt at 05 : 20 , the barbed @-@ wire wrapped around the landing skids of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt . The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed some distance from the bridge , and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox , which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small @-@ arms fire . The non @-@ commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst another of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it , allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle . Simultaneously , Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the canal bank and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison . Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge , though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders . The defenders held on until a platoon of reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village . However , the assaulting force could not overcome two field @-@ guns located five hundred metres from the bridge by small @-@ arms fire , thus forcing Altmann to call for air support . Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns . Group Steel was to be relieved by 14 : 30 , but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21 : 30 . During the fighting , the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded . 
 Ten of the eleven gliders transporting Group Concrete landed next to the Vroenhoven bridge at 05 : 15 , the eleventh glider having been hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire en route to the bridge and being forced to land prematurely inside Dutch territory . The gliders were engaged by heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire as they landed , causing one of the gliders to stall in mid @-@ air . The resulting crash severely wounded three airborne troops . The rest of the gliders landed without damage . One of the gliders landed near to the fortification housing the bridge detonators . This allowed the airborne troops to rapidly assault the position . They killed the occupants and tore out the wires connecting the explosives to the detonator set , ensuring the bridge could not be destroyed . The remaining Belgian defenders resisted fiercely by mounting several counter @-@ attacks in an attempt to recapture the bridge . They were repelled with the aid of several machine @-@ guns dropped by parachute to the airborne troops at 06 : 15 . Constant Belgian attacks meant that Group Concrete were not withdrawn and relieved by an infantry battalion until 21 : 40 . They suffered losses of seven dead and twenty @-@ four wounded . 
 All but one of the ten gliders carrying the airborne troops assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to their objective , the bridge at Kanne . Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the gliders , one of the gliders was dropped in the wrong area . The other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire and released at 05 : 35 . As the gliders began to descend towards their objective , the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison . Unlike the garrisons of the other two bridges , the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned , as the German mechanized column heading for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule . Its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge . As the gliders came in to land , one was hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants . The remaining eight landed successfully , and the airborne troops stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders . 
 By 05 : 50 the airborne troops had secured the area as well as the nearby village of Kanne , but they were then subjected to a strong counter @-@ attack which was only repulsed with the aid of air support from Stuka divebombers . The defenders launched several more counter @-@ attacks during the night , ensuring that the airborne troops could not be relieved until the morning of 11 May . Group Iron suffered the heaviest casualties of all three assault groups assigned to capture the bridges with twenty @-@ two dead and twenty @-@ six wounded . One of the airborne troops assigned to the Group was taken prisoner by the Belgians . He was later freed by German forces at a British prisoner of war camp at Dunkirk . 
 = = = Fort Eben @-@ Emael = = = 
 The nine remaining gliders transporting the airborne troops assigned to Group Granite successfully landed on the roof of Fort Eben @-@ Emael , utilizing arrester @-@ parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt . The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements on the top of the Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges . In the southern part of the Fort , Objective No. 18 , an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge , which collapsed the casemate 's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself . Objective No. 12 , a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops , who then moved to Objective No. 26 , a turret holding another three 75mm weapons ; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off , this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers , who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it . Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola were disabled , as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops . However , attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful ; the objective , twin turrets with heavy @-@ calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola , was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own , forcing troops from two gliders to be used . Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated , but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them , and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels . 
 In the northern section of the fort , similar actions were taking place , as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces . Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine @-@ guns whose arcs of fire covered the western side of the Fort ; to destroy the casemate , the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat , and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it . Another observation cupola fitted with machine @-@ guns , Objective No. 19 , was destroyed , but two further objectives , Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations . Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23 , a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces . It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault , but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire , forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover . The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned , and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola . Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola , the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it throughout the rest of the fighting . Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort , giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter @-@ attack . The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges , but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled . A number of these included anti @-@ aircraft weapons and machine @-@ guns . 
 As these secondary objectives were attacked , a single glider landed on top of the Fort , from which emerged Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig . After his glider had unintentionally landed in German territory , he had radioed for another tug , and it landed in the field with a replacement glider . Once the airborne troops had broken down fences and hedges obstructing the aircraft , they boarded the new glider and were towed through anti @-@ aircraft fire to the fort . Having achieved their primary objectives of disabling the artillery pieces possessed by the fort , the airborne troops then held it against Belgian counter @-@ attacks , which began almost immediately . These counter @-@ attacks were made by Belgian infantry formations without artillery support and were uncoordinated . This allowed the airborne troops to repel them with machine @-@ gun fire . Artillery from several smaller Forts nearby and Belgian field artillery units also targeted the airborne troops , but this too was uncoordinated and achieved nothing and often aided the airborne troops in repelling counter @-@ attacks by Belgian infantry units . Patrols were also used to ensure that the garrison stayed in the interior of the fort and did not attempt to emerge and mount an attempt to retake the fort . Any attempt by the garrison to launch a counter @-@ attack would have been stymied by the fact that the only possible route for such an attack was up a single , spiral staircase , and any embrasures looking out onto the Fort had either been captured or disabled . The plan for the assault had called for Group Granite to be relieved by 51st Engineer Battalion within a few hours of seizing the Fort , but the Group was not actually relieved until 7 : 00 on 11 May . Heavy Belgian resistance , as well as several demolished bridges over the River Meuse , had forced the battalion to lay down new bridges , delaying it significantly . Once the airborne troops had been relieved , the battalion , in conjunction with an infantry regiment that arrived shortly after the engineers , mounted an attack on the main entrance to the fort . Faced with this attack , the garrison surrendered at 12 : 30 , suffering sixty men killed and forty wounded . The Germans took more than a thousand Belgian soldiers into captivity . Group Granite suffered six killed and nineteen wounded .

 The airborne assault on the three bridges and Fort Eben @-@ Emael had been an overall success for the Fallschirmjäger of Sturmabteilung Koch ; the artillery pieces possessed by Fort Eben @-@ Emael had been disabled , and two of the three bridges designated to be captured by the sub @-@ units of Sturmabteilung Koch had been captured before they could be destroyed . The capture of the bridges , and the neutralization of the artillery pieces in the Fort allowed infantry and armour from the 18th Army to bypass other Belgian defences and enter the heart of Belgium . In a post @-@ war publication , General Kurt Student wrote of the operation , and the efforts of Group Granite in particular , that " It was a deed of exemplary daring and decisive significance [ ... ] I have studied the history of the last war and the battles on all fronts . But I have not been able to find anything among the host of brilliant actions — undertaken by friend or foe — that could be said to compare with the success achieved by Koch 's Assault Group . " A number of officers and non @-@ commissioned officers were awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for their participation in the operation , including Lieutenant Rudolf Witzig who led the assault on Fort Eben @-@ Emael in the absence of Koch . Sturmabteilung Koch was expanded after the end of Fall Gelb to become 1st Battalion of the newly formed 1st Airlanding Assault Regiment , which itself consisted of four battalions of Fallschirmjaeger trained as a <unk> assault force . Hauptmann Koch was promoted to the rank of Major for his part in the operation and assumed command of the 1st Battalion . Due to the destroyed bridges , the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion built a new bridge over the canal on 15 September 1944 .

 The Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) is the largest charity that saves lives at sea around the coasts of the UK , Ireland , the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as on some inland waterways . There are numerous other lifeboat services operating in the same area . 
 Founded in 1824 as the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck , the RNLI was granted Royal Charter in 1860 and is a charity in the UK and Republic of Ireland . Queen Elizabeth II is Patron . The RNLI is principally funded by legacies and donations with most lifeboat crew members being unpaid volunteers . 
 The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and operates 444 lifeboats . Crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015 . RNLI Lifeguards operate on more than 200 beaches . They are paid by local authorities , while the RNLI provides equipment and training . The Institution operates Flood Rescue Teams ( <unk> ) nationally and internationally ( <unk> ) , the latter prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice .

 Sir William Hillary came to live on the Isle of Man in 1808 . Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea , with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast , he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews . Initially he received little response from the Admiralty . However , on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society , the plans were adopted and , with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert , the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824 . At the age of 60 , Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of the packet St George , which had foundered on <unk> Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour . He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew , yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life . It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on <unk> Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour . In 1854 the institution 's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution ) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William . 
 In its first year the RNLI raised £ 10 @,@ 000 , however by 1849 , income had dropped to £ 354 . Finding itself in financial difficulties , the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £ 2 @,@ 000 , which rose in subsequent years . This lasted until 1869 , when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies ; in addition , the government 's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service . It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £ 10 @,@ 000 . The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year .

 During World War I , lifeboat crews launched 1 @,@ 808 times , rescuing 5 @,@ 332 people . With many younger men on active service , the average age of a lifeboatman was over 50 . Many launches were to ships that had been torpedoed or struck mines , including naval or merchant vessels on war duty ; a notable example was the hospital ship SS Rohilla which foundered in 1914 and was attended by six lifeboats , saving 144 lives over a 50 @-@ hour rescue mission . 
 World War II placed considerable extra demands on the RNLI , particularly in south and east England where the threat of invasion and enemy activity was ever @-@ present , rescuing downed aircrew a frequent occurrence , and the constant danger of mines . During the war 6 @,@ 376 lives were saved . 
 = = = = Dunkirk evacuation = = = = 
 Nineteen RNLI lifeboats sailed to Dunkirk between 27 May and 4 June 1940 to assist with the Dunkirk evacuation . Lifeboats from Ramsgate and Margate went directly to France with their own crews . The crew of Ramsgate 's Prudential ( now <unk> ) ( ON 697 ) collected 2 @,@ 800 troops . Margate 's Coxswain , Edward Parker , was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his work taking the RNLB Lord Southborough ( ON 688 ) to the beaches . Of the other lifeboats and crews summoned to Dover by the Admiralty , the first arrivals questioned – reasonably in their view – the details of the service , in particular the impracticality of running heavy lifeboats on to the beach , loading them with soldiers , then floating them off . The dispute resulted in the first three crews being sent home . Subsequent lifeboats arriving were commandeered without discussion , much to the disappointment of many lifeboatmen . A later RNLI investigation resulted in the dismissal of two of Hythe crew members , who were nevertheless vindicated in one aspect of their criticism , as Hythe 's Viscountess Wakefield was run on to the beach and unable to be refloated ; she was the only lifeboat to be lost in the operation . Some RNLI crew members stayed in Dover for the emergency to provide repair and refuelling facilities , and after the end of the evacuation most lifeboats returned to their stations with varying levels of damage and continued their lifesaving services .

 The biggest rescue in the RNLI 's history was on 17 March 1907 , when the 12 @,@ 000 tonne liner SS Suevic hit the <unk> Reef near Lizard Point in Cornwall . In a strong gale and dense fog , RNLI lifeboat volunteers rescued 456 passengers , including 70 babies . Crews from The Lizard , Cadgwith , Coverack and Porthleven rowed out repeatedly for 16 hours to rescue all of the people on board . Six silver RNLI medals were later awarded , two to Suevic crew members .

 More than 2 @,@ 500 medals have been awarded for bravery : Gold ( 150 ) , Silver ( 1 @,@ 564 ) and Bronze ( 793 ) . Bronze medals were awarded from 1917 . The obverse of the gold medal carries the motto : " Let not the deep swallow me up " , from Psalm 69 . The Thanks of the Institution Inscribed on Vellum or a framed Letter of Appreciation may be given for other notable acts , such as those awarded to crews of Aberystwyth Lifeboat Station . The Ralph <unk> Award is a monetary award made for the most meritorious service in each year and was inaugurated in 1968 . The Walter and Elizabeth Groombridge Award is given annually for the most outstanding service by an Atlantic 21 ( and successors ) lifeboat crew . Established in 1986 as the Walter Groombridge Award in memory of Brighton Lifeboat Station 's Administration Officer it was renamed in memory of his wife who died in 1989 . 
 The most decorated lifeboatman was Henry Blogg , coxswain of Cromer for 37 years , with three gold medals and four silver . He also received the George Cross and the British Empire Medal and is known as " The Greatest of all <unk> " . The youngest recipient was Frederick Carter ( 11 ) who with Frank Perry ( 16 ) was awarded a Silver Medal for a rescue at Weymouth in 1890 . Other notable lifeboatmen include Henry Freeman of Whitby , coxswain for 22 years , Robert William Hook ( 1828 – 1911 ) , coxswain at Lowestoft from 1853 to 1883 and credited with saving over 600 lives plus two dogs and a cat , Henry " Shrimp " Davies , coxswain of the Cromer Lifeboat with 45 years service and James Haylett , coxswain of Caister @-@ on @-@ Sea . One lifeboat has received an award . For the Daunt lightship rescue in 1936 , the RNLB Mary Stanford and her entire crew were decorated ( see illustration in history section , above ) .

 The RNLI maintains or encourages a number of entities in respect of the history and activity of the Institution along with preserved lifeboats , including : 
 Historic Lifeboat Collection in Chatham Historic Dockyard with 17 historic vessels . 
 The Grace Darling Museum , opened 1938 at Bamburgh , commemorating her rescue of the SS Forfarshire . The museum is run by the RNLI . 
 The Henry Blogg Museum illustrates the history of Cromer 's lifeboats and tells the story of Henry Blogg 's most famous rescues .

 Throughout Great Britain and Ireland , ships in distress , or the public reporting an accident , contact the emergency services by telephone or radio . Calls are redirected to HM Coastguard or the Irish Coast Guard as appropriate , who will coordinate air @-@ sea rescue operations and may call on the RNLI ( or independent lifeboats ) , their own land @-@ based rescue personnel and rescue helicopters to help . 
 = = = Lifeboat stations = = = 
 There are 237 RNLI lifeboat stations around the coasts of Great Britain , Ireland , the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands . Tower Lifeboat Station on the River Thames in London is the RNLI 's busiest , in 2013 rescuing 372 people and saving 25 lives . In 2015 Tower 's launches had increased to 465 . Five new lifeboat station buildings were completed in 2013 . 
 For public access the RNLI classifies stations as one of three types : Explore , which are normally open all year round and have a shop , Discover , normally open during the summer months and Observe which , because of their location , still welcome visitors but may not be easily accessible . 
 From time to time the RNLI may close a station ; some of these are later reopened by independent services . The history of some former lifeboat stations can be found in Wikipedia articles on the places where those stations were . ( See also : List of Lifeboat Disasters in the British Isles for further information on closed stations . ) 
 = = = Rescue craft = = = 
 The RNLI operates 444 lifeboats ( 332 on station , 112 in the relief fleet ) . The ship prefix for all RNLI lifeboats from the D @-@ class to the Tamar @-@ class is RNLB ( Royal National Lifeboat ) . 
 All @-@ weather lifeboats ( ALBs ) are large boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck , which are self @-@ righting and can go out in all weather conditions . Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y @-@ class lifeboat or Y @-@ boat for inshore work , launched by mechanical arm . There are six classes of ALB motor life boats , with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots . The RNLI 's aim is to provide a 25 @-@ knot lifeboat to every all @-@ weather crew , and has begun construction of an All @-@ weather Lifeboat Centre ( ALC ) in Poole which , when complete , will save £ 3 million a year . The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019 , when six Shannon @-@ class lifeboats a year will be built . 
 Inshore lifeboats ( <unk> ) are smaller boats that operate closer to the shore and in shallower waters than ALBs . There are two classes , inflatables and <unk> capable of 25 – 40 knots . The RNLI 's Inshore Lifeboat Centre at Cowes , Isle of Wight , has been building lifeboats since the 1960s and by 2015 had produced over 1 @,@ 600 . 
 Hovercraft were introduced in 2002 , allowing rescue on mud flats and in river estuaries inaccessible to conventional boats . 
 = = = Personnel and equipment = = = 
 Lifeboat crews are almost entirely volunteers , numbering 4 @,@ 600 , including over 300 women , and are alerted by pager . They are supported by 3 @,@ 000 volunteer shore crew and station management . <unk> have evolved from cork , kapok and synthetic foam to today 's light and non @-@ cumbersome designs . ALB and ILB crews wear different styles of lifejacket . 
 RNLI lifeguards are placed on more than 200 beaches around England , Wales , Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands , and aided almost 20 @,@ 000 people in 2014 . RNLI lifeguards are paid by the appropriate town or city council , while the RNLI provides their equipment and training . 
 The Institution has operated a Flood Rescue Team since the 2000 Mozambique floods , with six strategically placed teams each with two boats , support transport and equipment . The RNLI 's international Flood Rescue Team ( <unk> ) is composed of volunteer lifeboat crew with a range of additional skills prepared to travel to emergencies overseas at short notice . They have trained alongside other teams for the common purpose in the USA . 
 = = = = Women in the RNLI = = = = 
 In the early days of the service , lifeboat launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women . There were deeply @-@ held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck . Along all parts part of the coastline , women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came . While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male ( 92 % ) , the first female ( inshore ) crew member was Elizabeth <unk> in 1969 , and Frances <unk> was the first woman crew member on an all @-@ weather lifeboat , at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station , in 1981 . Lauren McGuire , at the age of 27 , became the RNLI 's youngest station manager in 2011 , at Clovelly , Devon . 
 = = = = Voluntary support = = = = 
 Apart from lifeboat crew and lifeguards , the Institution provides a variety of volunteering opportunities . One of these is as " <unk> " where signed @-@ up volunteers are notified by email or mobile phone when there is a local need , such as marshalling at fundraising events , helping with collections or in an RNLI shop . Voluntary internships in RNLI offices are available three times a year . 
 = = = Safety advice = = = 
 In addition to safety advice given in its publications , the RNLI offers safety advice to boat and beach users when the opportunity arises , and to at @-@ risk groups such as anglers , divers and kayakers . The Institution runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people , particularly in inner @-@ city areas ; more than 6 @,@ 000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety , and over 800 children a week receive training . 500 children were taught to swim in 2014 . In an effort to reduce the estimated 400 @,@ 000 drownings a year worldwide , more than half of them children , the RNLI extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas , in some cases providing training at the Lifeboat College . 
 = = Infrastructure = = 
 The Institution is split into six administrative divisions : East ( East Anglia and South East England ) , South ( South West England ) , West ( Wales and the Isle of Man ) , North ( East and west coasts of northern England ) , Scotland and Ireland ( Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland ) . The headquarters of the RNLI are in Poole , Dorset , adjacent to Holes Bay in Poole Harbour . It includes RNLI HQ , lifeboat maintenance and repair facilities , the Lifeboat Support Centre and RNLI College ( the training centre ) . The support centre and college were opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 2004 . Specialist training facilities include a wave and capsize pool , a fire simulator , a ship 's bridge simulator and an engineering workshop . The College 's accommodation is available for RNLI members and their guests when training is not taking place and offers facilities for weddings , conferences and other events . About half of the RNLI 's staff work at Poole . Other locations are Dublin , London , Perth , Saltash , St Asaph and Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees , while some roles are at lifeboat stations or home @-@ based and include operations , estate and financial management , public relations and information technology . A new headquarters for RNLI Ireland was opened at <unk> in Swords , County Dublin in June 2006 by President Mary McAleese , attended by the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the RNLI , Admiral Sir Jock Slater , R.N. 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 The RNLI is principally funded by legacies ( 65 % ) and voluntary donations ( 28 % ) , with the remainder from merchandising and investment . In 2014 , the RNLI 's income was £ 182 million , while its expenditure was £ 149 @.@ 6 million . The Institution encourages corporate partnerships , which included in 2014 Waitrose , Yamaha and Fred . Olsen Cruise Lines . 
 There are 1 @,@ 100 RNLI fundraising branches throughout the regions served by the Institution , many far from the sea , which may support a particular station , or a project such as a new lifeboat . The Institution estimated their volunteer network at 31 @,@ 500 in 2014 . The largest regular contributor is The Communications and Public Service Lifeboat Fund ( known simply as ' The Lifeboat Fund ' ) established in 1886 for civil servants to support the RNLI collectively ; the Fund has provided the Institution with 52 lifeboats as well as other support . 
 The ubiquitous lifeboat collection boxes seen nationwide are popular enough to have even become the target for thieves . A fixed , cast iron collection box in Porthgwarra , Cornwall , is Grade II listed . The Institution 's annual fundraising day ( " SOS Day " ) is at the end of January , but many lifeboat stations hold open days during the summer , hosting displays , stalls and other events , as well as in @-@ station shops which are open full or part @-@ time . 
 Nationally and internationally known celebrities in various fields are , or have been supporters and fundraisers for the RNLI ; for example , the cartoonist Giles was a Life President of the RNLI and donated many cartoons which are still being used for RNLI charity cards and other illustrations , and Ross Brawn , the former Formula 1 team boss , in 2012 raised funds through a business challenge , for a new lifeboat for Chiswick Lifeboat Station on the River Thames in London . Other names include Bear Grylls , Dee <unk> , Chris <unk> , Ben Fogle , Daniel Craig , Rupert Grint , and Rebecca Newman , whose Coast to Coast tour in 2012 earned her an Outstanding Achievement Award .

 = = Criticism = = 
 = = = Salvage = = = 
 There have been a few isolated cases where RNLI crew members ( not the RNLI ) have claimed salvage leading to a not uncommon misconception that the RNLI is partly funded by this practice . There is no legal reason why crew members of the RNLI could not salvage a vessel and indeed frequently tow small vessels to safety , often long distances . The RNLI however does not support or encourage salvage because , firstly , they exist to save lives at sea and , secondly , to become involved in salvage might discourage those whose lives are at risk from calling for help . The RNLI 's Sea Safety Guidelines state : " There is no ' salvage ' fee when you are towed by a lifeboat , but a voluntary contribution to the RNLI is always very welcome ! " . This stance was reinforced when the RNLI was criticised for not launching a lifeboat to an unmanned fishing vessel that had run aground . A spokesman for the RNLI stated : " We are not a salvage firm and our charity 's aim is to provide immediate assistance for people in trouble at sea and lives are at risk . " 
 = 1945 Japan – Washington flight = 
 The 1945 Japan – Washington flight was a record @-@ breaking air voyage made by three specially modified Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortresses on September 18 – 19 , 1945 , from the northern Japanese island of Hokkaidō to Chicago in the Midwestern United States , continuing to Washington , D.C. The flight was made by three United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) generals and other airmen returning to the United States from their overseas duty after World War II . At that date , it involved the heaviest load carried by an American aircraft ( 144 @,@ 000 lb , 65 @,@ 300 kg ) , the longest nonstop flight made by the USAAF ( 5 @,@ 840 mi , 9 @,@ 400 km ) , and the first nonstop flight from Japan to the United States made with a complete aircraft . However the flight did not break the then @-@ world distance record established by the Royal Air Force in 1938 . 
 Originally intending to fly 6 @,@ 500 miles ( 10 @,@ 460 km ) nonstop to Washington , D.C. , the airmen encountered unexpected headwinds over Alaska Territory and Canada , and they predicted that two of the aircraft would not have enough fuel to take them the full distance . All three B @-@ 29s landed in Chicago instead , refueled , and continued to Washington , where each crewman was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross , including the three pilots : Generals Barney M. Giles , Emmett O 'Donnell , Jr. and Curtis LeMay . 
 The USAAF distance record did not last long : two months later , another American aircrew flew a B @-@ 29 from Guam to Washington , D.C. a distance of 7 @,@ 916 miles ( 12 @,@ 740 km ) , breaking the world record . Nevertheless , the Japan to Washington flight pioneered a route similar to that used by later airliners . Importantly for the airmen , America was able to demonstrate the reach of airpower in light of the nascent Cold War . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Three B @-@ 29s based on Guam , which had spotless mission records and no mechanical difficulties , were selected for the mission . In a ten @-@ day process that continued as a typhoon raged off Okinawa , the aircraft were stripped of unnecessary equipment such as armor and gun turrets , and the resulting empty spaces in the fuselage were faired over with smooth metal to minimize parasitic drag . Blister @-@ type bubble windows were replaced with flat ones , painted group markings were removed , and the aluminum aircraft skin polished to a high luster , all in order to achieve the least possible drag . Twentieth Air Force markings were painted on each vertical rudder . The bomb bay in each aircraft was fitted with five 600 @-@ gallon ( 2 @,@ 300 L ) fuel tanks ; added to the normal B @-@ 29 fuel tanks , this made a total of 10 @,@ 000 gallons ( 38 @,@ 000 L ) of fuel capacity , as much as a railroad tank car . Filled with fuel and 12 men , each ship weighed 144 @,@ 000 pounds ( 65 @,@ 300 kg ) — it would be the greatest overload attempted on a B @-@ 29 at that time . 
 When the aircraft were ready , they flew to Iwo Jima and stopped for the night . There they were loaded with as much fuel as they could hold . It was known that the intended air base in Hokkaidō did not have enough avgas to fill all three B @-@ 29s for the long @-@ distance flight , meaning that at Hokkaidō they could only top off the fuel tanks to make up for the amount used to fly from Iwo Jima . On September 15 , the three aircraft left Iwo Jima , flying north past Okinawa , where the typhoon had blown itself out . They continued to Hokkaidō where the approach involved some apprehension . The Japanese air base had been judged by Colonel William " Butch " Blanchard as suitable for B @-@ 29s , with a runway that was long enough and was near sea level for maximum lift in the densest possible air , but it was not known whether it could hold such heavily laden bombers without the concrete cracking . LeMay sent Douglas C @-@ 54 Skymasters filled with 55 @-@ gallon ( 210 L ) drums of avgas to Sapporo — the crewmen would have to top off their tanks by hand . 
 The Japanese air base that would serve as the launching point was called Mizutani at Chitose locally , and Sapporo Air Base by the Americans . Today it is the Japan Ground Self @-@ Defense Force Camp Higashi @-@ Chitose . It was built at the southern part of Japan 's northern island Hokkaidō , near the city of Sapporo , as the base for long @-@ range flights to attack the U.S. — one @-@ way suicide trips made by four @-@ engine bombers — a function that it never served . The three B @-@ 29s landed safely , and LeMay stepped from his aircraft to be greeted by approximately 30 Japanese soldiers and the base commander , who saluted for some time before realizing that LeMay had no intention of returning the salute . With that treatment setting the tone for U.S. – Japan relations in the area , the airmen made certain to wear side arms as they walked around downtown Sapporo on the evenings of September 16 and 17 . LeMay later said that the 3 @,@ 000 Japanese sailors manning the air base were " polite " and posed no threat . 
 = = Aircraft and men = = 
 The commander of the first aircraft was Lieutenant General Barney M. Giles , Deputy Commander of the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific . His aircraft carried the only weather officer making the long @-@ distance voyage . One of the crewmen was Captain Kermit Beahan , bombardier aboard Bockscar . Others included Lieutenant Bill Dolan , who served as one of the pilots . 
 The second aircraft 's commander was Major General Curtis LeMay , Chief of Staff of the Strategic Air Forces . First Lieutenant J. Ivan Potts served as one of the pilots , as did Lieutenant Colonel William C. Kingsbury — the two had been a flight team in the 25th Bombardment Squadron ( Very Heavy ) of the 58th Bombardment Wing , Very Heavy , based on Tinian , and were good friends . Colonel William H. Blanchard , Chief of Staff of the Twentieth Air Force , joined the crew at Guam after personally inspecting Sapporo Air Base a few days earlier . Others on the crew from the 25th BS included Sergeant Jerome A. School , Sergeant Richard P. Fischer and Sergeant B. T. Freeman , the latter two removed at Guam when LeMay and Blanchard joined . Two men were from the 44th Bomber Squadron : First Lieutenant John C. Eiland and Staff Sergeant Frank Klas Jr . The remainder of the crew was Flight Engineer Captain William W. Townes ( 45th Bomber Squadron ) , First Lieutenant Stephen T. Jones ( 24th Bomber Squadron ) , Major John F. Wedding ( 468th Bomb Group ) and Captain Theodore R. Finder ( 40th Bomb Group Headquarters ) . The crew chief was Master Sergeant Henry J. <unk> . 
 Number 2 was construction number 44 @-@ <unk> , a B @-@ 29 @-@ 75 built five months earlier in Wichita , Kansas , as part of the so @-@ called Battle of Kansas — the push to produce great air fleets of B @-@ 29s . Number 2 , dubbed Marianna Belle by its combat crew , made the cut because it did not consume more than the normal amount of fuel and oil in carrying out its missions , which were marked by top mechanical reliability . 
 Number 3 was commanded by Brigadier General Emmett O 'Donnell , Jr. who was ending his service as commander of the <unk> Bombardment Wing , Very Heavy . 
 = = Flight = = 
 The airmen drew up a " great circle " ( shortest distance on the surface of a globe ) flight plan that used the jet stream as a tailwind to help them get farther with less fuel , though the tailwind was not absolutely required . The plan was for each aircraft to make its own way over the Kamchatka Peninsula at the eastern edge of the Soviet Union , then over the Bering Sea to Nome , Alaska , and continue over Fairbanks , over the Canadian Rockies and much of Canada , over the Great Lakes , then on to Washington , D.C. near the Atlantic coast — a total of 6 @,@ 762 miles ( 10 @,@ 882 km ) taking 26 hours in the air . This distance would not have broken the world 's distance record then held by two Royal Air Force Vickers Wellesley aircraft that had flown from Ismaïlia , Egypt , to Darwin , Australia , in 1938 , covering 7 @,@ 162 miles ( 11 @,@ 526 km ) , but it was considered a good public relations stunt , good for the USAAF and the generals ' images . 
 On September 18 , the airmen woke up very early to make final preparations . A weather observation aircraft took off an hour before the first B @-@ 29 to report the latest meteorological conditions along the path ahead . Dumbo and Super Dumbo aircraft ( B @-@ 17s and B @-@ 29s rigged for air @-@ sea rescue ) stood by , on alert . With the airfield lit by truck headlamps , Number 1 commanded by Giles was first to take off , a little after 6 : 00 local time , as dawn began to glow in the east . Next , LeMay 's ship took off at 6 : 15 am , 4 : 15 pm Eastern War Time in Washington , with Lieutenant Colonel Kingsbury at the throttles and First Lieutenant Potts at the controls . O 'Donnell 's Number 3 took off a few minutes later . The heavily loaded machines required every bit of the 8 @,@ 200 @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 500 m ) concrete runway to get airborne — and some of the gravel beyond — reaching 142 miles per hour ( 229 km / h ) before lifting from the ground . All three bombers were expected to be in Washington by 5 pm the next day . 
 Two or three hours into the flight , the weather officer aboard Giles ' Number 1 observed slight headwinds . Giles " threatened to throw him overboard unless he did something about it . " Five hours out of Japan , the airmen in Number 2 were over Kamchatka when they were met by three Bell P @-@ 63 <unk> fighters wearing the red star insignia of the Soviet Air Force . The Soviet fighter pilots inspected the unarmed B @-@ 29 at close range and then performed aerobatic maneuvers for the Americans . The three dipped their wings in salute and left the Superfortress to continue its journey . After Kamchatka , LeMay and Blanchard replaced Kingsbury and Potts at the controls . 
 Over the Bering Sea , the three B @-@ 29s maintained radio contact with each other , communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently . Near the Arctic Circle , the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly , and the fliers ignored them , relying instead on the radio compass . In Number 2 , the radio compass stopped working as well , but it resumed working later in the flight . 
 Wearing fur @-@ lined flight suits did not prevent the men from feeling the extreme cold of high altitude . Pilots rotated duty so that none would get too tired . Weather continued to be a great concern , and was frequently checked . The aircraft left the Bering Sea behind , encountering North America at Nome after about 13 hours of flight . From Nome to Fairbanks , the Northern Lights were clearly visible to the crews . Even though the B @-@ 29 pressurization systems were working , the outside air temperature of − 25 ° F ( − 32 ° C ) at an altitude of about 21 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) was not counteracted by the heating systems " which seemed to have completely broken down . " 
 = = = Weather problems = = = 
 At Fairbanks , the three B @-@ 29s encountered significant headwinds ; more than the " slight " headwinds observed up to this time . They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream , yet could complete the distance without them , but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far . At 7 am Eastern War Time , aircraft Number 2 was over Northway , Alaska , and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule . He said later , " When I reported that fact to General LeMay , he looked at me as if he thought it was my fault , so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures . " Later , the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream . 
 Seventeen hours after lifting off at sunrise in Japan , the men began to see the sun rise again over the Yukon — it was a very short day for them , and none had been able to sleep for the excitement of the trip , the stimulant <unk> , and the penetrating cold . Crossing into Canada , the headwinds grew stronger still , and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings . Though the B @-@ 29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment , such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed . The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes . 
 Near Regina , Saskatchewan , the fliers made their first decision regarding early stops for fuel . One proposed solution was for Giles to land in Minneapolis , O 'Donnell to land in Detroit , and LeMay ( who had enough fuel ) to continue as before to Washington . Giles radioed this plan to the War Department : " Have been bucking headwinds for past nine hours . Predicted plans for Fairbanks to States did not materialize . Giles and O 'Donnell plan to land at Minneapolis and Detroit due to fuel . Plane Number Two , commanded by LeMay , believes he is able to get to Washington . " However , soon after this , Giles determined that Chicago Municipal Airport was the only airport large enough to accommodate the B @-@ 29s ; he directed O 'Donnell to land there with him . LeMay sent word by radio to the War Department that he was heading for Washington . In New York , newspapers put this plan in headlines : " Two B @-@ 29s will land to refuel as third roars on to Capitol " . 
 All three aircraft approached Chicago , and LeMay contacted the War Department again by radio . O 'Donnell landed at 5 : 43 pm Eastern War Time , with Giles about 45 minutes behind . Just past Chicago LeMay was informed by the War Department that weather was " marginal " in Washington and that he was now ordered to refuel in Chicago . Giles landed at 6 : 30 and LeMay at 6 : 43 pm . LeMay 's elapsed flight time was 27 hours and 28 minutes . The straight @-@ line distance they had flown over the globe was about 5 @,@ 840 miles ( 9 @,@ 400 km ) . 
 While the aircraft were refueled , newspaper reporters asked questions of Giles and of Captain Kermit Beahan , who as bombardier aboard Bockscar , visually targeted Nagasaki in order to drop the second atomic bomb . The other crewmen drank coffee and waited . When refueling was completed , they took off directly for Washington . 
 = = Reception = = 
 From Chicago to Washington , D.C. the flight was uneventful . The " silvery sky giants , manned by their blue ribbon crews " flew over National Airport ( now Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport ) in formation at 9 : 30 pm and landed . The generals and crews stepped from their aircraft , LeMay waiting until he was smoking one of his signature cigars . Along with senior USAAF staff and reporters , wives and family were at the airport to greet the airmen , as well as a crowd of onlookers . Photographs were taken at the airport , then the airmen were whisked off to the Statler Hotel , now the Capital Hilton . In the lobby , the weary , grimy and stubble @-@ bearded men were besieged for autographs . Some of them stayed up later to hear supper @-@ club singer Hildegarde in the grand showroom , others went to bed to catch up on sleep . 
 The next morning , a news conference was held in the grand showroom . Giles emphasized the importance of the route as an indication of the future , both for civil and military aircraft . He warned : " Now that we have proved that we can do it , we must now remember that any future enemy will also be able to do it " . LeMay declared that he wanted a second chance to prove that the B @-@ 29 was capable of flying 6 @,@ 500 miles nonstop . He said , " When we took off at Hokkaido we had a little headwind and expected it . However , all our information indicated that once we passed Fairbanks it would drop . We didn 't need a tailwind . All we needed was a nice normal wind to arrive on schedule . The buffeting headwind averaged 70 mph " ( 110 km / h ) . After the reporters were finished , Giles presented all the airmen with the Distinguished Flying Cross . Giles told the men that each one could keep his personal military equipment as a memento of the flight , including parachutes . They were offered free rides home on military aircraft . Potts refused the parachute and the ride , telling Giles , " Thank you , general , I think I 'll take the train ! " 
 Other B @-@ 29 crewmen still in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II did not pay much attention to the record @-@ breaking flight . Harry <unk> of the 40th Bomb Group on Tinian said " most of us in the 40th knew little about the trip in September 1945 as we were busy preparing to fly our 45 B @-@ 29s home in October " . Two months later on November 19 – 20 , Colonel Clarence S. Irvine and Lieutenant Colonel G. R.

 = The Boat Race 1978 = 
 The 124th Boat Race between crews from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge took place on the River Thames on 25 March 1978 . Umpired by former Cambridge rower James Crowden , Oxford won in a time of 18 minutes and 58 seconds . The race was complicated by bad weather , and when faced with choppy water , a strong headwind and horizontal , driving rain , the Cambridge boat , which lacked splashboards , took on water and sank . It was the fifth time a boat had sunk during the event . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths . Cambridge won the 33rd Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge . First held in 1829 , the competition is a 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) race along the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and is followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1977 race by seven lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 68 victories to Oxford 's 54 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The 1978 race was sponsored by Ladbrokes , while the BBC had paid between £ 10 @,@ 000 and £ 20 @,@ 000 to televise the event . 
 During training for the race , Oxford had sunk , taking on water in the inclement weather , and had decided to fit splashboards to their boat , while Cambridge opted to leave their boat unchanged . Prior to this year 's event , there had been four sinkings in the history of the race . Cambridge sank in 1859 , Oxford sank in 1925 and 1951 , and both crews sank in 1912 . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

 Oxford 's crew contained three Old Blues in Moran , Shealy and Michelmore , while Cambridge 's boat featured five returning rowers in Bathurst , Clegg , Horton , Ross and Cooke @-@ Yarborough .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . After a false start , the race commenced at <unk> in reasonable weather conditions , and Oxford took a one @-@ length lead to Hammersmith Bridge in a record time of 6 minutes 24 seconds . As the crews turned into the Surrey bend , conditions drastically worsened with a strong headwind and " horizontal rain driving into them " . Entering choppy water and in an attempt to push past Oxford , Cambridge made their challenge at Barnes Bridge but began to take on water . Within seconds the boat started to sink ; the Oxford crew realised the contest was over and rowed carefully to the finish in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds . It was Oxford 's third victory in a row , and their fourth in the past five years . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie beat Oxford 's Isis by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths , and in the 33rd running of the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge also triumphed .

Cambridge 's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat : " we had taken to the water without fitting any [ splashboards ] – an act of monumental idiocy " . Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian " I was surprised when I heard that Cambridge had sunk . If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out . " 
 Cambridge 's sinking was featured as the 79th in Channel 4 's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments . 
 = Juniper berry = 
 A juniper berry is the female seed cone produced by the various species of junipers . It is not a true berry but a cone with unusually fleshy and merged scales , which give it a berry @-@ like appearance . The cones from a handful of species , especially Juniperus communis , are used as a spice , particularly in European cuisine , and also give gin its distinctive flavour . Juniper berries have been called the only spice derived from conifers , although tar and inner bark ( used as a sweetener in Apache cuisines ) from pine trees is sometimes considered a spice as well . 
 = = Species = = 
 All juniper species grow berries , but some are considered too bitter to eat . In addition to J. communis , other edible species include Juniperus drupacea , Juniperus phoenicea , Juniperus <unk> , and Juniperus californica . Some species , for example Juniperus sabina , are toxic and consumption is inadvisable . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Juniperus communis berries vary from four to twelve millimeters in diameter ; other species are mostly similar in size , though some are larger , notably J. drupacea ( 20 – 28 mm ) . Unlike the separated and woody scales of a typical pine cone , those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds . The berries are green when young , and mature to a purple @-@ black colour over about 18 months in most species , including J. communis ( shorter , 8 – 10 months in a few species , and about 24 months in J. drupacea ) . The mature , dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine , while gin is flavoured with fully grown but immature green berries . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The flavor profile of young , green berries is dominated by pinene ; as they mature this piney , resinous backdrop is joined by what Harold McGee describes as " green @-@ fresh " and citrus notes . The outer scales of the berries are relatively <unk> , so the berries are almost always at least lightly crushed before being used as a spice . They are used both fresh and dried , but their flavour and odour are at their strongest immediately after harvest and decline during drying and storage . 
 Juniper berries are used in northern European and particularly Scandinavian cuisine to " impart a sharp , clear flavor " to meat dishes , especially wild birds ( including thrush , blackbird , and woodcock ) and game meats ( including boar and venison ) . They also season pork , cabbage , and sauerkraut dishes . Traditional recipes for <unk> <unk> , an Alsatian dish of sauerkraut and meats , universally include juniper berries . Besides Norwegian and Swedish dishes , juniper berries are also sometimes used in German , Austrian , Czech , Polish and Hungarian cuisine , often with roasts ( such as German <unk> ) . Northern Italian cuisine , especially that of the South Tyrol , also incorporates juniper berries . 
 Juniper , typically Juniperus communis , is used to flavor gin , a liquor developed in the 17th century in the Netherlands . The name gin itself is derived from either the French <unk> or the Dutch <unk> , which both mean " juniper " . Other juniper @-@ flavoured beverages include the Finnish rye @-@ and @-@ juniper beer known as <unk> , which is flavored with both juniper berries and branches . The brand Dry Soda produces a juniper @-@ berry soda as part of its lineup . Recently , some American distilleries have begun using ' New World ' varieties of juniper such as Juniperus occidentalis . 
 Juniper berry was first intended as a medication since juniper berries are a diuretic and were also thought to be an appetite stimulant and a remedy for rheumatism and arthritis . Native Americans are reported to have used the juniper berry as an appetite suppressant in times of hunger . Juniper berry is being researched as a treatment for diet @-@ controlled diabetes , as it releases insulin from the pancreas , hence alleviating hunger . It is also said to have been used by some tribes as a female contraceptive . 
 A few North American juniper species produce a seed cone with a sweeter , less resinous flavor than those typically used as a spice . For example , one field guide describes the flesh of the berries of Juniperus californica as " dry , mealy , and fibrous but sweet and without resin cells " . Such species have been used not just as a seasoning but as a nutritive food by some Native Americans . In addition to medical and culinary purposes , Native Americans have also used the seeds inside juniper berries as beads for jewellery and decoration . 
 An essential oil extracted from juniper berries is used in aromatherapy and perfumery . The essential oil can be distilled out of berries which have already been used to flavour gin . 
 = = History = = 
 Juniper berries , including Juniperus phoenicea and Juniperus oxycedrus have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs at multiple sites . J. oxycedrus is not known to grow in Egypt , and neither is Juniperus excelsa , which was found along with J. oxycedrus in the tomb of Tutankhamun . The berries imported into Egypt may have come from Greece ; the Greeks record using juniper berries as a medicine long before mentioning their use in food . The Greeks used the berries in many of their Olympics events because of their belief that the berries increased physical stamina in athletes . The Romans used juniper berries as a cheap domestically produced substitute for the expensive black pepper and long pepper imported from India . It was also used as an adulterant , as reported in Pliny the Elder 's Natural History : " Pepper is adulterated with juniper berries , which have the property , to a marvellous degree , of assuming the pungency of pepper . " Pliny also incorrectly asserted that black pepper grew on trees that were " very similar in appearance to our junipers " . 
 = Parkinson 's disease = 
 Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is a long term disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system . The symptoms generally come on slowly over time . Early in the disease , the most obvious are shaking , rigidity , slowness of movement , and difficulty with walking . Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur . Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease . Depression and anxiety are also common occurring in more than a third of people with PD . Other symptoms include sensory , sleep , and emotional problems . The main motor symptoms are collectively called " parkinsonism " , or a " parkinsonian syndrome " . 
 The cause of Parkinson 's disease is generally unknown , but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors . Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themself . There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea . The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra , a region of the midbrain . This results in not enough dopamine in these areas . The reason for this cell death is poorly understood but involves the build @-@ up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons . Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms , with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases . 
 There is no cure for Parkinson 's disease . Initial treatments is typically with the <unk> medication levodopa , with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective . As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost , these medications become less effective while at the same time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements . Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms . Surgery to place the <unk> for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective . Evidence for treatments for the non @-@ movement @-@ related symptoms of PD , such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems , is less strong . 
 In 2013 PD was present in 53 million people and resulted in about 103 @,@ 000 deaths globally . Parkinson 's disease typically occurs in people over the age of 60 , of which about one percent are affected . Males are more often affected than females . When it is seen in people before the age of 40 or 50 , it is called young onset PD . The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years . The disease is named after the English doctor James Parkinson , who published the first detailed description in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy , in 1817 . Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson 's Day ( on the birthday of James Parkinson , 11 April ) and the use of a red tulip as the symbol of the disease . People with parkinsonism who have increased the public 's awareness of the condition include actor Michael J. Fox , Olympic cyclist Davis Phinney , and late professional boxer Muhammad Ali . 
 = = Classification = = 
 The term parkinsonism is used for a motor syndrome whose main symptoms are tremor at rest , stiffness , slowing of movement and postural instability . <unk> syndromes can be divided into four subtypes , according to their origin : 
 primary or idiopathic 
 secondary or acquired 
 hereditary parkinsonism , and 
 Parkinson plus syndromes or multiple system degeneration . 
 Parkinson 's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and is usually defined as " primary " parkinsonism , meaning parkinsonism with no external identifiable cause . In recent years several genes that are directly related to some cases of Parkinson 's disease have been discovered . As much as this conflicts with the definition of Parkinson 's disease as an idiopathic illness , genetic parkinsonism disorders with a similar clinical course to PD are generally included under the Parkinson 's disease label . The terms " familial Parkinson 's disease " and " sporadic Parkinson 's disease " can be used to differentiate genetic from truly idiopathic forms of the disease . 
 Usually classified as a movement disorder , PD also gives rise to several non @-@ motor types of symptoms such as sensory deficits , cognitive difficulties , and sleep problems . Parkinson plus diseases are primary <unk> which present additional features . They include multiple system atrophy , progressive <unk> palsy , <unk> degeneration , and dementia with Lewy bodies . 
 In terms of pathophysiology , PD is considered a <unk> due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha @-@ synuclein protein in the brain in the form of Lewy bodies , as opposed to other diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein in the form of neurofibrillary tangles . Nevertheless , there is clinical and pathological overlap between <unk> and <unk> . The most typical symptom of Alzheimer 's disease , dementia , occurs in advanced stages of PD , while it is common to find neurofibrillary tangles in brains affected by PD . 
 Dementia with Lewy bodies ( <unk> ) is another <unk> that has similarities with PD , and especially with the subset of PD cases with dementia . However , the relationship between PD and <unk> is complex and still has to be clarified . They may represent parts of a continuum or they may be separate diseases . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Parkinson 's disease affects movement , producing motor symptoms . Non @-@ motor symptoms , which include autonomic dysfunction , neuropsychiatric problems ( mood , cognition , behavior or thought alterations ) , and sensory and sleep difficulties , are also common . Some of these non @-@ motor symptoms are often present at the time of diagnosis and can precede motor symptoms . 
 = = = Motor = = = 
 Four motor symptoms are considered cardinal in PD : tremor , rigidity , slowness of movement , and postural instability . 
 Tremor is the most apparent and well @-@ known symptom . It is the most common ; though around 30 % of individuals with PD do not have tremor at disease onset , most develop it as the disease progresses . It is usually a rest tremor : maximal when the limb is at rest and disappearing with voluntary movement and sleep . It affects to a greater extent the most distal part of the limb and at onset typically appears in only a single arm or leg , becoming bilateral later . Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz ( cycles per second ) . A feature of tremor is pill @-@ rolling , the tendency of the index finger of the hand to get into contact with the thumb and perform together a circular movement . The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the earlier pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills . 
 <unk> ( slowness of movement ) is another characteristic feature of PD , and is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process , from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement . Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is hindered . <unk> is commonly a very disabling symptom in the early stages of the disease . Initial manifestations are problems when performing daily tasks which require fine motor control such as writing , sewing or getting dressed . Clinical evaluation is based on similar tasks such as alternating movements between both hands or both feet . <unk> is not equal for all movements or times . It is modified by the activity or emotional state of the subject , to the point that some people are barely able to walk yet can still ride a bicycle . Generally people with PD have less difficulty when some sort of external cue is provided . 
 <unk> is stiffness and resistance to limb movement caused by increased muscle tone , an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles . In parkinsonism the rigidity can be uniform ( lead @-@ pipe rigidity ) or <unk> ( cogwheel rigidity ) . The combination of tremor and increased tone is considered to be at the origin of cogwheel rigidity . <unk> may be associated with joint pain ; such pain being a frequent initial manifestation of the disease . In early stages of Parkinson 's disease , rigidity is often asymmetrical and it tends to affect the neck and shoulder muscles prior to the muscles of the face and extremities . With the progression of the disease , rigidity typically affects the whole body and reduces the ability to move . 
 Postural instability is typical in the late stages of the disease , leading to impaired balance and frequent falls , and secondarily to bone fractures . Instability is often absent in the initial stages , especially in younger people . Up to 40 % may experience falls and around 10 % may have falls weekly , with the number of falls being related to the severity of PD . 
 Other recognized motor signs and symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as <unk> ( rapid shuffling steps and a forward @-@ flexed posture when walking ) , speech and swallowing disturbances including voice disorders , mask @-@ like face expression or small handwriting , although the range of possible motor problems that can appear is large . 
 = = = Neuropsychiatric = = = 
 Parkinson 's disease can cause neuropsychiatric disturbances which can range from mild to severe . This includes disorders of speech , cognition , mood , behaviour , and thought . 
 Cognitive disturbances can occur in the early stages of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis , and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease . The most common cognitive deficit in affected individuals is executive dysfunction , which can include problems with planning , cognitive flexibility , abstract thinking , rule acquisition , initiating appropriate actions and inhibiting inappropriate actions , working memory , and selecting relevant sensory information . Fluctuations in attention , impaired perception and estimation of time , slowed cognitive processing speed are among other cognitive difficulties . Memory is affected , specifically in recalling learned information . Nevertheless , improvement appears when recall is aided by cues . Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease , seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines . 
 A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population . The prevalence of dementia increases with duration of the disease . Dementia is associated with a reduced quality of life in people with PD and their caregivers , increased mortality , and a higher probability of needing nursing home care . 
 Behavior and mood alterations are more common in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population , and are usually present in PD with dementia . The most frequent mood difficulties are depression , apathy and anxiety . Establishing the diagnosis of depression is complicated by symptoms that often occur in Parkinson 's including dementia , decreased facial expression , decreased movement , a state of indifference , and quiet speech . Impulse control behaviors such as medication overuse and craving , binge eating , hypersexuality , or pathological gambling can appear in PD and have been related to the medications used to manage the disease . Psychotic symptoms — hallucinations or delusions — occur in 4 % of people with PD , and it is assumed that the main precipitant of psychotic phenomena in Parkinson 's disease is dopaminergic excess secondary to treatment ; it therefore becomes more common with increasing age and levodopa intake . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 In addition to cognitive and motor symptoms , PD can impair other body functions . 
 Sleep problems are a feature of the disease and can be worsened by medications . Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness , disturbances in REM sleep , or insomnia . A systematic review shows that sleep attacks occur in 13 @.@ 0 % of patients with Parkinson 's disease on dopaminergic medications . 
 Alterations in the autonomic nervous system can lead to orthostatic hypotension ( low blood pressure upon standing ) , oily skin and excessive sweating , urinary incontinence and altered sexual function . <unk> and gastric <unk> can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health . PD is related to several eye and vision abnormalities such as decreased blink rate , dry eyes , deficient ocular pursuit ( eye tracking ) and <unk> movements ( fast automatic movements of both eyes in the same direction ) , difficulties in directing gaze upward , and blurred or double vision . Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell , sensation of pain and paresthesia ( skin tingling and numbness ) . All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Parkinson 's disease in most people is idiopathic ( having no specific known cause ) . However , a small proportion of cases can be attributed to known genetic factors . Other factors have been associated with the risk of developing PD , but no causal relationships have been proven . 
 = = = Environmental factors = = = 
 A number of environmental factors have been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson 's including : pesticide exposure , head injuries , and living in the country or farming . Rural environments and the drinking of well water may be risks as they are indirect measures of exposure to pesticides . 
 <unk> agents include insecticides , primarily chlorpyrifos and organochlorines and pesticides , such as rotenone or <unk> , and herbicides , such as Agent Orange and <unk> . Heavy metals exposure has been proposed to be a risk factor , through possible accumulation in the substantia nigra ; however , studies on the issue have been inconclusive . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 PD traditionally has been considered a non @-@ genetic disorder ; however , around 15 % of individuals with PD have a first @-@ degree relative who has the disease . At least 5 % of people are now known to have forms of the disease that occur because of a mutation of one of several specific genes . 
 Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD . These genes code for alpha @-@ synuclein ( SNCA ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , leucine @-@ rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 or dardarin ) , PTEN @-@ induced putative kinase 1 ( <unk> ) , DJ @-@ 1 and <unk> . In most cases , people with these mutations will develop PD . With the exception of LRRK2 , however , they account for only a small minority of cases of PD . The most extensively studied PD @-@ related genes are SNCA and LRRK2 . Mutations in genes including SNCA , LRRK2 and <unk> ( GBA ) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD . Mutations in GBA are known to cause Gaucher 's disease . Genome @-@ wide association studies , which search for mutated alleles with low penetrance in sporadic cases , have now yielded many positive results . 
 The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha @-@ synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies . Missense mutations of the gene ( in which a single nucleotide is changed ) , and duplications and <unk> of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD . Missense mutations are rare . On the other hand , multiplications of the SNCA locus account for around 2 % of familial cases . <unk> have been found in asymptomatic carriers , which indicate that penetrance is incomplete or age @-@ dependent . 
 The LRRK2 gene ( <unk> ) encodes a protein called dardarin . The name dardarin was taken from a Basque word for tremor , because this gene was first identified in families from England and the north of Spain . Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD , accounting for approximately 5 % of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3 % of sporadic cases . There are many mutations described in LRRK2 , however unequivocal proof of causation only exists for a few . 
 Several Parkinson @-@ related genes are involved in the function of lysosomes , organelles that digest cellular waste products . It has been suggested that some forms of Parkinson may be caused by lysosome dysfunctions that reduce the ability of cells to break down alpha @-@ synuclein . 
 = = Pathology = = 
 = = = Anatomical = = = 
 The basal ganglia , a group of brain structures innervated by the dopaminergic system , are the most seriously affected brain areas in PD . The main pathological characteristic of PD is cell death in the substantia nigra and , more specifically , the ventral ( front ) part of the pars compacta , affecting up to 70 % of the cells by the time death occurs . 
 Macroscopic alterations can be noticed on cut surfaces of the brainstem , where neuronal loss can be inferred from a reduction of <unk> pigmentation in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus . The histopathology ( microscopic anatomy ) of the substantia nigra and several other brain regions shows neuronal loss and Lewy bodies in many of the remaining nerve cells . Neuronal loss is accompanied by death of astrocytes ( star @-@ shaped glial cells ) and activation of the microglia ( another type of glial cell ) . Lewy bodies are a key pathological feature of PD . 
 = = = Pathophysiology = = = 
 The primary symptoms of Parkinson 's disease result from greatly reduced activity of dopamine @-@ secreting cells caused by cell death in the pars compacta region of the substantia nigra . 
 There are five major pathways in the brain connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia . These are known as the motor , <unk> @-@ motor , associative , limbic and orbitofrontal circuits , with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit . All of them are affected in PD , and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease since these circuits are involved in a wide variety of functions including movement , attention and learning . Scientifically , the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively . 
 A particular conceptual model of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980 , although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications . In this model , the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence on a wide range of motor systems , preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times . When a decision is made to perform a particular action , inhibition is reduced for the required motor system , thereby releasing it for activation . Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition , so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity , while low levels of dopamine function , such as occur in PD , demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement . Thus , the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce <unk> , an overall reduction in motor output . Drugs that are used to treat PD , conversely , may produce excessive dopamine activity , allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias . 
 = = = Brain cell death = = = 
 There is speculation of several mechanisms by which the brain cells could be lost . One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha @-@ synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells . This insoluble protein accumulates inside <unk> forming inclusions called Lewy bodies . According to the Braak staging , a classification of the disease based on pathological findings , Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb , medulla oblongata and pontine <unk> , with individuals at this stage being asymptomatic . As the disease progresses , Lewy bodies later develop in the substantia nigra , areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain , and in a last step the neocortex . These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD ; however , Lewy bodies may not cause cell death and they may be protective . In people with dementia , a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas . <unk> tangles and senile plaques , characteristic of Alzheimer 's disease , are not common unless the person is demented . 
 Other cell @-@ death mechanisms include <unk> and lysosomal system dysfunction and reduced mitochondrial activity . Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed in conjunction with the protein inclusions . It may be related to oxidative stress , protein aggregation and neuronal death , but the mechanisms are not fully understood . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 A physician will diagnose Parkinson 's disease from the medical history and a neurological examination . There is no lab test that will clearly identify the disease , but brain scans are sometimes used to rule out disorders that could give rise to similar symptoms . People may be given levodopa and resulting relief of motor impairment tends to confirm the diagnosis . The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered proof that the person had Parkinson 's disease . The progress of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson 's disease , and some authorities recommend that the diagnosis should be periodically reviewed . 
 Other causes that can secondarily produce a parkinsonian syndrome are Alzheimer 's disease , multiple cerebral infarction and drug @-@ induced parkinsonism . Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive <unk> palsy and multiple system atrophy must be ruled out . Anti @-@ Parkinson 's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes . Faster progression rates , early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability , minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself . Genetic forms are usually classified as PD , although the terms familial Parkinson 's disease and familial parkinsonism are used for disease entities with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance . 
 Medical organizations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process , especially in the early stages of the disease . The most widely known criteria come from the UK Parkinson 's Disease Society Brain Bank and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . The PD Society Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement ( bradykinesia ) plus either rigidity , resting tremor , or postural instability . Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out . Finally , three or more of the following features are required during onset or evolution : unilateral onset , tremor at rest , progression in time , asymmetry of motor symptoms , response to levodopa for at least five years , clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa . Accuracy of diagnostic criteria evaluated at autopsy is 75 – 90 % , with specialists such as neurologists having the highest rates . 
 Computed tomography ( CT ) and conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scans of people with PD usually appear normal . These techniques are nevertheless useful to rule out other diseases that can be secondary causes of parkinsonism , such as basal ganglia tumors , vascular pathology and hydrocephalus . A specific technique of MRI , diffusion MRI , has been reported to be useful at discriminating between typical and atypical parkinsonism , although its exact diagnostic value is still under investigation . Dopaminergic function in the basal ganglia can be measured with different PET and SPECT <unk> . Examples are <unk> ( <unk> ) ( trade name <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) for SPECT or fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F ) and <unk> for PET . A pattern of reduced dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia can aid in diagnosing PD . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Exercise in middle age reduces the risk of Parkinson 's disease later in life . Caffeine also appears protective with a greater decrease in risk occurring with a larger intake of caffeinated beverages such as coffee . Although tobacco smoke causes adverse health effects , decreases life expectancy and quality of life , it may reduce the risk of PD by a third when compared to non @-@ smokers . The basis for this effect is not known , but possibilities include an effect of nicotine as a dopamine stimulant . Tobacco smoke contains compounds that act as MAO inhibitors that also might contribute to this effect . 
 Antioxidants , such as vitamins C and D , have been proposed to protect against the disease but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven . The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory , with various studies reporting protective effects , risk @-@ increasing effects or no effects . Also , there have been preliminary indications of a possible protective role of estrogens and anti @-@ inflammatory drugs . 
 = = Management = = 
 There is no cure for Parkinson 's disease , but medications , surgery , and multidisciplinary management can provide relief from the symptoms . The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are levodopa ( usually combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor or COMT inhibitor which does not cross the blood – brain barrier ) , dopamine agonists and MAO @-@ B inhibitors . The stage of the disease determines which group is most useful . Two stages are usually distinguished : an initial stage in which the individual with PD has already developed some disability for which he needs pharmacological treatment , then a second stage in which an individual develops motor complications related to levodopa usage . Treatment in the initial stage aims for an optimal tradeoff between good symptom control and side @-@ effects resulting from improvement of dopaminergic function . The start of levodopa ( or L @-@ DOPA ) treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO @-@ B inhibitors and dopamine agonists , in the hope of delaying the onset of dyskinesias . In the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication . Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed . When medications are not enough to control symptoms , surgery , and deep brain stimulation can be of use . In the final stages of the disease , palliative care is provided to improve quality of life . 
 = = = Levodopa = = = 
 Levodopa has been the most widely used treatment for over 30 years . L @-@ DOPA is converted into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by dopa decarboxylase . Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra , the administration of L @-@ DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms . 
 Only 5 – 10 % of L @-@ DOPA crosses the blood – brain barrier . The remainder is often metabolized to dopamine elsewhere , causing a variety of side effects including nausea , dyskinesias and joint stiffness . <unk> and benserazide are peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors , which help to prevent the metabolism of L @-@ DOPA before it reaches the dopaminergic neurons , therefore reducing side effects and increasing bioavailability . They are generally given as combination preparations with levodopa . Existing preparations are carbidopa / levodopa ( co @-@ <unk> ) and benserazide / levodopa ( co @-@ <unk> ) . Levodopa has been related to dopamine dysregulation syndrome , which is a compulsive overuse of the medication , and <unk> . There are controlled release versions of levodopa in the form intravenous and intestinal infusions that spread out the effect of the medication . These slow @-@ release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate release preparations . 
 <unk> inhibits the COMT enzyme , which degrades dopamine , thereby prolonging the effects of levodopa . It has been used to complement levodopa ; however , its usefulness is limited by possible side effects such as liver damage . A similarly effective drug , entacapone , has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function . Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa . 
 Levodopa preparations lead in the long term to the development of motor complications characterized by involuntary movements called dyskinesias and fluctuations in the response to medication . When this occurs a person with PD can change from phases with good response to medication and few symptoms ( " on " state ) , to phases with no response to medication and significant motor symptoms ( " off " state ) . For this reason , levodopa doses are kept as low as possible while maintaining functionality . Delaying the initiation of therapy with levodopa by using alternatives ( dopamine agonists and MAO @-@ B inhibitors ) is common practice . A former strategy to reduce motor complications was to withdraw L @-@ DOPA medication for some time . This is discouraged now since it can bring dangerous side effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome . Most people with PD will eventually need levodopa and later develop motor side effects . 
 = = = Dopamine agonists = = = 
 Several dopamine agonists that bind to dopaminergic post @-@ synaptic receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa . These were initially used for individuals experiencing on @-@ off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa ; they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms with the aim of delaying motor complications . When used in late PD they are useful at reducing the off periods . Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , apomorphine and <unk> . 
 Dopamine agonists produce significant , although usually mild , side effects including drowsiness , hallucinations , insomnia , nausea , and constipation . Sometimes side effects appear even at a minimal clinically effective dose , leading the physician to search for a different drug . Compared with levodopa , dopamine agonists may delay motor complications of medication use but are less effective at controlling symptoms . Nevertheless , they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years . They tend to be more expensive than levodopa . <unk> due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD , but along with other side effects , become more common with age at onset . Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for earlier onset , as opposed to levodopa in later onset . Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders ( such as compulsive sexual activity and eating , and pathological gambling and shopping ) even more strongly than levodopa . 
 <unk> , a non @-@ orally administered dopamine agonist , may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD . It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions . Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common , individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored . Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches ( <unk> and <unk> ) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state . 
 = = = MAO @-@ B inhibitors = = = 
 MAO @-@ B inhibitors ( <unk> , selegiline and <unk> ) increase the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolism . They inhibit monoamine oxidase B ( MAO @-@ B ) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons . The reduction in MAO @-@ B activity results in increased L @-@ DOPA in the striatum . Like dopamine agonists , MAO @-@ B inhibitors used as monotherapy improve motor symptoms and delay the need for levodopa in early disease , but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa . There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage , although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods . An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death , but this was later disproven . 
 = = = Other drugs = = = 
 Other drugs such as amantadine and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms . However , the evidence supporting them lacks quality , so they are not first choice treatments . In addition to motor symptoms , PD is accompanied by a diverse range of symptoms . A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems . Examples are the use of <unk> for psychosis , <unk> inhibitors for dementia , and modafinil for daytime sleepiness . A 2010 meta @-@ analysis found that non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( apart from aspirin ) , have been associated with at least a 15 percent ( higher in long @-@ term and regular users ) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson 's disease . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice , but since the discovery of levodopa , the number of operations declined . Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques , so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient . Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups : <unk> and deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus , the globus pallidus or the <unk> nucleus . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) is the most commonly used surgical treatment , developed in the 1980s by Alim @-@ Louis <unk> and others . It involves the implantation of a medical device called a <unk> which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain . DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication , or to those who are intolerant to medication , as long as they do not have severe neuropsychiatric problems . Other , less common , surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific subcortical areas . For example , <unk> involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia . 
 = = = Rehabilitation = = = 
 Exercise programs are recommended in people with Parkinson 's disease . There is some evidence that speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation , although studies are scarce and of low quality . Regular physical exercise with or without physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility , flexibility , strength , gait speed , and quality of life . When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist , there are more improvements in motor symptoms , mental and emotional functions , daily living activities , and quality of life compared to a self @-@ supervised exercise program at home . In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity , generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension . Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk , rhythmic initiation , diaphragmatic breathing , and meditation techniques . As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as <unk> ( slowness of movement ) , shuffling and decreased arm swing ; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety . Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on but are not limited to improving gait speed , the base of support , stride length , trunk and arm swing movement . Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment ( pole walking and treadmill walking ) , verbal cueing ( manual , visual and auditory ) , exercises ( marching and PNF patterns ) and altering environments ( surfaces , inputs , open vs. closed ) . Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson 's disease . However , reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken . Therefore , it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best . Also , due to the forward flexed posture , and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson 's disease , deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity . Exercise may improve constipation . 
 One of the most widely practiced treatments for speech disorders associated with Parkinson 's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment ( <unk> ) . Speech therapy and specifically <unk> may improve speech . Occupational therapy ( OT ) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible . There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor , although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life for the duration of the therapy . 
 = = = Palliative care = = = 
 Palliative care is specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses , including Parkinson 's . The goal of this speciality is to improve quality of life for both the person suffering from Parkinson 's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms , pain , and stress of illnesses . As Parkinson 's is not a curable disease , all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life , and are therefore palliative in nature . 
 Palliative care should be involved earlier , rather than later in the disease course . Palliative care specialists can help with physical symptoms , emotional factors such as loss of function and jobs , depression , fear , and existential concerns . 
 Along with offering emotional support to both the patient and family , palliative care serves an important role in addressing goals of care . People with Parkinson 's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube , non @-@ invasive ventilator , and tracheostomy ; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation ; and when to use hospice care . Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson 's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values . 
 = = = Other treatments = = = 
 Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD , resulting in constipation and gastroparesis ( food remaining in the stomach for a longer period than normal ) . A balanced diet , based on periodical nutritional assessments , is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction . As the disease advances , swallowing difficulties ( dysphagia ) may appear . In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating , both measures reducing the risk of choking . <unk> to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases . 
 Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood – brain barrier , thereby competing for access . When they are taken together , this results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug . Therefore , when levodopa is introduced , excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended . In advanced stages , additional intake of low @-@ protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons . To minimize interaction with proteins , levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals . At the same time , regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch , allowing protein intake in the evening . 
 Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa @-@ induced dyskinesias . Its usefulness in PD is an open research topic , although recent studies have shown no effect by <unk> . Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments ; however there is no evidence that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms . There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong , or T 'ai chi , have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms . Further research on the viability of Tai chi for balance or motor skills are necessary . Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD . While they have shown some effectiveness in clinical trials , their intake is not free of risks . Life @-@ threatening adverse reactions have been described , such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 PD invariably progresses with time . A severity rating method known as the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( <unk> ) is the most commonly used metric for clinical study . A modified version known as the MDS @-@ <unk> is also sometimes used . An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr scale ( originally published in 1967 ) , and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale , have also been commonly used . The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression . 
 Motor symptoms , if not treated , advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later . Untreated , individuals are expected to lose independent <unk> after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years . However , it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays . Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms , while at the same time it is a new source of disability because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use . In people taking levodopa , the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years . However , it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual . Age is the best predictor of disease progression . The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis , while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset . 
 Since current therapies improve motor symptoms , disability at present is mainly related to non @-@ motor features of the disease . Nevertheless , the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear . Disability is initially related to motor symptoms . As the disease advances , disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication , such as swallowing / speech difficulties , and gait / balance problems ; and also to motor complications , which appear in up to 50 % of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage . Finally , after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances , sleep problems , mood alterations and cognitive decline . All of these symptoms , especially cognitive decline , greatly increase disability . 
 The life expectancy of people with PD is reduced . Mortality ratios are around twice those of unaffected people . Cognitive decline and dementia , old age at onset , a more advanced disease state and presence of swallowing problems are all mortality risk factors . On the other hand , a disease pattern mainly characterized by tremor as opposed to rigidity predicts an improved survival . Death from aspiration pneumonia is twice as common in individuals with PD as in the healthy population . 
 In 2013 PD resulted in about 103 @,@ 000 deaths globally , up from 44 @,@ 000 deaths in 1990 . The death rate increased from an average of 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 per 100 @,@ 000 during that time . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer 's disease and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States . The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0 @.@ 3 % in industrialized countries . PD is more common in the elderly and rates rises from 1 % in those over 60 years of age to 4 % of the population over 80 . The mean age of onset is around 60 years , although 5 – 10 % of cases , classified as young onset PD , begin between the ages of 20 and 50 . PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry , although this finding is disputed . Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women , but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes . The number of new cases per year of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100 @,@ 000 person – years . 
 Many risk factors and protective factors have been proposed , sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease , however , none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence . When epidemiological studies have been carried out in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD , they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory . The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides , and a reduced risk in smokers . 
 = = History = = 
 Several early sources , including an Egyptian papyrus , an Ayurvedic medical treatise , the Bible , and Galen 's writings , describe symptoms resembling those of PD . After Galen there are no references unambiguously related to PD until the 17th century . In the 17th and 18th centuries , several authors wrote about elements of the disease , including <unk> , <unk> , Hunter and <unk> . 
 In 1817 an English doctor , James Parkinson , published his essay reporting six cases of paralysis <unk> . An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor , abnormal posture and gait , paralysis and diminished muscle strength , and the way that the disease progresses over time . Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau , Gowers , Kinnier Wilson and Erb , and most notably Jean @-@ Martin Charcot , whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease . Among other advances , he made the distinction between rigidity , weakness and bradykinesia . He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson . 
 In 1912 Frederic Lewy described microscopic particles in affected brains , later named " Lewy bodies " . In 1919 Konstantin <unk> reported that the substantia nigra was the main cerebral structure affected , but this finding was not widely accepted until it was confirmed by further studies published by Rolf Hassler in 1938 . The underlying biochemical changes in the brain were identified in the 1950s , due largely to the work of Arvid Carlsson on the neurotransmitter dopamine and Oleh <unk> on its role on PD . In 1997 , alpha @-@ synuclein was found to be the main component of Lewy bodies by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and others . 
 <unk> and surgery ( lesioning of the corticospinal pathway or some of the basal ganglia structures ) were the only treatments until the arrival of levodopa , which reduced their use dramatically . Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk , but it received little attention until the mid 20th century . It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD . By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim @-@ Louis <unk> and colleagues at Grenoble , France , emerged as a possible treatment . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Cost = = = 
 The costs of PD to society are high , but precise calculations are difficult due to methodological issues in research and differences between countries . The annual cost in the UK is estimated to be between 449 million and 3 @.@ 3 billion pounds , while the cost per patient per year in the U.S. is probably around $ 10 @,@ 000 and the total burden around 23 billion dollars . The largest share of direct cost comes from inpatient care and nursing homes , while the share coming from medication is substantially lower . Indirect costs are high , due to reduced productivity and the burden on caregivers . In addition to economic costs , PD reduces quality of life of those with the disease and their caregivers .

 11 April , the birthday of James Parkinson , has been designated as World Parkinson 's Day . A red tulip was chosen by international organizations as the symbol of the disease in 2005 : it represents the James Parkinson Tulip cultivar , registered in 1981 by a Dutch horticulturalist . Advocacy organizations include the National Parkinson Foundation , which has provided more than $ 180 million in care , research and support services since 1982 , Parkinson 's Disease Foundation , which has distributed more than $ 115 million for research and nearly $ 50 million for education and advocacy programs since its founding in 1957 by William Black ; the American Parkinson Disease Association , founded in 1961 ; and the European Parkinson 's Disease Association , founded in 1992 .

 Actor Michael J. Fox has PD and has greatly increased the public awareness of the disease . After diagnosis , Fox embraced his Parkinson 's in television roles , sometimes acting without medication , in order to further illustrate the effects of the condition . He has written two autobiographies in which his fight against the disease plays a major role , and appeared before the United States Congress without medication to illustrate the effects of the disease . The Michael J. Fox Foundation aims to develop a cure for Parkinson 's disease . Fox received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institutet for his contributions to research in Parkinson 's disease . 
 Professional cyclist and Olympic medalist Davis Phinney , who was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson 's at age 40 , started the Davis Phinney Foundation in 2004 to support Parkinson 's research , focusing on quality of life for people with the disease . 
 Muhammad Ali showed signs of Parkinson 's when he was 38 , but was not diagnosed until he was 42 , and has been called the " world 's most famous Parkinson 's patient " . Whether he had PD or a parkinsonism related to boxing is unresolved . 
 = = Research = = 
 There is little prospect of significant new PD treatments in the near future . Currently active research directions include the search for new animal models of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of gene therapy , stem cell transplants and neuroprotective agents . 
 = = = Animal models = = = 
 PD is not known to occur naturally in any species other than humans , although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research . The appearance of parkinsonian symptoms in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic opiate <unk> led to the discovery of the chemical <unk> as an agent that causes a parkinsonian syndrome in non @-@ human primates as well as in humans . Other predominant toxin @-@ based models employ the insecticide rotenone , the herbicide <unk> and the fungicide <unk> . Models based on toxins are most commonly used in primates . Transgenic rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed . Using the neurotoxin 6 @-@ <unk> , also known as 6 @-@ <unk> , it creates a model of Parkinson 's disease in rats by targeting and destroying dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway when injected into the substantia nigra . 
 = = = Gene therapy = = = 
 Gene therapy typically involves the use of a non @-@ infectious virus ( i.e. , a viral vector such as the <unk> @-@ associated virus ) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain . The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage . In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD . There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown . One of these reported positive results in 2011 , but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012 . 
 = = = <unk> treatments = = = 
 Investigations on neuroprotection are at the forefront of PD research . Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments . However , none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration . Agents currently under investigation include anti @-@ <unk> ( <unk> , CEP @-@ 1347 ) , <unk> , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( selegiline , <unk> ) , <unk> ( coenzyme Q10 , creatine ) , calcium channel blockers ( <unk> ) and growth factors ( <unk> ) . Preclinical research also targets alpha @-@ synuclein . A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha @-@ synuclein , <unk> ( developed by Austrian company , <unk> ) , has entered clinical trials in humans . 
 = = = Neural transplantation = = = 
 Since early in the 1980s , fetal , porcine , carotid or retinal tissues have been used in cell transplants , in which dissociated cells are injected into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine @-@ producing cells that have been lost . Although there was initial evidence of <unk> dopamine @-@ producing cell transplants being beneficial , double @-@ blind trials to date indicate that cell transplants produce no long @-@ term benefit . An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue , leading to <unk> . Stem cell transplants are a recent research target , because stem cells are easy to manipulate and stem cells transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys have been found to survive and reduce behavioral abnormalities . Nevertheless , use of fetal stem cells is controversial . It has been proposed that effective treatments may be developed in a less controversial way by use of induced pluripotent stem cells taken from adults . 
 = Evolution = 
 Evolution is change in the heritable traits of biological populations over successive generations . Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation , including the levels of species , individual organisms , and molecules . 
 All life on Earth shares a common ancestor known as the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) , which lived approximately 3 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 8 billion years ago , although a study in 2015 found " remains of biotic life " from 4 @.@ 1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the LUCA of all organisms living on Earth . 
 Repeated formation of new species ( speciation ) , change within species ( anagenesis ) , and loss of species ( extinction ) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth are demonstrated by shared sets of morphological and biochemical traits , including shared DNA sequences . These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor , and can be used to reconstruct a biological " tree of life " based on evolutionary relationships ( phylogenetics ) , using both existing species and fossils . The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite , to microbial mat fossils , to fossilized multicellular organisms . Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped both by speciation and by extinction . More than 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates of Earth 's current species range from 10 to 14 million , of which about 1 @.@ 2 million have been documented . 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , Charles Darwin formulated the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection , published in his book On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) . Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive , along with three facts about populations : 1 ) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology , physiology , and behaviour ( phenotypic variation ) , 2 ) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction ( differential fitness ) , and 3 ) traits can be passed from generation to generation ( heritability of fitness ) . Thus , in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place . This <unk> is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform . Natural selection is the only known cause of adaptation but not the only known cause of evolution . Other , nonadaptive evolutionary processes include mutation , genetic drift and gene migration . 
 In the early 20th century the modern evolutionary synthesis integrated classical genetics with Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection through the discipline of population genetics . The importance of natural selection as a cause of evolution was accepted into other branches of biology . Moreover , previously held notions about evolution , such as orthogenesis , evolutionism , and other beliefs about innate " progress " within the largest @-@ scale trends in evolution , became obsolete scientific theories . Scientists continue to study various aspects of evolutionary biology by forming and testing hypotheses , constructing mathematical models of theoretical biology and biological theories , using observational data , and performing experiments in both the field and the laboratory . 
 In terms of practical application , an understanding of evolution has been instrumental to developments in numerous scientific and industrial fields , including agriculture , human and veterinary medicine , and the life sciences in general . Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just in the traditional branches of biology but also in other academic disciplines , including biological anthropology , and evolutionary psychology . Evolutionary computation , a sub @-@ field of artificial intelligence , involves the application of Darwinian principles to problems in computer science . 
 = = History of evolutionary thought = = 
 The proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first pre @-@ Socratic Greek philosophers , such as Anaximander and Empedocles . Such proposals survived into Roman times . The poet and philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork De rerum natura ( On the Nature of Things ) . In contrast to these materialistic views , Aristotle understood all natural things , not only living things , as being imperfect <unk> of different fixed natural possibilities , known as " forms , " " ideas , " or ( in Latin translations ) " species . " This was part of his teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order . Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning , but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one @-@ for @-@ one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be . 
 In the 17th century , the new method of modern science rejected Aristotle 's approach . It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of physical laws that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order . However , this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences , the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types . John Ray applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types , " species , " to plant and animal types , but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation . These species were designed by God , but showed differences caused by local conditions . The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships , but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan . 
 Other naturalists of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws . In 1751 , Pierre Louis Maupertuis wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species . Georges @-@ Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms , and Erasmus Darwin proposed that all warm @-@ blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism ( or " filament " ) . The first full @-@ fledged evolutionary scheme was Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck 's " transmutation " theory of 1809 , which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency , and postulated that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents . ( The latter process was later called Lamarckism . ) These ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support . In particular , Georges Cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed , their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs . In the meantime , Ray 's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by William Paley into the Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity ( 1802 ) , which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles Darwin . 
 The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection , which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations . Partly influenced by An Essay on the Principle of Population ( 1798 ) by Thomas Robert Malthus , Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a " struggle for existence " in which favorable variations prevailed as others perished . In each generation , many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources . This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism . Darwin developed his theory of " natural selection " from 1838 onwards and was writing up his " big book " on the subject when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a version of virtually the same theory in 1858 . Their separate papers were presented together at a 1858 meeting of the Linnean Society of London . At the end of 1859 , Darwin 's publication of his " abstract " as On the Origin of Species explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of concepts of evolution . Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin 's ideas to humans , using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry . Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe . 
 Precise mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery . Towards this end , Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis . In 1865 , Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements ( later known as genes ) . Mendel 's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin 's pangenesis theory . August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells that give rise to gametes ( such as sperm and egg cells ) and the somatic cells of the body , demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only . Hugo de Vries connected Darwin 's pangenesis theory to Weismann 's germ / soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin 's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure . De Vries was also one of the researchers who made Mendel 's work well @-@ known , believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline . To explain how new variants originate , de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries . In the 1930s , pioneers in the field of population genetics , such as Ronald Fisher , Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy . The false contradiction between Darwin 's theory , genetic mutations , and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled . 
 In the 1920s and 1930s a modern evolutionary synthesis connected natural selection , mutation theory , and Mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology . The modern synthesis was able to explain patterns observed across species in populations , through fossil transitions in palaeontology , and even complex cellular mechanisms in developmental biology . The publication of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance . Molecular biology improved our understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype . Advancements were also made in phylogenetic systematics , mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of evolutionary trees . In 1973 , evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky penned that " nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution , " because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent explanatory body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet . 
 Since then , the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the biological hierarchy , from genes to species . This extension , known as evolutionary developmental biology and informally called " evo @-@ devo , " emphasises how changes between generations ( evolution ) acts on patterns of change within individual organisms ( development ) . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits — the inherited characteristics of an organism . In humans , for example , eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the " brown @-@ eye trait " from one of their parents . Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism 's genome ( genetic material ) is called its genotype . 
 The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype . These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment . As a result , many aspects of an organism 's phenotype are not inherited . For example , <unk> skin comes from the interaction between a person 's genotype and sunlight ; thus , <unk> are not passed on to people 's children . However , some people tan more easily than others , due to differences in genotypic variation ; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism , who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn . 
 Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA , a molecule that encodes genetic information . DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases . The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information , in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence . Before a cell divides , the DNA is copied , so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence . Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes ; different genes have different sequences of bases . Within cells , the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes . The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus . If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals , the different forms of this sequence are called alleles . DNA sequences can change through mutations , producing new alleles . If a mutation occurs within a gene , the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls , altering the phenotype of the organism . However , while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases , most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci ( multiple interacting genes ) . 
 Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA . These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems . DNA methylation marking chromatin , self @-@ sustaining metabolic loops , gene silencing by RNA interference and the three @-@ dimensional conformation of proteins ( such as prions ) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level . Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation . <unk> may also occur at even larger scales . For example , ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment . This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations . Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors . Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and <unk> . 
 = = Variation = = 
 An individual organism 's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in . A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation . The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation . The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene . Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation — when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely . 
 Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population . Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics , one common hypothesis was blending inheritance . But with blending inheritance , genetic variance would be rapidly lost , making evolution by natural selection implausible . The Hardy – Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance . The frequencies of alleles ( variations in a gene ) will remain constant in the absence of selection , mutation , migration and genetic drift . 
 Variation comes from mutations in the genome , reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations ( gene flow ) . Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow , most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species . However , even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype : for example , chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5 % of their genomes . 
 = = = Mutation = = = 
 Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell 's genome . When mutations occur , they may alter the product of a gene , or prevent the gene from functioning , or have no effect . Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster , it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene , this will probably be harmful , with about 70 % of these mutations having damaging effects , and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial . 
 Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated ( usually by genetic recombination ) , which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome . Extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve . This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre @-@ existing genes that share common ancestors . For example , the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light : three for colour vision and one for night vision ; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene . 
 New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function . This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system ; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function . Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA . 
 The generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated , with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions . When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre @-@ existing parts , domains act as modules with simple independent functions , which can be mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions . For example , polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics ; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process , like a step in an assembly line . 
 = = = Sex and recombination = = = 
 In asexual organisms , genes are inherited together , or linked , as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction . In contrast , the offspring of sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents ' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment . In a related process called homologous recombination , sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes . Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies , but instead change which alleles are associated with each other , producing offspring with new combinations of alleles . Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution . 
 The two @-@ fold cost of sex was first described by John Maynard Smith . The first cost is that only one of the two sexes can bear young . ( This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species , like most plants and many invertebrates . ) The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50 % of its genes to any individual offspring , with even less passed on as each new generation passes . ( Again , this applies mostly to the evolution of sexual dimorphism , which occurred long after the evolution of sex itself . ) Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms ( although more common than sexual dimorphism ) . The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever @-@ changing environment . 
 = = = Gene flow = = = 
 Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species . It can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species . Gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms , as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations , or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses . 
 Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer . Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring ; this is most common among bacteria . In medicine , this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance , as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species . Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the <unk> bean weevil <unk> chinensis has occurred . An example of larger @-@ scale transfers are the eukaryotic <unk> rotifers , which have received a range of genes from bacteria , fungi and plants . Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms , allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains . 
 Large @-@ scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and bacteria , during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria . It is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and archaea . 
 = = Mechanisms = = 
 From a Neo @-@ Darwinian perspective , evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms . For example , the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common . Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection , genetic drift , genetic hitchhiking , mutation and gene flow . 
 = = = Natural selection = = = 
 Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population . It has often been called a " self @-@ evident " mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts : 
 Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology , physiology , and behaviour ( phenotypic variation ) . 
 Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction ( differential fitness ) . 
 These traits can be passed from generation to generation ( heritability of fitness ) . 
 More offspring are produced than can possibly survive , and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction . Consequently , organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage . 
 The central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism . Fitness is measured by an organism 's ability to survive and reproduce , which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation . However , fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring : instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism 's genes . For example , if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly , but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive , this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness . 
 If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene , then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population . These traits are said to be " selected for . " Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity . Conversely , the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer — they are " selected against . " Importantly , the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic ; if the environment changes , previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful . However , even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way , traits that were lost in the past may not re @-@ evolve in an identical form ( see Dollo 's law ) . 
 Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values , such as height , can be categorised into three different types . The first is directional selection , which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time — for example , organisms slowly getting taller . Secondly , disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common , with selection against the average value . This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage , but not those of medium height . Finally , in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends , which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity . This would , for example , cause organisms to slowly become all the same height . 
 A special case of natural selection is sexual selection , which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates . Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species . Although sexually favoured , traits such as cumbersome antlers , mating calls , large body size and bright colours often attract predation , which compromises the survival of individual males . This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard @-@ to @-@ fake , sexually selected traits . 
 Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits , are more or less likely to survive . " Nature " in this sense refers to an ecosystem , that is , a system in which organisms interact with every other element , physical as well as biological , in their local environment . Eugene Odum , a founder of ecology , defined an ecosystem as : " Any unit that includes all of the organisms ... in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure , biotic diversity and material cycles ( ie : exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts ) within the system . " Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche , or position , with distinct relationships to other parts of the system . These relationships involve the life history of the organism , its position in the food chain and its geographic range . This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which , together , comprise natural selection . 
 Natural selection can act at different levels of organisation , such as genes , cells , individual organisms , groups of organisms and species . Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously . An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons , which can replicate and spread throughout a genome . Selection at a level above the individual , such as group selection , may allow the evolution of cooperation , as discussed below . 
 = = = Biased mutation = = = 
 In addition to being a major source of variation , mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur , a process known as mutation bias . If two genotypes , for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position , have the same fitness , but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G , then genotypes with A will tend to evolve . Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes . Developmental or <unk> biases have also been observed in morphological evolution . For example , according to the phenotype @-@ first theory of evolution , mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment . 
 Mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes . If selection would favor either one out of two mutations , but there is no extra advantage to having both , then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population . Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new , fully functional gene . Most loss of function mutations are selected against . But when selection is weak , mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution . For example , pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves , and tend to be lost . This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias , and / or because the function had a cost , and once the benefit of the function disappeared , natural selection leads to the loss . Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias , rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability . When there is no selection for loss of function , the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size , indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift . In parasitic organisms , mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia . Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer @-@ membrane proteins . 
 = = = Genetic drift = = = 
 Genetic drift is the change in allele frequency from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles are subject to sampling error . As a result , when selective forces are absent or relatively weak , allele frequencies tend to " drift " upward or downward randomly ( in a random walk ) . This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed , either by disappearing from the population , or replacing the other alleles entirely . Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone . Even in the absence of selective forces , genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles . 
 It is usually difficult to measure the relative importance of selection and neutral processes , including drift . The comparative importance of adaptive and non @-@ adaptive forces in driving evolutionary change is an area of current research . 
 The neutral theory of molecular evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes are the result of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift . Hence , in this model , most genetic changes in a population are the result of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift . This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned , since it does not seem to fit the genetic variation seen in nature . However , a more recent and better @-@ supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory , where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population . Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution , such as genetic hitchhiking , also known as genetic draft . 
 The time for a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size , with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations . The number of individuals in a population is not critical , but instead a measure known as the effective population size . The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest . The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population . 
 = = = Genetic hitchhiking = = = 
 Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated . However , the rate of recombination is low ( approximately two events per chromosome per generation ) . As a result , genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together , a phenomenon known as linkage . This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations , which is called their linkage disequilibrium . A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype . This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial : natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population ; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft . Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size . 
 = = = Gene flow = = = 
 Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species . The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution . Due to the complexity of organisms , any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes , as in the Bateson @-@ Dobzhansky @-@ Muller model , even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment . 
 If genetic differentiation between populations develops , gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations , eventually resulting in the appearance of new species . Thus , exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept . 
 During the development of the modern synthesis , Sewall Wright developed his shifting balance theory , which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution . However , recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory . 
 = = Outcomes = = 
 Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms . Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection . These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food , avoiding predators or attracting mates . Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other , usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis . In the longer term , evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed . 
 These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution . <unk> refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species , in particular speciation and extinction ; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population , in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation . In general , macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution . Thus , the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one — the difference is simply the time involved . However , in macroevolution , the traits of the entire species may be important . For instance , a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats , lessening the chance of it going extinct , while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation , by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated . In this sense , microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels — with microevolution acting on genes and organisms , versus <unk> processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction . 
 A common misconception is that evolution has goals , long @-@ term plans , or an innate tendency for " progress , " as expressed in beliefs such as orthogenesis and evolutionism ; realistically however , evolution has no long @-@ term goal and does not necessarily produce greater complexity . Although complex species have evolved , they occur as a side effect of the overall number of organisms increasing and simple forms of life still remain more common in the biosphere . For example , the overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes , which form about half the world 's biomass despite their small size , and constitute the vast majority of Earth 's biodiversity . Simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form of life on Earth throughout its history and continue to be the main form of life up to the present day , with complex life only appearing more diverse because it is more noticeable . Indeed , the evolution of microorganisms is particularly important to modern evolutionary research , since their rapid reproduction allows the study of experimental evolution and the observation of evolution and adaptation in real time . 
 = = = Adaptation = = = 
 Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat . Also , the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism 's survival . For example , the adaptation of horses ' teeth to the grinding of grass . By using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the product ( the bodily part or function ) , the two senses of the word may be distinguished . Adaptations are produced by natural selection . The following definitions are due to Theodosius Dobzhansky : 
 Adaptation is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats . 
 <unk> is the state of being adapted : the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats . 
 An adaptive trait is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing . 
 Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature , or the loss of an ancestral feature . An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection , with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug , or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell . Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long @-@ term laboratory experiment , <unk> evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by @-@ products of nylon manufacturing , and the soil bacterium <unk> evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide <unk> . An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection ( increasing organisms ' evolvability ) . 
 Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures . Consequently , structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms . This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways . The bones within bat wings , for example , are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands , due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor . However , since all living organisms are related to some extent , even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity , such as arthropod , squid and vertebrate eyes , or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates , can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function ; this is called deep homology . 
 During evolution , some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures . Such structures may have little or no function in a current species , yet have a clear function in ancestral species , or other closely related species . Examples include pseudogenes , the non @-@ functional remains of eyes in blind cave @-@ dwelling fish , wings in flightless birds , the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes , and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction . Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth , the coccyx , the vermiform appendix , and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes . 
 However , many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations : structures originally adapted for one function , but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process . One example is the African lizard <unk> guentheri , which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices , as can be seen by looking at its near relatives . However , in this species , the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree — an exaptation . Within cells , molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre @-@ existing proteins that previously had different functions . Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called <unk> within the lenses of organisms ' eyes . 
 An area of current investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations . This research addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features . These studies have shown that evolution can alter development to produce new structures , such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals . It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes , such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles . It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes . 
 = = = Coevolution = = = 
 Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation . When the interaction is between pairs of species , such as a pathogen and a host , or a predator and its prey , these species can develop matched sets of adaptations . Here , the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species . These changes in the second species then , in turn , cause new adaptations in the first species . This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution . An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough @-@ skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator , the common garter snake . In this predator @-@ prey pair , an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake . 
 = = = Cooperation = = = 
 Not all co @-@ evolved interactions between species involve conflict . Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved . For instance , an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil . This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis . Here , the fungi actually grow inside plant cells , allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts , while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system . 
 Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved . An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects , such as bees , termites and ants , where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce . On an even smaller scale , the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism , which then supports a small number of the animal 's germ cells to produce offspring . Here , somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow , remain as they are , or die . If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately , their uncontrolled growth causes cancer . 
 Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of kin selection , which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative 's offspring . This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity , it is likely that its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on . Other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection , where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms . 
 = = = Speciation = = = 
 Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species . 
 There are multiple ways to define the concept of " species . " The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned . For example , some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms . Despite the diversity of various species concepts , these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches : interbreeding , ecological and phylogenetic . The Biological Species Concept ( BSC ) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach . Defined by Ernst Mayr in 1942 , the BSC states that " species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations , which are reproductively isolated from other such groups . " Despite its wide and long @-@ term use , the BSC like others is not without controversy , for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes , and this is called the species problem . Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species , while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species . 
 Barriers to reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species . Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations . Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor , it may still be possible for them to produce offspring , as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules . Such hybrids are generally infertile . In this case , closely related species may regularly interbreed , but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct . However , viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species , or possess a totally new phenotype . The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear , although cases have been seen in many types of animals , with the gray tree frog being a particularly well @-@ studied example . 
 Speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature . In sexually reproducing organisms , speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence . There are four mechanisms for speciation . The most common in animals is allopatric speciation , which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically , such as by habitat fragmentation or migration . Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms . As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species , separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed . 
 The second mechanism of speciation is peripatric speciation , which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment . This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population . Here , the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes , leading to rapid genetic change . 
 The third mechanism of speciation is parapatric speciation . This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat , but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations . Instead , speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations . Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species ' habitat . One example is the grass <unk> odoratum , which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines . Here , plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil . Selection against interbreeding with the metal @-@ sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal @-@ resistant plants , which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation . Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement , which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species , as well as character displacement , which is when two species become more distinct in appearance . 
 Finally , in sympatric speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat . This form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population . Generally , sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non @-@ random mating , to allow reproductive isolation to evolve . 
 One type of sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species to produce a new hybrid species . This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile . This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair . However , it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes , to form polyploids . This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis , since each parent 's chromosomes are represented by a pair already . An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis <unk> crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis <unk> . This happened about 20 @,@ 000 years ago , and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory , which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process . Indeed , chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation , as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with <unk> organisms . 
 Speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated equilibrium , which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short " bursts " of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis , where species remain relatively unchanged . In this theory , speciation and rapid evolution are linked , with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations . As a result , the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils . 
 = = = Extinction = = = 
 Extinction is the disappearance of an entire species . Extinction is not an unusual event , as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction . Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct , and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species . These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life , although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events . The Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event , during which the non @-@ avian dinosaurs became extinct , is the most well @-@ known , but the earlier Permian – Triassic extinction event was even more severe , with approximately 96 % of all marine species driven to extinction . The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity 's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years . Present @-@ day extinction rates are 100 – 1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30 % of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century . Human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event ; global warming may further accelerate it in the future . 
 The role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of extinction is considered . The causes of the continuous " low @-@ level " extinction events , which form the majority of extinctions , may be the result of competition between species for limited resources ( the competitive exclusion principle ) . If one species can out @-@ compete another , this could produce species selection , with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction . The intermittent mass extinctions are also important , but instead of acting as a selective force , they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors .

 The Earth is about 4 @.@ 54 billion years old . The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago , during the <unk> Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . Microbial mat fossils have been found in 3 @.@ 48 billion @-@ year @-@ old sandstone in Western Australia . Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3 @.@ 7 billion @-@ year @-@ old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland as well as " remains of biotic life " found in 4 @.@ 1 billion @-@ year @-@ old rocks in Western Australia . According to one of the researchers , " If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe . " 
 More than 99 percent of all species , amounting to over five billion species , that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct . Estimates on the number of Earth 's current species range from 10 million to 14 million , of which about 1 @.@ 2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described . 
 Highly energetic chemistry is thought to have produced a self @-@ replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago , and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed . The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions . The beginning of life may have included self @-@ replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells . 
 = = = Common descent = = = 
 All organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool . Current species are a stage in the process of evolution , with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events . The common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms : First , they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation . Second , the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms , but organisms that share morphological similarities . Third , vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally , that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups — similar to a family tree . However , modern research has suggested that , due to horizontal gene transfer , this " tree of life " may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species . 
 Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history . Fossils , along with the comparative anatomy of present @-@ day organisms , constitute the morphological , or anatomical , record . By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species , paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species . However , this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts , such as shells , bones or teeth . Further , as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies , their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry . 
 More recently , evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms . For example , all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids . The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms ' genomes : dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations . For example , these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share 98 % of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed . 
 = = = Evolution of life = = = 
 Prokaryotes inhabited the Earth from approximately 3 – 4 billion years ago . No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms over the next few billion years . The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 7 billion years ago . The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells , in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis . The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution , with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes . Another engulfment of cyanobacterial @-@ like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants . 
 The history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes , prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period . The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events , in organisms as diverse as sponges , brown algae , cyanobacteria , slime moulds and myxobacteria . In January 2016 , scientists reported that , about 800 million years ago , a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK @-@ PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells . 
 Soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms , a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years , in an event called the Cambrian explosion . Here , the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record , as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct . Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed , including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis . 
 About 500 million years ago , plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals . Insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species . Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago , followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago ( both from " reptile " -like lineages ) , mammals around 129 million years ago , <unk> around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250 @,@ 000 years ago . However , despite the evolution of these large animals , smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the Earth , with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Concepts and models used in evolutionary biology , such as natural selection , have many applications . 
 Artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms . This has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals . More recently , such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering , with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA . Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection ( for example modified enzymes and new antibodies ) in a process called directed evolution . 
 Understanding the changes that have occurred during an organism 's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body , genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders . For example , the Mexican tetra is an albino <unk> that lost its eyesight during evolution . Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes , since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves . This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation . 
 Many human diseases are not static phenomena , but capable of evolution . Viruses , bacteria , fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences , as well as pharmaceutical drugs . These same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance . It is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level . 
 In computer science , simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection . Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo <unk> in the 1960s . He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems . Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland . Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes . Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi @-@ dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems . 
 = = Social and cultural responses = = 
 In the 19th century , particularly after the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859 , the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical , social and religious implications of evolution . Today , the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists . However , evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists . 
 While various religions and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through concepts such as theistic evolution , there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their religions and who raise various objections to evolution . As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844 , the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have the same types of natural causes as other inherited traits in animals . In some countries , notably the United States , these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation – evolution controversy , a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education . While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts , evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists . 
 The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century . The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation , but it was gradually re @-@ introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision . Since then , the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s , but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design ( ID ) , to be excluded once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case . 
 = Hurricane Lenny = 
 Hurricane Lenny is the second @-@ strongest November Atlantic hurricane on record . It was the twelfth tropical storm , eighth hurricane , and record @-@ breaking fifth Category 4 hurricane in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season . Lenny formed on November 13 in the western Caribbean Sea and maintained an unprecedented west @-@ to @-@ east track for its entire duration . It attained hurricane status south of Jamaica on November 15 and passed south of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico over the next few days . Lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern Caribbean on November 17 , attaining peak winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) about 21 mi ( 34 km ) south of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands . It gradually weakened while moving through the Leeward Islands , eventually dissipating on November 23 over the open Atlantic Ocean . 
 Before moving through the Lesser Antilles , Lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern Colombia . Strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern Puerto Rico . Despite the hurricane 's passage near Saint Croix at peak intensity , damage on the small island was only described as " moderate " , although there was widespread flooding and erosion . Damage in the United States territories totaled about $ 330 million . The highest precipitation total was 34 @.@ 12 in ( 867 mm ) at the police station on the French side of Saint Martin . On the island , the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200 properties . In nearby Antigua and Barbuda , the hurricane killed one person ; torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply . Significant storm damage occurred as far south as Grenada , where high surf isolated towns from the capital city . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Lenny began as a low @-@ pressure area that was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 8 . It developed an area of convection but remained poorly defined for the next few days . Thunderstorms spread across the region , producing heavy rainfall in portions of Mexico and Central America . On November 13 , the system became better organized ; a Hurricane Hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . The data indicated the development of Tropical Depression Sixteen at 1800 UTC , about 175 mi ( 280 km ) south of the Cayman Islands . The depression 's convection was fairly disorganized , and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) did not anticipate any strengthening for three days . For much of its existence , the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the Caribbean Sea , which was unprecedented in the Atlantic hurricane database . The path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western Atlantic Ocean . 
 After its formation , the depression gradually became better organized ; the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Lenny on November 14 , based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters . When it was first upgraded to a tropical storm , the cyclone already had winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a developing eye feature . At 0000 UTC on November 15 , Lenny attained hurricane status about 175 mi ( 280 km ) southwest of Kingston , Jamaica . The quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center . At the same time , Lenny developed an anticyclone aloft , which provided favorable conditions for the hurricane 's development . After moving east @-@ southeastward during its initial development stages , the hurricane turned more to the east on November 15 . The Hurricane Hunters reported winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , which indicated that Lenny had become a Category 2 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . However , the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared , and Lenny 's winds weakened to 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) while the hurricane passed south of Hispaniola . The NHC noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storm 's small inner core by " subtle environmental changes " . After the sudden weakening , the Hurricane Hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricane 's winds had reached 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . At the time , a ridge was expected to build to Lenny 's east and turn the storm northeastward into Puerto Rico 24 hours later . 
 Beginning on November 16 , Hurricane Lenny underwent a 24 @-@ hour period of rapid deepening , reaching major hurricane status about 165 mi ( 265 km ) south of the Mona Passage . It developed well @-@ defined banding features , good outflow , and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in San Juan , Puerto Rico . The hurricane continued to become better organized , with an eye 29 mi ( 46 km ) in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall . Around 1200 UTC on November 17 , Lenny intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern Caribbean . It was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year , setting the record for most Category 4 hurricanes in a season . The hurricane then made its closest approach to Puerto Rico , passing about 75 mi ( 121 km ) southeast of Maunabo . Shortly thereafter , Lenny attained peak winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) while passing 21 mi ( 33 km ) south of the island of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands . This made it the second @-@ strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of November . At the time , Lenny was also one of only four November major hurricanes , but it was later joined by Hurricane Michelle in 2001 and Hurricane Paloma in 2008 . Hurricane Hunters reported Lenny 's peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane ; the group also reported a minimum pressure of 933 mbar , a drop of 34 mbar in 24 hours . In addition , a dropsonde recorded winds of 210 mph ( 339 km / h ) while descending to the surface , the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the time . 
 Around the time it peaked in intensity , Lenny 's forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges . Despite favorable conditions for strengthening , the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift , possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters . Late on November 18 , Lenny 's eye moved over Saint Martin with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . After continued weakening , the hurricane struck Anguilla and Saint Barthélemy the next day . It turned southeastward while still drifting , bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern Caribbean . Late on November 19 , Lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased wind shear exposed the cyclone 's center from the deepest convection . Early on November 20 , the storm made landfall on Anguilla , although by then the center had become difficult to locate . Later that day , the cyclone exited the Caribbean , continuing its southeast track . On November 21 , Lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression . The deep convection was located at least 100 mi ( 160 km ) east of the increasingly elongated center . Lenny turned to the east for the final time early on November 22 , dissipating the next day about 690 mi ( 1110 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Early in Lenny 's duration , a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for Jamaica . Later , a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of Hispaniola , and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the Dominican Republic . Haitian officials declared a state of alert in three southern provinces and allocated about $ 1 million ( 1999 USD ) in hurricane funds . Residents in flood @-@ prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern Haiti and in the neighboring Dominican Republic . 
 A hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November 15 , which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later . By that time , Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico . After Lenny made its closest approach to the island , the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November 17 , which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands . In Puerto Rico , the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office . Based on the coverage , the public was well informed of the hurricane 's threat to the island . Before the storm and as a result of its impact , around 4 @,@ 700 people evacuated to 191 shelters . This included 1 @,@ 190 residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27 schools , as well as 584 people in western Puerto Rico . Officials closed all schools , banned the sale of alcohol , and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) activated six medical assistance teams , three medical support teams , and two advance medical assessment units . The agency stored five days ' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands . Before the hurricane 's arrival , U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency . In St. Croix , 309 people rode out the storm in shelters . Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands . There , airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area . 
 Governments across the eastern Caribbean issued hurricane warnings as far south as Montserrat . In Anguilla , residents near the coast were advised to evacuate . Schools closed ahead of the storm , and the ferry between the island and Saint Martin was halted and moved to a safe location . In Saint Kitts and Nevis , the National Emergency Management Agency was activated on November 16 . Officials there advised residents living near <unk> to evacuate , and one shelter was located in each district of the country . In addition , stores were open for longer hours to allow people to stock up on supplies . Most businesses and schools were closed in Antigua and Barbuda during the storm , while in Dominica , the airport was closed . Further south , there was little warning for the hurricane in Grenada , and most people left their boats in the water .
