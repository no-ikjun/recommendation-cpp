 Pettigrew State Park is open for year @-@ round recreation , including hiking , fishing , camping , boating and picnicking . Lake Phelps is open to canoes , kayaks , rowboats and engine @-@ powered boats . Launch ramps are available at Cypress Point and behind the park offices on Lake Shore Drive . There is a canoe trail in the canals that were built during the plantation era . The Scuppernong River is also open to most types of watercraft . 
 The main campground is in a cypress and sweetgum forest , with 13 campsites that are open to tents or camping trailers . Each site comes equipped with a picnic table and charcoal grill . A second campsite is in a grassy meadow with the same amenities . A large group camping area is set in the forest . It has tent pads , grills and rustic toilet facilities . A centrally located bathhouse , open to all campers , includes flush toilets and showers . 
 Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River are both open for fishing . The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission ( NCWRC ) has established fishing regulations , such as catch and length limits , that are meant to enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River . The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002 . The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20 inches ( 50 @.@ 8 cm ) or between 14 and 16 inches ( 35 @.@ 6 @-@ 40 @.@ 6 cm ) . This rule was put in place to increase the number of <unk> fish , fish over 20 inches ( 50 @.@ 8 cm ) . Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River . 
 Pettigrew State Park has three pavilions and one large picnic area available on a first come , first served basis . Three hiking trails pass the shore of Lake Phelps and wind through the woods .

 Lupo the Butcher is a 1987 three @-@ minute animated short comedy film directed and written by Danny Antonucci . The short follows the story of a psychotic butcher who has a huge temper and swears at his meat when the smallest things go wrong . Produced by Marv Newland 's International <unk> Limited , Lupo the Butcher was a successful short and has earned itself a cult following . 
 = = Plot = = 
 An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is complaining about his job one day , while cutting meat in his shop . As each new slice falls to the ground , Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat . He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb , which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart . Blood gushes out onto the ground , and the various pieces of Lupo 's body collapse into a pile . The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo 's severed head , but before the scene can disappear entirely , Lupo 's head jumps forward , still alive . It remains on the screen , shouting insults during the credits , and then falls asleep .

 Danny Antonucci , who has worked in animation since the 1970s , decided to create his first solo work . Tired of people thinking that animation was only for children , he wanted to create a " character that people would believe in " . Due to his Italian heritage , Antonucci wanted his character to be an Italian immigrant who would blame America for all of his problems . Originally named " Lupo the Barber " , Antonucci eventually settled on the name " Lupo the Butcher " . This character was inspired by his father and uncle . After the short was finalized , Antonucci was pleased with his creation , and felt that the three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minute movie " worked out " . It was produced by Marv Newland 's International <unk> Limited . Released in 1987 , it was shown at Spike and Mike 's Festival of Animation . Antonucci went on to found a.k.a Cartoon , Inc . , with which he would create The Brothers Grunt and the Cartoon Network classic Ed , Edd n Eddy .

 Upon its release , Lupo the Butcher was a successful short and has earned itself a cult following . Eric Fogel , co @-@ creator of Glenn Martin , DDS , stated that Lupo the Butcher inspired him to pursue a career in animation , saying : " That film opened my eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and inspired me to pursue a career path that was a bit more … twisted . " In an interview with Take One , Linda Simensky called the short " the South Park of its time " and stated that she remembers tapes containing the short being passed around her office in 1988 . It was featured in Spike and Mike 's book Outlaw Animation , written by Jerry Beck , and in the Spike and Mike DVD . 
 = = Other media = = 
 The Lupo character was eventually licensed by the Converse athletic shoe company . This led to additional work , including animated commercials for Levi Strauss & Co. and MTV . 
 In 2010 , Danny Antonucci revealed that a second short called Meat the Family was planned by a.k.a. Cartoon in 1996 , but it remained unfinished . It had to be based on Lupo and his family , composed of his wife Sette <unk> ( Italian for " Seven Ass " ) , his son <unk> ( " Retard " ) , his father <unk> <unk> ( " Pissing Dad " ) and a cat named <unk> . The designs also appeared in Spike and Mike 's book Outlaw Animation , written by Jerry Beck . They were then resumed for achieve an animated television series based on the original short ; no further reports , however , have been made since then .

Robby Gordon was sent to the back of the starting grid because he changed engines after Happy Hour . NASCAR announced before the race that there would be a competition caution on lap 50 . At 12 : 16 p.m. , the green flag waved with Kevin Harvick the leader . Kevin Harvick stayed the leader until lap 41 when the first caution stopped the field because of a tire going down on Joe Nemechek 's car . Since this caution came out near NASCAR 's schedule competition caution on Lap 50 , NASCAR canceled the competition caution . On lap 46 , Kevin Harvick led to the green flag with Kurt Busch second . After a ten lap run , Jeff Gordon passed Kevin for the lead . Then on lap 63 , David Stremme spun in turn four to bring out the second caution . Jeff Gordon , who stayed out of pit road , was still the leading when the green flag waved . Afterwards , on lap 75 , David Reutimann spun in turn one to cause the third caution of the race . Jeff Gordon was still leading the race when race resumed , but a lap later Kurt Busch edged Jeff to lead lap 82 . Then Jeff passed Kurt to lead again on lap 89 . 
 After the lead change , the race experienced a run of 46 laps . During the laps , Kevin Harvick took his Chevrolet to the garage because of brake issues , and on lap 125 Juan Pablo Montoya collided into the wall ; he went to the garage with major damage . The run ended because Robby Gordon , who blew a tire , caused the fourth caution to be waved . After all of the lead lap cars pitted the leader was Jeff Gordon . On lap 140 , Kurt Busch passed Jeff for the lead , but on lap 149 Jeff Burton passed Jeff and Kurt to get the lead . Thirteen laps later the fifth caution was given because Greg Biffle spun after having contact with Marcos Ambrose .

 = Raptor ( Cedar Point ) = 
 Raptor is a steel inverted roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky , Ohio , United States . When built in 1994 , it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened . Instead of having a short layout designed to fit into a compact area like Batman : The Ride , Raptor was designed with a larger , 3 @,@ 790 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 160 m ) layout , making it the tallest , fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened . It features six inversions , including a cobra roll , a first for inverted roller coasters . At its opening , it was the largest investment in Cedar Point history . The ride is themed as a bird of prey . 
 = = History = = 
 On August 19 , 1993 , Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Raptor . Raptor was then announced on September 1 , 1993 during a press conference . Regarding the design of the attraction , Cedar Point management , said : " Raptor will be the most exciting and ambitious project ever ... a project that will challenge the boundaries of imagination and change the Sandusky , Ohio amusement park / resort like nothing before it . " 
 Construction started after the 1993 season with the site clearing of the Mill Race log flume water ride . The Midway Carousel and Calypso were relocated in October to other areas of the park to make room for Raptor . Footers also began to be poured that month . The lift hill was topped off in December with track construction continuing through January 1994 . The first trains were tested about two months later in March . Final preparations were made in March with the entrance plaza being built and 85 @,@ 000 square feet ( 7 @,@ 900 m2 ) of midway replaced . Media day was held on May 6 before the ride opened to the public the next day for the first time . The ride was originally painted with dark green supports , bright green track and unpainted rails . It was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green , matching the supports . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 Raptor is located on three acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) at the front of the park near Blue Streak . The ride travels over the pathway to Blue Streak then passes by the Cadillac Cars and Cedar Downs Racing Derby . The queue features a DJ booth that is used on the weekends . They take requests from people in the queue for family friendly songs . They can also be found daily in Millennium Force 's queue . Raptor is themed as a bird of prey , not a velociraptor .

 The ride begins with a left @-@ hand turn out of the station to the lift hill that ascends 137 feet ( 42 m ) . Riders are pulled up by a 9 @,@ 000 lbf ( 40 kN ) chain lift . At the top , the train dips slightly into the pre @-@ drop before turning 90 degrees to the left as it drops 119 feet ( 36 m ) down the first hill . From the bottom the train immediately enters a 100 feet ( 30 m ) vertical loop . The train then enters a zero @-@ g roll followed by the cobra roll which inverts riders twice . The cobra roll was a first for inverted roller coasters . After the cobra roll , the train climbs through an upward spiral and enters the mid @-@ course brake run . Next , the train dives down to the right transitioning into a brief straight section of track . Riders then enter the first of two corkscrews which rotates the train 360 degrees to the left . The track straightens briefly again before turning to the right and entering a short dip before taking riders into the second corkscrew . The ride finishes with a 1 @.@ 5 revolution flat helix where riders encounter strong positive G @-@ forces before making one last left turn into the final brake run . One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 16 seconds .

 The steel track is approximately 3 @,@ 790 feet ( 1 @,@ 160 m ) in length and the height of the lift is approximately 137 feet ( 42 m ) . The first drop is 119 feet ( 36 m ) . When the coaster first opened , it was painted with dark green supports , bright green track and unpainted rails . 1 @,@ 500 gallons of paint were used to originally paint it . Raptor was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green , matching the supports . Most of the 117 sections of track were manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators in Batavia , Ohio . The roller coaster will be repainted again for the 2016 season with its original colors .

 Raptor is adversely affected by unfavourable weather conditions as both a high altitude and high velocity ride . " Rain , high winds , and / or lightning " may result in the closing of the ride depending on the severity . It closes in high winds and any type of precipitation . 
 There is no minimum age requirement , but passengers must meet the miniumum height requirement of 54 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) to ride . Some persons over a certain weight / waist size are not be permitted to ride if the seat and lapbar harness cannot accommodate them . Passengers on Raptor may not bring any loose articles onto the train and are required to wear shirts and footwear . Headphones must be removed before boarding . 
 Passengers are advised that they must not ride Raptor if they have " a history of recent surgery , heart trouble / high blood pressure , neck trouble , back trouble , or any other condition that may be aggravated by riding , or who are pregnant " .

 On July 6 , 2009 , a guest complained of feeling faint after the ride . Raptor was immediately shut down as the guest was transported to a local hospital . The ride remained closed for the remainder of the day , reopening the next afternoon after a thorough inspection was completed . The guest was later released from the hospital . 
 On June 21 , 2015 , a 37 @-@ year @-@ old man 's leg was gashed by the ride 's loading platform gates . He was taken to a local hospital where his wound was sutured . 
 On August 13 , 2015 , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old man entered the ride 's restricted area to retrieve a cell phone he lost while riding . He was then struck by a moving train and died on the scene . The ride was immediately closed for inspection and reopened the next day .

 = Candida ( song ) = 
 " Candida " was the first single released by the American pop music group Dawn , with vocals by Tony Orlando , in July 1970 . The song , written by Irwin Levine and Toni Wine , was produced by Dave Appell and Hank Medress for Bell Records . Appell and Medress originally recorded another singer on the track , but decided that a different vocal approach would be preferable . Medress then approached Orlando to do the vocals . Orlando had been a professional singer in the early 1960s , but now worked as a music publishing manager for Columbia Records . Although initially worried about losing his job at Columbia , Orlando eventually agreed to lend his voice to the track . 
 " Candida " became a worldwide hit , reaching number one in five countries , and the top ten in many others . It was included on Dawn 's debut LP in 1970 and later appeared on several compilation albums . Andy Williams , Jesse Winchester , Ray Conniff , and Bernd Spier are among the artists who have covered the song . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 In 1970 Hank Medress of the Tokens and Dave Appell were producing a song called " Candida " for Bell Records . The composition was written by Toni Wine and Irwin Levine . For the first recording of the song , the lead vocal was done by blues singer Frankie Paris , in a style reminiscent of the Drifters . Paris 's performance was deemed unsatisfactory , and a new singer was sought for the track . Medress believed that " an ethnic feel " would suit the song well . He asked his friend Tony Orlando , whose heritage is Puerto Rican and Greek , to perform its lead vocal . 
 Orlando , a former professional singer , had had two top @-@ 40 hits in the USA in 1961 , but later moved into the music publishing business ; in 1967 Columbia Records chose him to manage their publishing division , April @-@ Blackwood Music . When Medress approached Orlando , he was reluctant to perform on a Bell Records single , as he did not want to jeopardize his job at Columbia . Medress reassured him by saying they would use a band name for the release , and that nobody would know who the singer was . Orlando finally agreed , partly because he believed the song would be unsuccessful and would not attract any attention . He went into a studio with Appell and Medress , and sang his lead vocal over prerecorded tracks . Background vocals were done by Wine and the Tokens ' Jay Siegel ; Orlando was not present when these were recorded . By different accounts , additional background singers may have included Ellie Greenwich , Robin Grean , Leslie Miller , and Linda November . Phil Margo and Siegel played instruments on at least one of the versions of the song . The music of Orlando 's version has been described as having " a lilting , sing @-@ along groove " . 
 = = Release = = 
 " Candida " was released as a single in July 1970 under the moniker Dawn , named after the daughter of either Jay Siegel or Bell Records executive Steve Wax . The single reached number one in Brazil , Malaysia , Singapore , Spain , and Sweden , and the top ten in Austria , Canada , Denmark , Mexico , New Zealand , Norway , South Africa , the UK , and the USA . It also reached the top twenty in Australia , Belgium , and Germany . Billboard ranked the record as the No. 18 song of 1970 . 
 Jay Warner , author of American Singing Groups : A History from 1940 to Today , notes that the group the Corporation released a different version of " Candida " around the same time as Dawn 's . The Corporation 's recording was produced by Bill and Steve James , and released on <unk> Records . Warner believes that this version was based on an early , slower piano @-@ and @-@ vocals demo by Toni Wine . A July 1970 capsule review in Billboard magazine of both Dawn 's and the Corporation 's versions categorized the latter 's recording as possessing " a strong blues and Tex @-@ Mex flavor " , and stated that both singles had " equal sales and chart potential " . However , although for a short while it seemed there might be competition between the two , the Corporation 's single did not sell well . 
 Dawn 's version was released on their debut album , Candida , in 1970 , and later on the Dawn compilations Greatest Hits , The World of Tony Orlando & Dawn , The Definitive Collection , and The Big Hits . It has also appeared on various @-@ artists compilations including Today 's Super Hits , AM Gold : 1970 , and Real 70 's : the Polyester Hits , Disc One .

 = Florida @-@ class battleship = 
 The Florida @-@ class battleships of the United States Navy comprised two ships : Florida and Utah . Launched in 1910 and 1909 respectively and commissioned in 1911 , they were slightly larger than the preceding Delaware @-@ class design but were otherwise very similar . This was the first US battleship class in which all ships received steam turbine engines . In the previous Delaware class , North Dakota received steam turbine propulsion as an experiment while Delaware retained triple @-@ expansion engines . 
 Both ships were involved in the 1914 Second Battle of Vera Cruz , deploying their Marine contingents as part of the operation . Following the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917 , both ships were deployed to Europe . Florida was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow ; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow Wilson to France for the peace negotiations . Utah was assigned to convoy escort duty ; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys as they approached the European continent . 
 Retained under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , both ships were modernized significantly , with torpedo bulges and oil @-@ fired boilers installed and other improvements made , but were demilitarized under terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty . Florida was scrapped , Utah converted into first a radio @-@ controlled target ship , then an anti @-@ aircraft gunnery trainer . She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 . Her hull , never raised , remains on the bottom of the harbor as a war memorial . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Floridas were the third of 10 separate classes built between 1906 and 1919 , a total of 22 battleships being commissioned . The new dreadnoughts of the American battle line were being designed from pre @-@ dreadnought experience and observation of foreign designs , as no US dreadnought had yet been commissioned at the time that the Floridas were designed ; all were either at some stage of building or in design . American capital ship design was also heavily influenced by war games conducted at the US Navy 's Naval War College . Captain William Sims led a reform movement that assigned warship design to the General Board . 
 These ships were an improvement over the preceding Delaware class . Their engine rooms were larger to hold four Curtis or Parsons steam turbines . Their larger beam gave them greater metacentric height , in which the Delawares were notably deficient , which improved buoyancy and reduced hull stress . The ships mounted new 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 caliber guns as secondary batteries in casemates that boasted increased armor protection . The class retained the large and fully enclosed conning towers that were adopted for the preceding Delawares , as a result of American studies of the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 . The design reduced the vulnerability of the command staff . Overall , these ships were much better protected than their British counterparts , although they were modified extensively during the interwar period . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Florida @-@ class ships were 510 ft ( 160 m ) long at the waterline and 521 ft 6 in ( 158 @.@ 95 m ) overall . They had a beam of 88 ft 3 in ( 26 @.@ 90 m ) and a draft of 28 ft 6 in ( 8 @.@ 69 m ) . They displaced 21 @,@ 825 long tons ( 22 @,@ 175 t ) at standard displacement and 23 @,@ 033 long tons ( 23 @,@ 403 t ) at full load . This was an increase of approximately 2 @,@ 500 long tons ( 2 @,@ 500 t ) over the previous Delaware @-@ class . The ships also had some of their superstructure rearranged , including the lattice masts and the funnels . The Florida @-@ class ships had a crew of 1 @,@ 001 officers and men . 
 The engine rooms on these ships were lengthened to accommodate the larger Parsons steam turbines , which meant the after boiler room had to be eliminated . The remaining boiler rooms were widened by 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) ; to do this and maintain adequate underwater and coal bunker protection , the ships were made 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) <unk> than the Delawares . Funnel spacing was therefore closer than in the Delawares . Also , the wider beam increased the vessels ' metacentric height , a quality in which the Delawares were notably deficient . This improvement allowed the Floridas to accommodate their larger medium @-@ caliber guns without any real penalty in topweight . 
 Florida was fitted experimentally with a larger bridge than was then standard , to house both ship and fire control personnel under armor , while Utah received an heavily armored fire @-@ control tower atop a standard @-@ sized bridge . The former proved especially successful , to the point that when a larger armored fire @-@ control tower and standard bridge was proposed for the Nevada class , it was rejected in favor of a roomier bridge like that of Florida . 
 The two ships were modernized in 1925 – 27 ; among the improvements were the addition of torpedo bulges , which were designed to increase resistance to underwater damage — this widened the ships to 106 ft ( 32 m ) . The ships also had their rear lattice masts removed and replaced with a pole mast . A catapult for launching aircraft was mounted on the number 3 gun turret . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships were propelled by four @-@ shaft Parsons steam turbines ; steam was provided by 12 Babcock & Wilcox coal @-@ fired boilers . The engines were rated at 28 @,@ 000 shp ( 20 @,@ 880 kW ) to give a top speed of 21 kn ( 39 km / h ) . On trials , Florida made 22 @.@ 08 kn ( 40 @.@ 89 km / h ; 25 @.@ 41 mph ) on 40 @,@ 511 shp ( 30 @,@ 209 kW ) ; Utah 's turbines produced only 27 @,@ 028 shp ( 20 @,@ 155 kW ) but still propelled the ship at 21 @.@ 04 kn ( 38 @.@ 97 km / h ; 24 @.@ 21 mph ) . However , the engine and boiler room arrangements remained the same as in the Delawares , with the engine room situated between the rear main turrets and steam lines running beneath the superfiring rear turret . The ships had a range of 5 @,@ 776 nmi ( 6 @,@ 650 mi ; 10 @,@ 700 km ) at a cruising speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 During Florida and Utah 's reconstruction in 1925 – 1927 , their coal @-@ fired boilers were replaced with four White @-@ Forster oil @-@ fired boilers . The reduction in the number of boilers allowed their twin funnels to be trunked into one single larger funnel .

 = = = = Main guns = = = = 
 It was intended originally to arm these ships with eight 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) / 45 caliber guns then in development in superfiring fore @-@ and @-@ aft mountings . As this gun did not go into service until 1914 , the arrangement of ten 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets was retained from the Delaware class . The gun housings were the Mark 8 type , and they allowed for depression to − 5 degrees and elevation to 15 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 2 to 3 rounds per minute . They fired 870 lb ( 395 kg ) shells , of either armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) or Common types , though the Common type was obsolete by 1915 and put out of production . The propellant charge was 310 lb ( 141 kg ) in silk bags , and provided a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 823 m / s ) . The guns were expected to fire 175 rounds before the barrels would require replacement . The two ships carried 100 shells per gun , or 1 @,@ 000 rounds in total . At 15 degrees elevation , the guns could hit targets out to approximately 20 @,@ 000 yd ( 18 @,@ 288 m ) 
 Unfortunately , the turret layout of the Delawares was also retained , with its respective challenges . Two turrets , Numbers 1 and 2 , were mounted fore in a superfiring pair , while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure , all on the centerline . The rearmost turret , number 5 , was placed on the main deck , facing rearward , the next turret , Number 4 , was placed on the main deck facing forward , but could only have fired on either broadside , it could not have fired straight forward or aft . The center turret , Number 3 , placed in a superfiring position facing rearward , could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward . This left only the rearmost turret , with its pair of 12 @-@ inch guns , to cover the rear quarter of the ship . Also , since the engine room was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it , steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room . These lines , it was later found , had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics .

 C & R proposed 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) secondary guns for these ships , protected by 6 @.@ 5 in ( 165 mm ) casemate armor . This would have been the only change from the protective scheme carried over from the Delaware class . However , a new 5 @-@ inch / 51 caliber gun was adopted instead after concerns about inadequate splinter protection for secondary gun casemates and smoke uptakes led to an increase in armor . Sixteen of these weapons were fitted in individual casemates . These guns fired a 50 lb ( 23 kg ) armor @-@ <unk> ( AP ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 3 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 960 m / s ) and a rate of 8 to 9 rounds per minute . The guns could depress to − 10 degrees and elevate to 15 degrees . The guns were manually operated , and had a range of train of about 150 degrees in either direction .

 Florida and Utah received two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 23 caliber guns in 1917 for anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defense . This was increased to eight guns between 1926 and 1928 .

 The ships were also armed with two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes . The tubes were mounted one on each broadside .

 The armor layout was largely the same as in the preceding Delaware @-@ class battleships .

After modernization , some of the casemated guns were moved to the superstructure ; these guns were protected with only 5 in ( 127 mm ) of armor . The barbettes that housed the main gun turrets were armored with between 4 and 10 in ( 102 and 254 mm ) of armor ; the side portions more vulnerable to shell fire were thicker , while the front and rear sections of the barbette , which were less likely to be hit , received thinner armor to save weight . The gun turrets themselves were armored with 12 in ( 305 mm ) of armor . The conning tower was 11 @.@ 5 in ( 292 mm ) thick . The armored deck was slightly reduced in thickness , from 2 to 1 @.@ 5 in ( 51 to 38 mm ) .

 Florida , ordered under hull number " Battleship # 30 " , was laid down at the New York Navy Yard on 9 March 1909 . She was launched on 12 May 1910 , after which fitting out work commenced . Work was finished on 15 September 1911 , at which point she was commissioned into the United States Navy . Utah was ordered under hull number " Battleship # 31 " . She was laid down in Camden , New Jersey , at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation , 6 days later on 15 March . Work proceeded faster on Utah than on her sister ship , and she was launched about four and a half months earlier , on 23 December 1909 . After launching , she underwent fitting out work , which lasted until 31 August 1911 , when she was commissioned into the American fleet .

 = = = USS Florida = = = 
 Florida took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in 1914 . She and her sister Utah were the first two ships on the scene ; the two ships landed some 1 @,@ 000 sailors and Marines under the command of Florida 's captain on 21 April . Fighting lasted for 3 days ; the contingent from Florida and Utah suffered a total of 94 casualties . 
 After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Florida was dispatched to Europe ; she departed the United States in December 1917 . After arriving in the North Sea , she was assigned to the Grand Fleet , where she served with her British counterparts . The ship , part of the US Navy 's Battleship Division Nine , under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman , arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet . Following training exercises with the British fleet , 6th Battle Squadron was tasked with convoy protection duty on the route to Scandinavia . Following the end of the war , in December 1918 , the ship escorted President Woodrow Wilson on his trip to Europe to participate in the peace negotiations at Versailles . Later in December , Florida returned to the United States to participate in the Victory Fleet Review in New York harbor . 
 Post @-@ war , Florida returned the US Navy 's Atlantic Fleet ; she operated along the east coast of the United States and into Central America . In July 1920 , she was assigned the hull numbers " BB @-@ 30 " . In December 1920 , she carried the US Secretary of State , Bainbridge Colby , on a diplomatic trip around the Caribbean and South America . Florida was the oldest American battleship that was retained under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . She underwent extensive reconstruction and modernization during the mid @-@ 1920s . After emerging from the shipyard , she was assigned as the flagship of the Control Force , US Fleet . The ship conducted a series of training cruises for the remainder of the decade . Under the London Naval Treaty of 1930 , the ship was to be discarded . She was decommissioned in February 1931 and towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard , where she was broken up for scrap . 
 = = = USS Utah = = = 
 Utah 's first assignment was with the US Navy 's Atlantic Fleet . During 1913 , she took a goodwill voyage to the Mediterranean . Utah was also involved in the Second Battle of Vera Cruz , alongside her sister Florida . The ship also saw front @-@ line duty in the First World War , although she was not attached to the British Grand Fleet . Starting in September 1918 , Utah was based in Bantry Bay , Ireland . Here she conducted convoy escort duties on the approach to Europe . 
 Post @-@ war service saw Utah again in the Atlantic Fleet ; during 1921 – 22 , she was stationed in Europe . Utah was also retained under the Washington Naval Treaty . In 1924 – 1925 , the ship sailed on a goodwill cruise to South America . Following her return to the United States , she was taken into dry dock for significant reconstruction . After she rejoined the active fleet , she was assigned to the US Scouting Fleet . Late in 1928 , she steamed to the South Atlantic , where she picked up President @-@ Elect Herbert Hoover , who was returning from an ambassadorial visit to several South American countries . 
 According to the London Naval Treaty , the ship was to be removed from front @-@ line service . To this end , she had her main battery guns removed and she was converted into a radio @-@ controlled target ship . She was redesignated AG @-@ 16 , and served in this capacity after 1931 . In the mid @-@ 1930s , she was rebuilt again , as an anti @-@ aircraft gunnery training ship . In 1941 , additional anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed to increase her training capacity . Later in 1941 , she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor . She was present in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 ; after having been hit by two torpedoes , she capsized and sank . A few years later , the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island , where the wreck remains today .

 Franklin Thompson Matthias ( 13 March 1908 – 3 December 1993 ) was an American civil engineer who directed construction of the Hanford nuclear site , a key facility of the Manhattan Project during World War II . 
 A graduate of the University of Wisconsin – Madison , Matthias joined the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) as a Junior Hydraulic Engineer in 1935 , and worked on hydroelectric projects . In April 1941 , he was called to active duty by the United States Army , and joined the Construction Division of the Army Corps of Engineers . He was area engineer at the Manhattan Project 's Hanford site from 1942 to 1945 . As such , he supervised the enormous construction effort which included three chemical separation plants so large that they were known as " Queen Marys " , and the world 's first three production @-@ scale nuclear reactors . 
 After the war <unk> went to Brazil where he helped build a hydroelectric facility . He joined the Aluminum Company of Canada ( Alcan ) in 1951 , and was involved in the construction of its <unk> @-@ <unk> hydroelectric dam and aluminum smelter project in northern British Columbia and the Chute @-@ des @-@ Passes project in Quebec . He was a vice president at Kaiser Engineering from 1960 to 1973 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Franklin Thompson Matthias was born in Glidden , Wisconsin , on 13 March 1908 , the son of Franklin Herman Matthias and Christina Thompson . He had two older brothers , Harold and Norman , and a younger brother , Carl . In 1928 he became an instructor in Topographical and Hydraulic Engineering at the University of Wisconsin – Madison , from which he received his Bachelor of Science ( B.S. ) degree in civil engineering in 1931 , and his Master of Science ( M.S. ) degree in civil engineering in 1933 . While there he joined the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) . In 1930 and 1931 he was editor of the Wisconsin Engineer , and president of the university YMCA . He was a member of Tau Beta Pi , Phi Kappa Phi and <unk> and Blade , and was a national officer of Chi Epsilon from 1931 to 1942 . 
 On 1 August 1933 , Matthias married Reva Baumgarten , a fellow graduate of the University of Wisconsin , who taught speech therapy in schools in Beloit , Wisconsin . In 1935 he was hired by the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) as a Junior Hydraulic Engineer , and worked on hydroelectric and hydraulic problems and on construction , planning and plant design . He left the TVA in 1939 , and spent a year working with a contractor on dredging the Tennessee River . In 1940 and 1941 he worked for the A. L. Johnson Construction Company , and on tunnels and aqueducts for the Dravo Corporation . 
 = = World War II = = 
 In April 1941 , Matthias was called to active duty by the United States Army as a first lieutenant , and joined the Construction Division of the Army Corps of Engineers , where he received rapid promotion . On 14 December 1942 , as a 34 @-@ year @-@ old lieutenant colonel , he accompanied Colonel Kenneth Nichols to Wilmington , Delaware , to discuss the location of a proposed plutonium production plant with representatives of DuPont . At this point , Matthias had not yet been assigned to the Manhattan Project , whose mission was to build an atomic bomb , but he had worked on some special studies for it , and had worked with its director , Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , on the construction of The Pentagon . He was already Groves 's choice for area engineer for the plutonium project . 
 Initially , the intention had been to locate the plutonium plant with the Manhattan Project 's other production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge , Tennessee , but concerns had arisen about the dangers of an atomic explosion , and Knoxville lay only 20 miles ( 32 km ) away . A larger site was required where facilities could be separated from each other . It had to be in a sparsely populated but accessible area with access to abundant water and electric power . When he returned from the meeting , Matthias was met by Groves , who instructed him to take a survey team and find a suitable site . Matthias surveyed four sites in California and Washington , and chose the area around Richland , Washington . 
 Matthias later recalled that : 
 As far as my working relationship with Du Pont was concerned , of course , we had differences from day one . I was fortunate that Gil Church and Walt Simon ( Du Pont 's project construction manager and operations manager ) were people I could deal with and respect , and we had a very good working relationship . I remember one time Granville Read ( Du Pont 's assistant chief engineer ) called up Groves and said Matthias and Church were having a big argument about something and what should we do ? Groves replied , " Well , if those two guys don 't have some arguments , then neither of them are worth a damn . " 
 Because of the isolation of the site , known as the Hanford Engineer Works , Matthias exercised more administrative autonomy than the Manhattan Project 's other area engineers . The number of personnel assigned to his office grew to over 500 in 1944 . Construction work commenced on the 400 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 160 @,@ 000 ha ) site in April 1943 . The size of the construction work force eventually reached 44 @,@ 900 in June 1944 ; over 150 @,@ 000 workers were employed at the site between 1943 and 1946 . 
 The scale of the task was enormous . Matthias supervised the construction of 554 buildings , 386 miles ( 621 km ) of roads , 158 miles ( 254 km ) miles of railroad track , three chemical separation plants and the world 's first three production @-@ scale nuclear reactors . The 800 @-@ foot ( 240 m ) -long chemical separation plants , where the plutonium was separated from uranium slugs that had been irradiated in the reactors , were so large that they were known as " Queen Marys " , after the ocean liner . Because the slugs were dangerously radioactive , the Queen Marys had concrete walls 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) thick , and operations were by remote control . 
 The first production batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at the separation plant on 26 December 1944 , and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered the first batch of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles , where he handed it over to another courier , who took it to the Los Alamos Laboratory . Plutonium from Hanford would be used in the Fat Man bomb used in the bombing of Nagasaki . For his wartime services , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal .

 Matthias left the Army in 1946 and went to Brazil as a project manager for the construction for a hydroelectric facility , eventually becoming the Manager of Engineering at Brazilian Traction . Late in 1951 he joined the Aluminum Company of Canada ( Alcoa ) as the Project Manager of Engineering and Construction of the <unk> @-@ <unk> hydroelectric dam and aluminum smelter project in northern British Columbia . In 1956 he moved to Montreal as its Director of Engineering , and worked on the Chute @-@ des @-@ Passes project . In 1960 he joined Kaiser Engineering in Oakland , California , as its Vice President for Heavy construction and Hydroelectric engineering , and was its Vice President of Transportation Projects from 1970 to 1973 . He retired in 1973 , at the age of 65 . 
 Matthias was a Registered Professional Engineer in Wisconsin , California , Nebraska , Pennsylvania , and British Columbia . For some years after his retirement he remained active as a consultant , working for firms including Kaiser Engineering , Pacific Gas and Electric , Louisiana Pacific and Bechtel . He was a member of the Advisory Board of the California Water Resources Association , the Committee on Large Dams , Committee on Construction of Nuclear Facilities , and the American Society of Civil Engineers . He also wrote the chapter on " Construction Services " in the Handbook of Heavy Construction ( 1971 ) . 
 In 1993 , he was informed that he had cancer of the lungs , liver and pancreas . He died six week later , on 3 December 1993 , at a nursing home in Walnut Creek , California . He was survived by his son Michael and younger brother Carl . His second wife , Mary Teresa <unk> , whom he had married on 29 October 1948 , had died in 1986 , and his daughter Gelen Christine had died in 1965 . His papers are in the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington , Delaware . 
 = Going Clear ( film ) = 
 Going Clear : Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a 2015 documentary film about Scientology . Directed by Alex Gibney and produced by HBO , it is based on Lawrence Wright 's book Going Clear : Scientology , Hollywood and the Prison of Belief ( 2013 ) . The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in Park City , Utah . It received widespread praise from critics and was nominated for seven Emmy Awards , winning three , including Best Documentary . It also won a Best Documentary award from the Writers Guild of America . 
 The film deconstructs the church 's claims by presenting a condensed history of Scientology and its founder , L. Ron Hubbard , examining how celebrities interact with the church , and highlighting the stories of a number of ex @-@ members and of the abuse and exploitation that they described seeing and experiencing . The Church of Scientology responded vehemently to the film , complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees . 
 Going Clear was released in a limited number of theaters on March 13 , 2015 and aired on HBO on March 29 , 2015 . It was a major ratings success and by mid @-@ April 2015 had attracted 5 @.@ 5 million viewers , making it the second most @-@ watched HBO documentary in the past decade . It was subsequently released internationally , showing in theaters and on television despite a sustained campaign by the Church of Scientology to block its release . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Going Clear is based closely on Lawrence Wright 's book , covering much of the same ground with the aid of archive footage , dramatic reconstructions , and interviews with eight former Scientologists : Paul Haggis , the Oscar @-@ winning director ; Mark Rathbun , the church 's former second @-@ in @-@ command ; Mike Rinder , the former head of the church 's Office of Special Affairs ; the actor Jason Beghe ; Sylvia ' Spanky ' Taylor , former liaison to John Travolta ; and former Scientologists Tom <unk> , Sara Goldberg , and Hana <unk> Whitfield . 
 The film breaks into three distinct acts . In the first , the former Scientologists describe how they joined Scientology ; the second act recounts the history of Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard ; and in the final act , the film airs allegations of the abuse of church members and misconduct by its leadership , particularly David Miscavige , who is accused of intimidating , beating , imprisoning , and exploiting subordinates . The film depicts the role played by celebrity members , such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise , through video clips contrasting their statements with the experiences of former Scientologists . 
 To support its thesis , the film utilises footage of ex @-@ Scientologists harassed and surveilled ( per Hubbard 's dictum that the church 's critics were all criminals whose crimes needed to be exposed ) , and describes the imprisonment of senior Scientology executives in a facility known as " The Hole " ; one Scientologist was said to have been forced to clean a bathroom with his tongue . According to the film , the actress Nicole Kidman was targeted for wiretapping by Scientology in an effort to break her marriage to Tom Cruise after she was labeled a " potential trouble source " by the church ; whereas John Travolta has been forced to stay in the church in fear that secrets from his personal life will be exposed .

 The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize – winning journalist Lawrence Wright 's book Going Clear : Scientology , Hollywood , and the Prison of Belief , which was published in January 2013 and was a National Book Award finalist . HBO announced in December 2014 that Alex Gibney , an Oscar @-@ winning director who made Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room ( 2005 ) , Taxi to the Dark Side , ( 2007 ) and The Armstrong Lie ( 2013 ) , was directing a film based on the book , to be released at the 2015 Sundance Festival . It was the first time that HBO had tackled Scientology directly , though not the first time it had clashed with the church ; in 1998 , protesters mounted demonstrations outside HBO 's headquarters because of a documentary that presented anti @-@ depressant drugs , which are fiercely opposed by Scientology , in a positive light . 
 Gibney began working on Going Clear in 2013 after becoming intrigued by Wright 's book . He collaborated with Wright , who came on board as a producer , to explore the book 's underlying theme of " how people become prisoners of faith in various ways " . Gibney saw Scientology as one of the toughest subjects he has had to tackle in his career as a documentarian , alongside government complicity in torture , corporate financial malfeasance , and clerical sexual abuse . 
 Fear of Scientology 's litigiousness rendered American networks unwilling to license any material to the filmmakers , which Gibney found " astounding " . He commented that he " found it interesting that universally this subject — more than any other — provoked all the networks to decline to license . I think at the end of the day , that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks , which is how ruthless they 've been in trying to silence any criticism . " The church 's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret : " Sometimes for the on @-@ camera interviews we 'd set up gear in somebody 's house and I 'd make sure I 'd be there hours before . Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody ’ s house . " 
 Explaining why he chose to make a film about Scientology , Gibney told Reuters that he considered it " an important topic . Not only about this church of Scientology , which everybody 's fascinated with partially because of the celebrities , but partially because of the way that the church seems to turn people to do things that I think they would normally never do if had they not entered the church . " Gibney , Wright , and the former Scientologists who appeared in the film told a post @-@ screening question @-@ and @-@ answer session that they hoped the film would raise public awareness about the alleged abuses committed by the Church of Scientology , and would prompt the media and law enforcement agencies to investigate further . Gibney later called in a Los Angeles Times opinion piece for Scientology 's tax exemption to be revoked in the light of the allegations of abuse documented in the film .

 Going Clear made its world première on January 25 , 2015 , at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City , Utah . The Wall Street Journal described it as " the hottest ticket " at the festival . The première was so popular that even those with tickets were unable to find seats , because so many VIP pass @-@ holders chose to watch the film , displacing ordinary festival @-@ goers . It attracted numerous celebrities and media figures , including actors Alec Baldwin and Tobey Maguire , comedian Jason Sudeikis , and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd . The audience gave Going Clear a standing ovation in an unusual occurrence for a Sundance presentation . ' Spanky ' Taylor 's appearance on stage , along with the daughter from whom the church had forced her to " disconnect " , reduced many in the audience to tears . The film was subsequently shown in a limited number of New York , Los Angeles and San Francisco theaters from March 13 , 2015 . 
 The initial theatrical release was deliberately small @-@ scale , most likely undertaken to ensure that Going Clear met the eligibility criteria for an Oscar nomination . Due to continuing public demand , HBO announced in July 2015 that it would be releasing the film more widely from September 25 through the ArcLight Cinemas chain 's theaters in California , Chicago , Washington D.C. , New York City , Texas and a few other locations around the US . 
 HBO broadcast the television première of Going Clear on March 29 , 2015 . It was the network 's most successful documentary premiere since 2006 , attracting 1 @.@ 7 million viewers . 5 @.@ 5 million viewers were reported to have watched it within only two weeks of its TV première , making it the second most successful HBO documentary in the past decade after a 2013 film on the singer Beyoncé . Vimeo has acquired the US rights for online distribution from September 2015 . 
 = = = International = = = 
 The film has sold worldwide but is scheduled only for non @-@ theatrical release in most countries . The Church of Scientology undertook an intensive campaign to block its release internationally . According to Alex Gibney , " Every step of the way , every distributor , every festival has received multiple threatening letters from the Church of Scientology . Some have come very close to buckling . " The Sydney Film Festival was among those threatened but the screening of Going Clear went ahead ; Gibney declared himself to be " delighted with the way the Australians handled it . " However , Australian airline Qantas , which employs Scientologist John Travolta as an ambassador , was reported to have refused to show the film on its aircraft . 
 The film was shown in Denmark on DR2 as <unk> <unk> <unk> , on April 21 , 2015 , in Sweden on SVT1 as <unk> av <unk> on May 19 , and by VPRO in the Netherlands on NPO 2 on May 19 . It was released as in Italy as Going Clear : Scientology e la <unk> della <unk> on June 25 . 
 Sky Atlantic , a co @-@ distributor of the film , along with HBO Documentary Films , originally planned to broadcast Going Clear in the UK and Ireland soon after its US TV première . However , this was stalled due to potential legal problems . Because Northern Ireland is not subject to the Defamation Act 2013 , which reformed the libel laws in other parts of the UK , and because Sky cannot differentiate its signal between regions , the film may be subject to legal challenge in Northern Ireland . The Church of Scientology successfully blocked the publication or distribution of the original book Going Clear in the UK and Ireland and indicated a willingness to sue broadcasters , saying in a statement that it " will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions . " 
 The film eventually received a low @-@ key release in June 2015 in 18 theaters in England and Scotland . It was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK and Ireland , including Northern Ireland , on September 21 , 2015 , and attracted 88 @,@ 000 overnight viewers . By the start of October it had become Sky 's most @-@ watched documentary for three years , attracting a peak audience of 313 @,@ 000 viewers and an average of 243 @,@ 000 including catchup viewing .

 Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes collected 87 reviews as of September 24 , 2015 , of which 94 % were said to be positive . The site 's consensus states : " Thoroughly disquieting but impossible to ignore , Going Clear : Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a searing investigative work from a master documentarian . " Metacritic gave the film a score of 80 / 100 based on 11 critics . 
 Variety 's chief film critic , Scott Foundas , praised the level of detail in Going Clear and called it a " powder @-@ keg " documentary that illustrates " the dangers of blind faith . " Lesley Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter characterized it as an " impeccably assembled and argued film " that " represents a brave , timely intervention into debates around the organization that have been simmering for some time . " Slate called the film " a stunning exposé of an organization and religion too long shrouded in mystery . " Screen Daily 's Anthony Kaufman felt that some of the re @-@ enactments in the film were " heavy @-@ handed or sensationalistic , " but commended it overall as " a serious , strange and unsettling account of brainwashing , greed and gross misuses of power . " 
 Writing in The Guardian , Brian Moylan described Going Clear as " entertaining and dismaying viewing " in which " the story of Scientology , with all its strange players , emerges as comedy , rather than horror , " but criticised its reliance on a small group of defectors and the lack of any involvement by the church . He felt that this made the film " a bit one @-@ sided " and that it was " easy to be skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims made by former members . " Sasha Bronner of the Huffington Post called the film a " shocking and eye @-@ opening " work that would leave those who did not know much about Scientology " spellbound . " The BBC 's Owen Gleiberman praised it as " the most exciting – and disturbing – work of cinematic non @-@ fiction in a long time " and awarded Going Clear five stars , describing it as having " the scary intensity of a thriller . " 
 Following the initial HBO broadcast of Going Clear , Saturday Night Live aired a music video featuring the " Church of <unk> " , a parody of Scientology 's 1990 music video " We Stand Tall " , clips from which were shown in the documentary .

 Going Clear received a total of seven nominations for the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards . The film was nominated in the categories for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special , Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming , Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming , Sound Editing for Nonfiction Programming ( single or multi @-@ camera ) and Sound Mixing for Nonfiction Programming ( single or multi @-@ camera ) . Alex Gibney also received two nominations for Writing for Nonfiction Programming and Direction for Nonfiction Programming . 
 The film won in three Emmy categories : Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special , Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming . Gibney praised the " courageous support " of HBO executives and the " courage of witnesses who stood up against ... the human rights abuses " of Scientology . He suggested that a sequel to Going Clear might be in the works : " There 's a lot more material already that I 've received , more to come out — and so far the IRS has not revoked its [ tax @-@ exemption ] protection so there ’ s a lot more to be done . " . On December 1 , the film was selected as one of 15 shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature . It also won the Writers Guild of America 's award for Best Documentary released in 2015 . 
 = = Scientology reaction = = 
 Ten days before the film 's premiere , the Church of Scientology took out full @-@ page advertisements in The New York Times and Los Angeles Times to denounce Going Clear , comparing it to the story " A Rape on Campus " published by Rolling Stone magazine . Gibney subsequently said that he was grateful for the church 's advertising , as it had attracted much publicity for the film ; he only wished " they 'd put in showtimes " . The head of HBO Documentary Films , Sheila Nevins , commented that when she saw the adverts she knew that Going Clear would be a big success : " Docs don ’ t get full page ads , and when they do , they do really well . " 
 The church also published a " special report " attacking the film on one of its websites , started a new Twitter account which claimed to be " taking a resolute stand against the broadcasting and publishing of false information " and bought numerous ads around Google search results relating to the film in order to direct searchers to its anti @-@ Going Clear pages . Additionally , the church posted a series of short films on its website attacking the filmmakers and their interviewees , with titles such as " Alex Gibney Documentary ' Going Clear ' Propaganda " , " Marty Rathbun : A Violent Psychopath , " " Mike Rinder : The Wife <unk> , " " Sara Goldberg : The Home Wrecker " and " Paul Haggis : The <unk> of Hollywood " . 
 The church complained that Gibney had declined to interview 25 of its members whom it had put forward to him . According to Gibney , Miscavige , Travolta , and Cruise all declined interviews . Instead the church offered " a delegation of 25 unidentified individuals , presumably to smear the people in our film " , which did not interest him . The church also denounced the film 's interviewees as " the usual collection of obsessive , disgruntled former Church members kicked out as long as 30 years ago for malfeasance , who have a documented history of making up lies about the Church for money " . 
 = = = Campaign against film interviewees and critics = = = 
 According to Gibney , the church mounted an " organized " and " brutal " response to the appearance of its former members in the film : " Some of them have had physical threats , people threatening to take their homes away , private investigators following them . That 's the part that 's really heartbreaking . " In March 2015 , a New York private investigator named Eric <unk> pleaded guilty to the federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer hacking after he illegally gained access to at least 60 email accounts on behalf of undisclosed clients , one of the main ones reportedly being " someone who has done investigations on behalf of the Church of Scientology " . Among those targeted were Mike Rinder and the journalist Tony Ortega , both interviewees in the film . The names of <unk> 's clients were not revealed and prosecutors declined to pursue action against anyone else , citing a lack of evidence . A few weeks after the film 's TV première , Paul Haggis reported that a suspected Scientology spy posing as a reporter for Time magazine had attempted to interview him in a possible attempt to obtain material to use against him ; the Church denied the claim . Tony Ortega and another interviewee in the film , former Scientologist Marc Headley , reported that investigators from the church had surveilled them at Salt Lake City airport as they made their way to the festival . 
 The church contacted film critics complaining that their reviews of Going Clear were " filled with bald faced lies " and demanding that the critics should publish a church statement rebutting the film . Jason Bailey of Flavorwire wrote that " pretty much every critic who wrote about Going Clear " received an email from Scientology spokesperson Karin Pouw . He commented that the church did not seem to realise that film critics do not usually try to interview people for reviews , and noted how neatly it " <unk> with the film 's portrayal of the Church as a hive of shady , paranoid control freaks . " In an email to Flavorwire , Gibney observed that " anytime someone writes something – film criticism or social criticism – about Scientology , the Church of Scientology counter @-@ attacks by smearing critics . " 
 Indiewire 's Max O 'Connell criticised the church 's approach for being counterproductive . He predicted that " their campaign against the film is going to be the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for , if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and ( this is no small thing ) a nightmare for the ex @-@ CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church 's practices . But then , they don 't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn 't do a lot of good for your image . " Paul Haggis , who was labeled " doughy " and " pasty " by the church , likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring : " You don 't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way ? I 'm an imperfect human being . And I 've made many , many mistakes in my life . So you can absolutely publicize any of those . But this , really , ( you ’ re ) thinking that makes you look good ? " 
 The film @-@ makers reported receiving " lots of cards and letters " from the church , though in their case it had limited its response to " loads of legal paperwork " . HBO had earlier said that it had put " probably 160 lawyers " onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church . Sheila Nevins of HBO commented that she could not believe how aggressive the church had been . Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film , but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film : " I thought , ' They really don 't want us to do it . All the reason more to do it . ' "

 Following the film 's success at the Emmys , the church was reported to have mounted an aggressive campaign to deny it recognition at the Oscars . The church 's campaign included producing an anti @-@ Gibney film and approaches to members of the Academy 's documentary branch , responsible for selecting contenders for the awards . Several members of the documentary branch reported receiving approaches from the Church 's magazine Freedom in connection with a planned profile of Gibney . Although the Church denied that its actions had anything to do with the Oscars , Lawrence Wright suggested that its " more feverish attention to the documentary " had to do with it feeling " threatened by the possibility that [ the Hollywood ] community would examine the church more closely " as the Oscars approached . In January 2016 , according to the Hollywood Reporter , the film and Gibney were reported to have been “ snubbed ” by Oscar voters and not included in the Best Documentary category of the 88th Academy Awards .

 Timor @-@ Leste competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China which was held from August 8 to August 24 . The country 's participation at Beijing marked its second appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 2004 Summer Olympics . The delegation included Augusto Ramos Soares and Mariana Diaz Ximenez , both of whom were <unk> that qualified via wildcard places as the nation had no athletes that met the " A " or " B " qualifying standards .

 Timor @-@ Leste participated in two Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . The Timor @-@ Leste National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) selected two athletes via wildcards . Usually , an NOC would be able to enter up to 3 qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the " A " standard , or 1 athlete per event if they met the " B " standard . However , since Timor @-@ Leste had no athletes that met either standard , they were allowed to select two athletes , one of each gender , as wildcards . The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Beijing games were Augusto Ramos Soares in the Men 's marathon and Mariana Diaz Ximenez in the Women 's marathon .

 " Season 4 " is the first episode of the fourth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock , and the 59th episode overall . It was written by the series creator , executive producer and lead actress , Tina Fey and directed by series producer Don Scardino . The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) network in the United States on October 15 , 2009 . Guest stars in this episode include Steve Buscemi , Liz Holtan , and Paula Pell . 
 The episode takes place in 2009 as concerns rise over The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan ( TGS ) , a fictitious sketch comedy series . Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) is worried that the show no longer appeals to mainstream America . He tells Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) to return to his lower @-@ class roots and Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) to become more " country . " Meanwhile , Jack tasks Liz Lemon ( Fey ) with finding a new cast member for TGS . Finally , NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) grows angry over Jack 's large financial bonus , somewhat similar to the real @-@ world AIG bonus payments controversy . 
 " Season 4 " has received generally positive reviews from television critics . According to the Nielsen ratings system , the episode was watched by 6 @.@ 312 million households during its original broadcast , and received a 3 @.@ 0 rating / 8 share among viewers in the 18 – 49 demographic . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode opens with Jack welcoming Liz , Tracy , and Jenna to " Season 4 " , a fusion cuisine restaurant which serves the best @-@ selling food from the rest of America , " Cheesy Blasters " . Jack uses this to " teach ... a lesson " that they have " lost touch with the heartland of consumers . " He believes the cast and crew of TGS with Tracy Jordan have become too elitist and need to change to survive in tough economic times . Towards this goal Jack tells Tracy to reconnect with his roots and Jenna suggests that she can " go country " . 
 Despite the plans for Tracy and Jenna , Jack tells Liz — the head writer for TGS — to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image . Liz recruits TGS producer Pete Hornberger ( Scott Adsit ) to help in her search , planning trips to comedy clubs to find new talent . Both agree to try to keep the process secret from the cast and crew for fear that they would be angered over the idea of a new actor joining the cast . Liz and Pete give awkward answers trying to explain why they are going places together and ultimately tell the TGS writing staff . They also inadvertently tell Josh Girard ( Lonny Ross ) who , angered by the news , quits the show . 
 Meanwhile , Kenneth — an NBC page — goes to Jack worried that he cannot honestly sign his <unk> because Kenneth worked many overtime hours but NBC has stopped paying for it to save money . Jack convinces him to sign the sheet , but Kenneth later accidentally receives a large bonus check of Jack 's instead of his own paycheck . Kenneth grows angry over the bonus and leads a page strike . The strike grows in size as other trade unions join it , along with Tracy in an attempt to join the common man . Jack hires private detective Lenny Wosniak ( Steve Buscemi ) to try to end the strike , but he fails . Finally , Jack admits to Kenneth that he is a " big ol ' liar " and Kenneth ends the strike ( though he nearly reveals to the other pages it was over a personal matter ) .

 " Season 4 " was written by series creator , executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey , and directed by series producer Don Scardino . This was Fey 's eighteenth writing credit , and Scardino 's twenty @-@ second helmed episode . " Season 4 " originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 15 , 2009 , as the season premiere episode of the show 's fourth season and the 59th overall episode of the series . The episode was filmed on August 28 , September 1 , September 30 , and October 9 , 2009 . 
 Actor Steve Buscemi reprised his role as private investigator Lenny Wosniak for the fourth time , having appeared in " The Collection " , " The Natural Order " , and " Mamma Mia " . Buscemi directed the 30 Rock episode " Retreat to Move Forward " that was broadcast on January 22 , 2009 , during the show 's third season . Paula Pell , a producer and writer on the show , made her third appearance as the character Paula Hornberger , the wife of Pete Hornberger , played by Scott Adsit . 
 The episode somewhat parodies the AIG bonus payments controversy that occurred in March 2009 when it was publicly disclosed that AIG — an American insurance corporation — was paying approximately $ 200 million in bonus payments to employees of its financial services division . In the episode , NBC page Kenneth Parcell , along with other pages , wants to be paid for overtime , however , NBC has stopped paying for it to save money . Later , Kenneth receives General Electric executive Jack Donaghy 's large bonus check by accident and is angered by this , and as a result , Kenneth rallies all the pages to strike . Despite hiring Lenny to try and end the strike , Jack finally gives in to Kenneth 's demand . Television reviewer Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune noted that the strike here was similar to that of the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . 
 Part of this episode featured Liz Lemon and Pete going around comedy clubs looking to cast a new individual on TGS after Jack , Liz and Pete 's boss , explained that the show 's staff have become too elitist and need to change to survive in tough economic times , and that the addition of a new cast member would help lessen this elitist image . The search for a new cast member would continue throughout the season . The scene with Jenna Maroney pulling her intern 's ( Liz Holtan ) earring off , as Jenna believed that her intern wanted to be an actress , was originally meant for the season three episode " Gavin Volure " , but was instead featured on 30 Rock 's season three DVD as part of the deleted scenes in the Bonus feature . 
 Two filmed scenes from " Season 4 " were cut out from the airing . Instead , the scenes were featured on 30 Rock 's season four DVD as part of the deleted scenes in the Bonus feature . In the first scene , in the TGS make @-@ up room , Jenna asks Liz for a ride to Pennsylvania so that she can buy a Confederate Flag so that she can wear as a tube top on her appearance on Fox & Friends , however , Liz cannot give her a ride as she is busy . Kenneth stops by and informs Jenna that actress Mischa Barton is on the phone and wants to speak with her . Jenna , however , tells Kenneth to tell Barton that the deal is off as she has decided to go country . In the second scene , Jack and Lenny go through Kenneth 's page desk , while Kenneth is participating in the page strike . The two hope to find something that would damage Kenneth 's reputation but instead the two come up empty .

 IGN contributor Robert Canning reviewed the episode , giving it high marks saying it " proves yet again that 30 Rock is worthy of the Best Comedy Emmy " and scored the episode a 9 @.@ 2 out of 10 . Sean Gandert of Paste magazine also reviewed " Season 4 " , saying it did " little to disappoint and in fact starts the show off on much stronger footing than the first couple episodes of season 3 . " Gandert said the episode " doesn 't have quite as many truly classic moments as the show 's peaks in seasons one and two " but that " it also never really hits a sour note . " Bob Sassone of AOL 's TV Squad enjoyed the economic crisis , cutbacks , and corporate bonuses theme in the episode , explaining that one of the reasons he loves the show " is because it can take something that 's in the news and make it the plot of an episode without it feeling weird or forced . " Sassone wrote that despite " Season 4 " not being the best episode of 30 Rock " it was still very good . " TV Guide 's Michael Anthony commented that Steve Buscemi is " so weird and yet does it in such an endearing way . " Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times called Kenneth 's strike one of the more hilarious strikes in history . Entertainment Weekly 's Margaret Lyons noted that this episode of 30 Rock had strong moments " and was a solid start to the new season " . David Zurawik , a contributor for The Baltimore Sun , liked the episode and enjoyed Buscemi 's appearance , noting he " brings just the right mix of sleaze and smiles to the role . " The Chicago Sun @-@ Times ' Paige Wiser noted , " ... tonight 's season premiere , the hype is warranted : 30 Rock is in all its glory . " Kevin <unk> of Time Out magazine wrote that the best part from " Season 4 " was Tracy 's storyline after being told to reconnect with his roots . 
 Not all reviews were positive . David Hinckley of the New York Daily News reported that the season premiere episode " never quite [ found ] its rhythm . " Linda Stasi of the New York Post said that " Season 4 " had " some good laughs here , but there 's also the threat that 30 Rock could easily turn into that thing the writers relentlessly make fun of – TV shows and stars that are too smug , too smart and too out @-@ of @-@ touch for their own good . " The Kansas City Star 's Aaron Barnhart deemed it as " one of the weakest 30 Rock 's " he has ever seen and that he found the episode boring . 
 = Calgary Stampede = 
 The Calgary Stampede is an annual rodeo , exhibition and festival held every July in Calgary , Alberta , Canada . The ten @-@ day event , which bills itself as " The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth " , attracts over one million visitors per year and features one of the world 's largest rodeos , a parade , midway , stage shows , concerts , agricultural competitions , chuckwagon racing and First Nations exhibitions . 
 The event 's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair . In 1912 , American promoter Guy Weadick organized his first rodeo and festival , known as the Stampede . He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick 's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede . 
 Organized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders , the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world 's richest rodeos , one of Canada 's largest festivals and a significant tourist attraction for the city . Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada . However , both have been the target of increasing international criticism by animal welfare groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as animal rights organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general . 
 Calgary 's national and international identity is tied to the event . It is known as the " Stampede City " , carries the informal nickname of " Cowtown " and the local Canadian Football League team is called the Stampeders . The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede : office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes , residents don western wear and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and barbecues . 
 = = History = = 
 The Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west . The society held its first fair two years later , attracting a quarter of the town 's 2 @,@ 000 residents . By 1889 , it had acquired land on the banks of the Elbow River to host the exhibitions , but crop failures , poor weather , and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895 . The land passed briefly to future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett who sold it to the city . The area was called Victoria Park , after Queen Victoria , and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899 . 
 The exhibition grew annually , and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded Dominion Exhibition that year . Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself , the city spent C $ 145 @,@ 000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack . It held a lavish parade as well as rodeo , horse racing , and trick roping competitions as part of the event . The exhibition was a success , drawing 100 @,@ 000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25 @,@ 000 . 
 Guy Weadick , an American trick <unk> who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show , returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the " wild west " than the shows he was a part of . He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans , but with the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen , Weadick convinced businessmen Pat Burns , George Lane , A. J. McLean , and A. E. Cross to put up $ 100 @,@ 000 to guarantee funding for the event . The Big Four , as they came to be known , viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen . The city built a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over 100 @,@ 000 people attended the six @-@ day event in September 1912 to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada , the United States and Mexico compete for $ 20 @,@ 000 in prizes . The event generated $ 120 @,@ 000 in revenue and was hailed as a success . 
 Weadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede , promoting the event across North America . However , the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event . Businessmen in Winnipeg convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city , but the show failed financially . A third attempt held in New York State in 1916 suffered the same fate . Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of E. L. Richardson , the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition . The two convinced numerous Calgarians , including the Big Four , to back the " Great Victory Stampede " in celebration of Canada 's soldiers returning from World War I. 
 = = = Calgary Exhibition and Stampede = = = 
 While the 1919 Stampede was successful , it was again held as a one @-@ time event . Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition . However , declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson 's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting . Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis . Weadick agreed , and the union created the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede . 
 The combined event was first held in 1923 . Weadick encouraged the city 's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the " wild west " . Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time : Mayor George Webster followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six @-@ day event to accommodate street parties . The new sport of chuckwagon racing was introduced and proved immediately popular . 138 @,@ 950 people attended and the event earned a profit . Over 167 @,@ 000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently . 
 Attendance grew annually throughout the 1920s , peaking at 258 @,@ 496 in 1928 , but the onset of the Great Depression resulted in attendance declines and financial losses . After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931 , the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks , a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick . Furthering the divide was Weadick 's growing resentment of the board 's control of what he considered his event . The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation , ending with Weadick 's threat to quit entirely . One month later , the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties . Angered by the decision , Weadick sued the exhibition board for $ 100 @,@ 000 , citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal . His claim was upheld in courts , but he was awarded only $ 2 @,@ 750 plus legal fees . Embittered by the events , Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal . 
 At least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950 . The most profitable , the 1925 silent film The Calgary Stampede , used footage from the rodeo and exposed people across North America to the event . Hollywood stars and foreign dignitaries were attracted to the Stampede ; Bob Hope and Bing Crosby each served as parade marshals during the 1950s , while Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip made their first of two visits to the event as part of their 1959 tour of Canada . The Queen also opened the 1973 Stampede . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 The discovery of the Leduc No. 1 oil well in 1946 and major reserves in the Turner Valley area southwest of the city ushered in a period of growth and prosperity . Calgary was transformed from an agricultural community into the oil and gas capital of Canada . The city 's population nearly doubled between 1949 and 1956 , and Calgary 's immigrant population not only embraced the Stampede , but encouraged friends and family in their home towns to do the same . The 1950s represented the golden age of the Calgary Stampede . 
 Attendance records were broken nearly every year in the 1950s and overall attendance increased by 200 @,@ 000 from 1949 to 1959 . The growth necessitated expansion of the exhibition grounds . The 7 @,@ 500 @-@ seat Stampede Corral was completed in 1950 as the largest indoor arena in Western Canada . It housed the Calgary Stampeders hockey team , which was operated by the Board of Governors and won the Western Hockey League championship in 1954 . Acts such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and Louis Armstrong played the Corral , although the arena 's poor acoustics were a frequent concern to organizers and patrons . 
 Improvements were made to the grandstand and the race track was rebuilt in 1954 . The Big Four Building , named in honour of the Stampede 's benefactors , opened in 1959 to serve as the city 's largest exhibition hall in the summer , and was converted into a 24 @-@ sheet curling facility each winter . The improvements failed to alleviate all the pressures growth had caused : chronic parking shortages and inability to accommodate demand for tickets to the rodeo and grandstand shows continued . 
 Attendance continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s , topping 500 @,@ 000 for the first time in 1962 and reaching 654 @,@ 000 in 1966 . Organizers expanded the event from six days to nine in 1967 and then to ten the following year . The Stampede exceeded one million visitors for the first time in 1976 . The park , meanwhile , continued to grow . The Round @-@ Up Centre opened in 1979 as the new exhibition hall , and the Olympic Saddledome was completed in 1983 . The Saddledome replaced the Corral as the city 's top sporting arena , and both facilities hosted hockey and figure skating events at the 1988 Winter Olympics . 
 Maintaining the traditional focus on agriculture and western heritage remained a priority for the Calgary Stampede as the city grew into a major financial and oil hub in Western Canada . " Aggie Days " , a program designed to introduce urban schoolchildren to agriculture was introduced in 1989 and proved immediately popular . A ten @-@ year expansion plan called Horizon 2000 was released in 1990 detailing plans to grow Stampede Park into a year @-@ round destination for Calgarians ; an updated plan was released in 2004 . The organization dropped the word " exhibition " from its title in 2007 , and has since been known simply as the Calgary Stampede . Attendance has plateaued around 1 @.@ 2 million since 2000 , however the Stampede set an attendance record of 1 @,@ 409 @,@ 371 while celebrating its centennial anniversary in 2012 . 
 Severe flooding in Calgary two weeks before the July 5 opening of the 2013 Stampede caused significant damage to the grounds . Stampede officials promised , however , that the event would be staged as planned . Some of the main events , and all concerts , scheduled for the Saddledome were cancelled due to flood damage to the facility , while other events were relocated to other locations .

 The parade serves as the official opening of the Stampede and begins shortly before 9 a.m. on the first Friday of the event . Each year features a different parade marshal , chosen to reflect the public 's interests at that time . Politicians , athletes , actors and other dignitaries have all served as marshals . The event features dozens of marching bands , over 150 floats and hundreds of horses with entrants from around the world , and combines western themes with modern ones . Cowboys , First Nations dancers and members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in their red <unk> are joined by clowns , bands , politicians and business leaders . The first Stampede parade , held in 1912 , was attended by 75 @,@ 000 people , greater than the city 's population at the time . As many as 350 @,@ 000 people attended the parade in 2009 , while the presence of Prince William and Catherine , Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , at the 2011 parade as part of their tour of Canada increased attendance to a record estimate of 425 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Rodeo = = = 
 The rodeo is the heart of the Calgary Stampede . It is one of the largest , and the most famous event of its kind in the world . With a prize of $ 100 @,@ 000 to the winner of each major discipline and $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 total on championship day alone , it also offers the richest payout . Cowboys consider performing in front of over 20 @,@ 000 fans daily to be the highlight of the rodeo season . 
 There are six major disciplines – bull riding , barrel racing , steer wrestling , tie down roping , saddle bronc and bareback riding – and four novice events – junior steer riding , novice bareback , novice saddle bronc and wild pony racing . Each event is organized as its own tournament , and the cowboys and girls are divided into two pools . The first pool competes each night for the first four nights , and the second each night for four nights following . The top four in each pool advance to the Sunday final , and the remainder compete on Saturday for a wild card spot in the final . The competitor with the best time or score on Sunday wins the $ 100 @,@ 000 grand prize . 
 All livestock for the rodeo events come from the 22 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 89 km2 ) Stampede Ranch located near the town of Hanna . The ranch was created in 1961 as a means of improving the quality of bucking horses and bulls and to guarantee supply . The first of its kind in North America , the Stampede Ranch operates a breeding program that produces some of the top rodeo stock in the world and supplies rodeos throughout southern Alberta , and as far south as Las Vegas . 
 = = = Rangeland Derby = = = 
 Weadick is credited with inventing the sport of chuckwagon racing in 1923 , inspired either by seeing a similar event in 1922 at the Gleichen Stampede or watching impromptu races as he grew up . He devised the sport to be a new and exciting event for the newly joined Exhibition and Stampede . Weadick invited ranchers to enter their wagons and crews to compete for a total of $ 275 in prize money . 
 Called the Rangeland Derby , and nicknamed the " half @-@ mile of hell " , chuckwagon racing proved immediately popular and quickly became the event 's largest attraction . While only six teams raced in 1923 , today 's Rangeland Derby consists of 36 teams competing for $ 1 @.@ 15 million in prize money . Joe <unk> was the voice of the Rangeland Derby for 45 years , until 2008 . His distinctive voice and signature phrase of " and they 're <unk> ! " to announce the start of a race made him a local legend , and earned him induction into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2003 . 
 The chuckwagon drivers auction advertising space on their wagons before each year 's Stampede . The first advertisement on the tarp cover of a chuckwagon was made in 1941 , and Lloyd Nelson was the last person to win the Rangeland Derby without a sponsored wagon , doing so in 1956 . The current practice of selling advertising via a tarp auction began in 1979 . The revenue generated by the auctions , a record $ 4 million for the 2012 Stampede , is considered an indicator of the strength of Calgary 's economy . 
 = = = Exhibition = = = 
 When the agricultural exhibition was first launched in 1886 , Alberta was an overwhelmingly rural province . Today , agricultural producers make up less than two percent of the province 's population , but the exhibition remains an integral part of the Calgary Stampede . Nearly half of all visitors attend the exhibition , which is made up of 50 agricultural programs organized by more than 1 @,@ 000 exhibitors . Numerous competitions are held as part of the exhibition . The American National Cutting Horse Association sanctions a World Series of Cutting event , and the World Championship Blacksmith Competition attracts top blacksmiths from around the world . Farm and ranch demonstrations feature numerous breeds of livestock along with stock dog trials and team penning competitions . 
 Additionally , the exhibition serves to educate the public about Alberta 's ranching and agricultural heritage along with modern food production displays through events like Ag @-@ <unk> in the City . The Stampede works with Alberta 4 @-@ H clubs to encourage youth participation in agricultural pursuits , and has a partnership with Olds College that includes the operation of a satellite campus at Stampede Park .

 The Calgary Stampede midway has been operated by North American Midway Entertainment , and its predecessor Conklin Shows , since 1976 . The midway is the only part of the event operated on a for @-@ profit basis . It is considered an essential component of the Stampede , but is separate from the predominantly western theme . The midway opens on the Thursday night before other events begin , known as " sneak @-@ a @-@ peek " night . In addition to the traditional rides and carnival games , the midway features two concert areas . Nashville North , a large party tent , made its debut in 1993 as a country music venue . It was followed one @-@ year later by what is now known as the Coca @-@ Cola Stage that offers family entertainment during the day and rock and pop acts during the evenings . The Saddledome hosts headlining acts , including Garth Brooks and The Beach Boys , who were booked for the Stampede 's 100th anniversary in 2012 .

 The Stampede Market is located in the BMO Centre on the northwest corner of the park . It offers 38 @,@ 000 square metres ( 410 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of retail space and in 2011 had 181 vendors selling artwork , toys , household goods , foodstuffs and other items . The Western Oasis , a subsection of the market , offers cowboy and western @-@ themed artwork , bronze statues , craftwork , foods and wine . Lured by the opportunity to show their wares to the one million people who attend the Stampede , some vendors wait years before gaining admittance , and those that do consider it one of the prime events of the year . 
 = = Stampede Park = = 
 Stampede Park is located southeast of downtown Calgary in the Beltline District and is serviced by Calgary Transit 's light rail system . Permanent structures at the site include the Saddledome and Corral , Big Four Building , BMO Centre – a convention and exhibition facility – a casino , the Stampede Grandstand , the agriculture building , and a number of facilities that support the exhibition and livestock shows . 
 The park remains at its original location , though attempts were made to relocate . In 1964 , the Stampede Board made plans to purchase former military land in southwest Calgary near Glenmore Trail and 24 Street and relocate the park there . A fully developed plan was released in 1965 , and while it had the support of the civic and federal governments , intense opposition from nearby residents quashed the proposal . Space concerns remained a constant issue , and a new plan to push northward into the Victoria Park community beginning in 1968 initiated a series of conflicts with the neighbourhood and city council that persisted for decades . 
 While Victoria Park fell into steady decline , it was not until 2007 that the final buildings were removed , paving the way for both an expansion of Stampede Park and an urban renewal program for the area . With the land finally secured , the Stampede organization embarked on a $ 400 @-@ million expansion that is planned to feature a new retail and entertainment district , an urban park , a new agricultural arena and potentially a new hotel . The expansion was originally planned to be complete by 2011 , but delays and an economic downturn have pushed the expected completion of the project back to 2014 . 
 Stampede Park has long been a central gathering place for Calgarians and tourists . In addition to attendance at the Calgary Stampede , over 2 @.@ 5 million people attend other sporting events , concerts , trade shows and meetings on a grounds that hosts over 1 @,@ 000 events annually . 
 = = People = = 
 Each year , a queen and two princesses are selected as Stampede royalty . They are chosen via a contest open to any woman between the ages of 19 and 24 who resides in Alberta . An emphasis is placed on horsemanship skills and ability to serve as ambassadors for both the Stampede and the city . The first Stampede Queen , Patsy Rodgers , was selected in 1946 while the princesses were first chosen the following year . The royal trio serve one @-@ year terms during which they will make hundreds of appearances throughout southern Alberta and across North America . They then become members of the Calgary Stampede Queens ' Alumni Association , founded in 1971 . The association organizes fundraisers and events in support of organizations that work with special needs children . 
 = = = Native participation = = = 
 During each Stampede , the five nations of the Treaty 7 – the <unk> T 'ina , <unk> , Stoney , Kainai and <unk> – create an " Indian Village " on the bank of the Elbow River in the southern section of Stampede Park . They erect tipis , organize pow wows , offer arts and crafts , and re @-@ enact elements of their traditional lifestyle . Each year , an Indian Princess is selected from one of the five nations to represent the Treaty 7 as part of the Stampede 's royalty . The village is among the Stampede 's most popular attractions . 
 First Nations peoples had been frequent participants in the city 's exhibitions since they were first held in 1886 , taking part in parades and sporting events and entertaining spectators with traditional dances . By 1912 however , pressure from agents of the Department of Indian Affairs to suppress their historic traditions and to keep them on their farms nearly ended native participation . Weadick hoped to include native people as a feature of his Stampede , but Indian Affairs opposed his efforts and asked the Duke of Connaught , Canada 's Governor General , to support their position . The Duke refused , and after Weadick gained the support of political contacts in Ottawa , including future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett , the path was cleared . 
 Hundreds of First Nations peoples , representing six tribes , participated at the 1912 Stampede . They camped in tipis and wore their finest traditional regalia , making them among the most popular participants in the parade . Tom Three Persons , of the Blood ( Kainai ) tribe , emerged as one of the Stampede 's first heroes , amazing spectators with a winning performance in the saddle bronc competition . He was the only Canadian champion of the first Stampede and became the first person to successfully ride Cyclone , a notorious horse that had thrown over 100 riders during its career . 
 The federal government attempted to prevent a repeat occurrence , modifying the Indian Act in 1914 to make it illegal for natives to participate in fairs or parades without permission from the local Indian Agent . The new law ended native participation in the Calgary Exhibition , but when Weadick returned in 1919 , he successfully fought for their return to the fairgrounds . Indian Affairs again sought to ban native participation in 1925 without success . While conflicts between the Stampede and Indian Affairs continued until 1932 , the Indian Village has remained a staple on the grounds . 
 First Nations members and the Stampede board have occasionally met with conflict . The original location of the Indian Village was on low @-@ lying ground that frequently flooded , a problem that was not resolved until 1974 when the village was moved its current location . Complaints about low appearance fees paid to tipi owners , lack of input on committees related to their participation and accusations that natives were being exploited have periodically been made throughout the years . The Stoneys famously boycotted the 1950 Stampede following a rule change that cancelled a policy giving any native person free admittance upon showing their treaty card . The event that year was marred by violent thunderstorms , which led to apocryphal stories that the band had performed a rain dance in an effort to ruin the fair . 
 Despite the conflicts , the native communities around Calgary have been enthusiastic supporters of the Stampede and the Indian Village . The tipi owners have been long @-@ term participants – many are third or fourth generation – and the Stampede has helped preserve and display native culture to the public . The village will again relocate in 2016 . It will double in size and feature a new exhibit displaying the partnership between the city , local nations and the Stampede . 
 = = = Employment and volunteerism = = = 
 Operation of the park throughout the year requires 300 full @-@ time and 1 @,@ 400 part @-@ time employees . An additional 3 @,@ 500 seasonal workers are hired for the Stampede itself . The seasonal positions are often filled by Calgary 's youth , and for many , represents their first paying jobs . The organization is maintained by a legion of volunteers , however . Over 2 @,@ 000 volunteers sit on 50 committees responsible for all aspects of the Stampede 's operation . Chief among them are the board of directors . The board is made up of 25 individuals ; 20 elected from amongst the shareholders , three representing the city , one the province and the most recent president of the Stampede board . Nearly half of all volunteers have served for more than 10 years , and some as long as 60 . 
 = = = Young Canadians and the Stampede Showband = = = 
 When the Calgary Stampede brought in The Rockettes from New York as part of the 1964 grandstand show , they auditioned local youth to participate as the " Calgary Kidettes " . It was intended to be a one @-@ time addition , but proved immensely popular with spectators , and both The Rockettes and Kidettes returned in the following years . The Kidettes were renamed the Young Canadians in 1968 and not only remained a staple of the grandstand show , but grew into a headlining act by the late 1970s . Within nine years of their creation , the Young Canadians were playing shows throughout Canada and the northern United States and performing in front of over 200 @,@ 000 people every year . In 1982 , the Stampede Foundation set up the Young Canadians School of Performing Arts . Supported by both the Calgary public and Catholic school boards , the school offers professional training to singers and dancers between the ages of 7 and 19 paid for by scholarships from the Stampede organization . 
 The Stampede Showband was created in 1971 to serve as the organization 's musical ambassadors . The troupe features over 150 members between the ages of 16 and 21 , and has been named the world champion of marching show bands five times , lastly being in August 2014 . The group has performed all over the world , in front of royalty and world leaders , and at the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Winter Olympics . The Showband performs year round , and make over 100 appearances during the Stampede alone . They performed in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena , California for the third time in 2012 as part of the Stampede 's 100th anniversary celebrations . The Stampede <unk> were created in 1985 as a precision equestrian drill team and colour guard that accompanies the Showband . 
 = = Animal welfare = = 
 The Stampede has attempted to balance rodeo tradition against the concerns of animal welfare groups who argue that the sport is inhumane . Officials defend the sport , calling the animals the " stars of the show " and stating that the Stampede is " passionate about the proper treatment of animals " . The Calgary Humane Society has found itself at odds with other organizations by choosing to work with the Stampede to ensure that stress on the animals is kept to a minimum . It is one of two such groups , in addition to veterinarians , who are on hand to monitor the rodeo . 
 Chuckwagon racing is a particular source of controversy . Animal rights groups protest the event , arguing that the sport causes undue suffering for the horses . Racers admit the sport is dangerous , but defend their sport amidst the controversy , arguing that the animals are well cared for , and that allowing them to race saves many horses from prematurely going to slaughter . 
 Following a particularly deadly series of accidents in 1986 where nine horses were killed in chuckwagon racing incidents alone – including five horses in one spectacular crash – humane society officials , fans and even some drivers called for major changes to the races , while others called for the sport to be banned entirely . Numerous rule changes were announced prior to the 1987 event . The Calgary chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accepted the changes , stating it would not call for the sport to be banned given that Stampede officials had moved to improve animal safety , further changes were announced in 2011 . 
 Tie down roping is a particular focus of efforts to eliminate the event . The Stampede altered its policies in 2010 to enforce the rules of the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association . Additionally , the Stampede was the first rodeo to introduce a no @-@ time penalty for competitors who make a dangerous tackle in the steer wrestling event . Several more changes were made in 2011 , the rule changes were announced after six animals died at the 2010 Stampede and were met with mixed reactions from both cowboys and animal welfare groups . 
 Such changes have not completely eliminated all risks ; periodic accidents have continued to result in the deaths of horses and livestock . One of the deadliest incidents in Stampede history occurred in 2005 when , late in a trail ride meant to help celebrate the province 's centennial , a group of about 200 horses spooked and in the melee nine horses were killed after they were pushed off a city bridge into the Bow River . While similar trail rides had been completed without incident in the past , Stampede officials announced they would not attempt any further rides unless they could ensure the safety of the horses . 
 Animal welfare groups have called animal deaths " depressingly predictable " and seek a boycott of the rodeo . In the United Kingdom travel agencies have been asked to stop offering tourism packages to the Stampede , and in 2010 , 92 members of the UK Parliament signed an Early Day Motion asking their Canadian counterparts to ban rodeo . Several groups petitioned the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to cancel their planned attendance in 2011 . However , the couple attended and participated in a private demonstration of rodeo and chuckwagon events .

 The festival spirit during Stampede extends throughout the city . Parade day serves as an unofficial holiday as many companies give employees half or full days off to attend . People of all walks of life , from executives to students , discard formal attire for casual western dress , typically represented by Wrangler jeans and cowboy hats . Many Calgarians have reduced productivity during the event because they take a relaxed attitude towards their usual workplace and personal responsibilities . However , the community and corporate events held during the Stampede create social networking opportunities and help newcomers acclimatize to the city . The Stampede is an important stop for political leaders as part of their annual summer tours of the country , sometimes called the barbecue circuit . 
 = = = Pancake breakfasts = = = 
 The pancake breakfast is a local institution during Stampede . Dozens are held throughout the city each day , hosted by community groups , corporations , churches , politicians and the Stampede itself . The tradition of pancake breakfasts dates back to the 1923 Stampede when a chuckwagon driver by the name of Jack Morton invited passing citizens to join him for his morning meals . 
 The largest is the breakfast hosted at the Chinook Centre shopping mall . Four hundred volunteers are required to feed over 60 @,@ 000 people who attend the one @-@ day event that had its 50th anniversary in 2010 . Other groups , such as the Calgary Stampede Caravan , feed as many as 120 @,@ 000 people over ten days . The rising popularity of the barbecue grill in the 1960s and the city 's population boom at the time brought with it the growth of community and company barbecues throughout the city during Stampede . Community booster groups have exported the tradition across the country as a symbol of Calgary 's hospitality . Among them are the Calgary Grey Cup Committee , whose volunteers have hosted pancake breakfasts on the day of the Canadian Football League championship game for over three decades , sometimes in spite of poor weather conditions for the annual November contest . 
 = = = Stampede parties = = = 
 The size and number of parties each year during Stampede is viewed as an indicator of Calgary 's economic strength . Corporations and community groups hold lavish events throughout the city for their staff and clients , while bars and pubs erect party tents , the largest of which draws up to 20 @,@ 000 people per day . Paul Vickers , who owns several establishments in the city , estimates that he makes up to 20 percent of his annual revenue during the ten days of Stampede alone . Some parties have become known for heavy drinking and relaxed morals , so much so that one hotel 's satirical ad promising to safely store a patron 's wedding ring during Stampede was widely viewed as a legitimate offer . The parties are not without consequences , as lawyers have noted a significant increase in divorce filings in the weeks following the Stampede , primarily on claims of infidelity . Clinics see an increase in people seeking testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases , and Calgary is said to experience an annual baby boom each April – nine months after the event . 
 = = Relationship with the city = = 
 The Stampede has become inexorably linked to the city 's identity . Calgary has long been called the " Stampede City " , and carries the informal nickname of " Cowtown " . The event 's iconic status offers Calgary global publicity and plays a significant role in defining the city 's image . Calgary 's Canadian Football League team has been called the Stampeders since 1945 , and it is a name shared by other teams in various sports throughout the city 's history , including the Stampeders hockey team that operated in the years following World War II . 
 The Stampede has strong polling support within the province . A 2006 Ipsos @-@ Reid poll found that 86 percent of Albertans felt that it raised the civic quality of life and considered it one of the region 's most important cultural events . Nearly three in four stated they look forward to the annual event . However , critics argue that the themes promoted by the Stampede and within the city are an invented tradition . They suggest that it is not a reflection of Alberta 's frontier history , but represents a mythical impression of western cowboy culture created by 19th @-@ century wild west shows and exploited for profit . 
 Part of the event 's success can be attributed to the close relationship the Stampede has often shared with both the civic government and community leaders . Mayors of Calgary and city aldermen have sat on the Stampede Board of Governors at the same time they occupied public office , and the Stampede 's ability to convince wealthy and influential citizens to volunteer their time has allowed the organization to gain a high profile within the city . The Stampede operates on city @-@ owned land , pays no property tax on its lease , and typically faces little to no political interference from City Hall . It operates as a non @-@ profit entity with all income reinvested into the park . All improvements to the park would revert to city control if the lease were allowed to expire . 
 Likewise , the Stampede has support from the media , which has been accused of providing an inordinate amount of positive coverage to the event while trivializing negative aspects . The local media faced national scrutiny in 2009 when both major newspapers refused to run anti @-@ rodeo ads sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society . While the Calgary Herald simply refused to run the ad , the Calgary Sun defended its position in an editorial . The Sun refuted charges it was kowtowing to the Stampede and justified its refusal by claiming " we are Calgarians and allowing a group of outsiders to come in and insult a proud Calgary tradition seemed just plain wrong . " The Herald reversed its decision a year later , running a full @-@ page ad sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society . 
 = = = Economic impact and tourism = = = 
 While 70 percent of Stampede attendees are from the Calgary region , officials work to promote the event across the globe . As such , the Calgary Stampede is known around the world . The Stampede draws foreign visitors primarily from the United States , the United Kingdom and Australia , and is experiencing growing attendance by tourists from Asia and South America . 
 Stampede officials estimated in 2009 that the city of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $ 172 @.@ 4 million from the ten @-@ day event alone , with a wider provincial total of $ 226 @.@ 7 million . In terms of economic impact , the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada , ahead of Ottawa 's <unk> , the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto , and the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal . Additionally , Stampede officials estimate that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park , tourists spend $ 2 @.@ 65 in the rest of the city . A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $ 150 – $ 400 over the course of the event , and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that . 
 = = = Promoting Calgary = = = 
 Civic leaders have consistently made note of the Stampede 's impact on the city . Mayor Andrew Davison claimed in 1944 that the event " had done more to advertise Calgary than any single agency , " an opinion that has been echoed by his successors . Stampede officials have made similar claims , arguing that the event is one of Canada 's most important tourist attractions . The Canadian Tourism Commission placed the event in its Signature Experiences Collection , one of six such events or locations in Alberta . 
 According to Ralph Klein , former mayor of Calgary and premier of Alberta , the Stampede symbolizes the province 's spirit . He cited the friendly and welcoming attitude and festival spirit of the city 's populace during the event , which community booster groups export around the world . Among examples cited was the infamous 1948 Grey Cup game in which two trains of Stampeder football fans descended on Toronto and launched an unprecedented series of celebrations before , during and after the game that included riding a horse into the lobby of the Royal York Hotel . The events helped turn the Grey Cup into a national festival and the largest single @-@ day sporting event in the country . 
 = The Rings of Akhaten = 
 " The Rings of Akhaten " is the seventh episode of the seventh series of the British science @-@ fiction drama Doctor Who , first broadcast on BBC One on 6 April 2013 . It was written by Neil Cross and directed by Farren Blackburn . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) takes his new companion Clara Oswald ( Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman ) to the Rings of Akhaten , where several planets revolve around a larger one . They attend a religious festival where the young Queen of Years , Merry <unk> ( Emilia Jones ) , is about to be sacrificed . Determined to save Merry , the Doctor and Clara come face @-@ to @-@ face with the parasite of Akhaten , who requires memories , stories , and items of sentimental value . 
 Cross was asked to write the episode after the success of scripting and shooting " Hide " , a later episode . " The Rings of Akhaten " , as Clara 's first trip to an alien world , was intended to show the wonders of the universe instead of the Doctor getting his new companion trapped somewhere less glamorous , a trend that had been observed in the history of the programme . The episode also explores Clara 's backstory . Filmed entirely in @-@ studio in late October 2012 , pre @-@ made moulds were utilised for the many different aliens to save money . " The Rings of Akhaten " was watched by 7 @.@ 45 million viewers in the UK and received a mixed reception regarding its emotion and plot .

 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 Following the events of " The Bells of Saint John " , in which he encountered a third version of Clara , the Doctor decides to learn more about his new companion and travels into her past to observe her . He finds that her parents met by a chance encounter caused by a gust of wind blowing a leaf into her father 's face and discovers that her mother died while Clara was a teenager . The Doctor goes back to the present and collects Clara , then takes her to the Rings of Akhaten , where they observe a series of planetoids orbiting a planet , with a shining pyramid on one of them . The Doctor takes Clara to a giant alien marketplace and introduces her to several aliens , including a merchant named Dor 'een who attempts to rent them a space bike . The market does not use hard currency but rather trades in items of sentimental value ; this appalls Clara , who believes sentimental items should be cherished and not given away . She becomes separated from the Doctor and encounters a little girl ( Emilia Jones ) who appears to be running and hiding . Clara catches up to her and she explains that her name is Merry <unk> , the Queen of Years . Merry tells Clara that she is hiding because she is supposed to sing a song at a ceremony and she is afraid to get it wrong . Clara reassures her by telling her what her mother once said , and Merry heads to the ceremony . 
 The Doctor and Clara attend the ceremony , where the Doctor explains that since the Rings were settled there has been a constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep . The people fear that the god , which they call Grandfather , will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted . Merry begins singing , joined by a chorister at the pyramid . During the song , a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken . Merry panics , believing she got the song wrong . A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her , and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy . The Doctor and Clara find Dor 'een and rent the space bike using Clara 's mother 's ring as payment . They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry 's soul . The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather . As they attempt to leave , a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself . The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room , but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free . A ray of light strikes the planet , revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself , a planet @-@ sized parasitic creature . 
 Clara and Merry flee back to the ceremony and the Doctor faces the creature , realising it feeds off memories , stories , and feelings . He tries to overfeed it by offering the sum total of his Time Lord memories ; Merry also leads the citizens in a song of hope , confusing Akhaten who then disappears . However , The Doctor 's memories are not enough to sate the creature and Akhaten reappears , Clara returns to help . She offers Akhaten the leaf that blew into her father 's face on the day he met her mother , which contains an infinite amount of untold potential that Clara 's mother never saw because she died early . Akhaten , overwhelmed by the infinite potential it has consumed , implodes on itself and the Rings are saved . The Doctor returns Clara to her home on the same day they left and gives her back her mother 's ring , telling her that all the creatures she saved wanted her to have it back . Suddenly Clara remembers seeing the Doctor at her mother 's funeral and asks why he was there . He tells her that she reminds him of someone who died and she rebukes him for using her as a replacement , but he assures her she is not a replacement and Clara leaves . However , the moment she is gone , the Doctor 's expression becomes grim and closes the TARDIS door that Clara left from . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 In " The Bells of Saint John " , the Doctor finds a preserved leaf pressed between the pages of Clara 's book , 101 Places to See . Clara enigmatically refers to it as " page one " . The opening scene in " The Rings of Akhaten " explains this statement , showing how a mishap involving the leaf led to her parents ' first meeting . The Doctor mentions to Clara that he had visited Akhaten long ago with his granddaughter . This is a reference to Susan Foreman , the Doctor 's granddaughter and companion who travelled with the First Doctor . 
 = = Production = = 
 Writer Neil Cross was a Doctor Who fan , but had never had the time to write an episode . Executive producer Caroline Skinner , who was new with the seventh series , knew him and offered to work his schedule around writing an episode ; he was willing to do it . Executive producer and lead writer Steven Moffat was pleased to have Cross join , as he was a showrunner in his own right with Luther . Cross had written the ninth episode of the series , " Hide " , which was liked by the producers and so Cross was asked to write " The Rings of Akhaten " when he was in the UK after " Hide " had completed filming . Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman named " The Rings of Akhaten " one of her favourites of the second half of the seventh series , as it was the first adventure for Clara which allowed the audience to watch the story " [ begin ] again " . 
 The concept behind having the episode based around an alien planet occurred to Moffat , Skinner , and producer Marcus Wilson when realising they had done big location pieces in the first half of the series with " A Town Called Mercy " and " The Angels Take Manhattan " , but had none for the second half . They decided to do a story set in " a world created in our studios to make you really feel you 're out there " , rather than having the Doctor " promise unearthly wonders to his companions , and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel " . As such , the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised . The production team aimed to show " the best alien planet " on Doctor Who . The episode originally had a different pre @-@ credits sequence , which consisted of a long scene in the kitchen in which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities to her job , and the boy she takes care of asks if the Doctor is her boyfriend . Cross 's intent was to juxtapose this " mundane " scene with the vast scale of the planet . However , Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf , an idea Moffat approved of . Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech , which Cross likened to " facing down one of Lovecraft 's Old Gods : an alien so alien that it 's practically a supernatural being . " Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day . After thinking about it for a while , Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution . 
 The read @-@ through for " The Rings of <unk> " was held on 17 October 2012 , with filming beginning the next week on 22 October . Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " . According to Matt Smith , there were " between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens " in a scene set in an alien market . The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick @-@ ups or reshoots for " Nightmare in Silver " . Millennium FX 's Neill Gorton remarked that he had " always wanted to do a scene like the Star Wars cantina " and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future , as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget . Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources . For example , Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked , " We 've always wanted to have a speeder @-@ bike like in Return of the Jedi and we know how to do it inexpensively , so can you get one into the story ? " However , Cross felt that the speeder @-@ bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon . The songs were written by composer Murray Gold . To help establish the year at the beginning of the episode " Ghost Town " by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano . The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who @-@ themed edition on 15 May 2013 .

 The episode received mixed reviews . Neela Debnath of The Independent called it " heart @-@ warming " and felt that centering the episode around a child " adds something " . She also praised the aesthetics and the caring nature of Clara 's character . Zap2it 's Geoff Berkshire shared similar sentiments , and also praised Emilia Jones ' performance . Both Debnath and Berkshire likened the storytelling to the Russell T Davies era ( 2005 – 2010 ) . The Guardian reviewer Dan Martin described the story as " slight and straightforward [ but ] told it in broad and effective strokes " with " gorgeous " visuals . He particularly praised the emotional effectiveness of the ending , but felt that " The Mummy " , although visually impressive , was " a little bit of a squib after all the build @-@ up " . 
 IGN 's Mark Snow gave " The Rings of Akhaten " a rating of 7 @.@ 2 out of 10 . He wrote that Akhaten " felt like a fully formed world " but criticised the resolution and the Mummy 's appearance . Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode three and a half out of five stars and called it " a mixed bag ... but still with enough elements of uniqueness to demonstrate , almost 50 years on , just why there is still nothing like Doctor Who on television " . He wrote that the religion and singing was well @-@ realised , but felt the " mind parasite " was too similar to the Great Intelligence which was featured the previous week , and also thought the many aliens " gave more than a hint of trying too hard and did not get things off to the best of starts " . Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery praised Clara and the monsters , but felt that after a good build @-@ up the episode fell apart at its climax , which he felt was " far too fantastical " . 
 SFX reviewer Richard Edwards was more negative , giving the episode three stars out of five . He felt that the story had a lot of interesting ideas but then became standard . He also criticised the use of the sonic screwdriver and the Doctor 's monologue , which he felt had been overused too much recently , but said that the episode was saved by Clara . Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was also disappointed , saying that it " amounts to little more than series of events and has a more preposterous premise than usual " . He questioned the physics and noted that there was not much of an ending and surprisingly found Smith not up to his usual performance . Doctor Who Magazine reviewer Graham Kibble @-@ White also reacted negatively , writing , " There wasn 't a wet eye in the house , as pathos run <unk> amok , " and claimed it " by some stretch the least awesome Doctor Who we 've encountered for a long time . " He also claimed it seemed like " Cross hadn 't seen an episode since the 1980s " and that " even the leftfield mention of the Time War feels as if it 's come from a quick consult with Wikipedia . " Additionally , he felt that it could be " <unk> " and complained that it was " turning the aliens into a freak show , something to be <unk> at , rather than truly met . " 
 Cross acknowledged that " The Rings of Akhaten " had received a mixed reception and was originally bothered by some of the criticisms . However , he said he was cheered up by children between the ages of nine and fifteen who had experienced bullying and wrote to him saying that they had been inspired by the episode . One girl told him it had changed her mind about suicide . 
 = M @-@ 129 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 129 is a state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan . It runs from Cedarville to Sault Ste . Marie . South of Nine Mile Road in Chippewa County ( and in all of Mackinac County ) , M @-@ 129 overlays the Michigan Meridian . The section of M @-@ 129 that overlays the meridian is named Meridian Road . The highway between M @-@ 48 and the northern terminus is a part of the larger Lake Huron Circle Tour . 
 Originally a part of M @-@ 12 and US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) , the current roadway was formerly designated M @-@ 5 from 1930 until 1939 . Two other highways were also previously designated M @-@ 129 . The first was in the western UP in the late 1920s ; it was replaced by M @-@ 64 . The second was in the Keweenaw Peninsula and was replaced by M @-@ 26 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 129 starts at an intersection between Meridian Road and M @-@ 134 in Cedarville . This intersection is northwest of Lake Huron and a ferry connection to the 4 @-@ mile ( 6 km ) long La Salle Island , part of Les <unk> Islands . The islands are a quiet tourist destination that Hunt 's Guide to Michigan 's Upper Peninsula describes as " off the beaten tourist track " and full of " low @-@ key charm " . From here north , M @-@ 129 follows the Michigan Meridian on Meridian Road . The highway forms part of the north – south Mackinac – Chippewa county line as it approaches the community of Pickford . South of Pickford , M @-@ 129 and M @-@ 48 merge along Meridian Road at 26 Mile Road . M @-@ 129 picks up the Lake Huron Circle Tour designation and the two roads cross together over the Munuscong River , which empties into Munuscong Lake , a part of the St. Marys River . These two highways run concurrently through Pickford to 22 Mile Road . 
 At 22 Mile Road , M @-@ 48 turns westerly and M @-@ 129 continues north . This intersection is also the location of the <unk> Golf Club . M @-@ 129 meets the eastern termini of M @-@ 80 and M @-@ 28 at 17 Mile Road and 9 Mile Road , respectively . Just before meeting 9 Mile Road , M @-@ 129 jogs to the east , leaving Meridian Road to meet up with McKnight Road , which runs parallel to the Michigan Meridian . McKnight Road and I @-@ 75 run roughly parallel approaching Sault Ste . Marie from the south . At 3 Mile Road , M @-@ 129 enters the city of Sault Ste . Marie east of the southern terminus of BS I @-@ 75 , and the roadway is renamed Ashmun Street . When BS I @-@ 75 meets Ashmun Street , M @-@ 129 ends and BS I @-@ 75 takes over the Ashmun Street name into downtown . M @-@ 129 ends south of the Lake Superior State University campus , home of the annual Banished Words List .

 = Caloboletus calopus = 
 Caloboletus calopus , commonly known as the bitter beech bolete or scarlet @-@ stemmed bolete , is a fungus of the bolete family , found in Asia , Northern Europe and North America . Appearing in coniferous and deciduous woodland in summer and autumn , the stout fruit bodies are attractively coloured , with a beige to olive cap up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) across , yellow pores , and a reddish stipe up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) long and 5 cm ( 2 in ) wide . The pale yellow flesh stains blue when broken or bruised . 
 Christiaan Persoon first described Boletus calopus in 1801 . Modern molecular phylogenetics showed that it was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus ; Caloboletus was erected in 2014 , with C. calopus designated as the type species . Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking , there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe . Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species , such as Boletus edulis . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Caloboletus calopus was originally published under the name Boletus olivaceus by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774 , but this name is unavailable for use as it was later sanctioned for another species . Johann Friedrich Gmelin 's 1792 synonym Boletus <unk> is also illegitimate . Christiaan Hendrik Persoon described the mushroom in 1801 ; its specific name is derived from the Greek <unk> / <unk> ( " pretty " ) and πους / pous ( " foot " ) , referring to its brightly coloured stipe . The German name , <unk> or " pretty @-@ foot bolete " , is a literal translation . Alternate common names are scarlet @-@ stemmed bolete and bitter beech bolete . 
 Other synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers to Dictyopus by Lucien Quélet in 1886 , and Tubiporus by René Maire in 1937 . Boletus frustosus , originally published as a distinct species by Wally Snell and Esther Dick in 1941 , was later described as a variety of B. calopus by Orson K. Miller and Roy Watling in 1968 . <unk> and Lannoy described the variety <unk> and the form <unk> from Europe in 2001 . 
 In his 1986 infrageneric classification of the genus Boletus , Rolf Singer placed C. calopus as the type species of the section <unk> , which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh , bitter taste , and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls . Other species in section <unk> include C. radicans , C. inedulis , B. peckii , and B. pallidus . Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that C. calopus and many ( but not all ) red @-@ pored boletes were part of a dupainii clade ( named for Boletus ( now Rubroboletus ) dupainii ) , well @-@ removed from the core group of the type species B. edulis and relatives within the Boletineae . This indicated it needed placement in a new genus . This took place in 2014 , B. calopus was transferred to ( and designated the type species of ) the new genus Caloboletus by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini .

 Up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) or rarely 20 cm ( 8 in ) in diameter , the cap is beige to olive and initially almost globular before opening out to a hemispherical and then convex shape . The surface of the cap is smooth or has minute hairs , and sometimes develops cracks with age . The cap cuticle hangs over the cap margin . The pore surface is initially pale yellow before deepening to an olive @-@ yellow in maturity , and quickly turns blue when it is injured . The pores , numbering one or two per millimetre , are circular when young but become more angular as the mushroom ages . The tubes are up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) deep . 
 The attractively coloured stipe is typically yellow above to pink @-@ red below , with a straw @-@ coloured network ( reticulation ) near the top or over the upper half ; occasionally the entire stipe is reddish . It measures 7 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long by 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick , and is either fairly equal in width throughout , or thicker towards the base . Sometimes , the reddish stipe colour of mature mushrooms or harvested specimens that are a few days old disappears completely , and is replaced with ochre @-@ brown tones . The pale yellow flesh stains blue when broken , the discolouration spreading out from the damaged area . Its smell can be strong , and has been likened to ink . The spore print is olive to olive @-@ brown . Spores are smooth and elliptical , measuring 13 – 19 by 5 – 6 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 30 – 38 by 9 – 12 µm . The cystidia are club @-@ shaped to spindle @-@ shaped , hyaline , and measure 25 – 40 by 10 – 15 µm . 
 Variety frustosus is morphologically similar to the main type , but its cap becomes areolate ( marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices ) in maturity . Its spores are slightly smaller too , measuring 11 – 15 by 4 – 5 @.@ 5 µm . In the European form <unk> , the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules , while the variety <unk> has pinkish @-@ red pores . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 The overall colouration of Caloboletus calopus , with its pale cap , yellow pores and red stipe , is not shared with any other bolete . Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus , and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores . Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus <unk> but the stipes of this species are not reticulated . Edible species such as B. edulis lack a red stipe . It closely resembles the similarly inedible C. radicans , which lacks the redness on the stipe . Like C. calopus , the western North American species C. <unk> also has a bitter taste , similarly coloured cap , and yellowish pores that bruise blue , but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe . Found in northwestern North America , B. <unk> lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe , and has a darker , olive @-@ grey to deep brown cap . 
 Two eastern North American species , C. inedulis and C. <unk> , also have an appearance similar to C. calopus . C. inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish @-@ white cap , while C. <unk> associates solely with hemlock . C. firmus , found in the eastern United States , eastern Canada , and Costa Rica , has a pallid cap colour , reddish stipe , and bitter taste , but unlike C. calopus , has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation . C. <unk> , a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013 , bears a resemblance to C. calopus , but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface , or microscopically by the amyloid @-@ staining cells in the flesh of the cap , and morphologically distinct cystidia on the stipe . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 An ectomycorrhizal species , Caloboletus calopus grows in coniferous and deciduous woodland , often at higher altitudes , especially under beech and oak . Fruit bodies occur singly or in large groups . The species grows on chalky ground from July to December , in Northern Europe , and North America 's Pacific Northwest and Michigan . In North America , its range extends south to Mexico . Variety frustosus is known from California and the Rocky Mountains of Idaho . In 1968 , after comparing European and North American collections , Miller and Watling suggested that the typical form of C. calopus does not occur in the United States . Similar comparisons by other authors have led them to the opposite conclusion , and the species has since been included in several North American field guides . The bolete has been recorded from the Black Sea region in Turkey , from under Populus ciliata and Abies <unk> in Rawalpindi and <unk> Gali in Pakistan , Yunnan Province in China , Korea , and Taiwan . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Although it is an attractive @-@ looking bolete , Caloboletus calopus is not considered edible on account of its very bitter taste , which does not disappear upon cooking . There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine . The bitter taste is largely due to the compounds calopin and a δ @-@ lactone derivative , O @-@ <unk> A. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3 @-@ <unk> unit , which is rare in natural products . A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003 . 
 The pulvinic acid derivatives <unk> acid , variegatic acid , and xerocomic acid are present in B. calopus mushrooms . These compounds inhibit cytochrome P450 — major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and <unk> . Other compounds found in the fruit bodies include calopin B , and the sesquiterpenoid compounds <unk> and <unk> A and B. The latter two highly oxygenated compounds have significant free @-@ radical scavenging activity in vitro . The compounds 3 @-@ <unk> ( 47 @.@ 0 % of total volatile compounds ) , 3 @-@ octanol ( 27 @.@ 0 % ) , 1 @-@ octen @-@ 3 @-@ ol ( 15 @.@ 0 % ) , and limonene ( 3 @.@ 6 % ) are the predominant volatile components that give the fruit body its odour .

 Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson , who has just made her Broadway musical debut . A meteorite lands near Central Park , and an extraterrestrial symbiote attaches itself to Peter 's moped . Meanwhile , police pursue escaped prisoner and robber Flint Marko , who falls into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body on a microscopic level with the surrounding sand , transforming him into Sandman . Harry Osborn attacks Peter with new weapons based on his father 's Green Goblin technology , leading to partial amnesia , which makes him forget his revenge . 
 During a festival honoring Spider @-@ Man , Marko robs an armored car . NYPD Captain George Stacy tells Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben 's killer , and the deceased Dennis Carradine was only Marko 's accomplice . While a vengeance @-@ obsessed Peter sleeps in his Spider @-@ Man costume , the symbiote bonds with him . Peter wakes up hanging from a skyscraper , discovers his costume has changed , and his powers have been enhanced , but the symbiote brings out Peter 's dark side . Wearing the new black suit , Spider @-@ Man locates Marko — spiting his Daily Bugle competitor Eddie Brock by breaking his camera — and battles him in a subway tunnel . He discovers water is Marko 's weakness , and breaks a water pipe to reduce the Sandman into mud , washing Marko away into the pipes , Spider @-@ Man leaving him for dead . 
 Peter 's changed personality alienates Mary Jane , whose career is floundering , and she finds solace with Harry . Harry recovers from his amnesia , and urged by a hallucination of his dead father , compels Mary Jane to break up with Peter . After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves somebody else , Harry meets with Peter , and claims to be " the other guy . " Later , Peter , wearing the black suit , confronts Harry , and spitefully tells him his father never loved him . Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at Peter , who deflects it back , disfiguring Harry 's face . 
 Under the symbiote 's influence , Peter exposes Brock by showing that he submitted doctored photographs showing Spider @-@ Man as a criminal . Furious at having to print a retraction , Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson fires Brock . Soon afterwards , to make Mary Jane jealous , Peter brings Stacy 's daughter , Gwen to the nightclub , where Mary Jane works . Gwen catches on , and leaves . Peter brawls with the bouncers , and after accidentally attacking Mary Jane , he realizes the symbiote is changing and slowly corrupting him . Retreating to a church bell tower , he discovers that he cannot remove the suit , but that the symbiote weakens when the bell rings . Peter removes the symbiote , and it falls to the lower tower , landing on Brock , who is praying for Peter 's death . The symbiote bonds to Brock 's body , transforming him into Venom . Brock then finds Marko , and offers to join forces . 
 Brock hijacks Mary Jane 's taxi , and hangs it from a web hundreds of feet above a sand @-@ filled construction site . Peter seeks Harry 's help , but is rejected . While Peter battles with Brock , Harry learns the truth about his father 's death , and goes to help Peter . Harry subdues the Sandman , while Peter battles Brock . Brock almost impales Peter with Harry 's glider , but Harry jumps in the way , and is impaled himself . Fighting the symbiote , Peter remembers how the church bell weakened it . He grabs pipes , and creates a ring around the symbiote , creating a wall of sonic vibrations . The symbiote releases Brock , and Peter uses his webs to pull Brock from it . However , the symbiote has gained enough power from Peter and Brock to live on its own without a host . Peter throws a pumpkin bomb at the symbiote from Harry 's glider , but Brock jumps in to save it , and both are killed by the explosion . 
 After the battle , Marko explains to Peter that the reason behind him <unk> robberies was to save his dying daughter and that he never intended to kill Ben , but only wanted his car , and shot him accidentally when Dennis grabbed his arm , and that Ben 's death has left him plagued with guilt . Peter forgives a tearful Marko , who dissipates , and floats away . Peter and Harry forgive each other , and Harry dies , with Mary Jane and Peter at his side . After Harry 's funeral , Peter and Mary Jane dance , reconciling their relationship at the nightclub .

 In March 2004 , with Spider @-@ Man 2 being released the coming June , Marvel Studios had begun developing Spider @-@ Man 3 for a release in 2007 . By the release of Spider @-@ Man 2 , a release date for Spider @-@ Man 3 had been set for May 2 , 2007 before production on the sequel had begun . The date was later changed to May 4 , 2007 . In January 2005 , Sony Pictures Entertainment completed a seven @-@ figure deal with screenwriter Alvin Sargent , who had penned Spider @-@ Man 2 , to work on Spider @-@ Man 3 with an option to write a fourth film . 
 Immediately after Spider @-@ Man 2 's release , Ivan Raimi wrote a treatment over two months , with Sam Raimi deciding to use the film to explore Peter learning that he is not a sinless vigilante , and that there also can be humanity in those he considers criminals . Harry Osborn was brought back as Raimi wanted to conclude his storyline . Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father 's legacy , but be instead " somewhere between . " Sandman was introduced as an antagonist , as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character . While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics , the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben 's killer to increase Peter 's guilt over his death and challenge his simplistic perception of the event . Overall , Raimi described the film as being about Peter , Mary Jane , Harry , and the Sandman , with Peter 's journey being one of forgiveness . 
 Raimi wanted another villain , and Ben Kingsley was involved in negotiations to play the Vulture before the character was cut . Producer Avi Arad convinced Raimi to include Venom , a character whose perceived " lack of humanity " had initially been criticized by Sam Raimi . Venom 's alter @-@ ego , Eddie Brock , already had a minor role in the script . Arad told the director that Venom had a strong fan base , so Raimi included the character to please them , and even began to appreciate the character himself . The film 's version of the character is an amalgamation of Venom stories . Eddie Brock , Jr . , the human part of Venom , serves as a mirror to Peter Parker , with both characters having similar jobs and romantic interests . Brock 's actions as a journalist in Spider @-@ Man 3 also represent contemporary themes of paparazzi and tabloid journalism . The producers also suggested adding rival love interest Gwen Stacy , filling in an " other girl " type that Raimi already created . With so many additions , Sargent soon found his script so complex that he considered splitting it into two films , but abandoned the idea when he could not create a successful intermediate climax . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Camera crews spent 10 days from November 5 @-@ 18 , 2005 to film sequences that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin work on the shots early in the project . The same steps had been taken for Spider @-@ Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus . 
 Principal photography for Spider @-@ Man 3 began on January 16 , 2006 and wrapped in July 2006 after over 100 days of filming . The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19 , 2006 . In spring 2006 , film location manager Peter <unk> brought camera crews to Cleveland due to the Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city 's convention center at no cost . In Cleveland , they shot the battle between Spider @-@ Man and Sandman in the armored car . Afterwards , the team moved to Manhattan , where filming took place at various locations , including One Chase Manhattan Plaza , from May 26 , 2006 until July 1 , 2006 . Shooting placed a strain on Raimi , who often had to move between several units to complete the picture . Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope , as the symbiote Spider @-@ Man , Venom , and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night . 
 After August , pick @-@ ups were conducted as Raimi sought to film more action scenes . The film then wrapped in October , although additional special effects shots were taken to finalize the production a month later . In early @-@ 2007 , there were further pick @-@ up shots regarding the resolution of Sandman 's story , amounting to four different versions . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 John Dykstra , who won the Academy Award for Visual Effects for his work on Spider @-@ Man 2 , declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor . Dykstra 's colleague , Scott Stokdyk , took his place as supervisor , leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks . This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider @-@ Man 3 began production , creating nine hundred visual effects shots . 
 In addition to the innovative visual effects for the film , Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1 : 16 scale with New Deal Studios ' Ian Hunter and David Sanger . Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer @-@ generated imagery so damage done to the building could be portrayed realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models . In addition , to Sony Imageworks , Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider @-@ Man rescues Gwen Stacy , as well as shots in the climactic battle . To understand the effects of sand for the Sandman , experiments were done with twelve types of sand , such as splashing , launching it at stuntmen , and pouring it over ledges . The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman . For scenes involving visual effects , Thomas Haden Church was super @-@ imposed onto the screen , where computer @-@ generated imagery was then applied . With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors , ground @-@ up <unk> were used as a substitute instead . Because of its resemblance to the substance , sand from Arizona was used as the model for the CG sand . In a fight where Spider @-@ Man punches through Sandman 's chest , amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire 's place in filming the scene . Humby , whose right hand was amputated at birth , helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman 's chest . 
 Whereas the symbiote suit worn in the comics by Spider @-@ Man was a plain black affair with a large white spider on the front and back , the design was changed for the film to become a black version of Spider @-@ Man 's traditional costume , complete with webbing motif . As a consequence of this , the suit Topher Grace wore as Venom also bore the webbing motif ; as producer Grant Curtis noted , " it ’ s the Spider @-@ Man suit , but twisted and mangled in its own right . " Additionally , the motif gave a sense of life to the symbiote , giving it the appearance of gripping onto the character 's body . When animating the symbiote , Raimi did not want it to resemble a spider or an octopus , and to give it a sense of character . The CG model is made of many separate strands . When animating Venom himself , animators observed footage of big cats such as lions and cheetahs for the character 's agile movements . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Originally , Danny Elfman , the composer for the previous installments , did not plan to return for the third installment of Spider @-@ Man because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi . Elfman said that he had a " miserable experience " working with Raimi on Spider @-@ Man 2 and could not comfortably adapt his music . Christopher Young was then announced to score Spider @-@ Man 3 in Elfman 's absence . In December 2006 , however , producer Grant Curtis announced that Elfman had begun collaborating with Christopher Young on the music for Spider @-@ Man 3 . 
 Sandman 's theme uses " two contrabass saxophones , two contrabass clarinets , two contrabass bassoons and eight very low French horns " to sound " low , aggressive and heavy " . Young described Venom 's theme as " Vicious , my instructions on that one were that he ’ s the devil personified . His theme is much more demonic sounding . " Venom 's theme uses eight French horns . Raimi approved the new themes during their first performance , but rejected the initial music to the birth of Sandman , finding it too monstrous and not tragic enough .

 In 2007 , Spider @-@ Man 4 entered development , with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire , Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles . Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration . However , Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films , those two films would actually be a continuation of each other . James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in early 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp , who wrote the first Spider @-@ Man film . The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer @-@ winning playwright David Lindsay @-@ Abaire in November 2008 and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009 . Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider @-@ Man 5 and Spider @-@ Man 6 . 
 In 2007 , Raimi expressed interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter @-@ ego , the Lizard ; the character 's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea . By December 2009 , John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy , though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure , the <unk> . Raimi stated years later , however , that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider @-@ Man 4 had been made . 
 Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for Spider @-@ Man 4 had been cancelled due to Raimi 's withdrawal from the project . Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 6 , 2011 release date while at the same time upholding the film creatively . Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still " hated it " . 
 The next film in the franchise , a reboot of the series , called The Amazing Spider @-@ Man was released on July 3 , 2012 , with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker . 
 In February 2015 , Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that Spider @-@ Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) , with the character appearing in an MCU film and Sony releasing a Spider @-@ Man film produced by Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on July 28 , 2017 .

 The episode was written by the showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss . Like the rest of the first season , it adapts the plot of A Game of Thrones , the first novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin . The episode covers the novel 's chapters 66 to 73 , that is , Arya V , Bran VII , Sansa VI , Daenerys IX , Tyrion IX , Jon IX , Catelyn XI and Daenerys X. It also covers part of the second novel , A Clash of Kings : Arya I ( chapter 2 ) and part of Catelyn VII ( chapter 55 ) . Scenes added for the adaptation include Catelyn and Robb receiving news of Eddard 's death , the revelation of Cersei and <unk> Lannister 's relationship , as well as interactions between Grand Maester Pycelle , the prostitute Ros , Varys and Littlefinger . 
 The dragons featured in the episode 's finale were implemented by <unk> , UK , the lead VFX agency for the first season . VFX supervisor Angela Barson confirmed that the CGI dragons were among the most stressful effects , prompting sleepless nights . Commenting on the episode 's climactic scene where the hatchling dragons are revealed , actress Emilia Clarke told VH1 , " You see the relationship that Dany has with her eggs , and you see that grow and grow and grow and kind of the intuitive connection she has with them , you see that develop really beautifully . " Clarke also hinted that she expected to " get to play with some more dragons ! " in the second season , based on her conversations with book author and executive producer George R.R. Martin . " VFX Data Wrangler " <unk> McEvoy has confirmed that dragon presence will be increasing in season two . 
 In the scene where Joffrey forces Sansa to view the heads of Ned and his entourage on spikes , one of the prosthetic heads briefly seen in profile is that of former U.S. president George W. Bush . In their commentary on the DVD release of season 1 , David Benioff and D.B. Weiss explained that this was not meant as a political statement , but rather because the production used the prosthetic heads that happened to be at hand . Following media reports in June 2012 , HBO apologized for this shot , which their statement described as " unacceptable , disrespectful and in very bad taste . " The statement also said that the shot would be edited for any future home video production and TV broadcasts . HBO removed the episode from digital download services until the scene was edited . In the edited scene , the head bears no resemblance to Bush .

" He rated the episode 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 . Todd VanDerWerff of the A.V. Club gave it an " A- , " commenting : 
 " The series , especially , has shown that it ’ s willing to stretch some of these emotional or philosophical moments out , to really get the most out of the actors ’ performances and give them scenes where they can expand their characters beyond what ’ s on the page . In a finale that could have felt too scattered — we drop in on every major character of the season who ’ s still alive — that sense that cooler heads would rather prevent greater war but were thwarted by hotter , younger heads was what united the story " . 
 David Sims , also writing for the A.V. Club , called it a fitting end to the season , " leaving absolutely everyone salivating for season two . " Writing for the Star @-@ Ledger , Jenifer Braun praised the episode for its set dressing ( " I have to say , it ’ s a pleasure just to look at all the shiny stuff the HBO set dressers came up with for Tywin Lannister 's tent " ) and the authenticity of the baby dragons ( " And wow , HBO , seamless special effects here .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1932 race by five lengths , and led overall with 43 victories to Oxford 's 40 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Cambridge were coached by Francis Escombe , Harold Rickett ( who rowed three times between 1930 and 1932 ) , and Peter Haig @-@ Thomas ( four @-@ time Blue for Cambridge between 1902 and 1905 ) . Oxford 's coaches were John Houghton Gibbon ( who had participated in the 1899 and 1900 races , and umpired the 1931 race ) , P. Johnson ( who had rowed for Oxford in the 1927 race ) , A. E. Kitchin ( who had rowed in the 1908 race ) and W. P. Mellen ( who was a Dark Blue in 1923 and 1924 races ) . The race was umpired by former Cambridge rower Herbert Aylward Game who had represented the Light Blues in the 1895 and 1896 races . 
 According to the rowing correspondent for The Times , " no training in recent years has seen more changes in the comparative merits of the two crews . " Oxford started well while Cambridge took time to settle , but having done so " made astonishingly rapid progress " and " promised to be the best Cambridge crew since 1900 . " Oxford improved further once they had arrived at Putney ; conversely the Light Blues suffered misfortune in losing Lewis Luxton , last year 's stroke ten days before the race . The Dark Blues continued to progress but by the time of the race , " there was very little to choose between the two crews . "

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 6 @.@ 125 lb ( 78 @.@ 8 kg ) , 1 @.@ 125 pounds ( 0 @.@ 5 kg ) per rower more than their opponents .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . The race was delayed as a result of the slowly rising tide and it was eventually started by umpire Game at 4 : 02 p.m. Cambridge made the quicker start and out @-@ rated their opponents to hold a quarter @-@ length lead by the end of the Fulham Wall . With the bend in the river favouring the Middlesex station , Oxford gained and the crews passed the Mile Post level . Despite a spurt from Cambridge 's stroke Frame @-@ Thomson , Oxford took the lead and responded to the push with one of their own . Another spurt , this time minute @-@ long , from the Light Blues , saw them pass below Hammersmith Bridge with a one third length advantage . 
 Making the most of the inside of the bend in the river , Cambridge pushed on to be a length clear by The Doves pub . As both crews rowed into Chiswick Reach , they were struck by the headwind and by Chiswick Steps , the Light Blues had extended their lead by half a length , rating two strokes per minute more than Oxford . By the time they passed below Barnes Bridge , Cambridge were seven seconds ahead . They passed the finishing post with a lead of two and a quarter lengths in a time of 20 minutes 57 seconds , taking the overall record in the event to 44 – 40 in their favour . It was the Light Blues ' tenth consecutive victory , a record streak in the history of the event . It was the slowest winning time since the 1925 race and the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race . Writing in The Observer , William Beach Thomas declared that " a good crew was beaten by a good crew after one of the finest races in the long chronicles " . According to the former Oxford rower E. P. Evans , " the features of the race were the superb stroking of the Oxford crew by Holdsworth and the extremely bad coxing of the Cambridge boat ... although Cambridge won , they were not really at their best . " 
 = Chelicerata = 
 The subphylum Chelicerata ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; New Latin , from French <unk> , from Greek <unk> " claw , <unk> " and kéras " horn " ) constitutes one of the major subdivisions of the phylum Arthropoda . It contains the horseshoe crabs , sea spiders , and arachnids ( including scorpions and spiders ) . 
 The <unk> originated as marine animals , possibly in the Cambrian period , but the first confirmed chelicerate fossils , eurypterids , date from 445 million years ago in the Late Ordovician period . The surviving marine species include the four species of <unk> ( horseshoe crabs ) , and possibly the 1 @,@ 300 species of pycnogonids ( sea spiders ) , if the latter are indeed chelicerates . On the other hand , there are over 77 @,@ 000 well @-@ identified species of air @-@ breathing chelicerates , and there may be about 500 @,@ 000 unidentified species . 
 Like all arthropods , chelicerates have segmented bodies with jointed limbs , all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins . The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata , the prosoma and the opisthosoma , except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections . The chelicerae , which give the group its name , are the only appendages that appear before the mouth . In most sub @-@ groups , they are modest pincers used to feed . However , spiders ' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey . The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods , in which a tube @-@ like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel , which is the major body cavity . Marine chelicerates have gills , while the air @-@ breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae . In general the ganglia of living chelicerates ' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax , but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae , which are regarded as the oldest and most primitive group of spiders . Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations , air currents , and chemical changes in their environment . The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight . 
 Chelicerates were originally predators , but the group has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies : predation , parasitism , herbivory , scavenging and eating decaying organic matter . Although harvestmen can digest solid food , the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this , and they generally <unk> their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes . To conserve water , air @-@ breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules , structures that also evolved independently in insects . While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization , air @-@ breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization . Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate . Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults , but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge . In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves , but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young . 
 The evolutionary origins of chelicerates from the early arthropods have been debated for decades . Although there is considerable agreement about the relationships between most chelicerate sub @-@ groups , the inclusion of the Pycnogonida in this taxon has recently been questioned ( see below ) , and the exact position of scorpions is still controversial , though they were long considered the most primitive ( basal ) of the arachnids . 
 Although the venom of a few spider and scorpion species can be very dangerous to humans , medical researchers are investigating the use of these venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction . The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test for the presence of contaminant bacteria . Mites can cause allergies in humans , transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock , and are serious agricultural pests . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Segmentation and cuticle = = = 
 The Chelicerata are arthropods as they have : segmented bodies with jointed limbs , all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins ; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during the development of the embryo ; a much reduced coelom ; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates , driven by a tube @-@ like heart . Chelicerates ' bodies consist of two tagmata , sets of segments that serve similar functions : the foremost one , called the prosoma or cephalothorax , and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen . However , in the Acari ( mites and ticks ) there is no visible division between these sections . 
 The prosoma is formed in the embryo by fusion of the acron , which carries the eyes , with segments two to seven , which all have paired appendages , while segment one is lost during the embryo 's development . Segment two has a pair of chelicerae , small appendages that often form pincers , segment three has a pair of pedipalps that in most sub @-@ groups perform sensory functions , while the remaining four cephalothorax segments have pairs of legs . In primitive forms the acron has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment @-@ cup ocelli ( " little eyes " ) in the middle . The mouth is between segments two and three . 
 The opisthosoma consists of twelve or fewer segments that originally formed two groups , a mesosoma of seven segments and a metasoma of five , terminating with a telson or spike . The abdominal appendages of modern chelicerates are missing or heavily modified – for example in spiders the remaining appendages form spinnerets that extrude silk , while those of horseshoe crabs ( Xiphosura ) form gills . 
 Like all arthropods , chelicerates ' bodies and appendages are covered with a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins . Since this cannot stretch , the animals must molt to grow . In other words , they grow new but still soft cuticles , then cast off the old one and wait for the new one to harden . Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized . 
 = = = <unk> and pedipalps = = = 
 These appendages vary widely in form and function and the only consistent difference between them is their position : chelicerae arise from segment two , ahead of the mouth , and pedipalps from segment three , behind the mouth . 
 The chelicerae ( " claw horns " ) that give the sub @-@ phylum its name normally consist of three sections , and the claw is formed by the third section and a rigid extension of the second . However spiders ' have only two sections , and the second forms a fang that folds away behind the first when not in use . The relative sizes of chelicerae vary widely : those of some fossil eurypterids and modern harvestmen form large claws that extended ahead of the body , while scorpions ' are tiny pincers that are used in feeding and project only slightly in front of the head . 
 In most chelicerates the pedipalps are relatively small and are used as sensors . However those of male spiders have bulbous tips that act as syringes to inject sperm into the females ' reproductive openings when mating , while scorpions ' form large claws used for capturing prey . 
 = = = Body cavities and circulatory systems = = = 
 As in all arthropods , the chelicerate body has a very small coelom restricted to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems . The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most of the length of the body and through which blood flows , driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward . Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body , they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins , and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods . 
 = = = Respiratory systems = = = 
 These depend on individual sub @-@ groups ' environments . Modern terrestrial chelicerates generally have both book lungs , which deliver oxygen and remove waste gases via the blood , and tracheae , which do the same without using the blood as a transport system . The living horseshoe crabs are aquatic and have book gills that lie in a horizontal plane . For a long time it was assumed that the extinct eurypterids had gills , but the fossil evidence was ambiguous . However a fossil of the 45 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) long <unk> <unk> , from the Late Ordovician period , has what appear to be three pairs of vertically oriented book gills whose internal structure is very similar to that of scorpions ' book lungs . 
 = = = Feeding and digestion = = = 
 The guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow to take solid food . All scorpions and almost all spiders are predators that " pre @-@ process " food in preoral cavities formed by the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps . However one predominantly vegetarian spider species is known , and many supplement their diets with nectar and pollen . Many of the Acari ( ticks and mites ) are blood @-@ sucking parasites , but there are many predatory , vegetarian and scavenger sub @-@ groups . All the Acari have a retractable feeding assembly that consists of the chelicerae , pedipalps and parts of the exoskeleton , and which forms a preoral cavity for pre @-@ processing food . 
 <unk> are among the minority of living chelicerates that can take solid food , and the group includes predators , vegetarians and scavengers . Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food , and use a distinctive feeding system . Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth , which is on the underside of the head and faces slightly backwards . The bases of the legs form toothed <unk> that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth . This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed . 
 = = = Excretion = = = 
 Horseshoe crabs convert nitrogenous wastes to ammonia and dump it via their gills , and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus . They also have nephridia ( " little kidneys " ) , which extract other wastes for excretion as urine . Ammonia is so toxic that it must be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water . Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals , which they excrete as dry matter . Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules . The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids , a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids . 
 = = = Nervous system = = = 
 <unk> nervous systems are based on the standard arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords , each with a ganglion per segment , and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it . If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment , which bears antennae in other arthropods , chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre @-@ oral ganglia instead of two . However , there are evidences that the first segments is available indeed and bears the <unk> . 
 There is a notable but variable trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain . The brains of horseshoe crabs include all the ganglia of the prosoma plus those of the first two <unk> segments , while the other <unk> segments retain separate pairs of ganglia . In most living arachnids , except scorpions if they are true arachnids , all the ganglia , including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma , are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma . However , in the Mesothelae , which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders , the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused , and in scorpions the ganglia of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 As with other arthropods , chelicerates ' cuticles would block out information about the outside world , except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system . In fact spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors . Various touch and vibration sensors , mostly bristles called setae , respond to different levels of force , from strong contact to very weak air currents . Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell , often by means of setae . 
 Living chelicerates have both compound eyes ( only in horseshoe crabs , as the compound eye in the other clades has been reduced to a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli ) , mounted on the sides of the head , plus pigment @-@ cup ocelli ( " little eyes " ) , mounted in the middle . The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images . At the other extreme , jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision , and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV @-@ light . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Horseshoe crabs , which are aquatic , use external fertilization , in other words the sperm and ova meet outside the parents ' bodies . Their trilobite @-@ like larvae look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes , but initially they have only two pairs of book @-@ gills and gain three more pairs as they molt . 
 Being air @-@ breathing animals , the living arachnids use internal fertilization , which is direct in some species , in other words the males ' genitalia make contact with the females ' . However , in most species fertilization is indirect . Male spiders use their pedipalps as syringes to " inject " sperm into the females ' reproductive openings , but most arachnids produce spermatophores ( packages of sperm ) which the females take into their bodies . Courtship rituals are common , especially in the most powerful predators , where males risk being eaten before mating . Most arachnids lay eggs , but all scorpions and a few mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until they hatch and offspring rather like miniature adults emerge . 
 Levels of parental care for the young range from zero to prolonged . Scorpions carry their young on their backs until the first molt , and in a few semi @-@ social species the young remain with their mother . Some spiders care for their young , for example a wolf spider 's brood cling to rough bristles on the mother 's back , and females of some species respond to the " begging " behavior of their young by giving them their prey , provided it is no longer struggling , or even regurgitate food . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 There are large gaps in the chelicerates ' fossil record because , like all arthropods , their exoskeletons are organic and hence their fossils are rare except in a few lagerstätten where conditions were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues . The Burgess shale animals <unk> and <unk> from about 505 million years ago have been classified as chelicerates , the former because of its pattern of <unk> ( how the segments are grouped , especially in the head ) and the latter because its appendages resemble those of the Xiphosura ( horseshoe crabs ) . However cladistic analyses that consider wider ranges of characteristics place neither as chelicerates . There is debate about whether <unk> from earlier in the Cambrian period , about 525 million years ago , was a chelicerate . Another Cambrian fossil , <unk> , was originally classified as an <unk> but may have been a <unk> and therefore a chelicerate . If any of these was closely related to chelicerates , there is a gap of at least 43 million years in the record between true chelicerates and their nearest not @-@ quite chelicerate relatives . 
 Until recently the earliest known <unk> fossil dated from the Late Llandovery stage of the Silurian 436 to 428 million years ago , but in 2008 an older specimen was reported from about 445 million years ago in the Late Ordovician . <unk> have left few good fossils and the earliest confirmed eurypterids appear in the Late Ordovician period a little over 445 million years ago . 
 The oldest known arachnid is the trigonotarbid Palaeotarbus jerami , from about 420 million years ago in the Silurian period , and had a triangular cephalothorax and segmented abdomen , as well as eight legs and a pair of pedipalps . 
 Attercopus fimbriunguis , from 386 million years ago in the Devonian period , bears the earliest known silk @-@ producing spigots , and was therefore hailed as a spider , but it lacked spinnerets and hence was not a true spider . Rather , it was likely sister group to the spiders , a clade which has been named <unk> . Several Carboniferous spiders were members of the Mesothelae , a primitive group now represented only by the Liphistiidae . 
 The Late Silurian Proscorpius has been classified as a scorpion , but differed significantly from modern scorpions : it appears wholly aquatic since it had gills rather than book lungs or tracheae ; its mouth was completely under its head and almost between the first pair of legs , as in the extinct eurypterids and living horseshoe crabs . Fossils of terrestrial scorpions with book lungs have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about 402 million years ago . 
 = = = Relationships with other arthropods = = = 
 The " traditional " view of the arthropod " family tree " shows chelicerates as less closely related to the other major living groups ( crustaceans ; hexapods , which includes insects ; and myriapods , which includes centipedes and millipedes ) than these other groups are to each other . Recent research since 2001 , using both molecular phylogenetics ( the application of cladistic analysis to biochemistry , especially to organisms ' DNA and RNA ) and detailed examination of how various arthropods ' nervous systems develop in the embryos , suggests that chelicerates are most closely related to myriapods , while hexapods and crustaceans are each other 's closest relatives . However these results are derived from analyzing only living arthropods , and including extinct ones such as trilobites causes a swing back to the " traditional " view , placing trilobites as the sister @-@ group of the <unk> ( hexapods plus myriapods ) and chelicerates as least closely related to the other groups . 
 = = = Major sub @-@ groups = = = 
 It is generally agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes <unk> ( spiders , scorpions , mites , etc . ) , Xiphosura ( horseshoe crabs ) and <unk> ( sea scorpions , extinct ) . The extinct <unk> may be a sub @-@ group within <unk> . The Pycnogonida ( sea spiders ) were traditionally classified as chelicerates , but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well @-@ known groups such as chelicerates evolved . 
 However the structure of " family tree " relationships within the Chelicerata has been controversial ever since the late 19th century . An attempt in 2002 to combine analysis of RNA features of modern chelicerates and anatomical features of modern and fossil ones produced credible results for many lower @-@ level groups , but its results for the high @-@ level relationships between major sub @-@ groups of chelicerates were unstable , in other words minor changes in the inputs caused significant changes in the outputs of the computer program used ( POY ) . An analysis in 2007 using only anatomical features produced the cladogram on the right , but also noted that many uncertainties remain . 
 The position of scorpions is particularly controversial . Some early fossils such as the Late Silurian Proscorpius have been classified by paleontologists as scorpions , but described as wholly aquatic as they had gills rather than book lungs or tracheae . Their mouths are also completely under their heads and almost between the first pair of legs , as in the extinct eurypterids and living horseshoe crabs . This presents a difficult choice : classify Proscorpius and other aquatic fossils as something other than scorpions , despite the similarities ; accept that " scorpions " are not monophyletic but consist of separate aquatic and terrestrial groups ; or treat scorpions as more closely related to eurypterids and possibly horseshoe crabs than to spiders and other arachnids , so that either scorpions are not arachnids or " arachnids " are not monophyletic . Cladistic analyses have recovered Proscorpius within the scorpions , based on reinterpretation of the species ' breathing apparatus . This is reflected also in the reinterpretation of <unk> as a terrestrial animal . 
 = = Diversity = = 
 Although well behind the insects , chelicerates are one of the most diverse groups of animals , with over 77 @,@ 000 living species that have been described in scientific publications . Some estimates suggest that there may be 130 @,@ 000 undescribed species of spider and nearly 500 @,@ 000 undescribed species of mites and ticks . While the earliest chelicerates and the living Pycnogonida ( if they are chelicerates ) and Xiphosura are marine animals that breathe dissolved oxygen , the vast majority of living species are air @-@ breathers , although a few spider species build " diving bell " webs that enable them to live under water . Like their ancestors , most living chelicerates are carnivores , mainly on small invertebrates . However many species feed as parasites , vegetarians , scavengers and detritivores . 
 = = Interaction with humans = = 
 In the past , Native Americans ate the flesh of horseshoe crabs , and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes . More recent attempts to use horseshoe crabs as food for livestock were abandoned when it was found that this gave the meat a bad taste . Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent , <unk> <unk> lysate , which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to ensure they are free of dangerous bacteria , and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers . 
 Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia , and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela . Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates . Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated , for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia , Alzheimer 's disease , strokes , and erectile dysfunction . Because spider silk is both light and very strong , attempts are being made to produce it in goats ' milk and in the leaves of plants , by means of genetic engineering . There were about 100 reliably reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century , compared with 1 @,@ 500 from jellyfish stings . 
 Scorpion stings are thought to be a significant danger in less @-@ developed countries , for example they cause about 1 @,@ 000 deaths per year in Mexico but only one every few years in the USA . Most of these incidents are caused by accidental human " invasions " of scorpion 's nests . However medical uses of scorpion venom are being investigated for treatment of brain cancers and bone diseases . 
 Ticks are parasitic , and some transmit micro @-@ organisms and parasites that can cause diseases in humans , while the saliva of a few species can directly cause tick paralysis if they are not removed within a day or two . 
 A few of the closely related mites also infest humans , some causing intense itching by their bites and others by burrowing into the skin . Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated . Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these , Varroa destructor , has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide . Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases , including hay fever , asthma and eczema , and they aggravate atopic dermatitis . Mites are also significant crop pests , although predatory mites may be useful in controlling some of these . 
 = Enda Muldoon = 
 Enda Muldoon ( born 11 September 1977 ) is an Gaelic footballer from Ballinderry , County Londonderry , Northern Ireland . Muldoon played for the Derry GAA team and has won an Ulster Senior Football Championship and two National League titles with the county , as well as Ulster Minor , Ulster Under 21 and All @-@ Ireland Under @-@ 21 Football Championships . He also won an All Star Award for his performances in the 2004 All @-@ Ireland Senior Football Championship . 
 Muldoon plays his club football for Ballinderry Shamrocks . He was instrumental in helping Ballinderry win the 2002 All @-@ Ireland Senior Club Football Championship , and he has also won six Derry Championships and an Ulster Senior Club Football Championship with the club . 
 Muldoon is a versatile player who can play anywhere in the forward line or in midfield . Described by Joe Brolly as " the greatest ever natural talent to have played with Derry " , his repertoire of skills include his catching ability , scoring prowess , confidence on the ball , positional awareness and in particular his great passing capabilities . He currently plays at left half forward for Derry and midfield for Ballinderry . 
 Despite often playing in the half forward line or midfield , Muldoon has consistently been a high scorer for Derry . He finished the 2001 All @-@ Ireland Senior Football Championship with 2 @-@ 10 ( 16 ) and the 2004 Championship with 3 @-@ 24 ( 33 ) . He finished the 2006 campaign with 1 @-@ 07 ( 10 ) from two matches . His tally of 12 Championship goals is one of the highest ever in Ulster football history .

 Described as " one of the most talented footballers of his generation " , Enda Muldoon has played in virtually all positions in the forward line , as well as midfield for both his club and county . He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high @-@ fielding skills , is hard to dispossess , is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence . Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin @-@ point passes , and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game . Ballinderry and Derry team @-@ mate Kevin McGuckin described him as " a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing " . GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him : " I cannot say I have ever seen a more elegant footballer " and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald .

 In 1995 , his last year of eligibility , Muldoon was brought into the Derry Minor panel . He was part of the team that won the 1995 Ulster Minor Championship and finished runners @-@ up to Westmeath in that year 's All @-@ Ireland Minor final . He was instrumental in Derry 's run in that Minor Championship , including scoring 1 @-@ 07 ( 10 ) against Down in the Ulster final and scoring a dramatic last minute goal which helped Derry beat Galway by a point in the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final . 
 Muldoon reached the Ulster Under @-@ 21 Football Championship final with Derry Under @-@ 21s in 1996 , but were defeated by Cavan . In 1997 Muldoon and Derry won the Ulster Under @-@ 21 and All @-@ Ireland Under @-@ 21 Football Championships , defeating Fermanagh and Meath in the respective finals . Muldoon was also on the team the following year , but Derry were defeated at the Ulster final stage by Armagh . 
 He made his Derry Senior debut in the 1997 season and reached the Ulster final , where they were beat by Cavan . In 1998 , playing in midfield he won the Ulster Senior Championship with Derry . It was his sixth Ulster final in four years — one Minor , three Under @-@ 21 and two Senior . Derry lost out to Galway in that year 's All @-@ Ireland Championship semi @-@ final . In 2000 he won the National League with Derry , defeating Meath in the final . Derry also reached that year 's Ulster final , but lost out to Armagh . He was nominated in 2000 for an All Star , but narrowly missed out . He was however an All Star replacement for the All Star trip to Dubai in January 2001 . 
 Derry lost at the semi @-@ final stage of the 2001 Ulster Championship , but nonetheless reached the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final through the qualifiers , where they once again faced Galway . Derry again lost to Galway , despite a goal scored by Muldoon . Muldoon scored 2 @-@ 10 ( 16 ) in that year 's Championship . Muldoon was named Derry captain for the 2003 season . 
 In 2004 Muldoon and Paddy Bradley formed a clinical scoring partnership en route to the All @-@ Ireland semi @-@ final , where they eventually lost to Kerry . Muldoon contributed 3 @-@ 24 ( 33 ) of Derry 's total of 7 @-@ 92 ( 113 ) in the 2004 All @-@ Ireland Championship , including a goal in the semi @-@ final and 1 @-@ 06 ( 9 ) in the quarter @-@ final in a man of the match performance against Westmeath . He was named full forward on the 2004 All @-@ Star team for his performances the Championship . 
 Muldoon had an injury called patellar tendinitis in both his knees . In December 2004 , he underwent surgery on one of his knees . The operation was successful and he resumed training on April 2005 . Muldoon started the 2006 Ulster Championship campaign very brightly scoring 1 @-@ 03 ( 6 ) in the first round of the Ulster Championship against defending All @-@ Ireland Champions Tyrone and 0 @-@ 04 against Donegal . However Muldoon , with a previously exemplary disciplinary record at all levels , was red @-@ carded late in that game . Some commentators called for Muldoon 's red card to be rescinded after television replays showed he was reacting to " extreme provocation " from Donegal full back Paddy Campbell , who had punched Muldoon in the groin . Muldoon however received a four @-@ week suspension and missed Derry 's next two games against Kildare and Longford . Longford produced a shock victory to knock Derry out of the 2006 Championship . He finished the 2006 campaign with 1 @-@ 07 ( 10 ) from two matches . 
 Muldoon put in some impressive performances in Derry 's run to the 2007 All @-@ Ireland quarter @-@ final , where they lost out to Dublin . He was awarded the Ulster Tennent ’ s Monthly Merit Award for July 2007 , for his performances against Mayo and Laois that month , including a lobbed goal against Mayo . This was the second time he had received the accolade . He was instrumental in the 2008 National League , which Derry won , defeating Kerry in the final . Joe Brolly described him as " the best player on the field " . The league success saw Derry become favourites to win the Ulster Championship and one of the top few for the All @-@ Ireland . However , despite a good opening victory against Donegal , Derry exited the Ulster Championship against Fermanagh at the semi @-@ final stage and were defeated by Monaghan in the first round of the Qualifiers . 
 Muldoon and Derry also reached the National League final in 2009 , but were defeated by Kerry . He missed the final due to injury . Muldoon won a second McKenna Cup medal with Derry in 2011 . They also reached that year 's Ulster final but lost to Donegal .

 Muldoon won his first Derry Senior Football Championship medal while still a minor in 1995 , when Ballinderry defeated Bellaghy in the final . In 1998 Muldoon was part of the Ballinderry team that won the All @-@ Ireland <unk> <unk> Sevens Championship . 
 After losing two finals in a row to Bellaghy in 1999 and 2000 , Ballinderry won the 2001 Derry Championship , once again defeating Bellaghy in the decider . The club went on to win the 2001 Ulster Club Championship with victories over St. Gall 's in the quarter @-@ final ( after a replay ) , Cavan Gaels in the semi @-@ final and <unk> in the final . Muldoon was awarded Ulster Football Award Winner at the AIB GAA Provincial Player Awards 2001 for his role in Ballinderry 's march to claim the Ulster Club Championship . He was presented his award by GAA President Seán <unk> . Ballinderry went on to represent Ulster in the All @-@ Ireland Senior Club Football Championship , which they won defeating <unk> Chonaill Gaels ( London ) in the quarter @-@ final , <unk> ( Wicklow ) in the semi @-@ final and Nemo Rangers ( Cork ) in the final . Muldoon played through the pain barrier in the Championship , delaying an operation on a troublesome hip injury until after the All @-@ Ireland final . 
 Ballinderry defended the Derry Championship in 2002 , but lost in the semi @-@ final stage of the Ulster Club Championship to Errigal Ciarán . Muldoon won the Ulster Tennent ’ s Monthly Merit Award for October 2002 for his performance against <unk> in the Ulster Club quarter @-@ final . His performance in that game was described as a " masterful display " , scoring vital points and was the " defensive anchor in a tense final quarter " . Muldoon also helped New York club Westmeath reach the semi @-@ final of the New York Senior Football Championship in 2002 , but they were defeated by the Kerry club . 
 Muldoon was runner @-@ up for the third time in the Derry Championship in 2003 , losing to local rivals An <unk> in the final . He gained his fourth Derry Championship medal in 2006 with the club , avenging the 2003 loss to An <unk> , with Muldoon having an " impressive game " . Ballinderry reached the 2006 Ulster Club final , but lost narrowly to Crossmaglen Rangers . In 2008 Muldoon and Ballinderry won the Ulster Senior Club Football League . Muldoon won his fifth Derry Championship medal in 2008 , this time as captain . An achilles injury forced him to miss the quarter @-@ final tie with Bellaghy and he was only fit enough to come on as a substitute in the semi @-@ final clash with <unk> . However he recovered in time for the final , and his performance , particularly in the second half , proved vital in helping the club defeat <unk> . Ballinderry got to the 2008 Ulster Club final and again faced Crossmaglen . Muldoon put in a brilliant performance in the game , which finished a draw . He broke a bone in his foot two days before the replay and could not play . His absence proved costly and Cross won the replay . 
 Coleraine defeated Ballinderry in the 2010 Derry Championship final , but Muldoon won his sixth county medal in 2011 with victory over Kilrea in the final . The <unk> also won the 2010 and 2011 Ulster League titles . He has also won eight Derry Senior League medals with the club ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 and 2010 ) .

 = Gun show loophole = 
 Gun show loophole , gun law loophole , Brady law loophole ( or Brady bill loophole ) , private sale loophole , and private sale exemption are political terms in the United States referring to sales of firearms by private sellers , including those done at gun shows , dubbed the " secondary market " . The term refers to the concept that a loophole in federal law exists , under which " [ a ] ny person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of the State where he resides as long as he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms " . 
 Under federal law , private @-@ party sellers are not required to perform background checks on buyers , whether at a gun show or other venue . They also are not required to record the sale , or ask for identification . This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License ( FFL ) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers , regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show . Access to the NICS background check system is limited to FFL holders and <unk> are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows . 
 Since the mid @-@ 1990s , gun control advocates have voiced concern over the perceived loophole in legislation , and campaigned to require background checks and record @-@ keeping for all gun sales . Contrarily , gun rights advocates have stated that there is no loophole , that current laws provide a single , uniform set of rules for commercial gun sellers regardless of the place of sale , and that no part of the United States Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate non @-@ commercial , intrastate transfers of legal firearms types between private citizens . In this latter view , regulating private sales at one type of location ( gun shows ) but not at other locations would create an exception in the law rather than eliminate one , while forcing any ( or all ) private firearm sales to go through dealers having access to the NICS background check system would be unacceptably intrusive and border on universal firearm registration .

 Sometimes referred to as the Brady bill loophole , the Brady law loophole , the gun law loophole , or the private sale loophole , the term refers to laws allowing for legal sales and transfers of firearms , that are not regulated by the National Firearms Act , without background checks between unlicensed private parties . Private @-@ party sellers are not legally required by federal law to : ask for identification , complete any forms , or keep any sales records . In addition to federal legislation , firearm laws vary by state . 
 Federal " Gun show loophole " bills were introduced in seven consecutive Congresses : two in 2001 , two in 2004 , one in 2005 , one in 2007 , two in 2009 , two in 2011 , and one in 2013 . Specifically , seven gun show loophole bills were introduced in the U.S. House and four in the Senate between 2001 and 2013 . None passed . In May 2015 Carolyn Maloney introduced <unk> , also referred to as the Gun Show <unk> Closing Act of 2015 . As of June 26 it has been referred to the Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , Homeland Security , and Investigations . 
 = = States requiring background checks for private sales = = 
 As of September 2015 , 18 states and Washington D.C. have background check requirements beyond federal law . Eight states require universal background checks at the point of sale for all transfers , including purchases from unlicensed sellers . Maryland and Pennsylvania laws in this regard are limited to handguns . Hawaii , Illinois , Massachusetts and New Jersey require any firearm purchaser to obtain a permit . Four more states ( Iowa , Michigan , Nebraska , and North Carolina ) do the same , but only for handguns . Illinois requires background checks at gun shows . Nevada allows but does not require unlicensed sellers to do background checks on buyers . A majority of these jurisdictions require unlicensed sellers to keep records of firearm sales . The following table summarizes these state laws . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1968 , Congress passed the Gun Control Act ( GCA ) , under which modern firearm commerce operates . The GCA mandated Federal Firearms Licenses ( <unk> ) for those " engaged in the business " of selling firearms , but not for private individuals who sold firearms infrequently . Under the Gun Control Act , firearm dealers were prohibited from doing business anywhere except the address listed on their Federal Firearms License . It also mandated that licensed firearm dealers maintain records of firearms sales . An unlicensed person is prohibited by federal law from transferring , selling , trading , giving , transporting , or delivering a firearm to any other unlicensed person only if they know or have reasonable cause to believe the buyer does not reside in the same State or is prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing firearms . 
 In 1986 , Congress passed the Firearm Owners Protection Act ( FOPA ) , which relaxed certain controls in the Gun Control Act and permitted licensed firearm dealers to conduct business at gun shows . Specifically , FOPA made it legal for FFL holders to make private sales , provided the firearm was transferred to the licensee 's personal collection at least one year prior to the sale . Hence , when a personal firearm is sold by an FFL holder , no background check or Form <unk> is required by federal law . According to the ATF , FFL holders are required to keep a record of such sales in a bound book . The United States Department of Justice ( USDOJ ) said the stated purpose of FOPA was to ensure the GCA did not " place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on law @-@ abiding citizens , but it opened many loopholes through which illegal gun traffickers can slip . " Efforts to reverse a key feature of FOPA by requiring criminal background checks and purchase records on private sales at gun shows were unsuccessful . 
 In 1993 , Congress enacted the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act , amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 . " The Brady Law " instituted federal background checks on all firearm purchasers who buy from federally licensed dealers ( FFL ) . This law had no provisions for private firearms transactions or sales . The Brady Law originally imposed an interim measure , requiring a waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer , manufacturer , or dealer may sell , deliver , or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual . The waiting period applied only in states without an alternate system that was deemed acceptable of conducting background checks on handgun purchasers . Personal transfers and sales between unlicensed Americans could also still be subject to other federal , state , and local restrictions . These interim provisions ceased to apply on November 30 , 1998 . 
 = = Government studies and positions = = 
 Firearm tracing starts at the manufacturer or importer and typically ends at the first private sale regardless if the private seller later sell to an FFL or uses an FFL for background checks . Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice , fewer than 2 % of convicted criminals bought their firearm at a flea market or gun show . About 12 % purchased their firearm from a retail store or pawnshop , and 80 % bought from family , friends , or an illegal source . 
 According to a 1999 report by the ATF , legal private party transactions contribute to illegal activities , such as arms trafficking , purchases of firearms by prohibited buyers , and straw purchases . Anyone selling a firearm is legally prohibited from selling it to anyone the seller knows or has reasonable cause to believe is prohibited from owning a firearm . Only an FFL holder may transfer a firearm to another licensed FFL that does not reside in the state in which the seller resides . FFL holders , in general , can only transfer firearms to non @-@ licensed persons that reside in the state they are licensed to do business in and only at that place of business or a gun show . 
 The January 1999 report said that more than 4 @,@ 000 gun shows are held in the U.S. annually . Also , between 50 and 75 percent of gun show vendors hold a Federal Firearms License , and the " majority of vendors who attend shows sell firearms , associated accessories , and other paraphernalia . " The report concluded that although most sellers at gun shows are upstanding people , a few corrupt sellers could move a large quantity of firearms into high @-@ risk hands . They stated that there were gaps in current law and recommended " extending the Brady Law to ' close the gun show loophole . ' " 
 In 2009 the U.S. Government Accountability Office published a report citing that many firearms trafficked to Mexico may be purchased through these types of private transactions , by individuals who may want to avoid background checks and records of their firearms purchases . Proposals put forth by United States Attorneys , which were never enacted , include : 
 Allowing only FFL holders to sell guns at gun shows , so a background check and a firearms transaction record accompany every transaction 
 Strengthening the definition of " engaged in the business " by defining the terms with more precision , narrowing the exception for " hobbyists , " and lowering the intent requirement 
 Limiting the number of individual private sales to a specified number per year 
 Requiring persons who sell guns in the secondary market to comply with the record @-@ keeping requirements applicable to Federal Firearms License holders 
 Requiring all transfers in the secondary market to go through a Federal Firearms License holder 
 Establishing procedures for the orderly liquidation of inventory belonging to FFL holders who surrender their license 
 Requiring registration of non @-@ licensed persons who sell guns 
 Increasing the punishment for transferring a firearm without a background check , as required by the Brady Act 
 Requiring gun show promoters to be licensed , maintaining an inventory of all the firearms that are sold by FFL holders and non @-@ licensed sellers at gun shows 
 Requiring one or more ATF agents be present at every gun show 
 <unk> unlicensed vendors from criminal liability if they agree to have purchasers complete a firearms transaction form
