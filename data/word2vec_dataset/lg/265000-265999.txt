 Renault Agriculture <unk> ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ( ə ) ] ) was the agricultural machinery division of the French car manufacturer Renault established in 1918 from its armored military vehicles division . While in operation , Renault Agriculture had various partnerships with major manufacturers and focussed production on tractors . The company was sold between 2003 and 2008 to German rival Claas . Renault Agriculture was dissolved in 2008 and its facilities became part of Claas ' tractor division . Claas ' tractor division and Renault 's Auto <unk> International are Renault Agriculture successors . 
 = = History = = 
 After the end of World War I , the Renault company used its experience in armored tanks to devise agricultural vehicles . The Renault 's Department 14 ( responsible for the FT tank ) developed the first tractor of the company , the Type GP , which was powered by an engine similar to that of the FT ( a four @-@ cylinder ) and had tracks . The most distinguishable differences of the new tractor with the FT were the front @-@ engine design and the reduced weight . The tractors were assembled in Renault 's Billancourt factory since 11 November 1918 on the same production lines that the tanks and tested at Louis Renault 's farm in <unk> . The Type HO introduced in 1921 replaced the tracks by more conventional wheels . In 1926 , Renault introduced the Type PE which was extensively revised compared to its predecessors , incorporating a new engine with reduced consumes and a vertical radiator . In 1931 , with the <unk> , the radiator was moved from the middle position used in the previous models to the front and , in 1933 , the model became the first France @-@ produced rubber @-@ wheeled tractor . The company also started to develop versions for specific markets , as vineyards . With the aim of reducing the fuel costs , it introduced its first diesel @-@ engined model , the Type VI , in 1932 . By 1938 , Renault was producing about 40 tractors per month and was the largest French manufacturer . 
 In 1920 , Renault founded the Le Mans engineering centre . Shortly after , plans to move the agricultural machinery production to the new site were revealed . However , the new factory was inaugurated in 1940 and the production was stopped because of World War II . Following the war and nationalisation , the Le Mans plant resumed production . The location was divided into a foundry section , a mechanical parts section ( supplying the factories of <unk> and Billancourt ) , a painting section and a tractor manufacturing section . At the time , Le Mans was the third largest Renault 's operation in France after Billancourt and <unk> . The following years saw the arrival of the D , N , E and Super model series . In 1956 , Renault Agriculture standardised the orange colour for its models . In 1950 , Renault was the largest tractor manufacturer within France , producing 8 @,@ 549 units , the 58 % of the country 's total production . In 1961 , Renault introduced the 385 model , with a 12 @-@ gear transmission . Apart from its own engines , Renault used <unk> and Perkins units . In the 1960s , it produced the One @-@ Sixty Diesel for Allis @-@ Chalmers . In 1968 , the company introduced its first four @-@ wheel drive model . In 1972 , Renault partnered with <unk> and sold some models of that company with the Renault badge . During the 1970s and 1980s , it also sold models from Mitsubishi . At the 1981 SIMA exhibition Renault Agriculture unveiled the TX range , with comfort elements designed in collaboration with the Renault 's car division . The last Renault tractors had ancient gods ' names . 
 From late 1993 to 1998 , Renault Agriculture and John Deere had a partnership agreement by which the former received John Deere engines manufactured at the Saran factory and in return it supplied John Deere with tractors marketed as the 3000 series . In 1994 , Renault Agriculture and Massey Ferguson formed a strategic partnership , as part of which they set up an equally owned joint venture called Groupement International de Mécanique Agricole ( <unk> ) at a facility located next to Massey 's Beauvais factory with the aim of manufacturing <unk> and related components . In 1995 , Renault Agriculture agreed to market products from the British agricultural machinery manufacturer <unk> through its dealership network in France . In 1997 , the company took a 16 @.@ 6 % stake of Rovigo @-@ based <unk> , a manufacturer of orchard tractors for various clients . In 2000 , it purchased a stake in the Indian manufacturer International Tractors ( the owner of the <unk> marque ) , forming a <unk> @-@ Renault joint venture . In 2003 , as part of a plan to shed non @-@ core assets , Renault sold a 51 % majority stake in Renault Agriculture 's tractor manufacturing plant to Claas . In 2006 , Claas increased its ownership to 80 % and in 2008 took full control and renamed it Claas Tractor . By 2005 , the Renault marque was phased out and all the tractor models produced at Le Mans were badged as Claas .

 = William L. Uanna = 
 William Lewis " Bud " Uanna ( May 13 , 1909 – December 22 , 1961 ) was a United States security expert , who gained prominence as a security officer with the Manhattan Project , which built the first atomic bomb during World War II . 
 Uanna was in charge of security at the project 's facility at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and later at the 509th Composite Group , which dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
 After the war , he headed the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) program to provide security clearances to its personnel , and developed the top @-@ secret Q clearance . He later served as chief of physical security at the State <unk> . 
 = = Education and military career = = 
 William Lewis Uanna was born in Medford , Massachusetts , on May 13 , 1909 , the son of Italian immigrants Anthony Uanna and Theresa née <unk> . He attended Medford High School , and then Tufts College on an athletic scholarship , where he was a halfback on the college football team , and an intercollegiate wrestling champion , earning a degree in engineering . He soon returned to Tufts and got a M.A. in education . 
 Uanna worked for private companies as well as the US Army Corps of Engineers . As a civilian with the Corps of Engineers he was involved in the construction of Grenier Army Air Field in New Hampshire and Fort Devens in Massachusetts , where he later served as an Army Counter Intelligence agent during Word War II . Between 1938 and 1942 he attended Suffolk University , graduating with an <unk> He then passed the Massachusetts Bar examination and was admitted to practice before the Federal Bar . Between 1949 and 1954 he attended the American University in Washington , D.C. 
 Enlisting in the U.S. Army on May 28 , 1941 , Uanna was assigned to the Corps of Intelligence Police ( CIP ) , later renamed the Counter Intelligence Corps ( CIC ) . He attended the Officer Candidate School at Fort Belvoir , and in 1942 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers . He was assigned to the CIC as Director of Operations of I Service Command , responsible for five field offices and between 300 and 400 Special Agents , who dealt with subversion , espionage , plant security , sabotage , water front security and personnel investigations . 
 In February 1943 , Uanna was posted to X Corps , then based at Sherman , Texas , where <unk> responsible for setting up the first intelligence units assigned to combat formations in the United States . With 112 officers and 35 agents he conducted investigations and evaluated the loyalty of individuals within X Corps and trained its troops in security procedures . In August 1943 , Uanna became an instructor at the CIC school in Chicago . 
 = = Manhattan Project security = = 
 Joining the Manhattan Project in late 1943 , Uanna was initially assigned to the New England area , where he looked after security at 150 organizations , including key contractors Stone & Webster , General Electric , Westinghouse and American Cyanamid , and universities such as Harvard , Brown , Yale and MIT . He was promoted to first lieutenant on July 25 , 1943 , captain on March 25 , 1944 , and ultimately major on June 25 , 1945 . In August 1944 , he was appointed Security Officer for the large town and industrial installation built by the US Government at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , to enrich uranium for an atomic bomb . As such , he oversaw the physical security of the site , and was responsible for the security clearance of over 50 @,@ 000 personnel . He supervised the activities of the town 's police , detectives and welfare bureau and provided security for the transport of fissile materials from Oak Ridge to the weapons laboratory at Los Alamos , New Mexico . 
 In February 1945 , Uanna assumed command of the 1st Technical Service Detachment , which was attached to the 509th Composite Group , the Army Air Force unit created to deliver the first atomic bomb . He became responsible for the security clearance of its personnel . Uanna arrived with orders from Lieutenant Colonel John Lansdale Jr . , the Manhattan Project 's head of security , and a briefcase containing dossiers on members of the 393d Bomb Squadron , the combat element of the 509th Composite Group . Uanna had particular concerns about Captain Claude Eatherly . The dossier indicated that Eatherly was a gambler , with an " emotional problem " . The commander of the 509th Composite Group , Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets Jr . , opted to keep Eatherly , based on his piloting skills . Background checks on the 1st Ordnance Squadron revealed that it had several escaped convicts in its ranks . Uanna surmised that enlisting in the Army under false names was an easy way of escaping detection in wartime . Since skilled technicians were hard to find , Tibbets elected to keep them , threatening to send them to back to prison for any dereliction of duty or security breaches . 
 Uanna oversaw the movement of the 509th from its training base in Wendover Army Air Field , Utah to Tinian Island in the Western Pacific , travelling by air with the Project Alberta advance party of 34 in a Douglas C @-@ 54 Skymaster " Green Hornet " of the 320th Troop Carrier Squadron . In his book Project Alberta , Harlow Russ , a civilian scientist with Project Alberta who was part of the Fat man bomb assembly team , recounts that during the flight he asked Uanna why all the military people on the plane were armed , and Uanna informed him that while the islands that they were stopping at were held by US forces , they would be flying over or close to other islands that were still occupied by the Japanese . Because of the remote chance that they might be engaged by Japanese aircraft or anti @-@ aircraft guns , they flew over these islands at night . 
 On Tinian , Uanna was in charge of the physical security of its installations , and supervised the unloading and installation of its stores and equipment . At one point Russ left his shirt on the line over night , and it disappeared . He mentioned this to Uanna " who seemed to know everything " , and he told him that it had most likely been taken by one of the Japanese soldiers holding out in caves and tunnels on Tinian , who made periodic raids in search of food . Uanna thought that one was responsible for an outbreak of diarrhea in the 509th Composite Group . Security around the cookhouse was increased , and the outbreak did not recur . 
 Uanna also looked after security at other bases that might be used by the 509th in an emergency , such as Iwo Jima . He supervised the loading the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay , and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6 , 1945 , he was in charge of a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian . He was <unk> one of the first people to know that Hiroshima was the target , and that it had been attacked . After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan , he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage , spending four weeks in Nagasaki . 
 = = Postwar career = = 
 Uanna returned to the United States in October 1945 , and was discharged from the Army in April 1946 . He returned to Boston , where he was admitted to the bar in 1946 , and practiced law and engineering , but was recalled to active duty in October 1946 to conduct an investigation into reports that servicemen had tried to sell pictures of the atomic bomb to The Baltimore Sun . These turned out to be pictures of the dummy bombs used for drop tests . In 1947 , he was chosen by the newly created Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) in Washington , D.C. to head its program to provide security clearances to its personnel , a requirement of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 . At this time he developed the criteria for the AEC 's Q clearance . He married Bonnie Louise Leonard on August 29 , 1947 . They had a son , Stephen Lee . 
 In 1948 Uanna became second @-@ in @-@ command of an Armed Forces Special Weapons Project ( AFSWP ) construction program to build storage bases for atomic weapons . As the highest ranking civilian on the project he was responsible for over $ 100 million of works . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) sought to continue the relationship they had developed at the Atomic Energy Commission where internal FBI memos described Uanna as the " main source of confidential information within the AEC . " 
 From 1949 to 1951 , Uanna worked as an Intelligence Specialist at the newly established Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , where he wrote the Office of Policy Coordination 's ( OPC ) briefing manual . The OPC was the covert action branch of the US intelligence community and at this time was overseen jointly by the State Department and the Department of Defense , rather than by the Director of Central Intelligence . 
 From 1951 to 1953 , Uanna was the special assistant to the Secretary of Commerce as Chief of the Facilities Protection Board , and was a staff member of the Industrial Evaluations Board . These boards were overseen by the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security ( <unk> ) and the National Security Resources Board ( <unk> ) . The <unk> was charged with developing security programs for industry and several were developed jointly with representatives from the power , transportation , explosives , petroleum , and communications industries . Since he was directly responsible to the Secretary of Commerce , after the Republican Administration took office in 1953 , Uanna found himself without a job . 
 After this , Uanna accepted a temporary assignment at the Department of State as Otto <unk> 's assistant . <unk> was in charge of State 's Evaluations Division . Amidst allegations from Senator Joseph McCarthy about the presence of Communist sympathizers in the Army and State Department , Uanna 's expertise in countering subversion won him the position . Using procedures he had developed at the AEC , Uanna wrote the <unk> Handbook that would be used by State Department investigators to review the loyalty and " suitability " of employees in accordance with Executive Order <unk> and Executive Order <unk> . 
 In 1953 the State Department 's physical security was split between foreign and domestic branches . Uanna reorganized these into one group called the Division of Physical Security , consisting of four branches , and took over as its new chief . He then published the Protection of Dignitaries Manual and developed the handbook used at the training school for Marine Security Guards assigned to U. S. embassies , legations and consulates overseas . As Chief of the Division , Uanna was responsible for the security of all State 's personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad . He was responsible for the security for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip 's visit to the United States in 1957 . 
 Dulles became ill in late 1958 and was replaced by Christian Herter , after which Uanna was posted overseas to Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , as an administrative officer at the U.S. Embassy . He was also the State Department liaison with the U.S. Department of Defense . He returned to the United States briefly to handle Nikita Khrushchev 's state visit in 1959 . 
 While on assignment , Uanna died of a heart attack in the office of the Air Attache at the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa on December 22 , 1961 . He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery . He was survived by his wife Bonnie née Leonard , who died on October 25 , 1992 , and his son Steven Lee .

 Uanna was portrayed by James Whitmore in the 1952 motion picture Above and Beyond . Lawrence H.

Whitmore wanted to meet Uanna , but was unable to do so . Uanna has also been portrayed by Stephen Macht in the 1980 TV movie Enola Gay : The Men , the Mission , the Atomic Bomb , and Minor Mustain in the 1995 Japanese / Canadian film Hiroshima .

 The 1998 Gator Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Tar Heels from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida on January 1 , 1998 . The game was the final contest of the 1997 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , the 53rd edition of the annual Gator Bowl game , and ended in a 42 @-@ 3 victory for North Carolina . 
 Virginia Tech was selected to play in the 1998 Gator Bowl as a reward for a 7 – 4 regular season . Facing the unranked Hokies were the No. 7 @-@ ranked North Carolina Tar Heels . The Heels had gone 10 – 1 during the regular season and were ranked seventh in the Associated Press poll heading into the game . North Carolina narrowly missed an at @-@ large selection to a higher @-@ prestige Bowl Alliance postseason game and was playing under new head coach Carl Torbush for the first time . Torbush had taken over for former head coach Mack Brown on December 8 after Brown announced that he was departing to take the position of head coach at Texas . 
 The game kicked off on January 1 , 1998 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida . From the opening kickoff , North Carolina dominated every aspect of the game . In the first quarter , the Tar Heels scored 16 unanswered points , including a defensive touchdown . North Carolina added six points in the second and third quarters before Tech scored its first points of the game — a 40 @-@ yard field goal by kicker Shayne Graham . The Tar Heels rounded out the game by scoring 14 points in the fourth quarter . The Tar Heels set school records for largest bowl game margin of victory , most points scored in a bowl game , and most touchdown passes in a bowl game . The eventual 42 – 3 loss was Virginia Tech 's largest bowl loss in school history . 
 Quarterbacks Chris Keldorf and Nick Sorensen were named the most valuable players of their respective teams , and each team saw multiple players selected in the 1998 NFL Draft , which followed the game . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 During the 1997 college football season , the Gator Bowl selection committee held contracts with both the Big East and Atlantic Coast Conferences . In exchange for guaranteeing to pay a total of $ 3 @.@ 2 million to the participating teams , the committee held the right to the second pick of bowl @-@ eligible teams from each conference . Each conference 's champion was awarded an automatic spot in a Bowl Alliance game , and it was expected that the Gator Bowl would select each conference 's second @-@ place team unless other circumstances arose . 
 Prior to the final week of the regular season , it appeared that circumstances might indeed throw that plan into confusion . North Carolina , the ACC 's second @-@ place team , had risen to No. 5 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 7 in the Associated Press college football poll , and was considered to be a candidate for an at @-@ large Bowl Alliance selection . If North Carolina was selected for a higher @-@ tier bowl game , the door would be opened for Notre Dame to play in the 1998 Gator Bowl — a circumstance provided for if neither the first nor second @-@ place ACC team was available to play . In the end , however , ACC runner @-@ up North Carolina was bypassed by Bowl Alliance officials , leaving the team available for the Gator Bowl . Facing the Tar Heels were the Virginia Tech Hokies , second @-@ place finishers in the Big East Conference . Gator Bowl officials considered inviting Big East third @-@ place West Virginia due to its reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games , but decided against inviting the Mountaineers out of recognition that North Carolina and West Virginia played each other in the 1997 Gator Bowl . 
 = = = North Carolina = = = 
 The North Carolina Tar Heels began the 1997 college football season having gone 10 – 2 in 1996 , a year that ended with a 20 – 13 win over West Virginia in the 1997 Gator Bowl . Hopes were high for the Tar Heels heading into the 1997 season , with some writers and fans picking North Carolina to have a chance to compete for the national championship . The Tar Heels bore out those hopes in the first game of the season , beating Big Ten opponent Indiana , 23 – 6 . 
 North Carolina rose to No. 7 in the national college football polls , and the victory over Indiana was followed the next week by a 28 – 17 win over No. 17 Stanford University . The two season @-@ opening wins were followed by six more in succession . The Tar Heels beat Maryland , 40 – 14 , on September 20 , and Virginia on September 27 by a score of 48 – 20 . Prior to the win against Virginia , North Carolina rose from No. 7 to No. 5 in the polls , and remained at that level after the win . Texas Christian University fell 31 – 10 to the Tar Heels on October 4 , and Wake Forest lost to North Carolina , 30 – 12 , on October 11 . After a week of inactivity , in which the Tar Heels rose to No. 4 , North Carolina defeated in @-@ state rival NC State by a score of 20 – 7 , and after another week and a half , the Tar Heels beat Georgia Tech narrowly , 16 – 13 , in a Thursday night game . 
 In their ninth game of the season , the Tar Heels lost to No. 2 Florida State , 20 – 3 . The loss was the sole losing effort for the Tar Heels in the 1997 season , and came at the hands of the eventual Atlantic Coast champion Seminoles . During the game , the Tar Heels also lost their then @-@ starting quarterback , Oscar Davenport , to a broken ankle . North Carolina recovered from the loss to win its final two games : 17 – 10 against Clemson , and 50 – 14 over Duke . Despite having only one loss , the Tar Heels were denied a chance to participate in a Bowl Alliance game and instead accepted a bid to the 1998 Gator Bowl .

 The Virginia Tech Hokies began the 1997 college football season having gone 10 – 2 the previous season , ending with a 41 – 21 loss to Nebraska in the 1996 Orange Bowl . The Hokies began the new season with hopes of repeating the success that saw the team reach consecutive Bowl Alliance games in the previous two seasons , but the loss of much of the starting lineup that led the Hokies in those years left some people 's skeptical about Tech 's chance to reach a third Bowl Alliance game . 
 In the Hokies ' first three games of the season , however , they answered their critics with wins . A season @-@ opening 59 – 19 win against Rutgers was followed by a 31 – 3 win over Syracuse and a 23 – 13 triumph against Temple . A 50 – 0 shutout win against Arkansas State University saw the Hokies elevated to the No. 14 position in the national college football polls . This , however , was followed by a 24 – 17 loss to Miami ( Ohio ) that dropped the Hokies to No. 23 . Tech rose again to No. 19 with a victory against Boston College . At No. 21 West Virginia , however , the Hokies lost , 30 – 17 . 
 The loss returned Tech to No. 23 in the polls . A recovery to No. 19 followed victories over the University of Alabama @-@ Birmingham and the University of Miami . In the final two games of the season , however , The Hokies lost to Pittsburgh , 30 – 23 , and Virginia , 34 – 20 . The dual losses dropped Tech out of the polls for the first time since the opening week of the season , and the Hokies prepared for the Gator Bowl after recording a 7 – 4 regular @-@ season record . 
 = = Pregame buildup = = 
 Pregame media coverage of the contest focused on North Carolina 's rejection by the Bowl Alliance , the Tar Heels ' new coach , and questions about whether a lightly regarded and unranked Virginia Tech team could compete with a top @-@ five North Carolina squad . This latter fact was reflected in the game 's point spread . On December 9 , shortly after the matchup was announced , spread bettors favored North Carolina to win by 12 points . Several sports commentators , including Lou Holtz and Craig James , said North Carolina deserved a more prestigious bowl game due to its high ranking . " The Alliance has not served its purpose , " Holtz said in an interview . " It 's politics as usual . " The game was the 27th meeting between the two teams , continuing a matchup that first started in 1895 . Despite that early beginning , the two teams hadn 't played each other since 1946 . 
 Tickets to the game sold quickly at first , but trailed off as the game approached . Virginia Tech sold 5 @,@ 000 tickets in the first three days after the Hokies were selected , but one week later , Tech managed to increase that total to just 8 @,@ 300 . In an effort to spur sales at the school , Virginia Tech athletic director Jim Weaver asked fans to buy tickets even if they did not plan on attending the game . The tickets could then be donated to charity . As an incentive for Gator Bowl officials to select Virginia Tech , the school agreed to sell 18 @,@ 000 tickets — more than the minimum 11 @,@ 500 North Carolina agreed to sell . When a shortfall resulted in Tech selling just 11 @,@ 000 tickets , the school was forced to purchase the remaining 7 @,@ 000 , costing Virginia Tech $ 245 @,@ 000 . At North Carolina , tickets sales were even slower , with about 6 @,@ 000 having been sold through the school two weeks after the matchup was announced . The Gator Bowl ticket office sold approximately 22 @,@ 000 tickets directly to fans in the same timeframe , and Gator Bowl officials predicted a crowd of between 50 @,@ 000 and 55 @,@ 000 people at the game . 
 Reduced ticket sales were a concern for Gator Bowl officials , who eyed an expiring television contract with NBC following the game . If attendance and viewership of the game 's broadcast were low , it could have a negative effect on negotiations for future contracts with NBC or its rival , CBS . 
 = = = Brown and Torbush = = = 
 Following the conclusion of the regular season and prior to North Carolina 's acceptance of the invitation to play in the Gator Bowl , Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown received an offer from the Texas Longhorns to become that school 's head coach . A day and a half after Texas extended the offer , Brown resigned his position as North Carolina 's head coach and accepted the Texas job . He replaced John Mackovic , who was fired three days earlier after finishing the season with a 4 – 7 record . 
 Immediately after Brown 's resignation , the question of his replacement and who would coach the team during the Gator Bowl arose . Brown offered to stay on to coach the team through the bowl game , but the proposal was met with hostility from some North Carolina players who felt betrayed by the coach 's resignation . School administrators ' first choice to replace Brown was then @-@ Georgia head coach Jim Donnan , who previously characterized the North Carolina head coaching position as his " dream job . " Donnan rejected the administrators ' offer , however , saying that he had a commitment to his then @-@ current players . 
 Following Donnan 's rejection of the North Carolina offer , several Tar Heel players approached North Carolina athletics director Dick <unk> , demanding that he hire Brown 's defensive coordinator , Carl Torbush , as the team 's new head coach . Torbush and UNC offensive coordinator Greg Davis were considered the two likeliest remaining candidates , but after Davis indicated his intention to follow Brown to Texas , UNC administrators acquiesced to the players ' demand and named Torbush as North Carolina 's new head football coach .

 On the same day Mack Brown announced his acceptance of the Texas head coaching position , seven North Carolina football players allegedly assaulted a North Carolina student , severely injuring him . All seven were charged with offenses ranging from misdemeanor assault to simple assault . Among the players charged were defensive leader and All @-@ American linebacker Kivuusama Mays and two other starters on North Carolina 's defense . At the time , UNC policy dictated the immediate suspension of any player charged with a felony , and punishment for lesser charges to be decided on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis . After investigating the incident , North Carolina school officials cleared six of the seven accused players to participate in the Gator Bowl with judicial charges still pending . The seventh accused player , backup defensive tackle Ricco McCain , was suspended indefinitely from the team while legal action proceeded . 
 The North Carolina coaching staff and administration was criticized for allowing the accused players to participate in the game , with at least one critic saying the school only did so in order to better its chances to win the game . Following the game , three of the players — Varian Ballard , Greg Harris and Ricco McCain — were found guilty of simple assault . Two others were found not guilty and charges were dismissed against another . The seventh player , Kivuusama Mays , pleaded no contest to the charge .

 On the field , North Carolina 's offense was led by quarterback Chris Keldorf . Keldorf was plagued by injuries during his college career , but still managed to set a North Carolina single @-@ game passing record when he threw for 415 yards against Texas Christian University . He replaced original starting quarterback Oscar Davenport , who broke his ankle midway through the regular season . Keldorf finished the season having completed 104 of 181 passes for 1 @,@ 448 yards , 12 touchdowns , and nine interceptions . With Keldorf and Davenport splitting command during the regular season , North Carolina averaged 27 @.@ 8 points and 379 yards per game . 
 The favorite passing target for Keldorf and Davenport was wide receiver Na Brown , who set a school record by catching 55 passes during the regular season . Overall , North Carolina 's offense averaged 262 passing yards per game during the season . 
 On the ground , North Carolina 's rushing game was led by running back Johnathan Linton , who finished the season with 1 @,@ 004 yards and 11 touchdowns . He was the 24th player in North Carolina history to rush for more than 1 @,@ 000 yards in a season and against Georgia Tech became the first Tar Heel in school history to rush for more than 100 yards and have more than 100 yards receiving in the same game . In a practice just before the game , however , Linton strained a ligament in his right knee , putting his presence at the game in doubt . Linton 's backup was Mike Geter , who played in 11 games this year and had 55 rushes for 245 yds and 5 receptions for <unk> . Geter was the team 's 2nd Leading Rusher behind Linton North Carolina fullback Deon Dyer , who rushed 25 times for 90 yards during the regular season , was not expected to play in the Gator Bowl due to a fractured fibula suffered in the Tar Heels ' 10th game of the season .

 During the regular season , the Hokies averaged 29 @.@ 3 points per game and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games — a streak dating to the 1995 season . Virginia Tech 's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark , who passed for 1 @,@ 476 yards and 10 touchdowns . He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season . At the beginning of December , however , Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint . Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery , it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or if he would be able to play at full strength . Four days prior to the game , Clark 's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102 @-@ degree fever . Clark 's backup , redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen , completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns . 
 Also injured was Virginia Tech wide receiver Ricky Scales . Scales didn 't play for 10 weeks during the regular season because of surgery to an injured tendon . Despite playing in only four games during the season , he finished the regular season as the Hokies ' No. 5 receiver , catching 13 passes for 298 yards . Scales ' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among the worst in the Big East in receiving yardage , averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air . As the game moved closer , however , Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength . 
 Virginia Tech 's rushing offense , led by running back Ken Oxendine , led the Big East in rushing yards , averaging 215 @.@ 3 yards per game . Oxendine entered the Gator Bowl as the No. 5 rusher in Virginia Tech history to that point , and accumulated 904 rushing yards and 13 receptions during his final season as a Hokie . Oxendine was supported by fullback Marcus Parker , who ran for 363 yards and four touchdowns during the regular season . Parker also found success in the passing game , becoming Tech 's leading receiver for the season by catching 20 passes for 212 yards . He was the first Virginia Tech runner since 1969 to lead the team in receptions . Backing up Oxendine was running back Lamont Pegues , a transfer student from Clemson who accumulated 85 carries for 391 yards and five touchdowns . All three players were assisted by Virginia Tech 's offensive line , which was led by Gennaro DiNapoli . DiNapoli was named to the All @-@ ACC team , but was predicted to face a tough task in stopping North Carolina 's top @-@ ranked defense . 
 = = = North Carolina defense = = = 
 North Carolina 's defense was among the best in the country during the regular season , finishing the year ranked second in total defense ( 209 @.@ 3 yards per game ) and fifth in scoring defense ( 13 points per game ) . The Tar Heels also were ranked second in the country in terms of rushing yards , allowing an average of 77 @.@ 9 rushing yards per game during the regular season . Those statistics were due to the performance of three consensus first @-@ team All @-@ America defenders : defensive end Greg Ellis , linebacker Brian Simmons and cornerback <unk> Bly . Ellis had 87 tackles during the season ( 18 for loss ) to lead the team in both categories . Another defender , linebacker Kivuusama Mays , was a third @-@ team All @-@ American . Simmons in particular felt confident enough to guarantee prior to the game that the Tar Heels would win if they held Virginia Tech to 20 points or less . No team had scored more than that total since the 1995 season . 
 Other North Carolina defensive players also performed well during the season . Defensive tackle Vonnie Holliday was named a first @-@ team All @-@ ACC selection after earning 64 tackles — 13 for loss . Fellow defensive tackle Russell Davis finished just behind Holliday in total tackles with 60 . 
 The Tar Heels faced a setback on defense when first @-@ team All @-@ ACC defensive back Robert Williams was involved in a car accident that injured his face , neck , and shoulder . Despite requiring more than 20 stitches , however , Williams recovered from his injuries to play in the game . 
 = = = Virginia Tech defense = = = 
 The Hokies ' defense , which appeared strong in the first games of the season , faltered in later games , allowing 129 points in its final five games . During the entire season , the Hokies allowed only 185 points . One of the stars of the Virginia Tech defense was defensive tackle Nat Williams , who had a team @-@ best 8 @.@ 5 tackles for loss amid 52 total tackles . Linebacker Steve Tate was the team 's leader in tackles , recording 104 . Former walk @-@ on defensive tackle Kerwin Hairston was fifth on the team in tackles ( 69 ) and tied for third in sacks ( 3 @.@ 5 ) and quarterback hurries ( eight ) . Starting linebacker Cory Bird was predicted to miss the game due to a knee injury . 
 Virginia Tech 's special teams squad was more highly regarded than its defense . Overall , Virginia Tech was 14th nationally in net punting and 37th in kickoff returns . Punter Jimmy Kibble was the No. 10 player in the country at his position , averaging 45 @.@ 1 yards per kick during the regular season . Because of Virginia Tech 's success at blocking kicks — the Hokies blocked seven during the season — North Carolina made a special effort to prepare for Virginia Tech 's kick blockers on special teams . Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham set Big East single @-@ season records for field goals made ( 19 ) and points scored by kicking ( 92 ) during the season . He was 35 of 36 on extra points and 19 for 23 on field goals , but caught the flu prior to the Gator Bowl .

Charlie Jones , Bob <unk> , John Dockery were the sportscasters of the broadcast . During the week prior to the game , the weather had been cold and rainy , with temperatures in the mid @-@ 40s and more than two inches of rain . At kickoff , the weather was clear , with temperatures near 55 degrees . North Carolina won the ceremonial pre @-@ game coin toss to determine first possession and elected to play defense to begin the game . 
 = = = First quarter = = = 
 The game 's opening kickoff was returned to the Virginia Tech 22 @-@ yard line , and the Hokies ran the first play of the game — a pass from quarterback Al Clark to fullback Marcus Parker . The play went for nine yards , but the Hokies needed two runs by running back Ken Oxendine to pick up the remaining yard and the first down . From the Tech 32 @-@ yard line , the Hokies earned one yard on two plays before Clark completed a seven @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Angelo Harrison . Still short of the first down , the Hokies were forced to punt . The ball rolled out of bounds at the North Carolina 19 @-@ yard line , and with 12 : 16 remaining in the first quarter , North Carolina prepared for its first possession of the game . 
 On the Tar Heels ' first play of the game , running back Jonathan Linton ran up the middle for a three @-@ yard gain . After the gain , Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf completed a 31 @-@ yard pass to tight end Alge Crumpler for a first down at the Virginia Tech 47 @-@ yard line . Now inside Virginia Tech territory , Linton ran for a five @-@ yard gain , which was followed by a pass from Keldorf to Linton , who gained 26 yards on the play . Following the catch , North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16 @-@ yard line . Linton left the field limping slightly , and backup running Mike Geter replaced him , then ran for four yards up the middle . Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play , and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete . North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29 @-@ yard field goal , which was good . With 9 : 15 remaining in the quarter , North Carolina took a 3 – 0 lead . 
 North Carolina 's post @-@ score kickoff was returned to the Virginia Tech 25 @-@ yard line , and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game . Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt , and another attempt on the next play was stopped for a loss of a yard . Facing third down , Clark attempted to scramble for the first down , but was stopped after a gain of six yards . Having gone three and out , the Hokies punted again . The kick was downed at the 36 @-@ yard line , and North Carolina 's offense returned for its second possession of the game . On the first play of the drive , Linton gained two yards on a run up the middle of the field . On the next play , Keldorf completed a 62 @-@ yard pass to <unk> Barnes , who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense . Barnes sprinted into the end zone for a touchdown , and after the extra point kick , North Carolina led 10 – 0 with 6 : 07 remaining in the quarter . 
 Following the kickoff by North Carolina and a short return , Virginia Tech took over at its 26 @-@ yard line . On Tech 's first play , Clark completed a seven @-@ yard pass to Williams . Running back Lamont Pegues then was stopped for a one @-@ yard loss , and Clark 's third @-@ down pass attempt fell incomplete . After again going three and out , Tech punted . The kick was returned to the North Carolina 14 @-@ yard line , and the Tar Heels began their third possession of the game . The first play of the drive was a pass from Keldorf to Crumpler , who gained 10 yards and a first down . From the Tar Heels ' 24 @-@ yard line , Linton gained one yard on a short run , then Keldorf threw a 30 @-@ yard pass to wide receiver Na Brown . The play gave the Tar Heels a first down at the Tech 44 @-@ yard line , and Linton gained four yards with a running play on first down . Two incomplete passes later , North Carolina punted for the first time in the game . The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback , and the Hokies ' offense started at the 20 @-@ yard line with 2 : 49 left in the quarter . 
 A one @-@ yard rush was followed by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards . Following the negative @-@ yardage play , North Carolina committed a five @-@ yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven . Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty , Clark 's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt . During the kick , however , North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble . Tar Heels ' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball and ran into the end zone for North Carolina 's second touchdown of the game . Following the play , North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35 @-@ yard extra point kick was no good . Despite the missed kick , North Carolina extended its lead to 16 – 0 with 1 : 03 remaining in the first quarter . 
 Virginia Tech 's kick returner slipped during the subsequent kickoff , and the Hokies ' offense started at its 13 @-@ yard line . Oxendine gained three yards on the first play of the drive , then Clark was sacked for a nine @-@ yard loss . The sack was the final play of the first quarter , and North Carolina had a 16 – 0 lead with three quarters still to be played . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 The second quarter began with Virginia Tech in possession of the ball and facing a long third down after a quarterback sack on the final play of the first quarter . On the first play of the quarter , Tech quarterback Al Clark was sacked by Brian Simmons , and this time he fumbled the ball . The loose ball was picked up in the end zone by Carolina defender Greg Ellis for the Tar Heels ' third touchdown of the game . Because North Carolina missed its extra @-@ point kick following its previous touchdown , Tar Heels ' head coach Carl Torbush ordered the team to attempt a two @-@ point conversion in order to gain the missed extra point from the previous play . A pass attempt by Keldorf fell incomplete , but with just seven seconds elapsed in the second quarter , North Carolina led 22 – 0 . 
 The Tar Heels ' kickoff was returned to the Hokies ' 24 @-@ yard line . Clark scrambled for one yard , then completed a five @-@ yard pass . Facing third down and four , Clark scrambled for a first down at the Tech 38 @-@ yard line . Following the first down , Parker gained two yards on a running play . Clark then completed a 10 @-@ yard pass to Parker , and the Hokies were aided by a 15 @-@ yard personal foul facemask penalty against North Carolina during the play . Following the pass and penalty , Tech entered North Carolina territory for the first time and had a first down at the Tar Heels ' 35 @-@ yard line . On the first play inside Carolina territory , Clark completed a 35 @-@ yard pass to Parker for an apparent touchdown , but the play was negated by a 15 @-@ yard penalty against Virginia Tech . From the 50 @-@ yard line , Pegues ran for four yards and Clark threw two incomplete passes , forcing a punt . The kick was downed at the Carolina 10 @-@ yard line , and the Tar Heels ' offense took over with 10 : 40 remaining before halftime . 
 Linton ran for nine yards , then picked up a first down with a five @-@ yard gain on second down . Keldorf completed a 12 @-@ yard pass to Barnes for a first down , Linton ran seven yards to the Carolina 43 @-@ yard line , then gained another first down with a run to the 50 @-@ yard line . From midfield , Keldorf attempted a deep pass on first down , but the ball fell incomplete . On second down , Keldorf completed a four @-@ yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by the Virginia Tech defense . The sack forced Carolina to punt for the second time in the game , and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11 @-@ yard line . 
 From that point , Pegues rushed for 13 yards on the first play of the drive , giving the Hokies a first down at their 24 @-@ yard line . Two more rushes by Pegues gained seven yards , then North Carolina committed a five @-@ yard offsides penalty , giving the Hokies a first down at the 36 @-@ yard line . Clark threw an incomplete pass , Pegues was tackled for no gain on a running play , then Tech committed a five @-@ yard delay of game penalty . On third down , Clark was sacked for a loss , and Tech punted . The kick was partially blocked , allowing North Carolina to return the ball to the 45 @-@ yard line of Virginia Tech . The Tar Heels thus began a drive inside Virginia Tech territory with 3 : 33 remaining in the first half . 
 The first play of the drive was a six @-@ yard run by Linton , and it was followed by an incomplete pass from Keldorf to Crumpler . Crumpler made up for the missed pass on the next play , when he caught a short pass for a first down from Keldorf . Now at the Hokies ' 31 , Linton ran straight ahead for a two @-@ yard gain . Linton 's run was followed by two incomplete passes by Keldorf , but rather than punt , the Tar Heels attempted to try to convert the fourth down . The fourth @-@ down pass fell incomplete , and the Tar Heels turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 30 @-@ yard line . Clark completed a six @-@ yard pass to Parker , then threw an incomplete pass downfield with less than a minute remaining on the clock . On third down , Clark completed a nine @-@ yard pass to Michael <unk> for a first down . A first @-@ down pass attempt was batted down by the North Carolina defense , but on second down , Clark completed a pass to <unk> for a first down at the Tar Heels 40 @-@ yard line . After a deep pass went incomplete , Clark was sacked and fumbled the ball for the second time in the first half . The loose ball was picked up by Vonnie Holliday with 13 seconds remaining , and the Tar Heels ' offense returned to the field . North Carolina tried a deep pass in an attempt to get into scoring position before the end of the half , but Keldorf was sacked and the Tar Heels kneeled on the football to end the half with a 22 – 0 lead .

 Because Virginia Tech began the first half in possession of the football , North Carolina received the ball to begin the second half . The Hokies ' kickoff was returned to the 39 @-@ yard line , Virginia Tech committed a 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalty , and North Carolina began the first possession of the second half at the Virginia Tech 46 @-@ yard line . The first play of the half was a short run by Linton , and after two incomplete passes by Keldorf , the Tar Heels prepared to punt . Rather than kick , however , North Carolina faked a punt and had punter Brian Schmitz pass the ball to linebacker Brian Simmons , who normally played defense . Simmons gained 28 yards and a first down on the play , which allowed the Tar Heels to continue their drive . Now at the Hokies ' 13 @-@ yard line , North Carolina committed a five @-@ yard delay of game penalty . On the next play , Linton made up the lost yardage , gaining six yards and advancing the ball to the Tech 12 @-@ yard line . The running play was followed by a pass from Keldorf to Linton for an eight @-@ yard gain . Needing one yard to gain a first down , North Carolina was stopped on third down then attempted to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal . Keldorf ran the ball straight ahead and gained the needed yardage , gaining a first down at the three @-@ yard line . Two plays later , Linton ran across the goal line and into the end zone for the Tar Heels ' first touchdown of the second half . The extra point kick was partially blocked by the Virginia Tech defense and was no good , but the Tar Heels still extended their lead to 28 – 0 with 9 : 43 remaining in the quarter . 
 Virginia Tech returned North Carolina 's kickoff to their 22 @-@ yard line , and the Hokies began their first drive of the second half . <unk> the Hokies was backup quarterback Nick Sorensen , who replaced starter Al Clark . On the drive 's first play , running back Ken Oxendine broke free of the North Carolina defense for a 36 @-@ yard gain and a first down at the North Carolina 42 @-@ yard line . Sorensen scrambled for a two @-@ yard gain , then completed a pass to wide receiver Shawn Scales at the 27 @-@ yard line for another first down . A run by Marcus Parker gained one yard , Sorensen was tackled for a two @-@ yard loss , then threw an incomplete pass . Facing fourth down and needing 11 yards , Tech coach Frank Beamer attempted to convert the fourth down rather than punt , and Sorensen scrambled for a first down at the 16 @-@ yard line . From there , Oxendine was stopped for a loss of five yards , Sorensen was sacked for a seven @-@ yard loss , and Sorensen completed a short pass to Parker . Beamer elected not to attempt to convert another fourth down and instead sent kicker Shayne Graham into the game to attempt a 40 @-@ yard field goal . The kick was good , and with 4 : 37 remaining in the quarter , Tech cut North Carolina 's lead to 28 – 3 . 
 The Hokie kickoff rolled into the end zone for a touchback , and North Carolina started its second drive of the half from its 20 @-@ yard line . The first play of the drive was a three @-@ yard run , and it was followed by a six @-@ yard pass from Keldorf to Linton . Needing a single yard for a first down , the Tar Heels rushed straight ahead and gained two yards and the first down at the 31 @-@ yard line . North Carolina continued to move the ball efficiently : Linton gained two yards on a rushing play , then Keldorf threw a short pass to Linton that gained 37 yards after Linton broke free of the Virginia Tech defense . The play resulted in a first down at the Virginia Tech 31 @-@ yard line . There , however , Keldorf was sacked for a three @-@ yard loss . After the sack , Keldorf completed a 21 @-@ yard pass to Crumpler for a first down at the 13 @-@ yard line . Keldorf then attempted to scramble for a gain , but was stopped for no gain . That play was the final one of the quarter , which ended with North Carolina still in possession of a firm lead , 28 – 3 .

 The fourth quarter began with North Carolina in possession of the ball and facing a second down and 11 on the Tech 14 @-@ yard line . On the first play of the quarter , Keldorf completed a 14 @-@ yard pass to Barnes for a touchdown . The extra point was good , and the Tar Heels extended their lead to 35 – 3 with 14 : 55 remaining in the game . North Carolina 's kickoff was returned to the Tech 34 @-@ yard line , and the Hokies ' offense began the first full drive of the fourth quarter . Tech 's first play of the drive was a trick reverse to Scales , who gained 29 yards and a first down on the trick play . After an incomplete pass by Sorensen from the Carolina 37 @-@ yard line , Pegues rushed for four yards , then the Hokies were stopped for no gain on third down . Tech attempted to convert the fourth down , but Sorensen 's pass fell incomplete and Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs with 12 : 39 remaining . 
 Following the turnover , the Tar Heels had a first down at their 32 @-@ yard line . Linton was stopped for no gain on a rushing play , passed for no gain , then completed a nine @-@ yard pass to Brown . Failing to gain the first down , the Tar Heels punted and the ball was returned to the 30 @-@ yard line . Oxendine gained two yards on a rush up the right side , then Sorensen ran for one yard on the left side of the field . On third down , Sorensen scrambled for a first down before fumbling the football . The loose ball was picked up by Tech lineman Derek Smith , and the Hokies ' drive continued . After a rush for no gain , another running play resulted in a Tech fumble , their second of the drive . Unlike the previous fumble , however , this one was recovered by North Carolina 's Russell Davis , and the Tar Heels offense was put into position for another scoring attempt . 
 After the turnover , North Carolina had a first down at the Tech 34 @-@ yard line . Keldorf threw an eight @-@ yard pass to Crumpler , North Carolina was stopped for a one @-@ yard loss on a running play , then the Tar Heels earned a first down with a four @-@ yard run by Geter . On first down , Keldorf threw an incomplete pass . Second down resulted in a 15 @-@ yard gain and a first down on a run by Geter along the left side of the field . Now at the Tech eight @-@ yard line , Geter ran straight ahead for a five @-@ yard gain . Geter was stopped for a two @-@ yard loss on the next play , but North Carolina recovered from the loss with a five @-@ yard pass from Keldorf to Carrick for a touchdown . The extra point kick was blocked , but a penalty against Virginia Tech allowed Carolina kicker Josh McGee another chance at the extra point . The second attempt was successful , and the kick gave the Tar Heels a 42 – 3 lead with 5 : 01 remaining in the game . 
 The Hokies returned North Carolina 's kickoff to the Tech 35 @-@ yard line , and the Hokies began their final possession of the game . Sorensen completed a four @-@ yard pass , then ran for 19 yards and a first down at the North Carolina 42 @-@ yard line . A shovel pass by Sorensen gained three yards , but he lost three yards on the next play and was sacked for a six @-@ yard loss on third down . A fourth @-@ down pass was batted down by the Carolina defense , and the Tar Heels ' offense returned to the field with 2 : 41 remaining in the game . 
 Backup quarterback Kevin Carty came onto the field for the Tar Heels , and handed the ball to Dominique Williams , who ran the ball twice for one yard . On third down , he broke free of the Virginia Tech defense and gained 20 yards and a first down at the Tech 33 @-@ yard line . Two more rushes gained three yards and ran the remaining time off the game clock . Time expired , and North Carolina won the 1998 Gator Bowl , 42 – 3 .

 = Don Bradman = 
 Sir Donald George " Don " Bradman , AC ( 27 August 1908 – 25 February 2001 ) , often referred to as " The Don " , was an Australian cricketer , widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time . Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99 @.@ 94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport . 
 The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression . 
 During a 20 @-@ year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , " worth three batsmen to Australia " . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team @-@ mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as " The Invincibles " on a record @-@ breaking unbeaten tour of England . 
 A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships , Bradman retained a pre @-@ eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised — more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the " greatest living Australian " . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image , and on 19 November 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Donald George Bradman was the youngest son of George and Emily ( née Whatman ) Bradman , and was born on 27 August 1908 at Cootamundra , New South Wales ( NSW ) . He had a brother , Victor , and three sisters — Islet , Lilian and Elizabeth May . One of his great @-@ grandfathers was one of the first Italians to migrate to Australia in 1826 . Bradman 's parents lived in the hamlet of Yeo Yeo , near <unk> . His mother Emily gave birth to him at the Cootamundra home of Granny Scholz , a midwife . That house is now the Bradman Birthplace Museum . Emily had hailed from Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands , and in 1911 , when Don Bradman was about two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years old , his parents decided to relocate to Bowral , close to Mittagong , to be closer to Emily 's family and friends , as life at Yeo Yeo was proving difficult . 
 Bradman practised batting incessantly during his youth . He invented his own solo cricket game , using a cricket stump for a bat , and a golf ball . A water tank , mounted on a curved brick stand , stood on a paved area behind the family home . When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand , the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles — and Bradman would attempt to hit it again . This form of practice developed his timing and reactions to a high degree . In more formal cricket , he hit his first century at the age of 12 , with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School .

 In 1920 – 21 , Bradman acted as scorer for the local Bowral team , captained by his uncle George Whatman . In October 1920 , he filled in when the team was one man short , scoring 37 not out and 29 not out on debut . During the season , Bradman 's father took him to the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) to watch the fifth Ashes Test match . On that day , Bradman formed an ambition . " I shall never be satisfied " , he told his father , " until I play on this ground " . Bradman left school in 1922 and went to work for a local real estate agent who encouraged his sporting pursuits by giving him time off when necessary . He gave up cricket in favour of tennis for two years , but resumed playing cricket in 1925 – 26 . 
 Bradman became a regular selection for the Bowral team ; several outstanding performances earned him the attention of the Sydney daily press . Competing on matting @-@ over @-@ concrete pitches , Bowral played other rural towns in the Berrima District competition . Against Wingello , a team that included the future Test bowler Bill O 'Reilly , Bradman made 234 . In the competition final against Moss Vale , which extended over five consecutive Saturdays , Bradman scored 320 not out . During the following Australian winter ( 1926 ) , an ageing Australian team lost The Ashes in England , and a number of Test players retired . The New South Wales Cricket Association began a hunt for new talent . Mindful of Bradman 's big scores for Bowral , the association wrote to him , requesting his attendance at a practice session in Sydney . He was subsequently chosen for the " Country Week " tournaments at both cricket and tennis , to be played during separate weeks . His boss presented him with an ultimatum : he could have only one week away from work , and therefore had to choose between the two sports . He chose cricket . Bradman 's performances during Country Week resulted in an invitation to play grade cricket in Sydney for St George in the 1926 – 27 season . He scored 110 on his debut , making his first century on a turf wicket . On 1 January 1927 , he turned out for the NSW second team . For the remainder of the season , Bradman travelled the 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) from Bowral to Sydney every Saturday to play for St George . 
 = = = First @-@ class debut = = = 
 The next season continued the rapid rise of the " Boy from Bowral " . Selected to replace the unfit Archie Jackson in the NSW team , Bradman made his first @-@ class debut at the Adelaide Oval , aged 19 . He secured the achievement of a hundred on debut , with an innings of 118 featuring what soon became his trademarks — fast footwork , calm confidence and rapid scoring . In the final match of the season , he made his first century at the SCG , against the Sheffield Shield champions Victoria . Despite his potential , Bradman was not chosen for the Australian second team to tour New Zealand . 
 Bradman decided that his chances for Test selection would be improved by moving to Sydney for the 1928 – 29 season , when England were to tour in defence of the Ashes . Initially , he continued working in real estate , but later took a promotions job with the sporting goods retailer Mick Simmons Ltd . In the first match of the Sheffield Shield season , he scored a century in each innings against Queensland . He followed this with scores of 87 and 132 not out against the England touring team , and was rewarded with selection for the first Test , to be played at Brisbane .

 Playing in only his tenth first @-@ class match , Bradman , nicknamed " <unk> " by his teammates , found his initial Test a harsh learning experience . Caught on a sticky wicket , Australia were all out for 66 in the second innings and lost by 675 runs ( still a Test record ) . Following scores of 18 and 1 , the selectors dropped Bradman to twelfth man for the Second Test . An injury to Bill Ponsford early in the match required Bradman to field as substitute while England amassed 636 , following their 863 runs in the First Test . RS Whitington wrote , " ... he had scored only nineteen himself and these experiences appear to have provided him with food for thought " . Recalled for the Third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , Bradman scored 79 and 112 to become the youngest player to make a Test century , although the match was still lost . Another loss followed in the Fourth Test . Bradman reached 58 in the second innings and appeared set to guide the team to victory when he was run out . It was to be the only run out of his Test career . The losing margin was just 12 runs . 
 The improving Australians did manage to win the Fifth and final Test . Bradman top @-@ scored with 123 in the first innings , and was at the wicket in the second innings when his captain Jack Ryder hit the winning runs . Bradman completed the season with 1 @,@ 690 first @-@ class runs , averaging 93 @.@ 88 , and his first multiple century in a Sheffield Shield match , 340 not out against Victoria , set a new ground record for the SCG . Bradman averaged 113 @.@ 28 in 1929 – 30 . In a trial match to select the team that would tour England , he was last man out in the first innings for 124 . As his team followed on , the skipper Bill Woodfull asked Bradman to keep the pads on and open the second innings . By the end of play , he was 205 not out , on his way to 225 . Against Queensland at the SCG , Bradman set a then world record for first @-@ class cricket by scoring 452 not out ; he made his runs in only 415 minutes . Not long after the feat , he recalled : 
 On 434 ... I had a curious intuition ... I seemed to sense that the ball would be a short @-@ pitched one on the leg @-@ stump , and I could almost feel myself getting ready to make my shot before the ball was delivered . Sure enough , it pitched exactly where I had anticipated , and , hooking it to the square @-@ leg boundary , I established the only record upon which I had set my heart . 
 Although he was an obvious selection to tour England , Bradman 's unorthodox style raised doubts that he could succeed on the slower English pitches . Percy Fender wrote : 
 ... he will always be in the category of the brilliant , if unsound , ones . Promise there is in Bradman in plenty , though watching him does not inspire one with any confidence that he desires to take the only course which will lead him to a fulfilment of that promise . He makes a mistake , then makes it again and again ; he does not correct it , or look as if he were trying to do so . He seems to live for the exuberance of the moment . 
 The encomiums were not confined to his batting gifts ; nor did the criticism extend to his character . " Australia has unearthed a champion , " raved former Australian Test great Clem Hill , " self @-@ taught , with natural ability . But most important of all , with his heart in the right place . " Selector Dick Jones weighed in with the observation that it was " good to watch him talking to an old player , listening attentively to everything that is said and then replying with a modest ' thank you ' . " 
 = = = 1930 tour of England = = = 
 England were favourites to win the 1930 Ashes series , and if the Australians were to exceed expectations , their young batsmen , Bradman and Jackson , needed to prosper . With his elegant batting technique , Jackson appeared the brighter prospect of the pair . However , Bradman began the tour with 236 at Worcester and went on to score 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs by the end of May , the fifth player ( and first Australian ) to achieve this rare feat . In his first Test appearance in England , Bradman hit 131 in the second innings but England won the match . His batting reached a new level in the Second Test at Lord 's where he scored 254 as Australia won and levelled the series . Later in life , Bradman rated this the best innings of his career as , " practically without exception every ball went where it was intended to go " . Wisden noted his fast footwork and how he hit the ball " all round the wicket with power and accuracy " , as well as faultless concentration in keeping the ball on the ground . 
 In terms of runs scored , this performance was soon surpassed . In the Third Test , at Leeds , Bradman scored a century before lunch on 11 July , the first day of the Test match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney . In the afternoon , Bradman added another century between lunch and tea , before finishing the day on 309 not out . He remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day 's play . His eventual score of 334 was a world @-@ record , exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham . Bradman dominated the Australian innings ; the second @-@ highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax . Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Bradman with a cheque for £ 1 @,@ 000 in appreciation of his achievement . The match ended in anti @-@ climax as poor weather prevented a result , as it also did in the Fourth Test . 
 In the deciding Test at The Oval , England made 405 . During an innings stretching over three days due to intermittent rain , Bradman made yet another multiple century , this time 232 , which helped give Australia a big lead of 290 runs . In a crucial partnership with Archie Jackson , Bradman battled through a difficult session when England fast bowler Harold Larwood bowled short on a pitch enlivened by the rain . Wisden gave this period of play only a passing mention : 
 On the Wednesday morning the ball flew about a good deal , both batsmen frequently being hit on the body ... on more than one occasion each player cocked the ball up dangerously but always , as it happened , just wide of the fieldsmen . 
 A number of English players and commentators noted Bradman 's discomfort in playing the short , rising delivery . The revelation came too late for this particular match , but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series . Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes . The victory made an impact in Australia . With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising , the country found solace in sporting triumph . The story of a self @-@ taught 22 @-@ year @-@ old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero . The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour , and in the Test matches in particular , broke records for the day and some have stood the test of time . In all , Bradman scored 974 runs at an average of 139 @.@ 14 during the Test series , with four centuries , including two double hundreds and a triple . As of 2012 , no @-@ one has matched or exceeded 974 runs or three double centuries in one Test series ; the record of 974 runs exceeds the second @-@ best performance by 69 runs and was achieved in two fewer innings . Bradman 's first @-@ class tally , 2 @,@ 960 runs ( at an average of 98 @.@ 66 with 10 centuries ) , was another enduring record : the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England . 
 On the tour , the dynamic nature of Bradman 's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet , solitary off @-@ field demeanour . He was described as aloof from his teammates and he did not offer to buy them a round of drinks , let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw . Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone , writing , as he had sold the rights to a book . On his return to Australia , Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception ; he became a " reluctant hero " . Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee 's newly won fame . They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide , Melbourne , Goulburn , his hometown Bowral and Sydney , where he received a brand new custom @-@ built Chevrolet . At each stop , Bradman received a level of adulation that " embarrassed " him . This focus on individual accomplishment , in a team game , " ... permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries " . Commenting on Australia 's victory , the team 's vice @-@ captain Vic Richardson said , " ... we could have played any team without Bradman , but we could not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett " . A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying " I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side , and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches . My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia . " 
 = = = Reluctant hero = = = 
 In 1930 – 31 , against the first West Indian side to visit Australia , Bradman 's scoring was more sedate than in England — although he did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne . However , he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against the South Africans in the Australian summer of 1931 – 32 . For NSW against the tourists , he made 30 , 135 and 219 . In the Test matches , he scored 226 ( 277 minutes ) , 112 ( 155 minutes ) , 2 and 167 ( 183 minutes ) ; his 299 not out in the Fourth Test , at Adelaide , set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia . Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series . 
 At this point , Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930 , scoring 2 @,@ 227 runs at an average of 131 . He had played 18 innings , scoring 10 centuries , six of which had extended beyond 200 . His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour , with 856 ( or 38 @.@ 5 % of his tally ) scored in boundaries . Significantly , he had not hit a six , which typified Bradman 's attitude : if he hit the ball along the ground , then it could not be caught . During this phase of his career , his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a " machine @-@ like " approach to batting . The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as , " heart @-@ breaking ... with his sort of cynical grin , which rather reminds one of the Sphinx ... he never seems to perspire " . 
 Between these two seasons , Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington , a move that , according to the rules of the day , would have ended his Test career . A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative . They devised a two @-@ year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers , broadcast on Radio <unk> and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son . However , the contract increased Bradman 's dependence on his public profile , making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired . 
 Bradman 's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life . The church " was under siege all throughout the day ... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view " ; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat . Just weeks later , Bradman joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada . He travelled with his wife , and the couple treated the trip as a honeymoon . Playing 51 games in 75 days , Bradman scored 3 @,@ 779 runs at 102 @.@ 1 , with 18 centuries . Although the standard of play was not high , the effects of the amount of cricket Bradman had played in the three previous years , together with the strains of his celebrity status , began to show on his return home . 
 = = = Bodyline = = = 
 Within the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , which administered English cricket at the time , few voices were more influential than " Plum " Warner 's , who , when considering England 's response to Bradman , wrote that it " must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill " . To that end , Warner orchestrated the appointment of Douglas Jardine as England captain in 1931 , as a prelude to Jardine leading the 1932 – 33 tour to Australia , with Warner as team manager . Remembering that Bradman had struggled against bouncers during his 232 at The Oval in 1930 , Jardine decided to combine traditional leg theory with short @-@ pitched bowling to combat Bradman . He settled on the Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce as the spearheads for his tactics . In support , the England selectors chose another three pacemen for the squad . The unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and roused Bradman 's own suspicions . 
 Bradman had other problems to deal with at this time ; among these were bouts of illness from an undiagnosed malaise which had begun during the tour of North America , and that the Australian Board of Control had initially refused permission for him to write a column for the Sydney Sun . Bradman , who had signed a two @-@ year contract with the newspaper , threatened to withdraw from cricket to honour his contract when the board denied him permission to write ; eventually , the paper released Bradman from the contract , in a victory for the board . In three first @-@ class games against England before the Tests , Bradman averaged just 17 @.@ 16 in 6 innings . Jardine decided to give the new tactics a trial in only one game , a fixture against an Australian XI at Melbourne . In this match , Bradman faced the leg theory and later warned local administrators that trouble was brewing if it continued . He withdrew from the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground amid rumours that he had suffered a nervous breakdown . Despite his absence , England employed what were already becoming known as the Bodyline tactics against the Australian batsmen and won an ill @-@ tempered match . 
 The public clamoured for the return of Bradman to defeat Bodyline : " he was the batsman who could conquer this <unk> bowling ... ' <unk> ' , amounting almost to religious fervour , demanded his return " . Recovered from his indisposition , Bradman returned to the side in Alan Kippax 's position . A world record crowd of 63 @,@ 993 at the MCG saw Bradman come to the crease on the first day of the Second Test with the score at 2 / 67 . A standing ovation ensued that delayed play for several minutes . Bradman anticipated receiving a bouncer as his first ball and , as the bowler delivered , he moved across his stumps to play the hook shot . The ball failed to rise and Bradman dragged it onto his stumps ; the first @-@ ball duck was his first in a Test . The crowd fell into stunned silence as he walked off . However , Australia took a first innings lead in the match , and another record crowd on 2 January 1933 watched Bradman hit a counter @-@ attacking second innings century . His unbeaten 103 ( from 146 balls ) in a team total of 191 helped set England a target of 251 to win . Bill O 'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series @-@ levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten . 
 The Third Test at the Adelaide Oval proved pivotal . There were angry crowd scenes after the Australian captain Bill Woodfull and wicket @-@ keeper Bert Oldfield were hit by bouncers . An apologetic Plum Warner entered the Australian dressing room and was rebuked by Woodfull . Woodfull 's remarks ( that " ... there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket " ) were leaked to the press , and Warner and others attributed this to Fingleton , however for many years ( even after Fingleton 's death ) a bitter war of accusation passed between Fingleton and Bradman as to who was the real source of the leak . In a cable to the MCC , the Australian Board of Control repeated the allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at Warner by Woodfull . With the support of the MCC , England continued with Bodyline despite Australian protests . The tourists won the last three Tests convincingly and regained the Ashes . Bradman caused controversy with his own tactics . Always seeking to score , and with the leg side packed with fielders , he often backed away and hit the ball into the vacant half of the outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf . This brought him 396 runs ( at 56 @.@ 57 ) for the series and plaudits for attempting to find a solution to Bodyline , although his series average was just 57 % of his career mean . Jack Fingleton was in no doubt that Bradman 's game altered irrevocably as a consequence of Bodyline , writing : 
 Bodyline was specially prepared , nurtured for and expended on him and , in consequence , his technique underwent a change quicker than might have been the case with the passage of time . Bodyline plucked something vibrant from his art . 
 The constant glare of celebrity and the tribulations of the season forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game and to seek a career away from his cricketing fame . Harry Hodgetts , a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control , offered Bradman work as a stockbroker if he would relocate to Adelaide and captain South Australia ( SA ) . Unknown to the public , the SA Cricket Association ( SACA ) instigated Hodgetts ' approach and subsidised Bradman 's wage . Although his wife was hesitant about moving , Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934 . 
 = = = Declining health and a brush with death = = = 
 In his farewell season for NSW , Bradman averaged 132 @.@ 44 , his best yet . He was appointed vice @-@ captain for the 1934 tour of England . However , " he was unwell for much of the [ English ] summer , and reports in newspapers hinted that he was suffering from heart trouble " . Although he again started with a double century at Worcester , his famed concentration soon deserted him . Wisden wrote : 
 ... there were many occasions on which he was out to wild strokes . Indeed at one period he created the impression that , to some extent , he had lost control of himself and went in to bat with an almost complete disregard for anything in the shape of a defensive stroke . 
 At one stage , Bradman went 13 first @-@ class innings without a century , the longest such spell of his career , prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique . After three Tests , the series was one – one and Bradman had scored 133 runs in five innings . The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm up game before the Fourth Test . Bradman started slowly and then , " ... the old Bradman [ was ] back with us , in the twinkling of an eye , almost " . He went on to make 140 , with the last 90 runs coming in just 45 minutes . On the opening day of the Fourth Test at Headingley ( Leeds ) , England were out for 200 , but Australia slumped to 3 / 39 , losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day . Listed to bat at number five , Bradman would start his innings the next day . 
 That evening , Bradman declined an invitation to dinner from Neville Cardus , telling the journalist that he wanted an early night because the team needed him to make a double century the next day . Cardus pointed out that his previous innings on the ground was 334 , and the law of averages was against another such score . Bradman told Cardus , " I don 't believe in the law of averages " . In the event , Bradman batted all of the second day and into the third , putting on a then world record partnership of 388 with Bill Ponsford . When he was finally out for 304 ( 473 balls , 43 fours and 2 sixes ) , Australia had a lead of 350 runs , but rain prevented them from forcing a victory . The effort of the lengthy innings stretched Bradman 's reserves of energy , and he did not play again until the Fifth Test at The Oval , the match that would decide the Ashes . 
 In the first innings at The Oval , Bradman and Ponsford recorded an even more massive partnership , this time 451 runs . It had taken them less than a month to break the record they had set at Headingley ; this new world record was to last 57 years . Bradman 's share of the stand was 244 from 271 balls , and the Australian total of 701 set up victory by 562 runs . For the fourth time in five series , the Ashes changed hands . England would not recover them again until after Bradman 's retirement . 
 Seemingly restored to full health , Bradman blazed two centuries in the last two games of the tour . However , when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home , he experienced severe abdominal pain . It took a doctor more than 24 hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately . Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four @-@ hour procedure and peritonitis set in . Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time ; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition . On 25 September , the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently . 
 " The effect of the announcement was little short of spectacular " . The hospital could not deal with the number of donors , and closed its switchboard in the face of the avalanche of telephone calls generated by the news . Journalists were asked by their editors to prepare obituaries . Teammate Bill O 'Reilly took a call from King George V 's secretary asking that the King be kept informed of the situation . Jessie Bradman started the month @-@ long journey to London as soon as she received the news . En route , she heard a rumour that her husband had died . A telephone call clarified the situation and by the time she reached London , Bradman had begun a slow recovery . He followed medical advice to convalesce , taking several months to return to Australia and missing the 1934 – 35 Australian season . 
 = = = Internal politics and the Test captaincy = = = 
 There was off @-@ field intrigue in Australian cricket during the antipodean winter of 1935 . Australia , scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year , needed to replace the retired Bill Woodfull as captain . The Board of Control wanted Bradman to lead the team , yet , on 8 August , the board announced Bradman 's withdrawal from the team due to a lack of fitness . Surprisingly , in the light of this announcement , Bradman led the South Australian team in a full programme of matches that season . 
 The captaincy was given to Vic Richardson , Bradman 's predecessor as South Australian captain . Cricket author Chris Harte 's analysis of the situation is that a prior ( unspecified ) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia . Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation : the off @-@ field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association ( SACA ) , which was looking for new leadership . To help improve discipline , Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA , and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams . He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10 years , Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria . He finished the season with 369 ( in 233 minutes ) , a South Australian record , made against Tasmania . The bowler who dismissed him , Reginald Townley , would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party . 
 Australia defeated South Africa 4 – 0 and senior players such as Bill O 'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson 's captaincy . A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour . For some , the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting , as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities in his role as a selector . 
 To start the new season , the Test side played a " Rest of Australia " team , captained by Bradman , at Sydney in early October 1936 . The Test XI suffered a big defeat , due to Bradman 's 212 and a haul of 12 wickets taken by leg @-@ spinner Frank Ward . Bradman let the members of the Test team know that despite their recent success , the team still required improvement . Shortly afterwards , Bradman 's first child was born on 28 October , but died the next day . He took time out of cricket for two weeks and on his return made 192 in three hours against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the Ashes series . 
 The Test selectors made five changes to the team who had played in the previous Test match . Significantly , Australia 's most successful bowler Clarrie Grimmett was replaced by Ward , one of four players making their debut . Bradman 's role in Grimmett 's omission from the team was controversial and it became a theme that dogged Bradman as Grimmett continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while his successors were ineffective — he was regarded as having finished the veteran bowler 's Test career in a political purge . 
 Australia fell to successive defeats in the opening two Tests , Bradman making two ducks in his four innings , and it seemed that the captaincy was affecting his form . The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne . 
 Bradman won the toss on New Year 's Day 1937 , but again failed with the bat , scoring just 13 . The Australians could not take advantage of a pitch that favoured batting , and finished the day at 6 / 181 . On the second day , rain dramatically altered the course of the game . With the sun drying the pitch ( in those days , covers could not be used during matches ) Bradman declared to get England in to bat while the pitch was " sticky " ; England also declared to get Australia back in , conceding a lead of 124 . Bradman countered by reversing his batting order to protect his run @-@ makers while conditions improved . The ploy worked and Bradman went in at number seven . In an innings spread over three days , he battled influenza while scoring 270 off 375 balls , sharing a record partnership of 346 with Jack Fingleton , and Australia went on to victory . In 2001 , Wisden rated this performance as the best Test match innings of all time . 
 The next Test , at the Adelaide Oval , was fairly even until Bradman played another patient second innings , making 212 from 395 balls . Australia levelled the series when the erratic left @-@ arm spinner " Chuck " Fleetwood @-@ Smith bowled Australia to victory . In the series @-@ deciding Fifth Test , Bradman returned to a more aggressive style in top @-@ scoring with 169 ( off 191 balls ) in Australia 's 604 and Australia won by an innings . Australia 's achievement of winning a Test series after outright losses in the first two matches has never been repeated in Test cricket . 
 = = = End of an era = = = 
 During the 1938 tour of England , Bradman played the most consistent cricket of his career . He needed to score heavily as England had a strengthened batting line @-@ up , while the Australian bowling was over @-@ reliant on O 'Reilly . Grimmett was overlooked , but Jack Fingleton made the team , so the clique of anti @-@ Bradman players remained . Playing 26 innings on tour , Bradman recorded 13 centuries ( a new Australian record ) and again made 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs before the end of May , becoming the only player to do so twice . In scoring 2 @,@ 429 runs , Bradman achieved the highest average ever recorded in an English season : 115 @.@ 66 . 
 In the First Test , England amassed a big first innings score and looked likely to win , but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia , a performance Bradman rated as the best he had ever seen . With Australia forced to follow @-@ on , Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe 's effort was not in vain , and he secured the draw with 144 not out . It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not out in the next Test as Australia struggled to another draw . Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Manchester . 
 Australia 's opportunity came at Headingley , a Test described by Bradman as the best he ever played in . England batted first and made 223 . During the Australian innings , Bradman backed himself by opting to bat on in poor light conditions , reasoning that Australia could score more runs in bad light on a good wicket than on a rain affected wicket in good light , when he had the option to go off . He scored 103 out of a total of 242 and the gamble paid off , as it meant there was sufficient time to push for victory when an England collapse left them a target of only 107 to win . Australia slumped to 4 / 61 , with Bradman out for 16 . An approaching storm threatened to wash the game out , but the poor weather held off and Australia managed to secure the win , a victory that retained the Ashes . For the only time in his life , the tension of the occasion got to Bradman and he could not watch the closing stages of play , a reflection of the pressure that he felt all tour : he described the captaincy as " exhausting " and said he " found it difficult to keep going " . 
 The euphoria of securing the Ashes preceded Australia 's heaviest defeat . At The Oval , England amassed a world record of 7 / 903 and their opening batsman Len Hutton scored an individual world record , by making 364 . In an attempt to relieve the burden on his bowlers , Bradman took a rare turn at bowling . During his third over , he fractured his ankle and teammates carried him from the ground . With Bradman injured and Fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain , Australia were thrashed by an innings and 579 runs , which remains the largest margin in Test cricket history . Unfit to complete the tour , Bradman left the team in the hands of vice @-@ captain Stan McCabe . At this point , Bradman felt that the burden of captaincy would prevent him from touring England again , although he did not make his doubts public . 
 Despite the pressure of captaincy , Bradman 's batting form remained supreme . An experienced , mature player now commonly called " The Don " had replaced the blitzing style of his early days as the " Boy from Bowral " . In 1938 – 39 , he led South Australia to the Sheffield Shield and made a century in six consecutive innings to equal CB Fry 's world record . Bradman totalled 21 first @-@ class centuries in 34 innings , from the beginning of the 1938 tour of England ( including preliminary games in Australia ) until early 1939 . 
 The next season , Bradman made an abortive bid to join the Victoria state side . The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and he was led to believe that if he applied , he would get the job . The position , which had been held by Hugh Trumble until his death in August 1938 , was one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket . The annual salary of £ 1 @,@ 000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him to retain a connection with the game . On 18 January 1939 , the club 's committee , on the casting vote of the chairman , chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman . 
 The 1939 – 40 season was Bradman 's most productive ever for SA : 1 @,@ 448 runs at an average of 144 @.@ 8 . He made three double centuries , including 251 not out against NSW , the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield , as he tamed Bill O 'Reilly at the height of his form . However , it was the end of an era . The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours , and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition .

 Bradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty . The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor @-@ General of Australia , Lord Gowrie , persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army , a move that was criticised as a safer option for him . Given the rank of Lieutenant , he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston , Victoria , to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training . The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems , diagnosed as fibrositis . Surprisingly , in light of his batting prowess , a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight . 
 <unk> out of service in June 1941 , Bradman spent months recuperating , unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered . He resumed stockbroking during 1942 . In his biography of Bradman , Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic , induced by stress and possibly depression ; Bradman read the book 's manuscript and did not disagree . Had any cricket been played at this time , he would not have been available . Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders , Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his ( dominant ) right hand . 
 In June 1945 , Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement . Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business , utilising Hodgetts ' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street , Adelaide . The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts , and left a stigma attached to Bradman 's name in the city 's business community for many years . 
 However , the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts . Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s , Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game . With the resumption of international cricket , he was once more appointed a Test selector , and played a major role in planning for post @-@ war cricket .

 In 1945 – 46 , Bradman suffered regular bouts of fibrositis while coming to terms with increased administrative duties and the establishment of his business . He played for South Australia in two matches to help with the re @-@ establishment of first @-@ class cricket and later described his batting as " painstaking " . Batting against the Australian Services cricket team , Bradman scored 112 in less than two hours , yet Dick Whitington ( playing for the Services ) wrote , " I have seen today the ghost of a once great cricketer " . Bradman declined a tour of New Zealand and spent the winter of 1946 wondering whether he had played his last match . " With the English team due to arrive for the 1946 – 47 Ashes series , the media and the public were anxious to know if Bradman would lead Australia . " His doctor recommended against a return to the game . Encouraged by his wife , Bradman agreed to play in lead @-@ up fixtures to the Test series . After hitting two centuries , Bradman made himself available for the First Test at The Gabba . 
 Controversy emerged on the first day of the First Test at Brisbane . After compiling an uneasy 28 runs , Bradman hit a ball to the gully fieldsman , Jack Ikin . " An appeal for a catch was denied in the umpire 's contentious ruling that it was a bump ball " . At the end of the over , England captain Wally Hammond spoke with Bradman and criticised him for not " walking " ; " from then on the series was a cricketing war just when most people desired peace " , Whitington wrote . Bradman regained his finest pre @-@ war form in making 187 , followed by 234 during the Second Test at Sydney ( Sid Barnes also scored 234 during the innings , many in a still standing 405 run 5th Wicket partnership with Bradman . Barnes later recalled that he purposely got out on 234 because " it wouldn 't be right for someone to make more runs than Bradman " ) . Australia won both matches by an innings . Jack Fingleton speculated that had the decision at Brisbane gone against him , Bradman would have retired , such were his fitness problems . In the remainder of the series , Bradman made three half @-@ centuries in six innings , but was unable to make another century ; nevertheless , his team won handsomely , 3 – 0 . He was the leading batsman on either side , with an average of 97 @.@ 14 . Nearly 850 @,@ 000 spectators watched the Tests , which helped lift public spirits after the war . 
 = = = Century of centuries and " The Invincibles " = = = 
 India made its first tour of Australia in the 1947 – 48 season . On 15 November , Bradman made 172 against them for an Australian XI at Sydney , his 100th first @-@ class century . The first non @-@ Englishman to achieve the milestone , Bradman remains the only Australian to have done so . In five Tests , he scored 715 runs ( at 178 @.@ 75 average ) . His last double century ( 201 ) came at Adelaide , and he scored a century in each innings of the Melbourne Test . On the eve of the Fifth Test , he announced that the match would be his last in Australia , although he would tour England as a farewell . 
 Australia had assembled one of the great teams of cricket history . Bradman made it known that he wanted to go through the tour unbeaten , a feat never before accomplished . English spectators were drawn to the matches knowing that it would be their last opportunity to see Bradman in action . RC Robertson @-@ Glasgow observed of Bradman that : 
 Next to Mr. Winston Churchill , he was the most celebrated man in England during the summer of 1948 . His appearances throughout the country were like one continuous farewell matinée . At last his batting showed human fallibility . Often , especially at the start of the innings , he played where the ball wasn 't , and spectators rubbed their eyes . 
 Despite his waning powers , Bradman compiled 11 centuries on the tour , amassing 2 @,@ 428 runs ( average 89 @.@ 92 ) . His highest score of the tour ( 187 ) came against Essex , when Australia compiled a world record of 721 runs in a day . In the Tests , he scored a century at Nottingham , but the performance most like his pre @-@ war exploits came in the Fourth Test at Leeds . England declared on the last morning of the game , setting Australia a world record 404 runs to win in only 345 minutes on a heavily worn wicket . In partnership with Arthur Morris ( 182 ) , Bradman reeled off 173 not out and the match was won with 15 minutes to spare . The journalist Ray Robinson called the victory " the ' finest ever ' in its conquest of seemingly insuperable odds " . 
 In the final Test at The Oval , Bradman walked out to bat in Australia 's first innings . He received a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition . His Test batting average stood at 101 @.@ 39 . Facing the wrist @-@ spin of Eric Hollies , Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced , was deceived by a googly , and bowled between bat and pad for a duck . An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat , denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99 @.@ 94 ; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings , it would have been 100 . A story developed over the years that claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes , a claim Bradman denied for the rest of his life . 
 The Australian team won the Ashes 4 – 0 , completed the tour unbeaten , and entered history as " The Invincibles " . Just as Bradman 's legend grew , rather than diminished , over the years , so too has the reputation of the 1948 team . For Bradman , it was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : 
 Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . 
 With Bradman now retired from professional cricket , RC Robertson @-@ Glasgow wrote of the English reaction " ... a miracle has been removed from among us . So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal " . 
 = = After cricket = = 
 After his return to Australia , Bradman played in his own Testimonial match at Melbourne , scoring his 117th and last century , and receiving £ 9 @,@ 342 in proceeds . In the 1949 New Year Honours , he was appointed Knight Bachelor for his services to the game , becoming the only Australian cricketer ever to be knighted . He commented that he " would have preferred to remain just Mister " . The following year he published a memoir , Farewell to Cricket . Bradman accepted offers from the Daily Mail to travel with , and write about , the 1953 and 1956 Australian teams in England . The Art of Cricket , his final book published in 1958 , is an instructional manual . 
 Bradman retired from his stockbroking business in June 1954 , depending on the " comfortable " income earned as a board member of 16 publicly listed companies . His highest profile affiliation was with Argo Investments Limited , where he was chairman for a number of years . Charles Williams commented that , " [ b ] <unk> was excluded on medical grounds , [ so ] the only sensible alternative was a career in the administration of the game which he loved and to which he had given most of his active life " . 
 Bradman was honoured at a number of cricket grounds , notably when his portrait was hung in the Long Room at Lord 's ; until Shane Warne 's portrait was added in 2005 , Bradman was one of just three Australians to be honoured in this way . Bradman inaugurated a " Bradman Stand " at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 1974 ; the Adelaide Oval also opened a Bradman Stand in 1990 , which housed new and much needed media facilities , as well as bar facilities and the South Australian Cricket Museum ( the Adelaide Oval 's Bradman Stand was demolished in early 2013 as the oval undergoes extensive re @-@ development ) . Later in 1974 , he attended a Lord 's Taverners function in London where he experienced heart problems , which forced him to limit his public appearances to select occasions only . With his wife , Bradman returned to Bowral in 1976 , where the new cricket ground was named in his honour . He gave the keynote speech at the historic Centenary Test at Melbourne in 1977 . 
 On 16 June 1979 , the Australian government awarded Bradman the nation 's second @-@ highest civilian honour at that time , Companion of the Order of Australia ( AC ) , " in recognition of service to the sport of cricket and cricket administration " . In 1980 , he resigned from the ACB , to lead a more secluded life . 
 = = = Administrative career = = = 
 In addition to acting as one of South Australia 's delegates to the Board of Control from 1945 to 1980 , Bradman was a committee member of the SACA between 1935 and 1986 . It is estimated that he attended 1 @,@ 713 SACA meetings during this half century of service . Aside from two years in the early 1950s , he filled a selector 's berth for the Test team between 1936 and 1971 . 
 Cricket saw an increase in defensive play during the 1950s . As a selector , Bradman favoured attacking , positive cricketers who entertained the paying public . He formed an alliance with Australian captain Richie Benaud , seeking more attractive play , with some success . He served two high @-@ profile periods as chairman of the board of Control , in 1960 – 63 and 1969 – 72 . During the first , he dealt with the growing prevalence of illegal bowling actions in the game , a problem that he adjudged " the most complex I have known in cricket , because it is not a matter of fact but of opinion " . The major controversy of his second stint was a proposed tour of Australia by South Africa in 1971 – 72 . On Bradman 's recommendation , the series was cancelled . Cricket journalist Michael Coward said of Bradman as an administrator : 
 Bradman was more than a cricket player nonpareil . He was ... an astute and progressive administrator ; an expansive thinker , philosopher and writer on the game . Indeed , in some respects , he was as powerful , persuasive and influential a figure off the ground as he was on it . 
 In the late 1970s , Bradman played an important role during the World Series Cricket schism as a member of a special Australian Cricket Board committee formed to handle the crisis . He was criticised for not airing an opinion , but he dealt with World Series Cricket far more pragmatically than other administrators . Richie Benaud described Bradman as " a brilliant administrator and businessman " , warning that he was not to be underestimated . As Australian captain , Ian Chappell fought with Bradman over the issue of player remuneration in the early 1970s and has suggested that Bradman was parsimonious : 
 I ... thought to myself , ' Ian , did you just ask Bradman to fill your wallet with money ? ' Bradman 's harangue confirmed my suspicions that the players were going to have a hard time extracting more money from the ACB . 
 = = = Later years and death = = = 
 After his wife 's death in 1997 , Bradman suffered " a discernible and not unexpected wilting of spirit " . The next year , on his 90th birthday , he hosted a meeting with his two favourite modern players , Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar , but he was not seen in his familiar place at the Adelaide Oval again . <unk> with pneumonia in December 2000 , he returned home in the New Year and died there on 25 February 2001 , aged 92 . 
 A memorial service to mark Bradman 's life was held on 25 March 2001 at St Peter 's Anglican Cathedral , Adelaide . The service was attended by a host of former and current Test cricketers , as well as Australia 's then prime minister , John Howard , leader of the opposition Kim Beazley and former prime minister Bob Hawke . Eulogies were given by Richie Benaud and Governor @-@ General Sir William Deane . The service was broadcast live on ABC Television to a viewing audience of 1 @.@ 45 million . A private service for family and friends was earlier held at the Centennial Park Cemetery in the suburb of Pasadena , with many people lining both Greenhill and Goodwood Roads to pay their respects as his funeral motorcade passed by . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Cricket writer David Frith summed up the paradox of the continuing fascination with Bradman : 
 As the years passed , with no lessening of his reclusiveness , so his public stature continued to grow , until the sense of reverence and unquestioning worship left many of his contemporaries scratching their heads in wondering admiration . 
 As early as 1939 , Bradman had a Royal Navy ship named after him . Built as a fishing trawler in 1936 , the HMS Bradman was taken over by the Admiralty in 1939 , but was sunk by German aircraft the following year . 
 In the 1963 edition of Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , Bradman was selected by Neville Cardus as one the Six Giants of the Wisden Century . This was a special commemorative selection requested by Wisden for its 100th edition . The other five players chosen were : Sydney Barnes , W. G. Grace , Jack Hobbs , Tom Richardson and Victor Trumper . 
 On 10 December 1985 , Bradman was the first of 120 inaugural inductees into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame . He spoke of his philosophy for considering the stature of athletes : 
 When considering the stature of an athlete or for that matter any person , I set great store in certain qualities which I believe to be essential in addition to skill . They are that the person conducts his or her life with dignity , with integrity , courage , and perhaps most of all , with modesty . These virtues are totally compatible with pride , ambition , and competitiveness . 
 Although modest about his own abilities and generous in his praise of other cricketers , Bradman was fully aware of the talents he possessed as a player ; there is some evidence that he sought to influence his legacy . During the 1980s and 1990s , Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews , assisting Michael Page , Roland Perry and Charles Williams , who all produced biographical works about him . Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio , broadcast as Bradman : The Don Declares in eight 55 @-@ minute episodes during 1988 . 
 The most significant of these legacy projects was the Bradman Museum , opened in 1989 at the Bradman Oval in Bowral . This organisation was reformed in 1993 as a non @-@ profit charitable Trust , called the Bradman Foundation . In 2010 , it was expanded and rebranded as the International Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 When the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame was created in Melbourne in 1996 , Bradman was made one of its 10 inaugural members . In 2000 , Bradman was selected by cricket experts as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Century . Each of the 100 members of the panel were able to select five cricketers : all 100 voted for Bradman . 
 Bradman 's life and achievements were recognised in Australia with two notable issues . Three years before he died , he became the first living Australian to be featured on an Australian postage stamp . After his death , the Australian Government produced a 20 @-@ cent coin to commemorate his life . 
 = = Family life = = 
 Bradman first met Jessie Martha Menzies in 1920 when she boarded with the Bradman family , to be closer to school in Bowral . The couple married at St Paul 's Anglican Church at Burwood , Sydney on 30 April 1932 . During their 65 @-@ year marriage , Jessie was " shrewd , reliable , selfless , and above all , uncomplicated ... she was the perfect foil to his concentrated , and occasionally mercurial character " . Bradman paid tribute to his wife numerous times , once saying succinctly , " I would never have achieved what I achieved without Jessie " . 
 The <unk> lived in the same modest , suburban house in Holden Street , Kensington Park in Adelaide for all but the first three years of their married life . They experienced personal tragedy in raising their children : their first @-@ born son died as an infant in 1936 , their second son , John ( born in 1939 ) contracted polio , and their daughter , Shirley , born in 1941 , had cerebral palsy from birth . His family name proved a burden for John Bradman ; he legally changed his last name to <unk> in 1972 . Although claims were made that he became estranged from his father , it was more a matter of " the pair inhabit [ ing ] different worlds " . After the cricketer 's death , a collection of personal letters written by Bradman to his close friend Rohan Rivett between 1953 and 1977 was released and gave researchers new insights into Bradman 's family life , including the strain between father and son . 
 Bradman 's reclusiveness in later life is partly attributable to the ongoing health problems of his wife , particularly following the open @-@ heart surgery Jessie underwent in her 60s . Lady Bradman died in 1997 , aged 88 , from cancer . This had a dispiriting effect on Bradman , but the relationship with his son improved , to the extent that John resolved to change his name back to Bradman . Since his father 's death , John Bradman has become the spokesperson for the family and has been involved in defending the Bradman legacy in a number of disputes . The relationship between Bradman and his wider family is less clear , although nine months after Bradman 's death , his nephew Paul Bradman criticised him as a " snob " and a " loner " who forgot his connections in Bowral and who failed to attend the funerals of Paul 's mother and father . 
 = = Style = = 
 Bradman 's early development was shaped by the high bounce of the ball on matting @-@ over @-@ concrete pitches . He favoured " horizontal @-@ bat " shots ( such as the hook , pull and cut ) to deal with the bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend . Employing a side @-@ on stance at the wicket , Bradman kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in . His backswing had a " crooked " look that troubled his early critics , but he resisted entreaties to change . His backswing kept his hands in close to the body , leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid @-@ swing , if need be . Another telling factor was the decisiveness of Bradman 's footwork . He " used the crease " by either coming metres down the wicket to drive , or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut , hook or pull . 
 Bradman 's game evolved with experience . He temporarily adapted his technique during the Bodyline series , deliberately moving around the crease in an attempt to score from the short @-@ pitched deliveries . At his peak , in the mid @-@ 1930s , he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded . After the Second World War , he adjusted to bat within the limitations set by his age , becoming a steady " accumulator " of runs . However , Bradman never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets . Wisden commented , " [ i ] f there really is a blemish on his amazing record it is ... the absence of a significant innings on one of those ' sticky dogs ' of old " . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 Bradman 's name has become an archetypal name for outstanding excellence , both within cricket and in the wider world . The term <unk> has been coined and is used both within and without cricketing circles . Steve Waugh described Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan as " the Don Bradman of bowling " , while John Howard , former Prime Minister of Australia , was called " the Don Bradman of politics " by his Liberal Party colleague Joe Hockey . T. H. White describes Sir Lancelot as " being the greatest knight King Arthur had . He was a sort of Bradman , top of the battling averages . " . 
 Bradman has been the subject of more biographies than any other Australian , apart from the outlaw Ned Kelly . Bradman himself wrote four books : Don Bradman 's Book – The Story of My Cricketing Life with Hints on Batting , Bowling and Fielding ( 1930 ) , My Cricketing Life ( 1938 ) , Farewell to Cricket ( 1950 ) and The Art of Cricket ( 1958 ) . The story of the Bodyline series was retold in a 1984 television mini @-@ series . 
 Bradman is immortalised in three popular songs from different eras , " Our Don Bradman " ( 1930s , by Jack O 'Hagan ) , " Bradman " ( 1980s , by Paul Kelly ) , and " Sir Don " , ( a tribute by John Williamson performed at Bradman 's memorial service ) . Bradman recorded several songs accompanying himself and others on piano in the early 1930s , including " Every Day Is A Rainbow Day For Me " . In 2000 , the Australian Government made it illegal for the names of corporations to suggest a link to " Sir Donald Bradman " , if such a link does not in fact exist . Other entities with similar protection are the Australian and foreign governments , Saint Mary MacKillop , the British Royal Family and the Returned and Services League of Australia .

 Bradman 's Test batting average of 99 @.@ 94 has become one of cricket 's most famous , iconic statistics . No other player who has played more than 20 Test match innings has finished with a Test average of more than 61 . Bradman scored centuries at a rate better than one every three innings — in 80 Test innings , Bradman scored 29 centuries . Only 11 players have since surpassed his total , all at a much slower rate : the next fastest player to reach 29 centuries , Sachin Tendulkar , required nearly twice as long ( 148 innings ) to do so . 
 In addition , Bradman converted 41 % of his centuries into double centuries : his total of 12 Test double hundreds — comprising 15 % of his innings — remains the most achieved by any Test batsman and was accumulated faster than any other total . 
 For comparison , the next highest totals of Test double hundreds are Kumar Sangakkara 's 11 in 223 innings ( 4 @.@ 9 % ) , Brian Lara 's 9 in 232 innings ( 3 @.@ 9 % ) , and Wally Hammond 's 7 in 140 innings ( 5 % ) ; the next highest rate of scoring Test double centuries was achieved by Vinod Kambli , whose 21 innings included 2 double centuries ( 9 @.@ 5 % ) .

 Wisden hailed Bradman as , " the greatest phenomenon in the history of cricket , indeed in the history of all ball games " . Statistician Charles Davis analysed the statistics for several prominent sportsmen by comparing the number of standard deviations that they stand above the mean for their sport . The top performers in his selected sports are : 
 The statistics show that " no other athlete dominates an international sport to the extent that Bradman does cricket " . In order to post a similarly dominant career statistic as Bradman , a baseball batter would need a career batting average of .392 , while a basketball player would need to score an average of 43 @.@ 0 points per game . The respective records are .366 and 30 @.@ 1 . 
 When Bradman died , Time allocated a space in its " Milestones " column for an obituary : 
 ... Australian icon considered by many to be the pre @-@ eminent sportsman of all time ... One of Australia 's most beloved heroes , he was revered abroad as well . When Nelson Mandela was released after 27 years in prison , his first question to an Australian visitor was , " Is Sir Donald Bradman still alive ? " 
 = Contracts ( Rights of Third Parties ) Act 1999 = 
 The Contracts ( Rights of Third Parties ) Act 1999 ( c 31 ) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that significantly reformed the common law Doctrine of Privity and " thereby [ removed ] one of the most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape " . The second rule of the Doctrine of Privity , that a third party could not enforce a contract for which he had not provided consideration , had been widely criticised by lawyers , academics and members of the judiciary . Proposals for reform via an Act of Parliament were first made in 1937 by the Law Revision Committee in their Sixth Interim Report . No further action was taken by the government until the 1990s , when the Law Commission proposed a new draft bill in 1991 , and presented their final report in 1996 . The bill was introduced to the House of Lords in December 1998 , and moved to the House of Commons on 14 June 1999 . It received the Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 , coming into force immediately as the Contracts ( Rights of Third Parties ) Act 1999 . 
 The Act allows third parties to enforce terms of contracts that benefit them in some way , or which the contract allows them to enforce . It also grants them access to a range of remedies if the terms are breached . The Act also limits the ways in which a contract can be changed without the permission of an involved third party . At the same time , it provides protection for the promisor and promisee in situations where there is a dispute with the third party , and allows parties to a contract to specifically exclude the protection afforded by the Act if they want to limit the involvement of third parties . 
 = = Background = = 
 The historical doctrine of privity consisted of two rules – the first was that a third party may not have obligations imposed by the terms of a contract , and second was that a third party may not enforce a contract for which he has not provided consideration . The first rule was not contested , while the second was described as " one of the most universally disliked and criticised blots on the legal landscape " . Originally , the second rule was not held to be valid . In the 17th century , a third party was allowed to enforce terms of a contract that benefited him , as shown in Provender v Wood [ 1627 ] <unk> 30 , where the judgement stated that " the party to whom the benefit of a promise <unk> , may bring his action . " The first reversal of this law in Bourne v Mason [ 1669 ] 1 Vent . , where the Court of King 's Bench found that a third party had no rights to enforce a contract that benefited him . This ruling was quickly reversed , and decisions immediately after used the original rule . 
 Over the next 200 years , different judges provided different decisions as to whether or not a third party could enforce a contract that benefited them . The dispute ended in 1861 with Tweddle v Atkinson [ 1861 ] 121 ER 762 , which confirmed that a third party could not enforce a contract that benefited him . This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v Selfridge and Co Ltd [ 1915 ] AC 847 in 1915 , where Lord Haldane stated that only a person who was party to a contract could sue on it . This version of the doctrine is commonly known as the original or basic doctrine . 
 = = = Criticism of the original doctrine = = = 
 The second rule of privity , that a third party cannot claim benefits from a contract , was widely criticised by academics , members of the judiciary and legal professionals . One problem was that the rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit , such as in Beswick v Beswick , where an uncle gave his nephew a business , on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week , and in the event of the uncle 's death , give a similar amount to his widow . 
 A second argument used to undermine the doctrine of privity was to point out the large number of exceptions to the rule created by Acts of Parliament , which seemed to indicate that Parliament itself had an issue with the doctrine . Critics also argued that with the large number of inconsistencies and exceptions with the doctrine of privity , it was " bad " law , as it provided no reliable rule ; the way that the law works in theory is hugely different from how it is enforced in the courts . The doctrine is also not found in many other legal systems , such as that of the United States . 
 The doctrine came under criticism from many academics and judges , including Lord Scarman , Lord Denning , Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin , and Stephen Guest wrote that " [ I ] t is said that it serves only to defeat the legitimate expectations of the third party , that it undermines the social interest of the community in the security of bargains and it is commercially inconvenient " . 
 = = Formation = = 
 The first proposal to reform the doctrine of privity was made in 1937 ; the Law Revision Committee in their Sixth Interim Report , proposed an Act of Parliament that would allow third parties to enforce terms of a contract that specified that they were allowed . The report was not acted on – as late as 1986 the assumption was that Parliament would not act , and any reform would come from judicial sources ( particularly the House of Lords ) . In 1991 @.@ the Law Commission published Consultation Paper No. 121 " Privity of Contract : Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties " , which proposed a similar change , and , in July 1996 , the final report ( No. 242 ) , along with a draft bill , were published . The proposed changes were supported by the legal profession and academics alike . The bill was introduced to the House of Lords on 3 December 1998 , and , during its second reading , was jokingly offered to Lord Denning as a birthday present due to his fight to overturn the doctrine of privity . It was moved to the House of Commons on 14 June , and it received the Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 . 
 = = Provisions = = 
 = = = Section 1 : Right of third party to enforce contractual term = = = 
 Section 1 of the Act overrides the old common law rule that a third party could not enforce the terms of a contract , as established in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd , and also the rule that a third party could not act against the promisor , established in Tweddle v Atkinson . It allows a third party to enforce terms of a contract in one of two situations : firstly if the third party is specifically mentioned in the contract as someone authorised to do so , and secondly if the contract " purports to confer a benefit " on him . 
 An exception to the second rule involves contracts that include language barring third parties from applying the rule . Another exception applies to contracts between solicitors and their clients to write wills , something governed by White v Jones [ 1995 ] 2 AC 207 . After the Act was first published , Guenter Treitel argued that in a situation where the promisor felt that the second rule had been wrongly applied by a statement in the contract , the onus would be on him to prove it . In Nisshin Shipping Co Ltd v Cleaves & Co Ltd [ 2003 ] <unk> 2602 , the High Court supported Treitel 's reasoning . 
 The second situation , that a third party can enforce terms that " purport to confer a benefit on him " , has been described by <unk> Dean as too broad , and one view put forward in the parliamentary debates was that it was " un @-@ workable " in situations such as complex construction contracts involving dozens of sub @-@ contractors with chains of contracts among them . This argument , and a proposal to exempt the construction industry from the Act , was rejected by both the Law Commission and Parliament . The phrase " purport to confer a benefit " was originally found in the 1937 Law Commission paper , and was used in the New Zealand Contracts ( Privity ) Act 1982 before it was adopted for the English Act . 
 The third party must be identified by name or as a member of a particular group , and does not need to exist when the contract was made . This can cause problems , however – if , for example , a party ( party A ) enters a contract to have another party ( party B ) construct a building , and A later sells the building to C who finds that it has structural problems , C has no cause of action against B because he was not named in the original contract . 
 If a third party chooses to enforce the terms of a contract , he can do so against the promisor and has the right to any remedy that would be available if he was party to the contract , such as specific performance . An exception to this is the ability to terminate the contract and have it rendered void , since the Law Commission believed that " the third party should not be entitled to terminate the contract for breach as this may be contrary to the promisee 's wishes or interests " . 
 Although the topic is not discussed in the Law Commission 's report or the bill itself , it is generally considered that the third party has no rights against the promisee , regardless of his rights against the promisor . Andrew Burrows , who prepared the Law Commission 's report , said that the third party does not acquire rights against the promisee , something Guenter Treitel has also suggested . A different stance is taken in Scots law , where a promisee has a duty to the third party to ensure performance of the contract . 
 = = = Section 2 : Variation and rescission of contract = = = 
 Section 2 of the Act governs changes to and rescission of contracts . It prevents parties to a contract rescinding it or altering it to remove or modify the terms that affect the third party if the third party has told the promisor that he " assents " to the term , or that he has relied on the contract ( and the promisor knows this , or could be expected to have known this ) . This is only the default position ; the Act allows parties to insert clauses into the contract which allow them to rescind or alter the contract without the consent of the third party if they so choose . The courts can ignore the consent of the third party and allow the promisor and promisee to change the contract if the third party is mentally incapable , <unk> or if it is impossible to tell if the third party has truly consented . At the same time the courts may add conditions to that decision , such as requiring the promisor or promisee to pay the third party compensation . 
 <unk> is considered complete when the third party " communicates " his assent to the promisor , which can be done in a variety of ways , including by post . The contract may specify the communication method ( s ) , and if it does , any other method is not valid . 
 The third party does not have to have suffered a detriment from his " reliance " ; it is enough that he has simply relied on the contract . It must be the third party who relied on the term , rather than another party closely related to the third party . If the third party relies on the terms of the contract , which are then breached , he can not only claim damages for any loss he suffered from relying on the contract but also for " standard " damages , such as loss of profit . 
 = = = Section 3 : Defences available to promisor = = = 
 Section 3 covers the defences available to the promisor if the third party brings an action against him . In a dispute between the promisor and the third party over a term , the promisor can rely on any defence he would have if the dispute was with the promisee , as long as the defence is applicable to the term under dispute . The Law Commission directly rejected the suggestion that the promisor should have every defence in a dispute with a third party that he would have in a dispute with the promisee ( regardless of whether or not it could be applied to the disputed term ) . Part III is directly modelled on the similar section of the New Zealand Contracts ( Privity ) Act 1982 . 
 The Act allows the promisor to list additional defences that can be used against the third party in the contract , which can be used to get around the Law Commission 's decision not to give the promisor equal defences against both the third party and promisee by simply listing those additional defences the promisor would like access to . 
 The Act takes a different attitude for the defences available to the third party in counterclaims , with the Law Commission saying that to apply the same rules would be " misleading and unnecessarily complex " . This is because the counterclaim may be more valuable than the original claim , which would impose an obligation on the third party to pay the promisor money , something not appropriate under the doctrine of privity which prohibits the placing of a burden or obligation on a third party . Again , the parties to the contract can insert a clause overriding this . 
 = = = Section 4 : Enforcement of contract by promisee = = = 
 Section 4 preserves the right of the promisee to enforce any term of the contract . This allows the promisee to sue for any losses to themselves , but not for losses of the third party . 
 = = = Section 5 : Protection of promisor from double liability = = = 
 Section 5 helps protect the promisor from double liability ( having to pay two sets of damages for the same breach , one to the third party and one to the promisee ) if the promisor breaches the contract . It does so in a very limited way , though – the promisor is only protected if he has first paid damages to the promisee , and the third party 's claim comes after that . In addition the Act only limits damages paid in this situation , it does not eliminate them . If the promisee brings an action against the promisor and wins , any damages paid to the third party in a subsequent action must take the previous damages paid to the promisee into account . 
 If the third party brings an action , and the promisee does so afterwards then the promisee cannot claim any damages . This is because the Law Commission felt that if the third party claimed compensation for the breach , the promisee would have no interest in the dispute any more . This fails to take into account situations where the promisee has suffered personal loss from the breach of contract . If the promisee brings an action first then the third party is prohibited from doing so , unless the promisee 's action fails , in which case the third party is free to pursue his own claim . 
 = = = Section 6 : Exceptions = = = 
 Section 6 creates exceptions to the scope of the Act . While the Act applies to standard contracts and contracts made by deeds , it does not apply to contracts made as a part of negotiable instruments , bills of exchange or promissory notes , or contracts governed by the Companies Act 1985 , such as articles of association . The Act also excludes contracts for the transport of goods across national lines , as these fall under international trade laws , and terms in an employment contract which allow a third party to sue an employee . These were excluded for one of two reasons – either the position of third parties in those types of contract are too well established to be changed easily , or there are reasons of public policy that make it a bad idea to allow the involvement of third parties , such as contracts of employment . 
 = = = Section 7 : Supplementary provisions relating to third party = = = 
 Section 7 includes supplementary provisions relating to the rights of third parties . In particular it prevents third parties from using the definition of " third party " in this Act when applying any other Act of Parliament , and excludes the section of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 that covers negligence from applying to actions against a third party . At the same time , Section 7 ( 1 ) ensures that any exceptions to the rule of privity which existed prior to the 1999 Act remain valid . 
 = = = Section 8 : Arbitration provisions = = = 
 The Act allows the insertion of arbitration clauses , which require the parties to submit to specific arbitration procedures in the event of disputes . The Law Commission initially excluded arbitration clauses from the Act , but later amended their draft bill so as to allow third parties to take advantage of arbitration proceedings . The provisions on arbitration clauses were not received well during the bill 's passage through Parliament , and were described as " very messy " , " a labyrinth " and " a mire " . The Commission initially proposed that jurisdiction clauses be specifically excluded from the Act . During the bill 's passage through Parliament , however , this exclusion disappeared , and the Act 's explanatory notes assume that the Act covers jurisdiction clauses . 
 = = = Section 9 : Northern Ireland = = = 
 Section 9 takes into account the differences between English and Northern Irish law , and modifies how the Act should be interpreted in Northern Ireland . Particularly it replaces the use of " Companies Act 1985 " in Part VI with the Northern Irish equivalent , the Companies ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1986 . Part IX also repeals sections 5 and 6 of the Law Reform ( Husband and Wife ) ( Northern Ireland ) Act 1964 . 
 = = Scope and implementation = = 
 The Act applies in England and Wales and Northern Ireland , but not Scotland , which has its own rules on privity and the rights of third parties . The Act came into law on 11 November 1999 when it received the Royal Assent , but the full provisions of the Act did not come into force until May 2000 . The act made clear that contracts negotiated during a six @-@ month " twilight period " after the act 's passage fell under its provisions if they included language saying that they had been made under the terms of the act . 
 The Act had various consequences – as well as allowing third parties to enforce terms it also made a number of exceptions to the basic rule unnecessary , such as claiming on behalf of another party as seen in Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd [ 1975 ] 1 WLR 1468 . It did not repeal or abolish these exceptions , however , and this allows the courts to accept cases based on the old common law exceptions as well as the 1999 Act . The Act specifically allows parties to exempt the provisions of the Act from contracts , allowing them a way out if they so choose . 
 The reaction from the judiciary , legal profession and academia was largely supportive of the Act ; the doctrine of privity had long been thought unfair . The act has been criticised somewhat by the construction industry for its refusal to make an exception for complex construction contracts , and for the vagueness of the term " purports to confer a benefit " . It is generally accepted , however , that it would be unfair to make an exception for a particular industry , and case law has clarified the meaning of " purports to confer a benefit " . Nonetheless , the construction industry continues to prefer collateral warranties , not least so that all parties can ' hold a piece of paper ' as clear evidence of their intent , but also because of the failure under the standard form contracts to insist on liability insurance for the parties and the rather conservative nature of the construction industry . 
 = Chemical Bank = 
 Chemical Bank was a bank with headquarters in New York City from 1824 until 1996 . The bank operated as the primary subsidiary of the Chemical Banking Corporation , a bank holding company established in 1988 . At the end of 1995 , Chemical was the third largest bank in the U.S. with approximately $ 182 @.@ 9 billion in assets . 
 Beginning in 1920 but accelerating in the 1980s and 1990s , Chemical was a leading <unk> of the banking industry in the United States , acquiring Chase Manhattan Bank , Manufacturers Hanover , Texas Commerce Bank and Corn Exchange Bank among others . Following Chemical 's acquisition of Chase , the bank adopted the venerable Chase brand . What had been Chemical Bank is now a foundational component of what today is JPMorgan Chase . 
 Chemical Bank was headquartered in New York City with more than 39 @,@ 000 employees globally as of the end of 1995 . 
 = = Overview of the company = = 
 Chemical Bank was the principal operating subsidiary of the Chemical Banking Corporation , a bank holding company . As of the end of 1995 , prior to its merger with the Chase Manhattan Bank , Chemical was the third largest bank in the United States in terms of total assets with $ 182 @.@ 9 billion of assets . The Chemical Banking Corporation was the fifth largest bank holding company in terms of total assets . 
 Of Chemical 's $ 182 @.@ 9 billion of total assets , the bank held approximately $ 82 @.@ 1 billion of loans , representing a balance between mortgage loans and other consumer loans as well as commercial loans in the U.S. and internationally . Among Chemical 's largest international exposure was to Japan , Germany and the United Kingdom . The other assets on the bank 's balance sheet included cash as well as various debt and equity securities . 
 Chemical reported record net income of $ 1 @.@ 8 billion for 1995 . Chemical 's level of capital at the end of 1995 remained strong , with capital adequacy ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements . The Corporation 's Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 8 @.@ 5 % and 12 @.@ 1 % , respectively . 
 Chemical was one of the leading banks in the U.S. , active both in corporate banking as well as retail banking . Within retail banking , Chemical provided personal and commercial checking accounts , savings and time deposit accounts , personal loans , consumer financing and mortgage banking as well as trust and estate administration . 
 Chemical 's corporate banking business provided a wide variety business loans , leasing , real estate financing , money transfer and cash management among other services . Chemical was among the leading bank lenders to small and medium @-@ sized businesses . Chemical also had a significant presence in investment banking as well as underwriting corporate debt and equity securities . 
 = = = Lines of business = = = 
 Prior to its merger with Chase , Chemical was structured into two operating segments : the Global Bank and Consumer & Relationship Banking . 
 Global Bank The Global Bank serviced the bank 's large corporate clients was made up of a traditional investment banking division , known as Global Banking & Investment Banking as well as a sales and trading division , known as Global Markets . Global Banking & Investment Banking performed advisory services such as mergers and acquisitions and restructuring as well as capital raising functions , such as leveraged loan syndication , high yield financing and other debt and equity underwriting . The bank 's private equity and venture capital functions were also housed in this division . Global Markets was primarily focused on sales and trading activities , foreign exchange dealing ; derivatives trading and structuring , risk management and other market related functions . In 1995 , Chemicals Global Bank revenue was roughly balanced between investment banking and markets activities 
 Consumer & Relationship Banking . Consumer and Relationship Banking was made up of a number of businesses including consumer banking , commercial banking ; credit cards ; mortgage banking ( and other consumer finance , i.e. – home equity loans , student loans ) as well as a number of smaller businesses . Chemical maintained a leading market share position in providing financial services to middle market companies nationally and small businesses in the New York metropolitan area . This division also included a small private banking business , although Chemical was not a leading player in this market . 
 = = = Offices = = = 
 The bank opened its first offices at 216 Broadway in Downtown New York in 1824 at the corner of Ann Street . In 1848 the bank agreed to sell its building to its neighbor Barnum 's American Museum ( the building collapsed during Barnum 's subsequent remodeling ) and in 1850 the bank moved into its newly constructed headquarters at 270 Broadway . Chemical bought additional land adjacent its 270 Broadway building in 1879 and 1887 but its offices remained modest through the start of the 20th century . 
 In 1907 the bank constructed a new headquarters on the original and adjacent properties at 270 Broadway . In 1921 , Chemical acquired a 13 @-@ Story building belonging to the Shoe & Leather Bank on Broadway , next door to and surrounded by its existing properties . Despite expanding its 1907 headquarters over the years , by the mid @-@ 1920s Chemical was in need of additional space to accommodate its growth and reflect its increasing profile . 
 In 1926 , the bank made plans to move again , this time constructing a new six story location at 165 Broadway , on the corner of Broadway and Cortlandt Street , closer to the Financial District . Chemical moved into its new headquarters in 1928 , after completion of the building , and the bank 's headquarters would remain at that location for more than five decades . 
 Under Chairman Donald Platten , Chemical 's headquarters was to move to 277 Park Avenue in 1979 . The bank moved across Park Avenue in 1991 to occupy the former headquarters of Manufacturers Hanover Corporation at 270 Park Avenue , which is still the headquarters of Chemical 's successor , JPMorgan Chase . However , JPMorgan Chase returned to 277 Park Avenue in 2000 , following the departure of its previous tenant , Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette . In 2008 , following JPMorgan 's acquisition of Bear Stearns , the bank relocated its investment banking groups from Chemical 's old headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding and early history = = = 
 The company was founded in 1823 as the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company by Balthazar P. Melick together with the original directors of the company , John C. Morrison , Mark Spenser , Gerardus Post , James Jenkins , William A. Seely and William Stebbins . Additionally , Joseph Sampson , although not a director was among the largest of the original shareholders of the bank . The founders used the manufacturing company , which produced chemicals such as blue vitriol , alum , nitric acid , camphor and saltpeter , as well as medicines , paints , and dyes as a means to securing a bank charter from the New York State legislature . During the 1820s , prospective bankers found that they were more likely to be able to successfully secure a charter if the bank were part of a larger business . The following year , in April 1824 , the company successfully amended its charter to allow Chemical to begin its banking practice . As a result , Chemical Bank was originally a division of the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company . Balthazar Melick was named the first president of the bank , which catered to merchants in New York City . 
 John Mason became a shareholder of the bank in 1826 and would serve as Chemical 's second president . Mason , who would later be referred to as " the father of the Chemical Bank , " and was one of the richest merchants of his day in New York , succeeded Baltus Melick in 1831 . Mason was responsible for establishing the highly conservative business culture of the young bank that would persist for nearly 90 years . For its first twenty @-@ five years , the bank paid no dividends , nor did it pay interest on its customers ' deposits . Mason was also responsible for leading Chemical through the Panic of 1837 . When a speculative bubble collapsed on May 10 , 1837 , banks suspended payment of gold and silver . Although twenty years later , Chemical would stand alone and continue to make payments in specie , in this crisis the bank followed others in suspending payments . Chemical was one of the earliest to resume payments in specie . 
 Mason died on September 26 , 1839 , but his legacy of conservatism was taken on by his successors . Isaac Jones and later his cousin John Quentin Jones would lead Chemical , both serving as president , across the next forty years through 1878 . Both Isaac and John Jones had close connections to John Mason , particularly Isaac who married one of John Mason 's three daughters . The Mason and Jones families would maintain effective control of Chemical for much of its first five decades . John Q. Jones was succeeded in 1878 by George G. Williams , who had joined the bank in 1842 and served as cashier of the bank from 1855 onward . In that position , Williams was also inculcated in Chemical 's conservative style of banking . Williams would serve as president from 1878 through 1903 . 
 In 1844 , when New York Chemical Manufacturing Company 's original charter expired , the chemical company was liquidated and was reincorporated as a bank only , becoming the Chemical Bank of New York in 1844 . Among the bank 's first directors under its new charter were Cornelius Roosevelt , John D. Wolfe , Isaac Platt and <unk> Johnson , as well as the bank 's president John Q. Jones . The company sold all remaining inventories from the chemical division as well as real estate holdings by 1851 . 
 Two years later , in 1853 , Chemical became a charter member of the New York Clearing House , the first and largest bank clearing house in the U.S. Two Chemical presidents would also serve as head of the clearing house , with John Q. Jones serving from 1865 – 1871 and George G. Williams serving in 1886 and from 1893 – 1894 . 
 During the Panic of 1857 , Chemical Bank earned the nickname " Old Bullion " by taking a stand that it would continue to redeem its bank notes in specie throughout the crisis . The panic , which had hit banks and caused a number of failures , led banks across the country to suspend specie payments and turn to issuing paper promissory notes . Chemical 's decision was highly unpopular among its fellow banks and led to the bank 's temporary suspension from the New York Clearing House , of which Chemical was a charter member . While hundreds of banks closed , including 18 banks in New York in a single day , Chemical developed a reputation for stability . This reputation proved extremely important in Chemical 's growth during subsequent recessions during the 1860s . Chemical frequently used the refrain " Good as gold then , good as gold today " in advertisements from the 1860s well into the 20th century . 
 Chemical received its national charter as the Chemical National Bank of New York in 1865 , at the urging of the secretary of the treasury . This allowed Chemical to issue government @-@ backed national bank notes , the forerunner to paper money . By the early 1870s , Chemical had accumulated deposits in excess of $ 6 million . 
 A contemporary perspective of Chemical from 1893 described the bank as follows : 
 The Chemical National Bank is a famous corporation . Its stock commands a greater price in proportion to its par value than any other bank stock . It has the greatest surplus and undivided profits , with a single exception , of any bank in the country . It has the largest amount of individual deposits . It pays the largest percentage of dividends on its par value of any corporation of any kind ... The shares of the bank based on $ 100 par value have sold as high as $ 4 @,@ 980 each . 
 = = = 1900 – 1946 = = = 
 By the first decade of the 20th century , Chemical had one of the strongest reputations in banking but as a business was in decline , losing accounts each year . Unlike many of its peers , Chemical had been reluctant to expand into securities and other businesses and had not paid interest on bank accounts . Both practices , considered to be highly conservative , had allowed Chemical to develop a large capital reserve but were not attracting customers . William H. Porter , a prominent banker of the era , was named president of the bank in 1903 after the death of the previous president George G. Williams . Porter would leave Chemical seven years later to become a partner at J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1910 and was succeeded by Joseph B. Martindale , who was named president in 1911 . 
 In 1917 , Chemical named a new president of the bank , Herbert Twitchell , after the death of Joseph B. Martindale . It was uncovered , just months after Martindale 's death , that the former Chemical president had stolen as much as $ 300 @,@ 000 from the account of Ellen D. Hunt , a niece of Wilson G. Hunt . 
 Twitchell initiated a major turnaround of Chemical , setting up a trust business and reversing Chemical 's policy of not paying interest on cash accounts . These steps along with other initiatives , resulted in an increase in deposits from $ 35 million to $ 81 million by 1920 . In 1920 , Twitchell was succeeded by Percy H. Johnston and remained with the bank as chairman of the board . Johnston would hold the presidency of the bank through 1946 at which time the bank had grown to become the seventh largest in the U.S. 
 In 1920 , Chemical completed its first major acquisition , merging with Citizens National Bank . The acquisition of Citizens National , a small New York commercial bank , increased Chemical 's assets to more than $ 200 million with more than $ 140 million of deposits . In 1923 Chemical established its first branch and by the end of the 1920s had opened a dozen branches in Manhattan and Brooklyn as well as a branch in London , its first international presence . 
 In 1929 , Chemical reincorporated as a state bank in New York as Chemical Bank & Trust Company and merged with the United States Mortgage & Trust Company , headquartered on the Madison Avenue and 74th Street . During the Depression @-@ era of the 1930s , Chemical 's deposits grew by more than 40 % and in 1941 , the bank reached $ 1 billion of assets . During this period , Chemical also established Chemical National Company a securities underwriting business . 
 = = = 1947 – 1979 = = = 
 In 1947 , after the retirement of Percy Johnston , Harold Holmes Helm was named the new president of Chemical and would serve first as president and later as chairman of the bank for the next 18 years until his retirement in 1965 . Under Helm , Chemical completed a series of large mergers in the late 1940s and early 1950s that again made the bank among the largest in the U.S. In 1947 , Chemical merged with Continental Bank and Trust Company . Then in 1954 , Chemical would merge with the Corn Exchange Bank and only five years later merge again with the New York Trust Company . 
 Chemical completed its largest acquisition to that point , in 1954 , merging with the Corn Exchange Bank to become the Chemical Corn Exchange Bank . Founded in 1853 , the Corn Exchange Bank was based in New York City , but had built a network of branches in other states through the acquisition of community banks . The merger with the Corn Exchange Bank added 98 additional branches to Chemical 's system largely in the New York City and $ 774 million in deposits . 
 In 1959 , the bank , now known as Chemical Corn Exchange Bank , merged with New York Trust Company , effectively doubling the size of the company . New York Trust Company , which had a large trust and wholesale @-@ banking business , specialized in servicing large industrial accounts . At the time of the merger , Chemical Corn was the fourth largest bank in New York and New York Trust was the ninth largest bank and the merger created the third largest bank in New York , and the fourth largest in the U.S. with $ 3 @.@ 8 billion of assets . Following the merger , the bank dropped the usage of the " corn exchange " from the corporate name to become the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company . 
 In 1968 , Chemical reorganized itself as a bank holding company which allowed for more rapid expansion . Throughout the early 1960s Chemical had begun to expand into New York 's suburbs , opening branches on Long Island and in Westchester County . However , by the late 1960s and early 1970s , Chemical was focused on building its international business . In these years , Chemical opened new offices in Frankfurt , Germany ( 1969 ) , Zurich , Switzerland ( 1971 ) , Brussels , Belgium ( 1971 ) , Paris , France ( 1971 ) and Tokyo , Japan ( 1972 ) . 
 In 1975 , Chemical acquired Security National Bank , which had a branch network on Long Island . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 Chemical continued pursuing acquisitions , throughout the 1980s notably its acquisitions of Texas Commerce Bank ( 1986 ) and Horizon Bancorp ( 1986 ) as well as its attempted takeover of Florida National Bank ( 1982 ) . 
 Chemical and Florida National Bank agreed , in 1982 , to enter into a merger , after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted , giving Chemical an option to acquire the business . In February , 1982 , Southeast Banking Corporation ( SBC ) , which had been rebuffed in its attempted to acquire Florida National sued to obtain an injunction against the Chemical merger . In early 1983 , Southeast Banking Corporation dropped its takeover attempt and agreed to exchange their Florida National shares for 24 FNB branch offices and other consideration . Following the deal with SBC , Florida National was cleared to merge with Chemical , however interstate banking acquisitions were still prohibited by Federal law and required state legislative approval . With the 1990 deadline running out for its option to buy Florida National and no sign of state legislative approval , Chemical Bank sold their 4 @.@ 9 % interest to First Union Corporation for $ 115 million . 
 Chemical completed its largest transaction of the 1980s in December 1986 , when the bank agreed to acquire Texas Commerce Bank . The $ 1 @.@ 1 billion transaction represented the largest interstate banking merger in U.S. history to that time . Texas Commerce , which was officially acquired in May 1987 , was one of the largest bank holding companies in the Southwestern U.S. , with a strong presence in corporate banking for small and medium @-@ sized businesses . Chemical did not seek Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation backing for its acquisition of Texas Commerce although other large Texas banks , First <unk> Corporation ( Acquired by <unk> ) and <unk> Bank ( acquired by Bank One ) , received over $ 5 billion of support . Ultimately Chemical contributed $ 300 million to shore Texas Commerce as it continued to suffer losses . 
 Also in 1986 , Chemical agreed to a merger with New Jersey @-@ based Horizon Bancorp , although the merger was not completed until 1989 , due again to interstate banking rules . 
 The bank 's holding company , which had been the Chemical New York Corporation was renamed the Chemical Banking Corporation in 1988 following its series of out of state mergers and acquisitions , including Texas Commerce Bank and Horizon Bancorp . 
 It was during this period , in the 1980s and early 1990s , that Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions . By the late 1980s , Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts , building a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker , Jimmy Lee . It was not until 1993 that Chemical would permission to underwrite corporate bonds , however within a few years , Chemical ( and later Chase ) became a major underwriter of below @-@ investment @-@ grade debt under Lee . Additionally , in 1984 , Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity transactions alongside various financial sponsors . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 In July 1991 , Chemical announced that it would acquire Manufacturers Hanover Corporation in a $ 135 billion merger transaction . At the time of the merger , Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover were the sixth and ninth largest banks , respectively , by assets . The transaction , when it closed at the end of 1991 , made the combined bank , which retained the Chemical name , the second largest bank in the U.S. , behind Citicorp both in terms of assets and customers ( approximately 1 @.@ 2 million household accounts in 1991 ) . Chemical adopted Manufacturers Hanover 's logo design and moved into its headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in New York . In corporate banking , Manufacturers Hanover was better established with larger , blue @-@ chip companies , whereas Chemical had been stronger with small- and medium @-@ sized businesses . 
 Nationally , the combined Chemical Bank became one of the largest lenders to U.S. companies and was arguably the leader in loan syndication globally . Additionally , Chemical took a leading role providing foreign exchange , interest rate and currency swaps , corporate finance services , cash management , corporate and institutional trust , trade services and funds transfer . Chemical operated one of the nation 's largest bank credit card franchises and was a major originator and <unk> of home mortgages . 
 In 1996 , Chemical acquired Chase Manhattan Corporation in a merger valued at $ 10 billion to create the largest financial institution in the United States . Although Chemical was the acquiring company and the nominal survivor , the merged bank adopted the Chase name , which was considered to be better known , particularly internationally . Chase , which at its height had been the largest bank in the U.S. , had fallen to sixth , while Chemical was the third largest bank at the time of the merger . The merger resulted in the reduction of more than 12 @,@ 000 jobs between the two banks and merger related expenses of approximately $ 1 @.@ 9 billion . 
 The bank continued to operate under the Chase brand until its acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. in December 2000 to form JPMorgan Chase & Co . Throughout all of these acquisitions , Chemical 's original management team , led by Walter V. Shipley , remained in charge of the bank . When the combined bank purchased J.P. Morgan & Co . , William B. Harrison , Jr . , who had been a longtime Chemical executive , was named CEO of the combined firm . Additionally , many of Chemical 's businesses remained intact through the various mergers . Chemical 's private equity group for example , was renamed multiple times , ultimately becoming JP Morgan Partners before completing a spin @-@ out from the bank , as <unk> Capital , after the bank 's 2004 merger with Bank One . Additionally , JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical 's pre @-@ 1996 stock price history , as well as Chemical 's old headquarters at 270 Park Avenue .

 = = = Electronic banking = = = 
 Chemical was among the pioneers of electronic online banking . On September 2 , 1969 , Chemical installed the first automated teller machine ( ATM ) at its branch in Rockville Centre , New York . The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card . A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted " On Sept . 2 our bank will open at 9 : 00 and never close again . " Chemical 's ATM , initially known as a <unk> , was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company <unk> . Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines . Additionally , executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money . 
 In 1982 , Chemical initiated the first personal computer based banking system when it launched a pilot electronic banking program called Pronto . Chemical had spent $ 20 million to develop the software for Pronto . The system , which worked with the <unk> console , began in New York and served 200 Chemical Bank customers . Pronto was an extension of other electronic banking services offered by Chemical that included a corporate cash @-@ management system and its growing ATM network and was one of the largest early forays by a bank into home computer based banking . However , a year after launching Pronto only 21 @,@ 000 of Chemical 's 1 @.@ 15 million customers were using the system , in large part due to the high monthly subscription costs that Chemical charged customers to use it . By 1985 , it was clear that Pronto , which was heavily promoted by Chemical , was growing much slower than anticipated . 
 In 1985 , Chemical and <unk> , another pioneer in electronic banking , entered into a joint venture with AT & T Corporation and Time Inc . , known as <unk> , to market banking and discount stock @-@ brokerage services to computer @-@ equipped households . By combining resources and sharing costs , the four firms hope to reduce the risk of large and protracted losses . Eventually Chemical discontinued its efforts in 1989 at a loss of nearly $ 30 million .

 = Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem = 
 The arrest and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm , the president of South Vietnam , marked the culmination of a successful CIA @-@ backed coup d 'état led by General Dương Văn Minh in November 1963 . On 2 November 1963 , Diệm and his adviser , his younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu , were arrested after the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) had been successful in a bloody overnight siege on Gia Long Palace in Saigon . The coup was the culmination of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam . Discontent with the Diệm regime had been simmering below the surface , and exploded with mass Buddhist protests against long @-@ standing religious discrimination after the government shooting of protesters who defied a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag . 
 When rebel forces entered the palace , the Ngô brothers were not present , having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon . The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace , and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace . The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile ; after being arrested , they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base . While no formal inquiry was conducted , the responsibility for the deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh 's bodyguard , Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung , and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa , both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip . Minh 's army colleagues and U.S. officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions . They postulated various motives , including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace , and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback . The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide , but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs ' corpses surfaced in the media . 
 = = Background = = 
 Diệm 's political career began in July 1954 , when he was appointed the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by former Emperor Bảo Đại , who was Head of State . At the time , Vietnam had been partitioned at the Geneva Conference after the defeat of the French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu , with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the 17th parallel . The partition was intended to be temporary , with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation . In the meantime , Diệm and Bảo Đại were locked in a power struggle . Bảo Đại disliked Diệm but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid . The issue was brought to a head when Diệm scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic . Diệm won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam . 
 Diệm refused to hold the reunification elections , on the basis that the State of Vietnam was not a signatory to the Geneva Accords . He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country . A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers . Dissidents , both communist and nationalist , were jailed and executed in the thousands , and elections were routinely rigged . Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong , which carried the death penalty , and in many areas , large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes . 
 Diệm kept the control of the nation firmly within the hands of his brothers and their in @-@ laws , and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit . Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm ; in 1960 , a paratroop revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt , while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him . South Vietnam 's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm 's strong favoritism towards Catholics . Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference , and government contracts , U.S. economic assistance , business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics . The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country , and its holdings were exempt from land reform . In the countryside , Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corvée labour . Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm 's army and police on Vesak , the birthday of Gautama Buddha . 
 In May 1963 , a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively invoked ; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục , Diệm 's elder brother . The Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire . With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality , sections of society began calling for his removal from power . The key turning point came shortly after midnight on 21 August , when Nhu 's Special Forces raided and vandalised Buddhist pagodas across the country , arresting thousands of monks and causing a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds . Numerous coup plans had been explored by the army before , but the plotters intensified their activities with increased confidence after the administration of U.S. President John F. Kennedy authorised the U.S. embassy to explore the possibility of a leadership change . 
 = = Surrender and debate = = 
 At 13 : 30 on 1 November , Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn , respectively the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff , led a coup against Diệm , assisted by mutinous ARVN officers . The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers to prevent them from saving Diệm . Unknown to Diệm , General Đính , the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN III Corps that surrounded the Saigon area , had allied himself with the plotters of the coup . The second of Diệm 's most trusted loyalist generals was Huỳnh Văn Cao , who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta . Diệm and Nhu were aware of the coup plan , and Nhu responded by planning a counter @-@ coup , which he called Operation Bravo . This plan involved Đính and Colonel Tung , the loyalist commander of the Special Forces , staging a phony rebellion before their forces crushed the " uprising " to reaffirm the power of the Ngô family . Unaware that Đính was plotting against him , Nhu allowed Đính to organise troops as he saw fit , and Đính transferred the command of the Seventh Division from Cao 's IV Corps to his own III Corps . This allowed Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có , Đính 's deputy , to take command of the 7th Division based at Mỹ Tho . The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Diệm , as he had done during the previous coup attempt in 1960 . Minh and Đôn had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base , headquarters of the Joint General Staff ( JGS ) , on the pretext of routine business . Instead , they announced that a coup was underway , with only a few , including Tung , refusing to join . Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender . The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from entering . This left only the Presidential Guard to defend Gia Long Palace . The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace , hoping that Diệm would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile . Diệm refused , vowing to reassert his control . After sunset , the 7th Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu , who later became the nation 's president , led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak . 
 In the early morning of 2 November , Diệm agreed to surrender . The ARVN officers had intended to exile Diệm and Nhu , having promised the Ngô brothers safe passage out of the country . At 06 : 00 , just before dawn , the officers held a meeting at JGS headquarters to discuss the fate of the Ngô brothers . According to Lucien Conein , the U.S. Army officer and CIA operative who was the American liaison with the coup , most of the officers , including Minh , wanted Diệm to have an " honorable retirement " from office , followed by exile . Not all of the senior officers attended the meeting , with having already left to make arrangements for the arrival of Diệm and Nhu at JGS headquarters . General Lê , a former police chief under Diệm in the mid @-@ 1950s , strongly lobbied for Diệm 's execution . There was no formal vote taken at the meeting , and Lê attracted only minority support . One general was reported to have said " To kill weeds , you must pull them up at the roots " . Conein reported that the generals had never indicated that assassination was in their minds , since an orderly transition of power was a high priority in achieving their ultimate aim of gaining international recognition . 
 Minh and Đôn asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country . Two days earlier , U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam , Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . , had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point . This request put the Kennedy administration in a difficult position , as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup . When Conein telephoned David Smith , the acting chief of the Saigon CIA station , there was a ten @-@ minute delay . The U.S. government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country , unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Diệm . The United States did not want Diệm and Nhu to form a government in exile and wanted them far away from Vietnam . Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman had written in August that " under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power . If the generals decide to exile Diệm , he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia . " He further went on to anticipate what he termed a " Götterdämmerung in the palace " . 
 We should encourage the coup group to fight the battle to the end and destroy the palace if necessary to gain victory . Unconditional surrender should be the terms for the Ngô family since it will otherwise seek to outmaneuver both the coups forces and the U.S. If the family is taken alive , the Nhus should be banished to France or any other country willing to receive them . Diệm should be treated as the generals wish . 
 After surrendering , Diệm called Lodge by telephone for the last time . Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington , so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting . However , after Lodge died in 1985 , his aide , Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Diệm spoke for the last time around 07 : 00 on 2 November moments after Diệm surrendered . When Diệm called , Lodge " put [ him ] on hold " and then walked away . Upon his return , the ambassador offered Diệm and Nhu asylum , but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day . This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Diệm to not resist the coup . Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers ' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him , but Lodge refused , saying , " We just can 't get that involved . " Dunn said , " I was really astonished that we didn 't do more for them . " Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely , Lodge later said after they had been shot , " What would we have done with them if they had lived ? Every Colonel Blimp in the world would have made use of them . " 
 Dunn also claimed that Lodge put Diệm on hold in order to inform Conein where the Ngô brothers were so the generals could capture them . When confronted about Dunn 's claim by a historian , Conein denied the account . It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals ' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon . One of Lodge 's staff told Conein that the plane would have to go directly to the faraway asylum @-@ offering country , so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter @-@ coup . Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam , and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements . Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period . Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy . In contrast , a U.S. Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought : " One wonders what became of the U.S. military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge 's departure , scheduled for the previous day . " The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines , which was under American jurisdiction , before taking him to the final destination . Moyar speculated that " when Lodge had offered the jet the day before , he had done it to induce Diệm to give up at a time when the outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt . Now that the coup clearly had succeeded , Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive . " 
 = = Intended arrest at Gia Long Palace = = 
 In the meantime , Minh left the JGS headquarters and traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard , Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung . Minh had also dispatched a M @-@ 113 armored personnel carrier and four jeeps to Gia Long to transport Diệm and Nhu back to JGS headquarters . While Minh was on the way to supervise the takeover of the palace , Generals Đôn , Trần Thiện Khiêm and Lê Văn Kim prepared the army headquarters for Diệm 's arrival and the ceremonial handover of power to the junta . Diệm 's pictures were taken down and his statue was covered up . A large table covered with green felt was brought in with the intention of seating Diệm for the handover to Minh and Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ , who was to become the civilian Prime Minister during a nationally televised event witnessed by international media . Diệm and Nhu would then " ask " the generals to be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country , which would be granted . The brothers were then to be held in a secure place at JGS headquarters while awaiting deportation . Minh arrived at the palace at 08 : 00 in full military ceremonial uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony . 
 = = Diệm 's escape = = 
 Minh instead arrived to find that the brothers were not in the palace . In anticipation of a coup , they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace . Around 20 : 00 on the night of the coup , with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units , Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase . They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists : Air Force Lieutenant <unk> Thơ , Diệm 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp , who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu , the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot , and Xuân Vy , head of Nhu 's Republican Youth . After the coup , General Paul Harkins , the head of the U.S. presence in Vietnam , inspected the tunnel and noted that it " was so far down that I didn 't want to go down to walk up the thing " . The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif , the city 's upper class sporting club , where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover . Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape , asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building , which was not yet under siege . Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car . The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan . After leaving the palace , Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up , arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival . Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao 's IV Corps , while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands . Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free , in case the surviving brother were to regain power . According to one account , Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu , reasoning that " You cannot leave alone . They hate you too much ; they will kill you . Stay with me and I will protect you . " Another story holds that Diệm said " We have always been together during these last years . How could we separate during these last years ? How could we separate in this critical hour ? " Nhu agreed to remain with his brother . 
 The loyalists reached the home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese business district of Cholon . Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who was reported to be Nhu 's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade . The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China , but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen 's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders . Nhu 's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace , so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long . Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21 : 00 they were about to fight for an empty building . Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night . 
 = = Arrest in Cholon = = 
 After Minh had ordered the rebels to search the areas known to have been frequented by the Ngo family , Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was informed by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon . Thảo was told by Khiêm , his superior , to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed . When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen 's house , he phoned his superiors . Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier , which they had frequented over the years . Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash , but his diary was not found until 1970 . Thơ recorded Diệm 's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being " I don 't know whether I will live or die and I don 't care , but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me " . Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls ' Day ( the Catholic day of the dead ) and after the congregation had left the building , the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits . It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard . Inside the church , the brothers prayed and received Communion . 
 A few minutes later , just after 10 : 00 , an armoured personnel carrier and two jeeps entered the narrow alcove housing the church building . Lieutenant Thơ , who had earlier urged Diệm to surrender , saying that he was sure that his uncle Đỗ Mậu , along with Đính and Khiêm , would guarantee their safety , wrote in his diary later " I consider myself responsible for having led them to their death " . 
 = = Convoy to JGS headquarters = = 
 The convoy was led by General Mai Hữu Xuân and consisted of Colonels Nguyễn Văn Quan and Dương Ngọc Lắm . Quan was the deputy of Minh and Lắm was the Commander of Diệm 's Civil Guard . Lắm had joined the coup once a rebel victory seemed assured . Two further officers made up the convoy : Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa and Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung . Nhung was Minh 's bodyguard . 
 Diệm requested that the convoy stop at the palace so that he could gather personal items before being exiled . Xuân turned him down , clinically stating that his orders were to take Diệm and Nhu directly to headquarters . Nhu expressed disgust that they were to be transported in an APC , asking , " You use such a vehicle to drive the president ? " Lắm assured them that the armour was for their own protection . Xuân said that it was selected to protect them from " extremists " . Xuân ordered the brothers ' hands be tied behind their backs before shoving them into the carrier . One officer asked to shoot Nhu , but Xuân turned him down . 
 = = Assassination = = 
 After the arrest , Nhung and Nghĩa sat with the brothers in the APC , and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt . Before the convoy had departed for the church , Minh was reported to have gestured to Nhung with two fingers . This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers . The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip , where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated . An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point @-@ blank range with a semi @-@ automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife . 
 Nghĩa gave his account of what occurred during the journey back to the military headquarters : " As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters , Diệm sat silently , but Nhu and the captain [ Nhung ] began to insult each other . I don 't know who started it . The name @-@ calling grew passionate . The captain had hated Nhu before . Now he was charged with emotion . " Nghĩa said that when the convoy reached a train crossing , " [ Nhung ] lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again , maybe fifteen or twenty times . Still in a rage , he turned to Diệm , took out his revolver and shot him in the head . Then he looked back at Nhu , who was lying on the floor , twitching . He put a bullet into his head too . Neither Diệm nor Nhu ever defended themselves . Their hands were tied . "

 When the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters , the generals were shocked . Although they despised and had no sympathy for Nhu , they still respected Diệm . One general broke down and wept while Minh 's assistant , Colonel Nguyễn Văn Quan collapsed on a table . General Đính , the military commander of the III Corps which controlled Saigon , later declared , " I couldn 't sleep that night " . Đôn maintained that the generals were " truly grievous " over the deaths , maintaining that they were sincere in their intentions to give Diệm a safe exile . Đôn charged Nhu with convincing Diệm to reject the offer . Lodge later concluded , " Once again , brother Nhu proves to be the evil genius in Diệm 's life . " 
 = = = ARVN reaction = = = 
 Đôn ordered another general to tell reporters that the Ngô brothers had died in an accident . He went to confront Minh in his office . 
 Đôn : Why are they dead ? 
 Minh : And what does it matter that they are dead ? 
 At this time , Xuân walked into Minh 's office through the open door , unaware of Đôn 's presence . Xuân snapped to attention and stated , " Mission accomplished . " Shortly after midnight on 2 November 1963 in Washington , D.C. the CIA sent word to the White House that Diệm and Nhu were dead , allegedly by suicide . Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison , and that they had committed suicide while prisoners in an APC transporting them to Tân Sơn Nhứt . <unk> and contradictory stories abounded . General Paul Harkins reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard . Minh tried to explain the discrepancy , saying " Due to an inadvertence , there was a gun inside the vehicle . It was with this gun that they committed suicide . " 
 = = = U.S. reaction = = = 
 Kennedy learned of the deaths on the following morning when National Security Council staffer Michael Forrestal rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ngô brothers ' alleged suicides . According to General Maxwell Taylor , " Kennedy leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before . " Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. recalled that the U.S. President was " somber and shaken " . Kennedy later penned a memo , lamenting that the assassination was " particularly abhorrent " and blaming himself for approving Cable 243 , which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu 's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas . Forrestal said that " It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter . It shook his confidence , I think , in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam . " When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism , Kennedy replied " No . They were in a difficult position . They did the best they could for their country . " 
 Kennedy 's reaction did not draw sympathy from his entire administration . Some believed that he should not have supported the coup and that as coups were uncontrollable , assassination was always a possibility . Kennedy was skeptical about the story and suspected that a double assassination had taken place . He reasoned the devoutly Catholic Ngô brothers would not have taken their own lives , but Roger Hilsman rationalised the possibility of suicide by asserting that Diệm and Nhu would have interpreted the coup as Armageddon . U.S. officials soon became aware of the true reasons for the deaths of Diệm and Nhu . Lucien Conein had left the rebel headquarters as the generals were preparing to bring in the Ngô brothers for the press conference which announced the handover of power . Upon returning to his residence , Conein received a phone call from Saigon 's CIA station that ordered him to report to the embassy . The embassy informed Conein that Kennedy had instructed him to find Diệm . Conein returned to Tân Sơn Nhứt at around 10 : 30 . The following conversation was reported : 
 Conein : Where were Diem and Nhu ? 
 Minh : They committed suicide . They were in the Catholic Church at Cholon , and they committed suicide . 
 C : Look , you 're a Buddhist , I 'm a Catholic . If they committed suicide at that church and the priest holds mass tonight , that story won 't hold water . Where are they ? 
 M : Their bodies are behind General Staff Headquarters . Do you want to see them ? 
 C : No . 
 M : Why not ? 
 C : Well , if by chance one of a million of the people believe you that they committed suicide in church and I see that they have not committed suicide and I know differently , then if it ever leaks out , I am in trouble . 
 Conein knew that if he saw the execution wounds , he would not be able to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated . Conein refused to see the proof , realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety . He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington . The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed . The photos were taken at about 10 : 00 , 2 November , showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC . They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs . Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed . The images appeared to be genuine , discrediting the generals ' claims that the brothers had committed suicide . The pictures were distributed around the world , having been sold to media outlets in Saigon . The caption below a picture published in Time read " ' Suicide ' with no hands . "

 After the deaths , the military junta asserted that the Ngô brothers had committed suicide . On 6 November , Information Minister Trần Tự Oai declared at a news conference that Diệm and Nhu had died through " accidental suicide " after a firearm discharged when Nhu had tried to seize it from the arresting officer . This drew immediate skepticism from David Halberstam of the New York Times , who won a Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam reporting . Halberstam wrote to the US Department of State that " extremely reliable private military sources " had confirmed that the brothers were ordered to be executed upon their return to military headquarters . Neil Sheehan of UPI reported a similar account based on what he described as " highly reliable sources " . Father Leger of Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church asserted that the Ngô brothers were kneeling inside the building when soldiers burst in , took them outside and into the APC . Lodge had been informed by " an unimpeachable source " that both brothers were shot in the nape of the neck and that Diệm 's body bore the signs of a beating . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 Once the news of the cause of death of the Ngo brothers began to become public , the United States became concerned at their association with the new junta and their actions during the coup . U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk directed Lodge to question Minh about the killings . Lodge cabled back , initially backing the false story disseminated by the generals , saying that their story was plausible because of the supposedly loaded pistol being left on the floor of the vehicle . Rusk was worried about the public relations implications the bloody photographs of the brothers would generate . Lodge showed no alarm in public , congratulating Đôn on the " masterful performance " of the coup and promising diplomatic recognition . Đôn 's assertion that the assassinations were unplanned proved sufficient for Lodge , who told the State Department that " I am sure assassination was not at their direction . " Minh and Đôn reiterated their position in a meeting with Conein and Lodge on the following day . Several members of the Kennedy administration were appalled by the killings . The Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs W. Averell Harriman declared that " it was a great shock to everybody that they were killed . " He postulated that it was an accident and speculated that Nhu may have caused it by insulting the officers who were supervising him . Embassy official Rufus Phillips , who was the U.S. advisor to Nhu 's Strategic Hamlet Program , said that " I wanted to sit down and cry " , citing the killings as a key factor in the future leadership troubles which beset South Vietnam . 
 According to historian Howard Jones , the fact " that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused . " The assassinations caused a split within the coup leadership , turning the initial harmony among the generals into discord , and further abroad repulsed American and world opinion , exploding the myth that this new regime would constitute a distinct improvement over their predecessors , and ultimately convinced Washington that even though the leaders ' names had changed in Saigon , the situation remained the same . The criticism of the killings further caused the officers to distrust and battle one another for positions in the new government . Đôn expressed his abhorrence at the assassinations by caustically remarking that he had organised the armoured car in an effort to protect Diệm and Nhu . Khanh claimed that the only condition he had put on joining the conspiracy was that Diem would not be killed . According to Jones , " when decisions regarding <unk> affairs took priority , resentment over the killings meshed with the visceral competition over government posts to disassemble the new regime before it fully took form . " 
 = = <unk> debate = = 
 The responsibility for the assassinations was generally placed on Minh . Conein asserted that " I have it on very good authority of very many people , that Big Minh gave the order " , as did William Colby , the director of the CIA 's Far Eastern division . Đôn was equally emphatic , saying " I can state without equivocation that this was done by General Dương Văn Minh and by him alone . " Lodge thought that Xuân was also partly culpable asserting that " Diệm and Nhu had been assassinated , if not by Xuân personally , at least at his direction . " 
 Minh placed the blame on Thiệu , after the latter became President , for the assassinations . In 1971 , Minh claimed that Thiệu was responsible for the deaths by hesitating and delaying the attack by his Fifth Division on Gia Long Palace . Đôn was reported to have pressured Thieu during the night , asking him on the phone " Why are you so slow in doing it ? Do you need more troops ? If you do , ask Đính to send more troops – and do it quickly because after taking the palace you will be made a general . " Thiệu stridently denied responsibility and issued a statement which Minh did not publicly rebut : " Dương Văn Minh has to assume entire responsibility for the death of Ngô Đình Diệm . " 
 During the presidency of Richard Nixon , a U.S. government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations . Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy , having narrowly lost to him in the 1960 Presidential election . Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders , convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order . 
 = = Motivation = = 
 Conein asserted that Minh 's humiliation by Diệm and Nhu was a major motivation for ordering their executions . Conein reasoned that Diệm and Nhu were doomed once they escaped from Gia Long Palace , instead of surrendering there and accepting the offer of safe exile . Having successfully stormed the palace , Minh had presumed that the brothers would be inside , and arrived at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform " with a sedan and everything else . " Conein described Minh as a " very proud man " who had lost face at turning up at the palace for his moment of glory , only to find an empty building . More than a decade after the coup , Conein claimed Diệm and Nhu would not have been killed if they had been in the palace , because there were too many people present . 
 One Vietnamese Diệm loyalist asked friends in the CIA why an assassination had taken place , reasoning that if Diem was deemed to be inefficient , his deposal would suffice . The CIA employees responded that " They had to kill him . Otherwise his supporters would gradually rally and organise and there would be civil war . " Some months after the event , Minh was reported to have privately told an American that " We had no alternative . They had to be killed . Diệm could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple , gullible people in the countryside , especially the Catholics and the refugees . We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared – and he had created organizations that were arms of his personal power . " 
 Trần Văn Hương , a civilian opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the Caravelle Manifesto that criticised Diệm , and later briefly served as Prime Minister , gave a scathing analysis of the generals ' action . He stated that " The top generals who decided to murder Diệm and his brother were scared to death . The generals knew very well that having no talent , no moral virtues , no political support whatsoever , they could not prevent a spectacular comeback of the president and Mr. Nhu if they were alive . " 
 = = Burials of Diệm and Nhu = = 
 At around 16 : 00 on 2 November , the bodies of Diệm and Nhu were identified by the wife of former Cabinet minister Trần <unk> Dung . The corpses were taken to St. Paul 's Catholic Hospital , where a French doctor made a formal statement of death without conducting an autopsy . The original death certificate did not describe Diệm as Head of State but as " Chief of Province " , a post he had held four decades earlier under the French colonial administration . Nhu was described as " Chief of Library Service " , a post which he held in the 1940s . This was interpreted as a Vietnamese way of expressing contempt for the two despised leaders . Their place of burial was never disclosed by the junta and rumours regarding it persist to the current day . The speculated burial places include a military prison , a local cemetery , the grounds of the JGS headquarters at Tan Son Nhut and there are reports of cremation as well . Nobody was ever prosecuted for the killings . 
 = = Memorial services = = 
 The government did not approve a public memorial service for the deaths of Diệm and Nhu until 1968 . In 1971 , several thousand mourners gathered at Diệm 's purported gravesite . Catholic prayers were given in Latin . Banners proclaimed Diệm as a saviour of the south , with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Diệm . Madame Thiệu , the First Lady , was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon 's basilica . Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN . According to the eulogy , Diệm died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country . Thiệu sponsored the services , and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Diệm 's personal characteristics . Diệm frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity , in contrast to Thieu , who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans . However , Thiệu 's attempts to associate himself with Diệm 's relative independence from United States influence was not successful . According to General Maxwell Taylor , Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , " there was the memory of Diệm to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall . By our complicity , we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves " . 
 = Ujjal Dosanjh = 
 Ujjal Dev Singh Dosanjh ( Punjabi : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) PC QC , ( / <unk> <unk> / ; born September 9 , 1947 ) is a Canadian lawyer and politician . He served as 33rd Premier of British Columbia from 2000 to 2001 and as a Liberal Party of Canada Member of Parliament from 2004 to 2011 including a period as Minister of Health from 2004 until 2006 when the party lost government . As a member of the Official Opposition from January 2006 until 2011 , Dosanjh variously has been the critic of National Defence , Public Safety , and Foreign Affairs , as well as sitting on Standing Committee on National Defence , the Committee on Public Safety and National Security , the Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development , and the Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan , and the Committee on Justice and Human Rights . Dosanjh was one of four Visible Minorities to serve in Paul Martin 's Ministry . 
 Prior to being involved in federal politics , he spent ten years in provincial politics . He was elected in the Vancouver @-@ Kensington riding in 1991 as a member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party ( BC NDP ) and re @-@ elected there in 1996 . He served as the Attorney General of British Columbia from August 1995 to February 2000 . When the leader of his party resigned in 1999 , Dosanjh put himself forward as a candidate and won the leadership vote . With the win he became Canada 's first Indo @-@ Canadian provincial leader . He served as the 33rd Premier of British Columbia until June 2001 when he lost the province 's general election . 
 Born in a village in the Jalandhar district of Punjab , India , Dosanjh emigrated to the United Kingdom at the age of 17 before moving to Canada almost four years later . He worked numerous manual labour jobs and attended university , studying political science . He earned his law degree at the University of British Columbia and opened his own law firm . He has been a vocal opponent of violence and extremism . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Ujjal Dosanjh was born in Dosanjh Kalan , a village in Jalandhar district , Punjab , India , in 1947 . After moving to another village , he lived with his grandfather , <unk> Singh Bains , who had established a primary school . Dosanjh gained an early interest in politics from listening to debates between his father , a follower of Jawaharlal Nehru and the populist Indian National Congress , and his grandfather , a former Indian freedom fighter and socialist . Dosanjh wanted to pursue an education in political science , but his father wanted him to be a doctor . So in 1964 , at the age of 17 , Dosanjh left India for the United Kingdom where he could pursue his own interests . In London he learned English and worked as an assistant editor for a Punjabi @-@ language newspaper . He emigrated to Canada three and a half years later , arriving in British Columbia on May 12 , 1968 , to live with his <unk> majoring in political science . He went on to earn a law degree from the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in 1976 and was called to the bar the following year . During this time he taught English as a second language courses at Vancouver Community College and worked as an assistant editor of a local Punjabi newspaper . He established his own law practice in 1979 , specializing in family and personal injury law . His involvement with community organizations included founding the Farm Workers ’ Legal Information Service ( later Canadian Farm Workers ' Union ) , serving on the board of directors for BC Civil Liberties Association and the Vancouver Multicultural Society , and the Labour Advocacy Research Association , as well as volunteer work with <unk> Immigrant Services Centre , and the South Vancouver Neighbourhood House . 
 A prominent moderate Sikh in Vancouver , Dosanjh spoke out against violence by Sikh extremists who advocated <unk> independence from India . As a result of these views , in February 1985 he was attacked in the parking lot of his law office by an assailant wielding an iron bar . Dosanjh , 37 at the time , suffered a broken hand and received 80 stitches in his head . 
 He was targeted again , on 26 December 1999 , while he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia , when his constituency office was broken into and a Molotov cocktail left burning on a table . 
 Dosanjh and his wife <unk> have three sons . In April 2000 , his middle son , Aseem , was charged with assaulting an Ontario police officer during a bar brawl , but was found not guilty . Dosanjh has travelled back to India several times , on official state business and for personal reasons , since emigrating . In January 2003 , he was awarded the <unk> Bharatiya Samman ( Expatriate Indian Honour ) from Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi . The award recognises individual excellence in various fields for persons of Indian origin across the world . 
 In 2014 , author Doug <unk> published a biography , Unbreakable : The Ujjal Dosanjh story . 
 = = Provincial politics = = 
 Dosanjh ran as the British Columbia New Democratic Party candidate in the Vancouver South riding in the 1979 and 1983 provincial elections . He lost both times to the BC Social Credit Party candidates . He ran in the 1991 provincial election in the Vancouver @-@ Kensington riding where he won as his party came to power . He would be re @-@ elected in that same riding in the 1996 provincial election . He spent his first few years as a Member of the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher . In 1993 , he chaired the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform , Ethical Conduct , Standing Orders and Private Bills . He served two years as caucus chair for his party until April 10 , 1995 , when Premier Mike Harcourt dismissed Robin <unk> from his cabinet and replaced him with Dosanjh as Minister of Government Services and Minister Responsible for Sports . A month later , in a small cabinet shuffle upon the resignation of Moe Sihota , Harcourt added Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism and Human Rights to Dosanjh 's portfolio . In another cabinet shuffle , as Sihota was re @-@ instated into the cabinet in August , Dosanjh 's portfolio was changed to Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism , Human Rights and Immigration and he was appointed Attorney General . 
 As Attorney General , Dosanjh oversaw the resolution of the <unk> Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation , set up a database for registering violent offenders , established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , and lobbied for more police officers , probation officers , and judiciary . At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses . As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism , Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same @-@ sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support , custody and access . In early 1999 , a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing . On March 4 , after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) raided the Premier 's house , they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh , whose office had to assist , and placed him under a gag order . The order was lifted on August 13 , he informed Clark , and called a press conference , after which Clark resigned as Premier . Dosanjh 's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner , and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene . 
 The leadership convention to replace Clark was set for February 20 , 2000 . Dosanjh was among the front runners , along with Corky Evans , Gordon Wilson , and Joy MacPhail who all had served at various cabinet posts . Clark , Wilson and fellow MLA Moe Sihota campaigned specifically against Dosanjh . MacPhail dropped out and endorsed Dosanjh followed by Wilson dropping out and endorsing Evans . Dosanjh was successful and became Premier on February 24 , 2000 , Canada 's first Indo @-@ Canadian provincial leader . 
 As Premier for two and a half sessions of the 36th Parliament , between February 24 , 2000 and June 5 , 2001 , Dosanjh gave priority to issues of health care , education , and balanced budgets . A boost in government revenue from rapidly expanding oil and gas development , led Dosanjh to direct the Finance Minister to draft balanced budget legislation . With the previous year 's budget unexpectedly in surplus and increased revenue expected to continue , Dosanjh was able to keep the provincial budget in surplus while increasing spending by 8 % in the 2001 budget year . The increased spending was mostly directed to renovations of hospital , public schools and higher education institutions , as well as building cancer treatment centers , lowering post @-@ secondary tuition fees , and creating significantly more new spaces in the province 's apprenticeship program and post @-@ secondary institutions . Dosanjh became the first provincial leader to march in a gay pride parade and the provincial government adopted the Definition of Spouse Amendment Act which extended equal rights to same @-@ sex couples . With Dosanjh as Premier the Legislative Assembly adopted the Tobacco Damages and Health Care Recovery Act which permitted lawsuits against tobacco organizations to re @-@ coup associated health care expenses , the Sex Offender Registry Act , and the Protection of Public Participation Act which prevented lawsuits against citizens who participated in public processes . 
 However , the BC NDP were deeply unpopular within the province , reaching a low at 15 % support in opinion polls at the time of Glen Clark 's resignation as Premier in August 1999 . With Dosanjh as leader , support had risen to 21 % by August 2000 . Dosanjh was consistently ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run @-@ up to the May 16 , 2001 , provincial election . Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected , so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive . Their campaign focused on the expanding economy , issues of health care and education , and Dosanjh 's personal popularity over Campbell . Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election , but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party . After the vote , on May 16 , Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver @-@ Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second @-@ worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada . The BC Liberals won all 77 other seats . 
 = = Federal politics = = 
 Following the election loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law and let his party membership lapse . There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada . New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 to see if he was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused . In March 2004 , with a federal election expected in the spring or summer , Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada . Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson , union leader Dave Haggard , community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham . The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party 's socially progressive aspect . In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44 @.@ 5 % of the vote . 
 = = = 38th Canadian Parliament = = = 
 In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was appointed Minister of Health in the federal Cabinet . As Health Minister , Dosanjh strongly supported Canada 's existing single @-@ tier , publicly funded health @-@ care system . Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe , new regulations to further limit lead content in children 's jewelry , and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats . He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , which they did in November 2004 . Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to more include more multicultural foods and another program to integrate foreign @-@ trained medical professionals into the health @-@ care system . Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons , the government agreed to compensate the 6 @,@ 000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion . Along with Prime Minister Martin , a 10 @-@ year , $ 41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $ 5 @.@ 5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers ' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk . As the Minister of Health , Dosanjh introduced Bill C @-@ 12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act ; it was given royal assent in May 2005 . 
 In May 2005 , opposition MP <unk> Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister 's Chief of Staff , Tim Murphy , of attempting to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife , Nina Grewal , if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote . Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh , Grewal , and Murphy . Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet . Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations . Nevertheless , fellow MP John Reynolds filed a complaint with the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society 's Professional Conduct Handbook . The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges . 
 = = = 39th Canadian Parliament = = = 
 In the January 2006 federal election , Dosanjh decisively won his riding against <unk> <unk> , the Indo @-@ Canadian Conservative candidate , and the community activist and NDP candidate Bev <unk> . With the Liberal party forming the Official Opposition , Dosanjh became the critic for National Defence and sat on the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development . In the December 2006 Liberal leadership race he supported Bob Rae , a fellow former @-@ NDP premier . When Rae was eliminated on the final ballot , Dosanjh supported Stéphane Dion . With Dion as the new leader , Dosanjh remained on the two committees but his critic responsibility was moved to Foreign Affairs . Dosanjh suffered a mild heart attack on the morning of February 13 , 2007 , outside the House of Commons . He was attended by fellow MP Carolyn Bennett , who is also a doctor , and he was rushed to hospital where a successful operation to remove a blood clot near his heart was performed . In the second session of the 39th Parliament , from October 2007 to September 2008 , Dosanjh sat on the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan , and his critic responsibility was moved Public Safety .

 The next election was called for October 2008 . Dosanjh faced sociologist Wai Young running for the Conservatives , health worker Ann Chambers running for the NDP , and an IT consultant , Csaba <unk> for the Green Party . Dosanjh won by 33 votes over Young , both receiving 38 @.@ 4 % of the vote . A recount confirmed Dosanjh 's victory but only by a margin of 22 votes . The Conservative Party requested a second , judicial recount , which again confirmed Dosanjh as the victor . In the 40th Canadian Parliament , with his party once again forming the official opposition , Dosanjh was appointed the National Defence critic for the first parliamentary session which was short @-@ lived . During the 2008 – 09 Canadian parliamentary dispute he defended the proposed coalition government as a reaction to inappropriate leadership on economic issues by the existing government . When Dion resigned as party leader , Dosanjh considered but did not run for leadership citing his inability to speak French and again supported Rae 's bid . In October 2009 , Michael Ignatieff appointed Dosanjh as the Liberals ' critic for National Defence . 
 When the 40th Parliament re @-@ convened for its 2nd session Dosanjh continued as the National Defence critic and served on the Standing Committee on National Defence , as well as the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights , and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan . In the 3rd session of the 40th Parliament Dosanjh continued with the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan , but also sat with the Standing Committee on Health . In September 2010 he was reassigned to being the critic on health for the Liberal Party . Dosanjh introduced private member bill C @-@ 467 An Act to amend the Citizenship Act ( children born abroad ) in the 2nd session , and re @-@ introduced it in the 3rd session where it received 2nd reading in September 2010 , which would grant natural citizenship to children born to , or adopted by , Canadian citizens working for the federal government ( including members of the Canadian Forces ) . The bill was meant to repeal portions of the April 2009 amendments to the Citizenship Act which repatriated Lost Canadians but also removed the ability of Canadians to pass their citizenship onto their children if the children are born outside of the country . 
 Dosanjh was defeated in the 2011 federal election which saw the Liberal Party reduced to third place in the House of Commons .

 On April 16 , 2010 , the day prior to the annual Vaisakhi Parade held in Surrey , B.C. , one of the parade organizers issued a statement indicating should Dosanjh and BC Liberal backbencher Dave Hayer choose to attend the parade , their safety could not be guaranteed . This was due in part to comments that Dosanjh had made after the parade in 2007 , suggesting a police investigation into reports of a parade float that had a picture of <unk> Singh Parmar on it , the alleged mastermind behind the bombing of Air India Flight 182 . Dosanjh also expressed concerns over some attendees wearing International Sikh Youth Federation T @-@ shirts , a terrorist organization that is banned in India , Britain , the United States , and Canada . 
 At least two complaints were made to RCMP about the comments by one of the parade organizers , Inderjit Singh Bains , on Sher @-@ E @-@ Punjab radio . During part of the show hosted by <unk> <unk> , Bains spoke about the importance of honouring the Sikh faith and some logistics of the Surrey , B.C. , parade that draws tens of thousands of people . 
 " Everybody 's invited except those who 've been excluded , " he said of the event that would include security for some participants . " Everyone ( is invited ) except ... two people – Ujjal Dosanjh and Dave Hayer , " he said . " We 've never invited them . If they come they should bring their own security . " 
 Premier Gordon Campbell called for an apology . None was forthcoming and all three declined to attend the parade . 
 On April 23 , 2010 , the RCMP launched an investigation into threats made against Dosanjh on a Facebook site , titled “ Ujjal Dosanjh is a Sikh Traitor . ” Canada 's Parliamentarians condemned any death threats against Dosanjh .

 During the TGS afterparty , new cast member Danny Baker ( Cheyenne Jackson ) admits to his boss , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) , that he has been having an office romance but will not disclose the woman 's name . While in attendance at a New York Knicks game , Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details , such as she has never let a man see her feet . This results in Jack 's realization that the woman is the show 's head writer , Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) , and he is displeased . 
 Meanwhile , actress Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) auditions for a role she believes is for a college freshman on Gossip Girl . At the audition , Jenna learns that she is actually booked to audition for the role of the college freshman 's mother . She panics , believing that this is a sign that she is no longer young , and in an attempt to reclaim her youth , begins acting young which causes the TGS writing staff to mock her . At the same time , movie star Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) decides to add a woman to his entourage as a learning experience when he and his wife , Angie ( Sherri Shepherd ) , have a daughter . He brings in the French @-@ Dutch TGS writer Sue Laroche @-@ Van der Hout ( Sue Galloway ) . Tracy later loses his temper with a crew member , thinking that he made a suggestive comment about Sue , causing NBC page Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) to tell Tracy that he has become paternal towards Sue . Soon after , Sue begins rebelling against him , as Tracy treats her as a child . 
 During the TGS after party , Danny 's body paint — after performing as a robot — had not washed off and could be seen under the black lights at the party . As he knows about Danny and Liz 's relationship , Jack later uses a black light on Liz to reveal body paint all over her — transferred from Danny — revealing to her that he knows about their relationship .

Simultaneously , Liz urges Jenna to come clean about her real age to the TGS staff , but Jenna balks at the idea . Liz tells Jenna if she tells everyone her real age , she will reveal her " friend Tom ... Tom Selleck " her mustache , to which Jenna agrees . Later , Liz walks by the staff with the mustache in her face . Jenna thanks Liz for this , and as a result , Jenna accepts the role of the mother on Gossip Girl . 
 Knowing that Liz will not break off with Danny , Jack tells Danny he knows about the two . He lies to Danny by telling him he cares for Liz , hoping that Danny will end it with Liz , which he does . After Sue returns from a night of partying , Tracy tells her that all he wanted to do was to be a father figure to her .

 " Black Light Attack ! " was written by Steve Hely and directed by series producer Don Scardino . This was Hely 's first writing credit and Scardino 's twenty @-@ third episode directed . It originally aired in the United States on January 14 , 2010 , on NBC as the tenth episode of the show 's fourth season and the 68th overall episode of the series . 
 " Black Light Attack ! " was filmed on November 9 and November 13 , 2009 . In the scene in which Jenna plays the dying mother on Gossip Girl , the scenery is that used for the Waldorf residence in Gossip Girl . The two series are shot next to each other at Silvercup Studios in Queens , New York . In September 2008 , it was reported that actresses Blake Lively and Leighton Meester , who star on Gossip Girl , were set to guest star on 30 Rock , but the appearances fell through . 
 Dr. Sanjay Gupta guest starred as himself in " Black Light Attack ! " ; Liz is at home and watches Dr. Gupta on CNN as he expounds about the rise in female libido before menopause , referred to as the " Dirty 30s " . This was actor Cheyenne Jackson 's third appearance as Danny on 30 Rock . He made his debut in the November 12 , 2009 , episode " The Problem Solvers " , and would later guest star on " Secret Santa " . Series ' creator , executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees , the latter that starred Jane Krakowski , who plays Jenna on the show . According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview , Fey set up a meeting to interest him in a role on the program . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson to the attention of the 30 Rock producers . While at the Knicks game , Danny reveals details to Jack , about the woman he is seeing , such as " She never takes off her shoes ... Even though the reason is she 's never let a man see her feet " , which is a real life trait of Fey 's and her character .

" Nick Catucci for New York magazine enjoyed the episode , particularly Jenna 's line " Would a mother be going on a sex tour of Vietnam ? " , after telling Liz about her booked role as a mother on Gossip Girl , as a " classic Jenna line , more absurd than hilarious " , and that the character 's rendition of " Forever Young " was a highlight . Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger opined that this episode " made the best use yet of Cheyenne Jackson 's Danny " , and that he for once enjoyed " Jenna 's narcissism and self @-@ delusion " subplot , and her " late attempt " to seem young . Bob Sassone of AOL 's TV Squad enjoyed " Black Light Attack ! " , though , his only complain was that 30 Rock did not focus more on the fictional show TGS , and said he would " like to get back to more of that . " Entertainment Weekly ’ s Margaret Lyons remarked that this episode and " Klaus and Greta " were terrific , and what stood out from both airings " was how much serialized plot [ s ] these two eps covered ... For a show that 's usually so episodic , it was an interesting — totally successful — change of pace . " 
 = Battle of San Lorenzo = 
 The Battle of San Lorenzo was fought on February 3 , 1813 in San Lorenzo , Argentina , then part of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata . A Spanish Royalist force under the command of Antonio Zabala was defeated by the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers , under the command of José de San Martín . This battle was the baptism of fire for this military unit , and for San Martín in the Spanish American wars of independence . 
 Montevideo , a royalist stronghold during the Argentine War of Independence , was under siege by José Gervasio Artigas . Those in the city raided population centres along the nearby rivers for supplies . José de San Martín , who shortly before had arrived in Buenos Aires and formed the regiment , followed the royalist ships to San Lorenzo . The area around San Lorenzo formed a large empty plain , so the regiment hid inside the San Carlos convent during the night and San Martín studied the battlefield and the enemy ships from the tower . The battle started at dawn , when the grenadiers made a surprise pincer movement to trap the enemy forces . One column was led by San Martín , and the other by Justo Germán Bermúdez . San Martín fell from his horse , and was nearly killed , but Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved him . The royalists were defeated , but continued to raid villages for some more time afterwards . 
 This battle was the only one that San Martín fought on the modern territory of Argentina . The city of San Lorenzo keeps historic memorials of the battle and it is referenced in the San Lorenzo march . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Although Buenos Aires had suffered a difficult period in its war for independence , its prospects were improving by 1812 . Even though the defeats of Manuel Belgrano during the Paraguay campaign and Juan José Castelli in the first Upper Peru campaign had generated a political crisis , Belgrano 's victory at Tucuman had given new fresh hope to the revolution , which would be strengthened shortly afterwards with the victory at the Battle of Salta . Montevideo , capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata since the May Revolution , was under siege by both an army from Buenos Aires led by José Rondeau and an Uruguayan one led by José Gervasio Artigas . The city , however , maintained its naval supremacy over Buenos Aires and their ships raided the coasts of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers to gather supplies , despite the siege . Montevideo organized a navy to destroy the gun batteries at Rosario and Diamante , two population centers along the Parana , but were prevented from doing so as Buenos Aires dismantled them knowing that they could not defend them . 
 The Royalist expeditionary navy that would raid San Lorenzo comprised eleven ships of varying sizes , two hundred and fifty soldiers and fifty sailors . They moved into the Paraná through its tributary , the Paraná <unk> River , slowed down by headwinds . The Second Triumvirate promoted José de San Martín to colonel and instructed him to follow them with the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and stop the raids . San Martín was influenced by Napoleonic warfare and trained the regiment with the most recent military techniques used in the Napoleonic Wars . 
 San Martín moved the regiment from Retiro to Rosario , nearing the river at San Pedro and San Nicolás . He was following the Spanish ships and moved at night to avoid detection . San Martín had one hundred and twenty men for this action , reinforced at Rosario by a militia of seventy men under the command of <unk> Escalada . Those reinforcements included twenty two rifleman , thirty cavalry , a small cannon and men armed with knives . Escalada had made other actions against the royalists before this battle . San Martín discovered that the royalists intended to pillage the San Carlos Convent and pressed the march to arrive there first . A hundred royalists landed on San Lorenzo , but the only food available to them was some chickens and watermelons . Aware of the risk of pillage , the population had removed the cattle from the area before the royalists arrived . Escalada arrived in San Lorenzo before the bulk of the patriot army , but the dust trail from the path to Rosario revealed their presence . Escalada attacked them but their ship had a longer range than his cannon , keeping him at bay . He was forced to retire when he found a Paraguayan prisoner who had escaped from the ship . The Paraguayan disclosed the size of the royalist army and their plan of attacking the convent with a larger force , suspecting that the local money was kept in it . They did not attack the convent right away , requiring time to prepare the two field cannons . Escalada returned with San Martin and relayed the news . The march from Retiro to the convent took only five days , thanks to the cadet Ángel Pacheco . Pacheco moved ahead of the regiment and prepared horses in advance at the relay positions . The whole army arrived on scene during the night of 2 February and hid inside the convent . They entered through the rear door and were not allowed to light fires or speak during the night . San Martín studied the enemy and the battlefield from the convent 's tower , using a monocular . 
 = = Battlefield = = 
 The battle was fought at the location of the modern city of San Lorenzo , Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River , at the point of its widest flow . The west bank of the river was tall and steep , forming a natural obstacle , and ships could only land troops and materials on that side of the river using man @-@ made paths cut into the side . The battlefield was near one of these paths , shaped like a ladder , after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes . The San Carlos Convent , the main nearby building , was a short distance away from the river . 
 The location was not an easy place to defend without artillery , as the plains made surprise attacks difficult . Except for the convent itself , the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit . Nevertheless , the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres , and the distance between the church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge . The royalists , on the other hand , could support their troops with their ships from the river . Without a supporting navy , or local batteries , San Martín had no means to attack the ships . Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships , it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them . San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night , when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The grenadiers left the convent at dawn , preparing their formations behind the convent . San Martín returned to the tower to watch the enemy who disembarked at sunrise , 5 : 30 in the morning . He mounted his horse , gave a short harangue to the troops , and headed to battle . His strategy was to divide his cavalry forces into two columns , of nearly sixty horsemen each , and make a surprise pincer movement to trap the enemy forces . The cavalry would not use their guns , relying instead on saber and spear attacks . The right @-@ hand column was headed by Justo German Bermúdez , and the left @-@ hand one by San Martín . The royalists marched in two columns with the two cannons , a deployed flag and military drummers . The clarion of the regiment of mounted grenadiers sounded for the first time , marking the beginning of the battle . 
 San Martín 's column was the first one to reach the enemy . The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists , but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and , unable to form a square , had to retreat . The advantage of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the amount of soldiers . When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed , retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships . Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse . 
 San Martín did not mention Escalada in his first battle report , leading initial historians to infer that they stayed within the convent during the battle . However it is currently considered that they took part in the battle , as suggested by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent . 
 The combat took around fifteen minutes and left forty royalists dead and many injured , including Zabala . Fourteen patriot grenadiers died in the combat and two more would die afterwards due to combat injuries . Manuel Díaz Vélez fell from his horse in the gully , was mortally injured and captured by the royalists . Bermúdez was shot in the patella and died a few days later . Hipólito Bouchard captured the Spanish flag after killing the standard bearer . 
 = = = Cabral 's intervention = = = 
 Despite the victory , the remaining royalist forces could not be pursued as the column led by Justo Bermúdez had moved further than calculated for . This delayed the meeting with San Martín 's column whose horse was killed by enemy fire , leaving with his leg trapped under the corpse of the animal . These factors led to the columns not meeting up and allowed many royalists to escape . A royalist , probably Zabala himself , attempted to kill San Martín while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury to his face , and a bullet wound to his arm . Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved San Martín 's life . Cabral was mortally wounded during the rescue and San Martín reported that after Cabral was hit he said " I die happy , we have defeated the enemy " . The exact moment this was said is unclear as the word " after " could have meant immediately after ; during the ongoing battle ; or some hours later during Cabral 's agonising decline . San Martín wrote the battle report under a nearby tree . Fray Herminio Gaitán considers that Cabral 's last words would have been in the Guaraní language , his first language , and that as San Martín also spoke Guaraní he would have translated them for the battle report . 
 Juan Bautista Cabral is commonly known as " Sergeant Cabral " , but he was a private at the time of the battle . San Martín 's report mentions him as " the grenadier Juan B. Cabral " , and historians like Bartolomé Mitre , Herminio Gaitán , Gerardo Bra or Norberto Galasso support the idea . Mitre considers that Cabral was promoted posthumously , but there are no documents confirming that . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Even though the battle of San Lorenzo is acknowledged in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence , it had little military influence in the conflict . Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it , as the size of the forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence . This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18 , 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22 . William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year . 
 San Martín did not take hostages or ask for ransoms , but rather he instructed his people to avoid further conflicts and to try to restore peaceful relations with the royalists . Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers , which San Martín provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast , which he accepted . San Martín was aware that the new enlightened ideas at stake in the Napoleonic Wars influenced many of the Spanish military , and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend . He succeeded , as Zabala joined the patriot forces under San Martín 's command during his administration in Mendoza . 
 José Gervasio Artigas , leader of the popular resistance at the Banda Oriental , sent an agent to San Lorenzo to congratulate San Martín for his victory . San Martín also met with John Parish Robertson , who informed Britain about the battle . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 There are many Argentine memorials and places named after the battle , including three cities in Greater Rosario : Puerto General San Martín , Capitán Bermúdez and <unk> Baigorria are named after José de San Martín , Justo Germán Bermúdez and Juan Bautista Baigorria respectively , all of whom were involved in the battle . The <unk> Cabral Department at the Chaco Province is named after Juan Bautista Cabral , even though he was not a sergeant as described . The most popular homage to the battle is the name of the football club San Lorenzo de Almagro , named after both the battle and Saint Lawrence . 
 The city of San Lorenzo preserves the site of the battle and a dedicated historic complex . The San Carlos Convent is still a working convent , but has turned part of its buildings into a museum . It has retained San Martín 's cell , the room used for medical treatment of the injured soldiers , urns of the dead soldiers and other related items to the " March of San Lorenzo " as well as the history of the convent . The mayor of San Lorenzo , made an agreement with the Argentine Armed Forces in 2008 that the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers would have a permanent presence at the site . 
 The battlefield is known as the " Field of Glory " , and it was turned into a park on May 20 , 1913 , by president Roque Sáenz Peña . There is a monument with two symbolic wings of victory , an eternal flame and nine memorials for the 16 patriot soldiers who died in the battle . The memorials are for the nine origins of those soldiers : the Argentine provinces of Corrientes , Santiago del Estero , La Rioja , Córdoba , San Luis and Buenos Aires , as well as Chile , France and Uruguay . Although Uruguay did not exist at the time of the battle , the Banda Oriental province is considered a predecessor of modern Uruguay . 
 The pine tree ( Pinus pinea ) where San Martin wrote the battle report is known as the " Historic Pine " , and has an estimated age of more than two hundred years . The convent , the battlefield and the Historic Pine were declared National Historic Monuments of Argentina on October 2 , 1940 by law 12 @.@ 648 . The Historic Pine was declared a " Historic Tree " in 1946 by decree 3 @.@ 038 .

 The battle of San Lorenzo is the theme of the San Lorenzo march . The military march was composed in February 1901 by Cayetano Alberto Silva following a proposal from Representative Celestino Pera . It was first officially played on October 30 , 1902 at the inauguration of the monument to General San Martín in Rosario . The lyrics were written by professor Carlos <unk> in 1908 . The march became famous in other countries and , according to the Argentine British Community Council , it has been considered in Europe to be one of the five best military marches ever written . The military bands of Uruguay , Brazil and Poland , amongst others , include it in their musical repertory . 
 The battle of San Lorenzo was also mentioned as an Argentine victory in the first Argentine National Anthem , along with the battles of San José , Suipacha , Las Piedras , Salta and Tucumán . There is also a brief reference to the battle in the march Mi <unk> ( " My flag " ) , which is about the flag of Argentina . However , this march includes a historic inaccuracy . It says " Here is the flag that one day triumphantly rose in the middle of the battle and , full of pride and gallantry , went <unk> to San Lorenzo " . This is incorrect as the current flag of Argentina was not widely used until 1814 or 1815 . The Battle of Salta was the only conflict of the Argentine War of Independence fought in current Argentine territory under the modern flag of Argentina . The San Martín National Institute states , by oral tradition , that the grenadiers of San Lorenzo did not use any flag for the operation . 
 = Ronnie Lee Gardner = 
 Ronnie Lee Gardner ( January 16 , 1961 – June 18 , 2010 ) was an American criminal who received the death penalty for murder in 1985 , and was executed by a firing squad by the state of Utah in 2010 . Gardner 's case spent nearly 25 years in the court system , prompting the Utah House of Representatives to introduce legislation to limit the number of appeals in capital cases . 
 In October 1984 , Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom during a robbery in Salt Lake City . While being moved in April 1985 to a court hearing for the homicide , he fatally shot attorney Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt . Convicted of two counts of murder , Gardner was sentenced to life imprisonment for the first count and received the death penalty for the second . The state adopted more stringent security measures as a result of the incident at the courthouse . While held at Utah State Prison , Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994 . However , that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim survived . 
 In a series of appeals , defense attorneys presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner , who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration . His request for commutation of his death sentence was denied in 2010 after the families of his victims testified against him . Gardner 's legal team took the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , which declined to intervene . 
 The execution of Gardner at Utah State Prison became the focus of media attention in June 2010 , because it was the first to be carried out by firing squad in the United States in 14 years . Gardner stated that he sought this method of execution because of his Mormon background . On the day before his execution , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints released a statement clarifying its position on the issue of blood atonement of individuals . The case also attracted debate over capital punishment and whether Gardner had been destined for a life of violence since his difficult childhood . 
 = = Personal background = = 
 Ronnie Lee Gardner was born in Salt Lake City , Utah , and was the youngest of Dan and Ruth Gardner 's seven children . Dan was a heavy drinker who left the household to start another family while Ronnie was a toddler ; Dan and Ruth divorced when Ronnie was 18 months old . Six months later , Ronnie was found malnourished and wandering the streets alone in a diaper . Child welfare workers filed a " failure to care " petition and took him into custody , though later returned him to his mother . Gardner 's relationship with his father was tumultuous ; Dan did not believe he was Gardner 's biological father and frequently told his son of his belief . According to Gardner , he was raised by an older sister , and was sexually abused by his siblings . Sometimes he and his sister Bonnie would run away and seek refuge in a " hobo camp . " By the age of 10 , Gardner was addicted to drugs and permitted access to alcohol . He and his brother Randy were arrested for stealing cowboy boots and taken into juvenile detention . Gardner recalled with distress that his father Dan came to take his brother Randy home and left him behind . 
 = = = Early institutionalization = = = 
 Gardner 's mother married Bill Lucas , who had been incarcerated in Wyoming in 1968 . The Gardner @-@ Lucas family eventually had nine children . Gardner admired Lucas , who used his stepsons as lookouts while <unk> homes . By his early teens , Gardner had been held in detention at a series of institutions , including an involuntary commitment at Utah State Hospital in Provo . Gardner was small as a boy , and described that he had to fight to defend himself and earn respect . As Gardner admitted , " I was a nasty little bugger . " 
 While held at Utah State Industrial School in Ogden , Gardner was visited by Jack Statt , a man who was living with his brother Randy . According to Gardner , Statt met Randy at a bus stop and paid him $ 25 for oral sex . When released from the school in 1975 , Gardner stayed with Statt . Although social workers noted the men in the household were dressed like women , Statt officially became a foster parent to Gardner and his brother . Gardner said that Statt performed sex acts on them and explained , " I thought life like that was normal . " Gardner stated in a psychological evaluation that he worked as a prostitute while living with Statt , who psychologists say fit the pedophile profile . Gardner said his time in foster care was the most stable period of his life — " Jack was a good man , and he tried to help us out . " 
 While Gardner intermittently continued to go to the industrial school , he met Debra Bischoff at a Salt Lake City apartment complex where his mother lived . Bischoff described him as : " Very caring . He never put me in the rough situations he was in throughout his life . He sheltered me from that stuff . " Gardner had a daughter in May 1977 and a son in February 1980 with Bischoff , but was convicted of robbery and sent to Utah State Prison in the same month his son was born . Gardner successfully escaped the prison 's maximum security unit on April 19 , 1981 , and was shot in the neck while attempting to kill a man who he believed had raped Bischoff . In February 1983 , he was identified as a ringleader in a disturbance in which inmates barricaded a cell block and started fires . 
 On August 6 , 1984 , Gardner escaped from custody at the University of Utah Hospital after faking an illness by vomiting . He attacked transportation officer Don Leavitt and forced him to unlock his shackles by telling him : " I guess you know if that doctor comes back , I 'll have to kill you both . " In the course of the escape , Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face . Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back . On August 11 , a letter carrier found Leavitt 's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said , " Here 's the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital . I don 't want to hurt no one else . I just want to be free . " 
 = = Murders = = 
 During the night of October 9 , 1984 , Gardner robbed the Cheers Tavern in Salt Lake City . While under the influence of cocaine , he shot bartender Melvyn John Otterstrom in the face , killing him . Otterstrom 's cousin Craig Watson stated that the robbery " gained less than $ 100 . " Family members said Gardner attended Otterstrom 's funeral and pretended to be a childhood friend . Following a tip , police apprehended Gardner three weeks later at the home of his cousin . Gardner said that the shooting occurred because Otterstrom put up a fight , but investigators did not find any evidence to support this claim . Gardner was held in custody in lieu of $ 1 @.@ 5 million bail . His getaway driver was identified as Darcy Perry McCoy , who testified against him . 
 During trial proceedings for the Otterstrom murder on April 2 , 1985 , Gardner attempted to escape from custody with a revolver smuggled into the Metropolitan Hall of Justice at Salt Lake City . Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department believed that the gun was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the courthouse from the underground parking lot . Gardner was immediately shot in the chest by guard Luther Hensley . Gardner then wounded unarmed bailiff George " Nick " Kirk in the abdomen . After running to the courtroom archives , Gardner confronted attorneys Robert Macri and Michael Burdell . According to Macri , after Gardner pointed the gun at him , he changed aim to Burdell , who had been doing pro bono work for his church . Burdell yelled , " Oh , my God , " when Gardner shot him in the eye . Gardner made his way outside the building , where he was surrounded by dozens of police officers . Gardner threw the gun away , dropped and yelled : " Don ’ t shoot , I don ’ t have a gun . " 
 Gardner was taken to the University of Utah Health Services Center where he was listed in serious condition , but recovered . Burdell died about 45 minutes later while in surgery at Holy Cross Hospital . Kirk survived surgery and was listed in critical condition at LDS Hospital . During a search of the courthouse , a bag of men 's clothing was found in the basement under a women 's restroom sink . Prosecutor Bob Stott believed Gardner 's gun had been taped to a water fountain on the first floor . Darcy Perry McCoy was found unarmed and was arrested about a mile away . Her sister , <unk> Jolley Hainsworth , was sentenced to eight years in prison for delivering the clothes and messages in preparation for the escape attempt , but the identity of the person who provided Gardner with the firearm was not known at the time . State corrections director William Vickrey cleared the actions of the prison guards who escorted Gardner , but Salt Lake County Sheriff N.D. " Pete " Hayward said that the guard who shot Gardner should have kept shooting until Gardner was dead . A review found that the guards were inhibited from shooting because Gardner had been using a hostage as a human shield . Sheriff Hayward said the escape attempt " appeared to be well @-@ planned " and blamed the security breach on the layout of the Metropolitan Hall of Justice , which allowed unrestricted access to areas where prisoners were transported . 
 Otterstrom , a mountain climber and veteran of the 19th Special Forces Group of the Utah National Guard , was survived by his wife Kathy and his five @-@ year @-@ old son , Jason . Burdell – a Vietnam veteran , former engineer , and member of the Summum Church – was survived by his girlfriend , Donna Nu , who would go on to advocate against Gardner 's execution . 
 = = Sentencing and incarceration = = 
 Gardner was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder . In June 1985 , Gardner pleaded guilty to the murder of Otterstrom and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole . At one point , Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a leg brace that would lock if he attempted to escape again . He was advised by guards that it would be to his benefit to behave in front of prospective jurors . District Judge Jay E. Banks instructed the jury , on October 22 , 1985 , that they had the option of a verdict for the lesser offense of manslaughter if they found Gardner to be under mental or emotional duress when he shot Burdell . The jurors deliberated less than three hours and found Gardner guilty of capital murder . Ultimately sentenced to death , Gardner selected execution by firing squad over lethal injection . Legislators in Utah had eliminated the firing squad as a method of execution in 2004 , but convicts who were sentenced before that date , such as Gardner , could still select that option . Since 1976 , only two other people have been executed by firing squad in the United States , both in Utah : Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor . In contrast to Taylor , who said he chose the firing squad to embarrass the state , Gardner 's attorney said that his client did not want to attract attention and simply preferred to die this way . 
 I 'd prefer to die of old age , your honor , but if that ain 't possible , I 'll take the firing squad . 
 Gardner 's incarceration as Utah 's then @-@ youngest inmate on death row was not uneventful . A hearing was held on February 19 , 1987 , in which Gardner and other inmates claimed " unconstitutional confinement " in unsanitary conditions with poor food . On October 28 , 1987 , Gardner broke a glass partition in a prison visiting area and had sex with a woman who was meeting him , while other inmates cheered and barricaded the doors . According to state prison spokesperson Juan Benavidez , though Gardner had " knocked out the lights " , an officer who was in the control room " could still see what was going on . " Gardner claimed breaking the glass was an accident . In 1993 , Utah state representative Dan Tuttle introduced what he called " the Ronnie Lee Gardner bill " in which he proposed that law enforcement officers be permitted to shoot inmates attempting to escape , whether they are " armed or not . " 
 On September 25 , 1994 , Gardner got drunk from consuming alcohol , which he fermented in his own prison cell sink , and stabbed inmate Richard " Fats " Thomas with a shiv fashioned from a pair of sunglasses . Thomas suffered nine puncture wounds to his face , mouth , arm and chest that were life @-@ threatening , but made a full recovery . Though Thomas had survived the stabbing , Gardner was charged with another capital crime under a 1974 Utah law reserved for prison attacks by first @-@ degree felony inmates . There was no precedent in the United States for a death penalty that was carried out for such a crime . The constitutionality of the law was challenged , with defense lawyers calling it " stale and anachronistic , " and the charge against Gardner was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim did not die . 
 In February 1996 , Gardner threatened to sue to force the state of Utah to execute him by firing squad . He had told a judge in a 1991 hearing that he was motivated by his children to seek lethal injection , but later changed his mind as they became older . He said that he preferred the firing squad because of his " Mormon heritage . " Gardner also felt that lawmakers were trying to eliminate the firing squad , in opposition to popular opinion in Utah , because of concern over the state 's image in the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympics . 
 I like the firing squad . It 's so much easier ... and there 's no mistakes . 
 In 1998 , the old Metropolitan Hall of Justice was vacated and replaced by the multimillion @-@ dollar Scott M. Matheson Courthouse . Gardner 's deadly escape attempt in 1985 was blamed on the open access and light security of the previous building and greatly influenced the tighter security measures adopted by Salt Lake City 's new courthouse . Former prosecutor Kent Morgan stated , " Absolutely Gardner changed that . " On March 3 , 2001 , the Metropolitan Hall of Justice was demolished .

 In 2007 , U.S. federal judge Tena Campbell rejected Gardner 's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate because they were unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim . The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8 , 2010 . Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times , but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time . State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence . 
 At Gardner 's commutation hearing on June 10 , 2010 , lawyers and medical experts in his defense argued whether meningitis contracted at the age of 4 had damaged his brain . Gardner had also <unk> gas and glue with his siblings , and played with mercury stolen from gas meters by his stepfather to sell . Three of the jurors that sentenced Gardner to death signed an affidavit that they would have recommended life without parole , an option that was not available in Utah until 1992 . Gardner claimed that he was a changed man who counseled other inmates and was interested in starting an organic farm project for youths on 160 acres ( 65 ha ) in Box Elder County , Utah . Gardner 's attorney presented a letter his client wrote to Oprah Winfrey requesting funds for the project . Gardner also argued that it was not justifiable to execute him after so much time had passed since the crime . 
 I can do a lot of good . First of all , I 'm a good example . There 's no better example in this state of what not to do . 
 Assistant state attorney general Tom Brunker argued against clemency , stating : " Mr. Gardner was sentenced to death and earned that death penalty because of his unflagging history of violent crime . " The family of the late George " Nick " Kirk recounted how his being shot by Gardner affected their lives and ultimately shortened Kirk 's life . Kirk 's daughter Barb Webb said , " He 's done a lot of horrific things in his past and I think , given the chance , he would do them all again . " Jason Otterstrom , whose father Melvyn was murdered by Gardner , struggled to describe the impact upon his family . After listening to the testimony from the families of the victims , the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole declined Gardner 's commutation request , stating that the jury 's verdict and sentence were " not inappropriate . " The board members cited his violent record during incarceration and questioned his effort to reform as being " too little , too late . " Gardner revealed at the hearing that it was Darcy Perry McCoy who provided him the gun with which he murdered Michael Burdell . Deputy Salt Lake County attorney Bob Stott said that McCoy would not be prosecuted because Gardner , the only witness , was going to be executed . 
 I feel really sorry for him ; I do feel sorry . But he made that choice . 
 The Utah Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings on June 14 , 2010 , exhausting Gardner 's appeals within the state . The U.S. Supreme Court turned down final appeals on June 17 , though a court order indicated that dissenting Justices Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens would have granted a stay of execution . Utah governor Gary Herbert also declined to intervene because Gardner had " a full and fair opportunity " in court . State attorney general Mark Shurtleff announced on Twitter that he signed off on the execution : " I just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner 's execution . " 
 = = = Death penalty debate = = = 
 Opponents of capital punishment gathered at the Utah State Capitol to hold a rally during the final appeals . The protest was attended by Gardner 's family , and was organized by <unk> for Alternatives to the Death Penalty . The protest also included the support of Brian King of the Utah House of Representatives , who pledged to urge the legislature to reconsider the use of the capital punishment . The family of murder victim Michael Burdell had also appealed on Gardner 's behalf , stating that Burdell was a pacifist who would have opposed the death penalty . 
 News media arrived from around the world and raised the issue of blood atonement because of Gardner 's citation of his Mormon roots in selecting the firing squad . Some followers of Mormonism were taught that murder is so heinous that the blood of the offender must be spilled to pay for their sins . On the day before Gardner 's execution , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints released the following statement : 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , when rhetorical , emotional oratory was common , some church members and leaders used strong language that included notions of people making restitution for their sins by giving up their own lives . 
 However , so @-@ called " blood atonement , " by which individuals would be required to shed their own blood to pay for their sins , is not a doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints . We believe in and teach the infinite and all @-@ encompassing atonement of Jesus Christ , which makes forgiveness of sin and salvation possible for all people . 
 Other denominations voiced their opposition to the use of capital punishment . Reverend David Henry of the First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City said , " Violence breeds violence ... . It doesn 't work . It 's ineffective , and it 's brutalizing all of us . " Cardinal Keith O 'Brien of the Roman Catholic Church later used Gardner 's cases to describe the " culture of vengeance " in the United States . 
 According to polls , support for capital punishment had been steadily declining since the 1990s , but the majority of people in Utah still supported the death penalty in the period leading up to Gardner 's scheduled execution . In 2010 , Kay <unk> of the Utah House of Representatives sponsored legislation to require condemned inmates to raise all appeal arguments in their first post @-@ conviction petition , noting that Gardner 's multiple appeals kept his case lingering on death row for nearly 25 years . The bill , <unk> , passed the Utah House by a margin of 67 @-@ to @-@ 5 on February 1 , 2011 , and unanimously passed the Utah State Senate on February 17 . If the legislation is signed into law by the governor , subsequent appeals would require the introduction of new evidence to first be submitted before a judge to determine whether it would affect the case .

 The Utah Department of Corrections provided Gardner 's attorney , Andrew Parnes , with documentation about executions by firing squad and lethal injection . The records included the Utah execution team 's training and expertise . Parnes relayed the information to Gardner after agreeing not to disclose it to anyone else . 
 On June 15 , 2010 , Gardner ate a last meal of steak , lobster tail , apple pie , vanilla ice cream and 7 @-@ Up , before beginning a 48 @-@ hour fast while watching The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and reading Divine Justice . According to his lawyers , the fast was motivated by " spiritual reasons . " Gardner was visited by an LDS bishop and his family before his execution . Gardner walked voluntarily to his place of execution . When asked if he had any last words , he responded , " I do not , no . " 
 Gardner was executed on June 18 , 2010 , at 12 : 15 am Mountain Daylight Time by a firing squad at Utah State Prison in Draper . He was placed in restraints on a black metal chair with a hood covering his head . Sandbags were arranged around him to absorb ricochets . The firing squad was made up of five anonymous volunteers who were certified police officers . The officers stood about 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) from Gardner , aiming at a white target positioned over his heart . One of their .30 @-@ caliber Winchester rifles was selected at random and loaded with a non @-@ lethal wax bullet so that they would not know with certainty who fired the fatal shots . According to the Utah Department of Corrections , the squad used a countdown cadence beginning with five and simultaneously firing right before two . His dark blue jumpsuit made it difficult to see the blood from his wounds . A medical examiner removed Gardner 's hood to reveal his lifeless face . After verifying Gardner 's lack of pulse at the neck and pupillary light reflex , the medical examiner pronounced him dead at 12 : 17 am . He was the first person to be executed by firing squad in the United States since the execution of John Albert Taylor 14 years earlier . A commemorative coin was commissioned for prison staff who participated in the execution . Gardner 's friends and family gathered outside the prison at a candlelight vigil while playing " Free Bird " by Lynyrd Skynyrd . They did not witness his execution , per his request . Some wore shirts with his prisoner number <unk> . His body was cremated and released to his daughter to be taken back to Idaho with family members . 
 Ultimately , his children and grandchildren got their chance to express their love for him . I 'm not sure Ronnie had a lot of love in his life . At least in the end there , he got that . 
 = Ringo Starr = 
 Richard Starkey , MBE ( born 7 July 1940 ) , known professionally as Ringo Starr , is an English musician , singer , songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles . He occasionally sang lead vocals , usually for one song on an album , including " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Yellow Submarine " and their cover of " Act Naturally " . He also wrote the Beatles ' songs " Don 't Pass Me By " and " Octopus 's Garden " , and is credited as a co @-@ writer of others , including " What Goes On " and " Flying " . 
 Starr was twice afflicted by life @-@ threatening illnesses during childhood , and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations fell behind in school . In 1955 , he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer . Soon afterwards , he became interested in the UK skiffle craze , developing a fervent admiration for the genre . In 1957 , he cofounded his first band , the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group , which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958 . 
 When the Beatles formed in 1960 , Starr was a member of another Liverpool group , Rory Storm and the Hurricanes . After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg , he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962 , replacing Pete Best . Starr played key roles in the Beatles ' films and appeared in numerous others . After the band 's break @-@ up in 1970 , he released several successful singles including the US number four hit " It Don 't Come Easy " , and number ones " Photograph " and " You 're Sixteen " . In 1972 , he released his most successful UK single , " Back Off Boogaloo " , which peaked at number two . He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo , which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US . He has been featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows . He also narrated the first two series of the children 's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed " Mr Conductor " during the first season of the PBS children 's television series Shining Time Station . Since 1989 , he has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All @-@ Starr Band . 
 Starr 's creative contribution to music has received praise from drummers such as Phil Collins , who described him as " a great musician " , and Steve Smith , who commented : " Before Ringo , drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity . Ringo 's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song . " He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1998 . In 2011 , Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth @-@ greatest drummer of all time . Starr , who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988 , was inducted for his solo career in 2015 , making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once . 
 = = 1940 – 56 : Early life = = 
 Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940 , at 9 <unk> Street , in Dingle , Liverpool . He is the only child of confectioners Elsie ( née Gleave ) and Richard Starkey . Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing , a hobby that she shared with her husband , an avid fan of swing . Prior to the birth of their son , whom they nicknamed " Ritchie " , the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit , but soon after his birth their regular outings ended . Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation . Subsequently , " Big Ritchie " , as Starkey 's father became known , lost interest in his family , choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs , sometimes for several consecutive days . 
 In 1944 , in an effort to reduce their housing costs , his family moved to another neighbourhood in the Dingle , 10 Admiral Grove ; soon afterwards , his parents separated , and they divorced within the year . Starkey later stated that he has " no real memories " of his father , who made little effort to bond with him , visiting as few as three times thereafter . Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex @-@ husband 's support payments of thirty shillings a week , so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a local barmaid , an occupation that she held for twelve years . 
 At age six Starkey developed appendicitis . Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis , causing him to fall into a coma that lasted for days . His recovery spanned twelve months , which he spent away from his family at Liverpool 's Myrtle Street children 's hospital . Upon his discharge in May 1948 , his mother allowed him to stay home , causing him to miss school . At age eight , he remained illiterate , with a poor grasp of mathematics . His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school , which resulted in him regularly playing truant at Sefton Park . After several years of twice @-@ weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour , Marie Maguire Crawford , Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically , but in 1953 , he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium , where he remained for two years . During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band , leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument : a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed . Soon afterwards , he grew increasingly interested in drumming , receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song " Bedtime for Drums " as a convalescence gift from Crawford . Starkey commented : " I was in the hospital band ... That 's where I really started playing . I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo , but I didn 't want them . My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing . Only the drums . " 
 Starkey attended St Silas , a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him " Lazarus " , and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school , where he showed an aptitude for art and drama , as well as practical subjects including mechanics . As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations , he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11 @-@ plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school . On 17 April 1953 , Starkey 's mother married Harry Graves , an ex @-@ Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage . Graves , an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists , introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore , Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels . Graves stated that he and " Ritchie " never had an unpleasant exchange between them ; Starkey later commented : " He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry . " After the extended hospital stay following Starkey 's recovery from tuberculosis , he did not return to school , preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks . 
 Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey 's upbringing as " a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune " . Houses in the area were " poorly ventilated , postage @-@ stamp @-@ sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls , with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse . " Crawford commented : " Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle , he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive . " The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park , escaping the soot @-@ filled air of their coal @-@ fuelled neighbourhood . Adding to their difficult circumstances , violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner @-@ city districts in Liverpool . Starkey later commented : " You kept your head down , your eyes open , and you didn 't get in anybody 's way . " 
 After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955 , Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline ; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful . In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes , he briefly held a railway worker 's job , which came with an employer @-@ issued suit . He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and , unable to pass the physical examination , he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits . He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales , but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job , not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work . In mid @-@ 1956 , Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer . While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford , and the two bonded over their shared interest in music . Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle , and he quickly became a fervent admirer . 
 = = 1957 – 61 : First bands = = 
 Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey 's interest in skiffle , the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant 's cellar during their lunch breaks . Trafford recalled : " I played a guitar , and [ Ritchie ] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes , he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys , or banged on the backs of chairs . " The pair were joined by Starkey 's neighbour and co @-@ worker , the guitarist Eddie Miles , forming the Eddie Miles Band , later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark . The band performed popular skiffle songs such as " Rock Island Line " and " Walking Cane " , with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard , creating primitive , driving rhythms . Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier , and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools . Though the lessons were short @-@ lived , they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town . 
 On Christmas Day 1957 , Graves gave Starkey a second @-@ hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum , bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from an old rubbish bin lid . Although basic and crude , the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band , who went on to book several prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK . 
 In November 1959 , Starkey joined Al Caldwell 's Texans , a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool 's best @-@ known skiffle acts to a full @-@ fledged rock and roll band . They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans , then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey . About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr ; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence . His drum solos were billed as Starr Time . 
 By early 1960 the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool 's leading bands . In May , they were offered a three @-@ month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales . Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five @-@ year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier , Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement . The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band , including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented : " The French don 't like the British ; at least I didn 't like them . " The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg , they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins . They eventually accepted , joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmider 's Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960 , where Starr first met the band . Storm 's Hurricanes were given top @-@ billing over the Beatles , who also received less pay . Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand @-@ in engagements while in Hamburg . On 15 October 1960 , he drummed with John Lennon , Paul McCartney and George Harrison , recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the George Gershwin aria " Summertime " . During Starr 's first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan , who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band . 
 = = 1962 – 70 : The Beatles = = 
 Starr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins . On 14 August , Lennon asked Starr to join the Beatles ; he accepted . On 16 August , Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer , Pete Best , who recalled : " He said ' I 've got some bad news for you . The boys want you out and Ringo in . ' He said [ Beatles producer ] George Martin wasn 't too pleased with my playing [ and ] the boys thought I didn 't fit in . " Starr first performed as a member of the band on 18 August 1962 , at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight . After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day , Best fans , upset by his firing , held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting " Pete forever ! Ringo never ! " Harrison received a black eye from one of the upset fans , and Epstein , whose car tyres they had flattened in anger , temporarily hired a bodyguard to ensure his safety . 
 Starr 's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962 . He stated that Martin had thought that he " was crazy and couldn 't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time , we were just a four piece band " . For their second recording session with Starr , which took place on 11 September 1962 , Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles ' first single , " Love Me Do " , backed with " P.S. I Love You " . Starr played tambourine on " Love Me Do " and maracas on " P.S. I Love You " . Concerned about his status in the Beatles , he thought : " That 's the end , they 're doing a Pete Best on me . " Martin later clarified : " I simply didn 't know what Ringo was like and I wasn 't prepared to take any risks . " 
 By November 1962 Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans , who were now calling for him to sing songs . Soon afterwards , he began receiving an amount of fan mail equal to that of the others , which helped to secure his position within the band . Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same " wavelength " as the other Beatles : " I had to be , or I wouldn 't have lasted . I had to join them as people [ sic ] as well as [ as ] a drummer . " He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney 's publishing company , Northern Songs , but he derived his primary income during this period from a one @-@ quarter share of Beatles Ltd , a corporation financed by the band 's net concert earnings . He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles : " I lived in nightclubs for three years . It used to be a non @-@ stop party . " Like his father Starr became well known for his late @-@ night dancing and he received considerable praise for his skills . 
 During 1963 , the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain . In January , their second single , " Please Please Me " , followed " Love Me Do " into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on Thank Your Lucky Stars earned them favourable reviews , leading to a boost in sales and radio play . By the end of the year , the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country , and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success , performing on The Ed Sullivan Show to a record 73 million viewers . Starr commented : " In the states I know I went over well . It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me . I 'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we 're ordinary lads . " He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time , including Penny Valentine 's " I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye " and Rolf Harris 's " Ringo for President " . In 1964 , " I love Ringo " lapel pins outsold all other Beatles merchandising . During live performances , the Beatles continued the Starr Time routine that had been popular among his fans : Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr 's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams . When the Beatles made their film debut in A Hard Day 's Night , Starr garnered much praise from critics , who considered both his delivery of deadpan one @-@ liners and his non @-@ speaking scenes highlights of the movie . The extended non @-@ speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr 's lack of sleep the previous night , Starr commented : " Because I 'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line . " Epstein attributed Starr 's acclaim to " the little man 's quaintness " . After the release of the Beatles ' second feature film , Help ! ( 1965 ) , Starr won a Melody Maker poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film . 
 During an interview with Playboy in 1964 , Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill ; Starr replied : " [ Best ] took little pills to make him ill " . Soon after Starr made the comment , a provoked Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted for four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best 's favour . In June , the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark , the Netherlands , Asia , Australia and New Zealand , but Starr became ill the day before the start of the tour . Stricken with a high @-@ grade fever , pharyngitis and tonsillitis , he was admitted to a local hospital where he briefly stayed followed by several days of recuperation at home . During this time , Starr was temporarily replaced for five concert dates by 24 @-@ year @-@ old session drummer Jimmie Nicol . Starr was discharged from the hospital , and he rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June . He later admitted that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness . In August , when the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan , Starr was the first to try a cannabis cigarette offered to the band by Dylan , whereas Lennon , McCartney and Harrison were hesitant . 
 On 11 February 1965 , Starr married Maureen Cox , whom he had first met in 1962 . By this time the stress and pressure that went along with Beatlemania had reached a peak for him . He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal , and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to provide protection from would @-@ be assassins . The constant pressure of the Beatles ' fame affected their live performances ; Starr commented : " We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it . " He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates , who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment ; during recording sessions he spent countless hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and roadie Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him . In a letter published in Melody Maker , a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more ; he replied : " [ I am ] quite happy with my one little track on each album " . 
 In August 1966 , the Beatles released Revolver , their seventh UK LP . The album included the song " Yellow Submarine " , which was the only British number one single with Starr as the lead singer . Later that month and owing to the increasing pressures of touring , the Beatles gave their final concert , a 30 @-@ minute performance at San Francisco 's Candlestick Park . Starr commented : " We gave up touring at the right time . Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone . " By December , he had moved into an upscale estate on three acres in Saint George 's Hill called Sunny Heights . Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items , including numerous televisions , light machines , film projectors and stereo equipment , a billiard table , go @-@ kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow , he did not include a drum kit , he explained : " When we don 't record , I don 't play " . 
 For the Beatles ' seminal 1967 album , Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon – McCartney composition " With a Little Help from My Friends " . Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper , the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr 's increased feeling of alienation within the band , he commented : " [ It ] wasn 't our best album . That was the peak for everyone else , but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play . " His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions ; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney , Lennon and Harrison . During his down @-@ time Starr worked on his guitar playing ; he commented : " I jump into chords that no one seems to get into . Most of the stuff I write is twelve @-@ bar " . 
 Epstein 's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management ; Starr remarked : " [ It was ] a strange time for us , when it 's someone who 've relied on in the business , where we never got involved . " Soon afterwards , the band began an ill @-@ fated film project , Magical Mystery Tour . Starr 's growing interest in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie 's Director of Photography , and his participation in the film 's editing was matched only by McCartney . 
 In February 1968 , Starr became the first Beatle to sing during another artist 's show without the other three present . He sang the Buck Owens hit " Act Naturally " , and performed a duet with Cilla Black , " Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit ? " on her BBC One television programme , Cilla . Later that year Apple Records released The Beatles , commonly known as the " White Album " . Creative inspiration for the double LP came in part from the band 's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh , India , they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods , composing most of the album 's songs there . Despite leaving after 10 days , Starr completed his first recorded Beatles song , " Don 't Pass Me By " , while in India . During the recording of the White Album , relations within the band became openly divisive . As the sessions progressed , their collective group dynamic began to decay ; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track . Starr had grown weary of McCartney 's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon 's passive @-@ aggressive behaviour , which was exacerbated by Starr 's resentment of Yoko Ono 's near @-@ constant presence . After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming , Starr quit the band for two weeks , taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers . During a lunch break the chef served octopus , which Starr refused to eat . A subsequent conversation with the ship 's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his Abbey Road composition , " Octopus 's Garden " , which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip . He returned to the studio two weeks later , to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome @-@ back gesture . 
 Despite a temporary return to congenial relations during the completion of the White Album , production of the Beatles ' fourth feature film , Let It Be , and its accompanying LP , strained the already tenuous cohesion within the band . On 20 August 1969 , the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for " I Want You " . Following a business meeting on 20 September , Lennon told the others that he had quit the Beatles .

 On 10 April 1970 , McCartney publicly announced that he had quit the Beatles . Shortly before this , he and Starr fell out due to McCartney 's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr 's debut , Sentimental Journey , and the Beatles ' Let It Be . Starr 's album – composed of renditions of pre @-@ rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones , Maurice Gibb , George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US . Starr followed Sentimental Journey with the country @-@ inspired Beaucoups of Blues , engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake . Despite receiving some favourable reviews , the album failed to meet with commercial success . Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor . 
 Starr played drums on Lennon 's John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band ( 1970 ) , Ono 's Yoko Ono / Plastic Ono Band ( 1970 ) , and on Harrison 's albums All Things Must Pass ( 1970 ) , Living in the Material World ( 1973 ) and Dark Horse ( 1974 ) . In 1971 , Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh , organised by Harrison , and with him co @-@ wrote the hit single " It Don 't Come Easy " , which reached number four in both the US and the UK . The following year he released his most successful UK hit , " Back Off Boogaloo " ( again produced and co @-@ written by Harrison ) , which peaked at number two ( US number nine ) . Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan , Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary Born to Boogie . 
 In 1973 , Starr earned two number one hits in the US : " Photograph " , a UK number eight hit that he co @-@ wrote with Harrison , and " You 're Sixteen " , written by the Sherman Brothers . Starr 's third million @-@ selling single , " You 're Sixteen " was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four in the charts . Both songs appeared on Starr 's debut rock album , Ringo , which was produced by Richard Perry and featured writing and musical contributions from Lennon and McCartney , as well as Harrison . A commercial and critical success , the LP also included " Oh My My " , a US number five . The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US . Author Peter Doggett describes Ringo as a template for Starr 's solo career , saying that , as a musician first rather than a songwriter , " he would rely on his friends and his charm , and if both were on tap , then the results were usually appealing . " 
 Goodnight Vienna followed in 1974 and was also successful , reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK . Featuring musical contributions from Lennon , Elton John and Harry Nilsson , the album included a cover of the Platters ' " Only You ( And You Alone ) " , which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK , and Hoyt Axton 's " No No Song " , which was a US number three and Starr 's seventh consecutive top @-@ ten hit . The John @-@ written " <unk> " failed to chart in the UK , however , when issued there as the second single from the album . During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul . He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn , " Don 't You Remember When " , and he inspired another De Paul song , " If I Don 't Get You the Next One Will " , which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office . 
 Starr founded the record label Ring O <unk> in 1975 . The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978 , including works by David Hentschel , Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes . The commercial impact of Starr 's own career diminished over the same period , however , although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence . Speaking in 2001 , he attributed this downward turn to his " [ not ] taking enough interest " in music , saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and Keith Moon : " We weren 't musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol ; now we were junkies dabbling in music . " Starr and Moon were members of a drinking club , The Hollywood Vampires . 
 In November 1976 Starr appeared as a guest at the Band 's farewell concert , featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary The Last Waltz . Also in 1976 , Starr issued Ringo 's Rotogravure , the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories . The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon , McCartney and Harrison . Starr promoted the release heavily , yet Rotogravure and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK . In America , the LP produced two minor hits , " A Dose of Rock ' n ' Roll " ( number 26 ) and a cover of " Hey ! Baby " ( number 74 ) , and achieved moderate sales , reaching a chart position of 28 . Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr 's formula ; the result was a curious blend of disco and 1970s pop , titled Ringo the 4th ( 1977 ) . The album was a commercial disaster , failing to chart in the UK and peaking at number 162 in the US . In 1978 Starr released Bad Boy , which reached a disappointing number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart .

 Following Lennon 's murder in December 1980 , Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr , " All Those Years Ago " , as a tribute to their former bandmate . Released as a Harrison single in 1981 , the track , which included Starr 's drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by Paul and Linda McCartney , peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK . Later that year , Starr released Stop and Smell the Roses , featuring songs produced by Nilsson , McCartney , Harrison , Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills . The album 's lead single , the Harrison @-@ composed " Wrack My Brain " , reached number 38 in the US charts , but failed to chart in the UK . Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album – " Nobody Told Me " and " Life Begins at 40 " – but following his death , Starr did not feel comfortable recording them . Soon after the murder , Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon 's widow Yoko Ono . 
 Following Stop and Smell the Roses , Starr 's recording projects were beset with problems . After completing Old Wave in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh , he was unable to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US . In 1987 he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album , produced by Chips Moman , after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings . Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984 – 86 of the popular children 's series Thomas & Friends , a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry . For a single season in 1989 , Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme 's American spin @-@ off , Shining Time Station . 
 In 1985 , Starr performed with his son Zak as part of Artists United Against Apartheid on the recording " Sun City " , and , with Harrison and Eric Clapton , was among the special guests on Carl Perkins ' TV special Blue Suede Shoes : A Rockabilly Session . In 1987 he played drums on Harrison 's Beatles pastiche " When We Was Fab " and also appeared in Godley & Creme 's innovative video clip for the song . The same year , Starr joined Harrison , Clapton , Jeff Lynne and Elton John in a performance at London 's Wembley Arena for the Prince 's Trust charity . In January 1988 , he attended the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in New York , with Harrison and Ono ( the latter representing Lennon ) , to accept the Beatles ' induction into the Hall of Fame . 
 During October and November 1988 , Starr and Bach attended a detox clinic in Tucson , Arizona , each receiving a six @-@ week treatment for alcoholism . He later commented on his longstanding addiction : " Years I 've lost , absolute years … I 've no idea what happened . I lived in a blackout . " Having embraced sobriety , Starr focused on re @-@ establishing his career by making a return to touring . On 23 July 1989 , Ringo Starr & His All @-@ Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas , Texas . Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades , the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right with popular songs at different times . The concerts interchanged Starr 's singing , including selections of his Beatles and solo songs , with performances of each of the other artists ' well @-@ known material , the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer .

 The first All @-@ Starr excursion led to the release of Ringo Starr and His All @-@ Starr Band ( 1990 ) , a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour . Also in 1990 , Starr recorded a version of the song " I Call Your Name " for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon 's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon 's birth . The track , produced by Lynne , features a supergroup composed of Lynne , Tom Petty , Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner . 
 The following year , Starr made a cameo appearance on The Simpsons episode " Brush with Greatness " and contributed an original song , " You Never Know " , to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film Curly Sue . In 1992 , Starr released his first studio album in nine years , Time Takes Time , which was produced by Phil Ramone , Don Was , Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson . The album failed to achieve commercial success , although the single " Weight of the World " peaked at number 74 in the UK , marking Starr 's first appearance on the singles chart there since " Only You " in 1974 . 
 In 1994 , Starr began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the Beatles Anthology project . They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles ' career . Released in December 1995 , " Free as a Bird " was the first new Beatles single since 1970 . In March 1996 , they released a second single , " Real Love " . The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song . Starr then played drums on McCartney 's 1997 album Flaming Pie . Among the tracks to which he contributed , " Little Willow " was a song McCartney wrote about Starr 's ex @-@ wife Maureen , who died in 1994 , while " Really Love You " was the first official release ever credited to McCartney – Starkey . 
 In 1998 , Starr released two albums on the Mercury label . The studio album Vertical Man marked the beginning of a nine @-@ year partnership with Mark Hudson , who produced the album and , with his band the Roundheads , formed the core of the backing group on the recordings . In addition , many famous guests joined on various tracks , including Martin , Petty , McCartney and , in his final appearance on a Starr album , Harrison . Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band . Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on VH1 Storytellers , which was released as an album under the same name . During the show , he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them . Starr 's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas @-@ themed I Wanna Be Santa Claus . The album was a commercial failure , although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain .

 Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002 , joining an elite group including Buddy Rich , William F. Ludwig , Sr. , and William F. Ludwig , Jr . On 29 November 2002 ( the first anniversary of Harrison 's death ) , he performed " Photograph " and a cover of Carl Perkins ' " Honey Don 't " at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall , London . Early the following year , Starr released the album Ringo Rama , which contained a song he co @-@ wrote as a tribute to Harrison , " Never Without You " . Also in 2003 , Starr formed <unk> Records with All @-@ Starr Band member Mark Hudson . The label was not prolific , but their first signing was Liam Lynch , who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs . 
 Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice @-@ over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas 's annual Christmas Eve journey , as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program . According to NORAD officials , he was " a Starr in the east " who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command 's Santa @-@ tracking tradition . 
 Starr 's 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star @-@ guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US . That same year , Liverpool 's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr 's birthplace , 9 <unk> Street , stating that it had " no historical significance " . The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved . 
 Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008 , coinciding with the start of Liverpool 's year as the European Capital of Culture . Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings , but after a falling out with Starr , he was replaced by David A. Stewart . Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool 's appointment , but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth . Later that year , he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign . 
 In April 2009 , Starr reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch Foundation 's " Change Begins Within " benefit concert , held at New York 's Radio City Music Hall . Having played his own set beforehand , Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed " With a Little Help from My Friends " , among other songs . Starr also appeared on @-@ stage during Microsoft 's June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono , McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote The Beatles : Rock Band video game . In November 2009 , Starr once again performed the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine for " The Official BBC Children in Need Medley " .

 During his youth , Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music , but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958 , he had developed a preference for rock and roll . He was also influenced by country artists , including Hank Williams , Buck Owens and Hank Snow , and jazz drummers such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef , whose compositional style inspired Starr 's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves . While reflecting on Buddy Rich , Starr commented : " He does things with one hand that I can 't do with nine , but that 's technique . Everyone I talk to says ' What about Buddy Rich ? ' Well , what about him ? Because he doesn 't turn me on . " He stated that he " was never really into drummers " , but identified Cozy Cole 's 1958 cover of Benny Goodman 's " Topsy Part Two " as " the one drum record " he bought . 
 Starr 's first musical hero was Gene Autry , about whom he commented : " I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang , ' South of the Border ' " . By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey . In November 1964 , Starr told Melody Maker : " Our music is second @-@ hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured . " 
 = = = Drums = = = 
 The overall effect of Starr 's drumming for the Beatles has received high praise from notable drummers . Starr commented : " I 'm no good on the technical things ... I 'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I 'm really left @-@ handed playing a right @-@ handed kit . I can 't roll around the drums because of that . " Beatles producer George Martin stated : " Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom @-@ tom well , even though he couldn 't do a roll to save his life " , although Martin later added , " He 's got tremendous feel . He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song , and gave it that support – that rock @-@ solid back @-@ beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles ' songs that much easier . " Starr commented : " I 've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song " ; comparing his drumming to painting , he stated : " I am the foundation , and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there 's a gap , I want to be good enough to fill it . " 
 In 2011 , readers of Rolling Stone magazine voted Starr as the fifth @-@ greatest drummer of all time . Journalist Robyn <unk> , writing for the Percussive Arts Society , stated : " I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums " . Drummer Steve Smith commented on Starr 's musical contribution : 
 Before Ringo , drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity . Ringo 's popularity brought forth a new paradigm in how the public saw drummers . We started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect . One of Ringo 's great qualities was that he composed unique , stylistic drum parts for the Beatles ' songs . His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song . 
 Starr has said that his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner , with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 . The pair subsequently played together as a double @-@ drumming team on some of Harrison 's recordings during the 1970s , on Ringo and other albums by Starr , and on the early All @-@ Starr Band tours . For Ringo 's Rotogravure in 1976 , Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination , crediting himself as " Thunder " and Keltner as " Lightnin ' " . 
 Starr influenced Phil Collins , the drummer for Genesis , who said : " I think he 's vastly underrated , Ringo . The drum fills on ' A Day in the Life ' are very , very complex things . You could take a great drummer from today and say , ' I want it like that ' , and they really wouldn 't know what to do . " In September 1980 , Lennon told Rolling Stone : 
 Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met . Ringo was a professional drummer who sang and performed and was in one of the top groups in Britain , but especially in Liverpool . So Ringo 's talent would have come out one way or the other ... whatever that spark is in Ringo , we all know it but can 't put our finger on it . Whether it 's acting , drumming , or singing , I don 't know . There 's something in him that is <unk> and he would have surfaced as an individual ... Ringo is a damn good drummer . 
 In his extensive survey of the Beatles ' recording sessions , historian Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent . According to Lewisohn , there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles ' eight @-@ year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake , while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles . Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques , such as the matched grip , tuning the drums lower , and using muffling devices on tonal rings , as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band . According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall , co @-@ authors of Classic Rock Drummers : " Ringo 's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers . " 
 = = = Vocals = = = 
 Starr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles ' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member . In many cases , Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him , as they did for " Yellow Submarine " from Revolver and " With a Little Help from My Friends " on Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . These melodies were tailored to Starr 's limited baritone vocal range . Because of his distinctive voice , Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles , but they can be heard on songs such as " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " and " Carry That Weight " . He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions " Don 't Pass Me By " and " Octopus 's Garden " . In addition , he sang lead on " I Wanna Be Your Man " , " Boys " , " Matchbox " , " Honey Don 't " , " Act Naturally " , " Good Night " and " What Goes On " . 
 = = = Songwriting = = = 
 Starr 's idiosyncratic turns of phrase , or <unk> as they became known , such as a hard day 's night and tomorrow never knows , were used as song titles by the Beatles , particularly by Lennon . McCartney commented : " Ringo would do these little malapropisms , he would say things slightly wrong , like people do , but his were always wonderful , very lyrical ... they were sort of magic " . As well as inspiring his bandmates ' creativity in this way , Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon – McCartney songs , such as the line " darning his socks in the night when there 's nobody there " from " Eleanor Rigby " . 
 Starr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs : " Octopus 's Garden " and " Don 't Pass Me By " . Starr is credited as a co @-@ writer of " What Goes On " , " Flying " and " Dig It " . On material issued after the break @-@ up , Starr received a writing credit for " Taking a Trip to Carolina " and received joint songwriting credits with the other three Beatles for " 12 @-@ Bar Original " , " Los Paranoias " , " Christmas Time ( Is Here Again ) " , " Suzy Parker " , heard in the Let It Be film , and " Jessie 's Dream " from the Magical Mystery Tour film . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965 , Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man , with Starr 's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses . Soon afterwards , the couple 's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song , " Treat Him Tender , Maureen " , by the <unk> . Starr and Maureen had three children together : Zak ( born 13 September 1965 ) , Jason ( born 19 August 1967 ) and Lee ( born 11 November 1970 ) . In 1971 , Starr purchased Lennon 's former home , Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there . Following Starr 's repeated infidelities , the couple divorced in 1975 . Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994 . 
 In 1980 , while on the set of the film Caveman , Starr met actress Barbara Bach ; they were married on 27 April 1981 . In 1985 , he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak 's daughter , <unk> Jayne Starkey . Zak Starkey is also a drummer , and during his father 's regular absences , he spent time with The Who 's Keith Moon . Zak has performed with his father during some All @-@ Starr Band tours . In total , Ringo Starr has seven grandchildren – one from Zak , three from Jason and three from Lee . 
 Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh , Surrey ; Los Angeles ; and Monte Carlo . In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011 , Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of £ 150 million . In 2012 , Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world . In 2014 Starr announced that his 200 @-@ acre Surrey estate at <unk> , with its Grade II @-@ listed Jacobean house , was for sale . However , he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King 's Road , and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles . 
 In December 2015 , Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien 's Auctions in Los Angeles . Highlights of the collection included Starr 's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit ; instruments gifted to him by Harrison , Lennon and Marc Bolan ; and a first @-@ pressing copy of the Beatles ' White Album numbered " 0000001 " . The auction raised over $ 9 million , a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation , a charity founded by Starr and Bach .
