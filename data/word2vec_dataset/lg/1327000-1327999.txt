 The red @-@ throated loon or red @-@ throated diver ( Gavia stellata ) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere . The most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family , it breeds primarily in Arctic regions , and winters in northern coastal waters . Ranging from 55 – 67 centimetres ( 22 – 26 in ) in length , the red @-@ throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world 's loons . In winter , it is a nondescript bird , greyish above fading to white below . During the breeding season , it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name . Fish form the bulk of its diet , though amphibians , invertebrates and plant material are sometimes eaten as well . A monogamous species , the red @-@ throated loon forms long @-@ term pair bonds . Both members of the pair help to build the nest , incubate the eggs ( generally two per clutch ) and feed the hatched young . 
 The red @-@ throated loon has a large global population and a significant global range , though some populations are declining . Oil spills , habitat degradation , pollution and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces . Natural predators — including various gull species , and both red and Arctic foxes , will take eggs and young . The species is protected by a number of international treaties . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 First described by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763 , the red @-@ throated loon is a monotypic species , with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range . Pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now @-@ defunct genus <unk> , which contained grebes as well as loons . By 1788 , however , German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera , and moved the red @-@ throated loon ( along with all other loon species ) to its present genus . Its relationship to the four other loons is complex ; although all belong to the same genus , it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology , behaviour , ecology and breeding biology , and may be the basal lineage of the genus . It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic , and then to have expanded into the Nearctic . 
 The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for " sea mew " , as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder . The specific epithet stellata is Latin for " set with stars " or " starry " , and refers to the bird 's speckled back in its non @-@ breeding plumage . " Diver " refers to the family 's underwater method of hunting for prey , while " red @-@ throated " is a straightforward reference to the bird 's most distinctive breeding plumage feature . The word " loon " is thought to have derived from the Swedish <unk> , the Old Norse or Icelandic <unk> , or the Old Dutch <unk> , all of which mean " lame " or " clumsy " , and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land .

 The red @-@ throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world 's loon species , ranging from 53 to 69 cm ( 21 to 27 in ) in length with a 91 – 120 cm ( 36 – 47 in ) wingspan , and weighing 1 – 2 @.@ 7 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 – 6 @.@ 0 lb ) . Like all loons , it is long @-@ bodied and short @-@ necked , with its legs set far back on its body . The sexes are similar in appearance , although males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females . In breeding plumage , the adult has a dark grey head and neck ( with narrow black and white stripes on the back of the neck ) , a triangular red throat patch , white underparts and a dark grey @-@ brown mantle . It is the only loon with an all @-@ dark back in breeding plumage . The non @-@ breeding plumage is drabber with the chin , foreneck and much of the face white , the top of the head and back of the neck grey , and considerable white speckling on the dark mantle . 
 Its bill is thin , straight and sharp , and the bird often holds it at an <unk> angle . Though the colour of the bill changes from black in summer to pale grey in winter , the timing of the colour change does not necessarily correspond to that of the bird 's overall plumage change . The nostrils are narrow slits located near the base of the bill , and the iris is reddish . One of the bird 's North American folk names is pegging @-@ awl loon , a reference to its sharply pointed bill , which resembles a sailmaker 's awl ( a tool also known as a " pegging awl " in New England ) . 
 Like the other members of its genus , the red @-@ throated loon is well @-@ adapted to its aquatic environment : its dense bones help it to submerge , its legs — in their set @-@ back position — provide excellent propulsion and its body is long and streamlined . Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining . Its feet are large , its front three toes are fully webbed , and its tarsus is flattened , which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water . 
 When it first emerges from its egg , the young red @-@ throated loon is covered with fine soft down feathers . Primarily dark brown to dark grey above , it is slightly paler on the sides of its head and neck , as well as on its throat , chest , and flanks , with a pale grey lower breast and belly . Within weeks , this first down is replaced by a second , paler set of down feathers , which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers . The juvenile 's plumage is similar to that of the adult , though with a few distinguishing features . It has a darker forehead and neck , with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat . Its back is browner and less speckled , and its underparts are tinged with brown . Its eyes are reddish @-@ brown , and its beak is a pale grey . Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid @-@ winter , many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults , except for their paler bills . 
 In flight , the red @-@ throated loon has a distinctive profile ; its small feet do not project far past the end of its body , its head and neck droop below the horizontal ( giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape ) and its thin wings are angled back . It has a quicker , deeper wingbeat than do other loons . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The adult red @-@ throated loon has a number of vocalisations , which are used in different circumstances . In flight , when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond , it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose @-@ like cackles - kaa @-@ kaa @-@ kaa or kak @-@ kak @-@ kak , at roughly five calls per second . Its warning call , if disturbed by humans or onshore predators , is a short croaking bark . A low @-@ pitched moaning call , used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young , but also during copulation , is made with the bill closed . The species also has a short wailing call - <unk> … <unk> … , which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second ; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch , this meowing call is more musical than its other calls . Another call — a harsh , pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch , and is typically repeated up to 10 times in a row — is used in territorial encounters and pair @-@ bonding , and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water . Known as the " long call " , it is often given in duet , which is unusual among the loons ; the female 's contribution is longer and softer than her mate 's . 
 Young have a shrill closed @-@ bill call , which they use in begging and to contact their parents . They also have a long call used in response to ( and similar to that of ) the long call of adults .

 At medium to close range , an adult red @-@ throated loon in either breeding or non @-@ breeding plumage is usually easily recognised . However , in certain light conditions , at certain times in its moulting cycle or at greater distances , it may be mistaken for another species — most commonly the black @-@ throated loon , but also occasionally the great crested grebe . It shows more white on the head and neck than does the black @-@ throated loon , and — provided it is not sitting low in the water — tends to show more white on the flanks as well . If it is sitting lower in the water , so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank ( thus resembling the pattern of the black @-@ throated loon ) , that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black @-@ throated . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The red @-@ throated loon breeds primarily in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America ( generally north of 50 ° N latitude ) , and winters in northern coastal waters , sometimes in groups of considerable size . More than 4 @,@ 400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on the eastern part of the German Bight , for example . Unlike other loons , it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites . 
 In North America , it winters regularly along both coasts , ranging as far south as the Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California in north @-@ western Mexico ; it has been recorded as a vagrant in the interior Mexican state of Hidalgo . Some of its folk names in north @-@ eastern North America — including cape race , cape brace , cape drake and cape racer , as well as corruptions such as scapegrace — originated from its abundance around Cape Race , Newfoundland . In Europe , it breeds in Iceland , northern Scotland , north @-@ western Ireland ( a few pairs only ) , Scandinavia and northern Russia , and winters along the coast as far south as parts of Spain ; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways , including the Mediterranean , Aegean and Black Seas , as well as large rivers , lakes and reservoirs . It has occurred as a vagrant as far south as Morocco , Tunisia and the Gambia . In Asia , it breeds in the northern stretches of Siberia , and winters along the Pacific coast as far south as China , Japan and Taiwan . It has occurred as a vagrant in Mongolia . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Because its feet are located so far back on its body , the red @-@ throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land ; however , it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast . Young use this method of covering ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water , including rivers and the sea . It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land . If frightened , it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above the surface of the water . 
 The red @-@ throated loon is a diurnal migrant , which travels singly or in loose groups , often high above the water . In eastern North America ( and possibly elsewhere ) , it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore ; Siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern European wintering grounds . It is a strong flier , and has been clocked at speeds between 75 and 78 kilometres per hour ( 47 and 48 mph ) . Like all members of its family , the red @-@ throated loon goes through a simultaneous wing moult , losing all its flight feathers at once and becoming flightless for a period of three to four weeks . However , unlike other loons — which undergo this moult in late winter — the red @-@ throated loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn . 
 = = = Food and feeding = = = 
 Like all members of its family , the red @-@ throated loon is primarily a fish @-@ eater , though it sometimes feeds on molluscs , crustaceans , frogs , aquatic invertebrates , insects , fish spawn or even plant material . It seizes rather than spears its prey , which is generally captured underwater . Though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion , it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly . Pursuit dives range from 2 – 9 m ( 6 @.@ 6 – 29 @.@ 5 ft ) in depth , with an average underwater time of about a minute . Its fish diet increases the red @-@ throated loon 's vulnerability to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals , both of which bioaccumulate , thus potentially causing greater problems for long @-@ lived species ( such as the loon ) at or near the top of the food chain . Its main diet has also led to several of the loon 's British folk names , including " <unk> borer " and " <unk> " . 
 For the first few days after hatching , young red @-@ throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small crustaceans by both parents . After 3 – 4 days , the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole . By four weeks of age , the young can eat the same food — of the same size — as their parents do . Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging ; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom , hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas . 
 = = = Breeding and survival = = = 
 The red @-@ throated loon is a monogamous species which forms long @-@ term pair bonds . Both sexes build the nest , which is a shallow scrape ( or occasionally a platform of mud and vegetation ) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers , and placed within a half @-@ metre ( 18 in ) of the edge of a small pond . The female lays two eggs ( though clutches of one and three have also been recorded ) ; they are incubated for 24 – 29 days , primarily by the female . The eggs , which are greenish or olive @-@ brownish spotted with black , measure 75 mm × 46 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in × 1 @.@ 8 in ) and have a mass of 83 g ( 2 @.@ 9 oz ) , of which 8 % is shell . Incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid , so they hatch asynchronously . If a clutch is lost ( to predation or flooding , for example ) before the young hatch , the red @-@ throated loon usually lays a second clutch , generally in a new nest . The young birds are precocial upon hatching : downy and mobile with open eyes . Both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially , then small fish for 38 – 48 days . Parents will perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest and young . Ornithologists disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that they do and others the opposite . 
 In the wild , the oldest known red @-@ throated loon lived for more than two decades ; it was found , oiled and dead , on a beach in Sweden 23 years and 7 months after it had been ringed ( banded ) . 
 = = Conservation status and threats = = 
 Although the red @-@ throated loon is not a globally threatened species , as it has a large population and a significant range , there are populations which appear to be declining . Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53 % population decline between 1971 and 1993 , for example , and counts have dropped in continental Europe as well . In Scotland , on the other hand , the population increased by some 16 % between 1994 and 2006 , according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage . In 2002 , Wetlands International estimated a global population of 490 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 individuals ; global population trends have not been quantified . 
 The red @-@ throated loon is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African @-@ Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) applies ; in the Americas , it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 . Oil spills , habitat degradation , and fishing nets are among the main threats this species faces . Because it tends to migrate close to shore — generally within 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) of land — it may be detrimentally affected by the construction of near @-@ shore wind farms ; studies indicate a high level of avoidance of wind farm areas , though deaths due to direct strikes with the turbines appear to be uncommon . High levels of mercury in the environment have led to reproductive failures in some areas , including parts of Sweden . Studies in Sweden have also shown that they may be adversely impacted by the acidification of lakes , as the fish on which they prey are susceptible to low pH . On the breeding grounds , Arctic and red foxes are major predators of eggs , while great skuas , Arctic skuas and various species of Larus gulls ( including great black @-@ backed gulls and glaucous gulls ) are predators of both eggs and young . 
 The species is known to serve as host for at least 51 species of parasites , most of which are roundworms ( nematodes ) , flatworms ( digeneans ) and tapeworms ( cestodes ) carried internally ; a single species of louse is its only known external parasite . It is also known to sometimes carry significant populations of diatoms ( microscopic phytoplankton ) on its contour feathers . The red @-@ throated loon is susceptible to avian influenza and Type E botulism , and is regularly killed by the ingestion of neurotoxins produced by " red tide " algal blooms . During a 2007 bloom , large numbers of the birds also died of hypothermia , after their plumages became matted by a protein byproduct of the algae , which reduced the insulating properties of their feathers .

 Used as a food source since prehistoric times , the red @-@ throated loon is still hunted by indigenous peoples in some parts of the world today . Eggs as well as birds are taken , sometimes in significant numbers ; during one study on northern Canada 's <unk> Island , 73 % of all red @-@ throated loon eggs laid within the 10 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 mi2 ) study site over two breeding seasons were collected by indigenous inhabitants of the island . In some parts of Russia , red @-@ throated loon skins were traditionally used to make caps and various clothing decorations , including collars . The species was also central to the creation mythologies of indigenous groups throughout the Holarctic . According to the myth — which varies only slightly between versions , despite the sometimes @-@ vast distances that separated the groups who believed it — the loon was asked by a great shaman to bring up earth from the bottom of the sea . That earth was then used to build the world 's dry land . 
 As recently as the 1800s , the behaviour of the red @-@ throated loon was used to forecast the weather ; according to the conventional wisdom of the time , birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather , while those flying out to sea or giving long , wailing cries predicted rain . In the Orkney and Shetland islands of Scotland , the species is still known as the " rain goose " in deference to its supposed weather @-@ predicting capabilities . The people of the Faroe Islands believed that if the red @-@ throated loon <unk> like a cat , then rain was imminent , while a call of gaa @-@ gaa @-@ gaa or <unk> @-@ <unk> predicted fine weather . 
 Bhutan , Japan , Åland ( an autonomous region of Finland ) , and the Union of the Comoros have issued stamps featuring the red @-@ throated loon .

 Stretford ( pop . 37 @,@ 500 ) is a town in Trafford , Greater Manchester , England . Lying on flat ground between the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal , it is 3 @.@ 8 miles ( 6 @.@ 1 km ) to the southwest of Manchester city centre , 3 @.@ 0 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south @-@ southwest of Salford and 4 @.@ 2 miles ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of Altrincham . Stretford is contiguous with the suburb of Chorlton @-@ cum @-@ Hardy to the east , and the towns of Urmston to the west , Salford to the north , and Sale to the south . The Bridgewater Canal bisects the town . 
 Historically in Lancashire , during much of the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural village , with its own market , known locally as <unk> , a reference to the large number of pigs produced for the nearby Manchester market . It was also an extensive market gardening area , producing more than 500 long tons ( 508 t ) of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845 . The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 , and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town , accelerated the industrialisation that had begun in the late 19th century . By 2001 less than one per cent of Stretford 's population was employed in agriculture . 
 Stretford has been the home of Manchester United Football Club since 1910 , and of Lancashire County Cricket Club since 1864 . Notable residents have included the industrialist , philanthropist , and Manchester 's first multi @-@ millionaire John Rylands , the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst , the painter L. S. Lowry , Morrissey , Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis and Jay Kay of Jamiroquai . 
 = = History = = 
 The origin of the name Stretford is " street " ( Old English <unk> ) on a ford across the River Mersey . The principal road through Stretford , the A56 Chester Road , follows the line of the old Roman road from Deva Victrix ( Chester ) to Mancunium ( Manchester ) , crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge , built at the location of the ancient ford . The earliest evidence of human occupation around Stretford comes from Neolithic stone axes found in the area , dating from about 2000 BC . Stretford was part of the land occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe before and during the Roman occupation , and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the Mersey . By 1212 , there were two manors in the area now called Stretford . The land in the south , close to the River Mersey , was held by Hamon de Mascy , while the land in the north , closer to the River Irwell , was held by Henry de Trafford . In about 1250 , a later Hamon de Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter , Margery . She in turn , in about 1260 , granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny . The de Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de Trafford , the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford , since when the two manors descended together . 
 The de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land , much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels . Although there is known to have been a <unk> operating in 1765 , the area remained largely rural until the early 20th @-@ century development of Trafford Park in the Old Trafford district north of the town . Until then Stretford " remained in the background of daily life in England " , except for a brief cameo role during the Jacobite rebellion of 1745 , when Crossford Bridge was destroyed to prevent a crossing by Bonnie Prince Charlie 's army during its abortive advance on London ; the bridge was quickly rebuilt . 
 Until the 1820s one of Stretford 's main cottage industries was the hand @-@ weaving of cotton . There were reported at one time to have been 302 handlooms operating in Stretford , providing employment for 780 workers , but by 1826 only four were still in use , as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced handlooms . As Manchester continued to grow , it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford 's agricultural products , in particular rhubarb , once known locally as Stretford beef . By 1836 market gardening had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the " garden of Lancashire " ; in 1845 more than 500 tons of vegetables were being produced for the Manchester market each week . Stretford also became well known for its pig market and the production of black puddings , leading to the village being given the nickname of <unk> . A local dish , known as Stretford goose , was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions . During the 1830s , between 800 and 1 @,@ 000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for the Manchester market . 
 Situated on the border with Manchester , Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid @-@ 19th century . Large recreation areas were established , such as the Royal Botanical Gardens , opened in 1831 . The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist John Dalton , because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city 's airborne pollution . In 1857 , the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition , the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom . A purpose @-@ built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of £ 38 @,@ 000 to house the 16 @,@ 000 exhibits . The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 , celebrating Queen Victoria 's 50 @-@ year reign . The exhibition ran for more than six months and was attended by more than 4 @.@ 75 million visitors . The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907 , and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928 . There was also greyhound racing from 1930 , and an athletics track . The complex was demolished in the late 1980s , and all that remains is the entrance gates , close to what is now the White City Retail Park . The gates were designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987 . 
 = = = Industrialisation = = = 
 The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 , and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford 's growth . The population in 1891 was 21 @,@ 751 , but by 1901 it had increased by 40 % to 30 @,@ 436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park . 
 During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel , including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber , and the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster . That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing , particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940 . On the nights of 22 / 23 and 23 / 24 December 1940 alone , 124 incendiaries and 120 high @-@ explosive bombs fell on the town , killing 73 people and injuring many more . Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United 's Old Trafford football ground , All Saints ' Church , St Hilda 's Church , and the children 's library in King Street . Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft , and 11 @,@ 900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire , Cheshire , Derbyshire , and Staffordshire , along with their teachers and supervisors . A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948 , over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940 . 
 Between 1972 and 1975 , what is now the B & Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity <unk> Theatre and Village Discothèque , hosting some of that period 's major artists in their prime . Led Zeppelin , David Bowie , Bob Marley , Elton John , Hawkwind , Yes , Chaka Khan , Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared . Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the <unk> , on 19 October 1975 . In more recent years , Lancashire Cricket Club 's Old Trafford ground , next door , has provided a concert venue for bands such as Oasis , Foo Fighters , The Cure , Radiohead , Coldplay , Arctic Monkeys and Take That . 
 = = = Transport history = = = 
 Stretford 's growth was fuelled by the transport revolutions of the 18th and especially the 19th century : the Bridgewater Canal reached Stretford in 1761 , and the railway in 1849 . The completion of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway ( MSJAR ) in 1849 , passing through Stretford , led to the population of the town nearly doubling in a decade , increasing from 4 @,@ 998 in 1851 to 8 @,@ 757 by 1861 . 
 Because Stretford is situated on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village , and as this traffic increased , more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places . One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach ; the Angel Hotel , on the present day site of what used to be the Bass Drum public house , was one of the main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford , and the Trafford Arms was another . The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s , about the time that horse @-@ drawn omnibuses arrived , in 1845 . The Manchester Carriage Company 's tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879 , terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road , next to which a small depot was built to house the cars and horses . A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10 minutes between 8 : 00 am and 10 : 15 pm . The horse @-@ drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902 , and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses . 
 The MSJAR railway line through Stretford was electrified in 1931 , and was converted to light rail operation in 1992 , when it became part of the Manchester Metrolink tram network . The first Metrolink tram through Stretford ran on 15 June 1992 .

 Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester , within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire . Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 , a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor , Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837 , one of three such unions in Manchester , before transferring to the Barton @-@ upon @-@ Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849 . In 1867 , Stretford Local Board of Health was established , assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868 . The board 's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways , and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services . The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894 , as a result of the Local Government Act 1894 . 
 Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933 , giving it borough status in the United Kingdom . Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933 . The roses are the red roses of Lancashire , and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt , 1st Duke of Lancaster . Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe ; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family ; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area ; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford 's industrial development . The boat at the bottom represents Stretford 's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal . 
 In 1974 , as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 , the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has , since 1 April 1974 , formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford , in Greater Manchester . Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford .

 Stretford is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford ; the other three are Altrincham , Sale and Urmston . The area historically known as Stretford , between the River Irwell in the north and the River Mersey in the south , has since 2004 been divided between the Trafford local government wards of Clifford , Longford , Gorse Hill , and Stretford . Each ward is represented by three local councillors , giving Stretford 12 of the 63 seats on Trafford Council . The wards elect in thirds on a four yearly cycle . As of the 2014 local elections , all 12 of the councillors representing the Stretford area are members of the Labour Party . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Stretford occupies an area of 4 @.@ 1 square miles ( 10 @.@ 6 km2 ) , just north of the River Mersey , at 53 ° 26 ′ 48 ″ N 2 ° 18 ′ 31 ″ W ( 53 @.@ <unk> , − 2 @.@ 3086 ) . The area is generally flat , sloping slightly southwards towards the river valley , and is approximately 150 feet ( 46 m ) above sea level at its highest point . The most southerly part of Stretford lies within the flood plain of the River Mersey , and so has historically been prone to flooding . A great deal of flood mitigation work has been carried out in the Mersey Valley since the 1970s , with the stretch of the Mersey through Stretford canalised to speed up the passage of floodwater . Emergency <unk> have also been constructed , Sale Water Park being a prominent local example , lying immediately to the south of Stretford . 
 Stretford comprises the local areas of Old Trafford , Gorse Hill , Trafford Park and Firswood . Its climate is generally temperate , with few extremes of temperature or weather . The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom . Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both slightly below the average for the UK . 
 Stretford 's built environment developed along the A56 road in two separate sections , corresponding to the original two manors . The area in the south , near to the border with Sale , grew around the church of St Matthew – an old alternative name for the town was Stretford St. Matthew . The northern part of Stretford was centred on Old Trafford , with undeveloped countryside separating them . During the 19th century , the sections merged . 
 The western terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch is in Hough Moss , just to the east of Stretford ; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century .

 As at the 2001 UK census , the Stretford area wards of Clifford , Longford , Talbot and Stretford had a total population of 37 @,@ 455 , and a population density of 9 @,@ 158 persons per square mile ( 3 @,@ 537 per km ² ) . 
 Stretford residents had an average age of 36 @.@ 7 years , younger than the 38 @.@ 9 Trafford average . For every 100 females , there were 96 @.@ 7 males . Of all residents , 52 % were single ( never married ) : in Trafford , 44 % were single . Of the 16 @,@ 078 households , 37 % were one @-@ person households , 14 % were married couples with dependent children , and 9 % were lone parents with dependent children . Of those aged 16 – 74 in Stretford , 33 % had no academic qualifications , higher than the 25 % in all of Trafford . 
 With 83 % of residents born in the United Kingdom , there is a relatively high proportion of foreign @-@ born residents reported . There is also a high proportion of non @-@ white people , as 73 % of residents were recorded as white . The largest minority group was Asian , at 15 % of the population . 
 In June 2004 , Trafford adopted a revised set of ward boundaries , and the ward of Talbot was replaced by the new ward of Gorse Hill . Re @-@ aligning the 2001 census figures with the 2004 ward boundaries gives Stretford a population of 42 @,@ 121 . 
 In 1931 , 18 @.@ 7 % of Stretford 's population was middle class and 19 @.@ 7 % working class compared to 14 % middle class and 36 % working class nationally .

 = = Economy = = 
 Until the end of the 19th century Stretford was a largely agricultural village . The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town , beginning in the late 19th century , had a significant effect on Stretford 's subsequent development . At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75 @,@ 000 workers ; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land . Trafford Park is still a very significant source of employment , containing an estimated 1 @,@ 400 companies and employing about 44 @,@ 000 people . As at the 2001 UK census , 0 @.@ 3 % of Stretford 's working population was employed in agriculture . 
 The main shopping centre is Stretford Mall in the commercial centre of Stretford , previously known as Stretford Arndale . It was opened in 1969 and changed its name in 2003 . Stretford Mall was built on the site of the original shopping centre in the former King Street . The Trafford Centre , a large shopping and leisure complex opened in September 1998 , lies to the northwest of Stretford . Frequent shuttle buses run between Stretford Metrolink tram station and The Trafford Centre , about 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) away . 
 According to the 2001 UK census , the industry of employment of residents in Stretford was 18 % retail and wholesale , 14 % property and business services , 13 % manufacturing , 12 % health and social work , 8 % education , 8 % transport and communications , 6 % construction , 5 % finance , 5 % public administration and defence , 5 % hotels and restaurants , 0 @.@ 7 % energy and water supply , 0 @.@ 3 % agriculture and 5 % other . This was roughly in line with national figures , except for the town 's relatively low percentage of agricultural workers . Many people commute into Stretford ; as of the 2001 census , there were 23 @,@ 595 jobs within the town , compared with the town 's 13 @,@ 399 employed residents .

 = = Landmarks = = 
 = = = Longford Cinema = = = 
 Longford Cinema , opposite Stretford Mall , on the eastern side of the A56 Chester Road , is perhaps the most visually striking building in the town . Designed by the architect Henry Elder , it was the height of Art Deco fashion when it was opened by the Mayor of Stretford in 1936 . Its unusual " cash register " frontage was intended to symbolise the business aspect of show business . 
 The building incorporated many modern features , such as sound @-@ proofing and under @-@ seat heating , and it was also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting . It had a seating capacity of 1 @,@ 400 in the stalls and 600 in the circle , with a further 146 seats in the café area . When built , the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade , but this was removed when the A56 was widened . During the Second World War the building was used for concerts , including one given by a young Julie Andrews . It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra 's own home , the Free Trade Hall , was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940 . 
 After a change of ownership in 1950 , the cinema was renamed the Stretford <unk> . It continued to operate as a cinema until 1965 , when it was converted into a bingo hall , which it remained until its closure in 1995 . The building has been unused since then . It was designated a Grade II listed building in 1994 . 
 = = = Great Stone = = = 
 The Great Stone , which gave its name to the Great Stone Road , where it was located until being moved in 1925 , is one of Stretford 's most easily overlooked landmarks . The stone is composed of millstone grit and was probably deposited as a glacial erratic . It is rectangular in shape , about 5 feet ( 2 m ) wide , 2 feet ( 1 m ) deep , and 3 feet ( 1 m ) tall , with two 7 @-@ inch ( 18 cm ) deep rectangular slots cut into its upper surface . 
 Several suggestions have been made for the history of the Great Stone . There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards , and during the Great Plague of 1655 – 56 the holes in the top of the stone were filled with vinegar or holy water , through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease . But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone 's original purpose . It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester , or some kind of boundary marker . The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo @-@ Saxon cross shaft . A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth , and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world . 
 When the Great Stone Road was widened in the late 19th century , the stone was moved back from the road slightly . In 1925 , the stone was moved again , to its current location outside the North Lodge of Gorse Hill Park , about 328 feet ( 100 m ) from its historical location . The stone is a Grade II listed structure . 
 = = = Cenotaph = = = 
 Stretford Cenotaph , opposite the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park , was built as a memorial to the 580 Stretford men who lost their lives in the First World War . Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on the wall behind the cenotaph . It was formally unveiled in 1923 , by the Earl of Derby , Secretary of State for War . 
 The cenotaph is 24 feet ( 7 m ) high and 11 feet ( 3 m ) wide at its base . It cost £ 2 @,@ 000 to build , raised by public subscription and a donation from the Stretford Red Cross . The memorial bears the legend " They died that we might live " on one side , and " In memory of the heroic dead " on the other . It is a Grade II listed structure . 
 = = = Longford Park = = = 
 Longford Park is the largest park in Trafford , at 54 acres ( 22 ha ) . It includes a pets ' corner , botanical garden , bowling greens , children 's play areas , and an athletics stadium , and is the finishing point of the annual Stretford Pageant . It was the site of a Royal Garden Party in 1977 , the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. <unk> the Manchester – Stretford boundary ran across the park until a Boundary Commission in the 1987 , part of it [ including the Athletics Stadium ] was in Chorlton @-@ cum @-@ Hardy , although it was always administered by Trafford MBC . 
 Longford Park was the home of John Rylands , industrialist , philanthropist , and Manchester 's first multi @-@ millionaire , from 1855 until his death in 1888 and of his widow Enriqueta <unk> Rylands until her death in 1908 . The house Rylands constructed in the park in 1857 , Longford Hall , was demolished in 1995 . It replaced an earlier house of the same name that had been the residence of Thomas Walker ( died 1817 ) and subsequently of his sons Thomas ( died 1836 ) and Charles . Today only the front porch , coach house , and the stable buildings remain . The estate and hall were sold to Stretford Council in 1911 after a poll of ratepayers , and the park was opened to the public the following year . 
 = = = Stretford Public Hall = = = 
 Stretford Public Hall was built in 1878 by John Rylands . It was designed by N. Lofthouse and is on the western side of the A56 Chester Road , opposite the Longford Cinema . Stretford 's first public lending library was established in the building in 1883 . On the death of Rylands in 1888 , his widow placed the building at the disposal of the local authority for a nominal rent , and on her own death in 1908 , the building was bought by Stretford Council for £ 5 @,@ 000 . 
 Public baths were built to the rear of the building , accessed via Cyprus Street . In 1940 the new Stretford Library was opened on King Street , and the public hall was rendered surplus . The building re @-@ opened in March 1949 as the Stretford Civic Theatre , with a well @-@ equipped stage for the use of local groups . After the Stretford Leisure Centre opened in 1977 now Stretford Sports Village , the Cyprus Street Baths wing fell into disuse , and was demolished . The remainder of the building began to fall into disrepair , despite being designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987 , until Trafford Council refurbished and converted the hall to serve as council offices in the mid @-@ 1990s . It was re @-@ opened in 1997 , once again named Stretford Public Hall .

 Stretford Cemetery was designed by John Shaw and opened in 1885 . Its chapel is in the Decorated style , designed by architects Bellamy & Hardy , and quite elaborate . On the western side is a memorial to the casualties of the Second World War and to the east a newer section of the cemetery . 
 = = = Trafford Town Hall = = = 
 Trafford Town Hall stands in a large site at the junction of Talbot Road and Warwick Road , directly opposite the Old Trafford Cricket Ground . Work on the building , designed by architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope of Bolton , began on 21 August 1931 . 
 The town hall officially came into use as Stretford Town Hall on the granting of Stretford 's charter , on 16 September 1933 . In 1974 , on the formation of the new Trafford Metropolitan Borough , Stretford Town Hall was adopted as the base for the new council and renamed Trafford Town Hall ; it was designated a Grade II listed building in 2007 .

 The Union Church was formed in 1862 , with John Rylands as its patron ; he laid the foundation stone of its building in Edge Lane , close to Longford Park 's southern entrance , in 1867 . In the latter part of the 20th century the church was converted into office accommodation but by the early 21st century was standing empty . In 2012 it was restored to its original use a church having been bought by the Church of Christ – Iglesia ni Cristo . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Stretford Metrolink station is part of the Manchester Metrolink tram system , and lies on the Altrincham to Bury line . Trams leave about every six minutes between 7 : 15 and 18 : 30 , and every 12 minutes at other times of the day . The nearest main line railway station is Trafford Park , on the Liverpool to Manchester line . Services are roughly every two hours in each direction , with extra services calling during the peak hours . The 20 @-@ acre ( 8 ha ) Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal , opened in 1993 , is in the Gorse Hill area of Stretford . It cost £ 11 million and has the capacity to deal with 100 @,@ 000 containers a year . The containers are handled by two huge gantry cranes , the noise from which has led to complaints from some local residents . 
 The town has good access to the motorway network . Junction 7 of the M60 is just to the north of Stretford 's boundary with Sale , and the A56 road gives easy access to the south as well as to Manchester city centre in the other direction . Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative . 
 Manchester Airport , the busiest in the UK outside London , is about nine miles ( 14 km ) to the south of Stretford . 
 = = Education = = 
 Along with the rest of Trafford , Stretford maintains a selective education system assessed by the Eleven Plus examination . 
 The proportion of pupils leaving Stretford Grammar School with five or more GCSEs at grades A * – C in 2006 , was 98 @.@ 3 % , compared to an average of 66 @.@ 7 % for all secondary schools in Trafford and a national UK average of 61 @.@ 3 % . More than half of the school 's pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds , and approximately a quarter of all pupils have a first language other than English , significantly above the national average . Stretford Grammar was awarded specialist Science College status in September 2005 . The school was assessed as " satisfactory " in its March 2006 Ofsted report . 
 Stretford High School Community Languages College , like Stretford Grammar , has a much higher proportion than the national average of pupils with a first language other than English , many of them being either asylum seekers or refugees . In 2004 Stretford High School was made subject to special measures , as it was considered not to be providing an adequate education for its pupils . Substantial improvement has taken place since then ; the school was assessed as " satisfactory " in its November 2005 Ofsted report and was removed from special measures . Further improvements saw Stretford High School gain an " outstanding " assessment from Ofsted , following its February 2008 inspection . GCSE results also placed the school in the top one per cent of schools in the country for adding value to its students . 
 Stretford also has the specialist Arts College , Lostock College . 
 = = Religion = = 
 The date of the first church to be built in Stretford is unrecorded , but in a lease dated 1413 , land is described as lying next to a chapel . Many of the present day churches in the area were constructed during the late 19th and early 20th century , as the population of Stretford began to grow . 
 Methodism was a significant influence in 19th @-@ century Stretford , but of the seventeen churches in the town today , only one is Methodist whereas five are Roman Catholic . The Catholic mission in Stretford was begun in 1859 , in a small chapel on Herbert Street . 
 As at the 2001 UK census , 65 % of Stretford residents reported themselves as being Christian , 12 % as Muslim , and 2 % as Sikh . No other religion was represented at higher than 1 % of the population , with 12 % reporting themselves as having no religion . 
 Stretford is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford , and the Anglican Diocese of Manchester . 
 There are two Grade II listed churches in Stretford : the Church of St Ann and the Church of St Matthew . St Ann 's is a Roman Catholic church , built in 1862 – 7 by E. W. Pugin for Sir Humphrey and Lady Annette de Trafford . It was officially opened by Bishop William Turner on 22 November 1863 , and was consecrated in June 1867 . Features include a historic organ built by Jardine & Co ( 1867 ) and a good number of fine stained glass windows by Hardman & Co of Birmingham . St Matthew 's church was built in 1842 by W. Hayley in the Gothic Revival style , with additional phases in 1869 , 1906 and 1922 .

 Stretford has been the home of Manchester United Football Club since 1910 , when the club moved to its present Old Trafford ground , the western end of which is still unofficially called the Stretford End . 
 Old Trafford was originally the home of Manchester Cricket Club , but became the home of Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1864 upon that club 's formation . The ground is on Talbot Road , Stretford , where it has been since 1856 . Similar to its counterpart , one end of the Old Trafford cricket ground is called the Stretford End . It has been a test venue since 1884 and has hosted three World Cup semi @-@ finals . After the 2005 Ashes Test , when more than 20 @,@ 000 fans had to be turned away , the decision was made to increase the ground 's capacity from 20 @,@ 000 to 25 @,@ 000 . Initial plans included building a new stadium on the site of Trafford Town Hall , opposite the present ground . However , Trafford Council voted against the demolition of the town hall and instead , in 2007 , signed an agreement jointly with Lancashire County Cricket Club , Ask Developments , and Tesco , to redevelop the ground on its present site . 
 The new cricket ground will be at the heart of a 750 @,@ 000 square feet ( 69 @,@ 677 m2 ) development that will also include business space , residential , retail , hotel and leisure facilities . More than £ 25 million is expected to be invested in the redevelopments at Old Trafford . 
 Stretford Stadium , adjoining Longford Park , is the home of Trafford Athletic Club . Trafford is one of the UK 's top athletic clubs , with more than 100 members having competed at international level . 
 The Stretford Sports Village run by Trafford Community Leisure Trust comprises two main centres : the original Stretford Leisure Centre , now called the Chester Centre , and the facility at Stretford High School called the Talbot Centre . The Stretford Sports Village is located in one of the UK 's sporting hot spots , sandwiched between Manchester United Football Club 's Old Trafford Stadium and Lancashire County Cricket Club 's Old Trafford Ground .

 The Stretford Pageant is an annual Rose Queen festival held on the last Saturday of June ; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919 . There is a procession of decorated floats through the streets , collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park , where the Rose Queen is crowned . The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter 's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919 . Various other entertainments are provided in the park on the day of the pageant , such as a fun fair and a car boot sale . Stretford Pageant , along with similar events in other parts of Trafford , is under threat because of the council 's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future .

 Alabama 's only saltwater port , Mobile is located at the head of the Mobile Bay and the north @-@ central Gulf Coast . The Port of Mobile has always played a key role in the economic health of the city beginning with the city as a key trading center between the French and Native Americans down to its current role as the 12th @-@ largest port in the United States .

 Mobile began as the first capital of colonial French Louisiana in 1702 . During its first 100 years , Mobile was a colony of France , then Britain , and lastly Spain . Mobile first became a part of the United States of America in 1813 , with the annexation of West Florida under President James Madison . In 1861 Alabama joined the Confederate States of America , which surrendered in 1865 . 
 As one of the Gulf Coast 's cultural centers , Mobile has several art museums , a symphony orchestra , a professional opera , a professional ballet company , and a large concentration of historic architecture . Mobile is known for having the oldest organized Carnival celebrations in the United States . The festival began to be celebrated in the first decade of the 18th century by its first French Catholic colonial settlers . Mobile was host to the first formally organized Carnival mystic society , known elsewhere as a <unk> , to celebrate with a parade in the United States , beginning in 1830 . In 2005 the first integrated mystic society had a parade for Mardi Gras . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The city gained its name from the Mobile tribe that the French colonists encountered living in the area of Mobile Bay . Although debated by Alabama historians , they may have been descendants of the Native American tribe whose small fortress town , <unk> , was used to conceal several thousand native warriors before an attack in 1540 on the expedition of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto . The Mobile tribe , along with the <unk> , obtained permission from the colonists , about seven years after the founding of the Mobile settlement , to settle near the fort . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Colonial = = = 
 The European settlement of Mobile began with French colonists , who in 1702 constructed Fort Louis de la Louisiane , at Twenty @-@ seven Mile Bluff on the Mobile River , as the first capital of the French colony of La Louisiane . It was founded by French Canadian brothers Pierre Le Moyne d 'Iberville and Jean @-@ Baptiste Le Moyne , Sieur de Bienville , to establish control over France 's Louisiana claims . Bienville was appointed as royal governor of French Louisiana in 1701 . Mobile 's Roman Catholic parish was established on July 20 , 1703 , by Jean @-@ Baptiste de la Croix de <unk> de Saint @-@ Vallier , Bishop of Quebec . The parish was the first French Catholic parish established on the Gulf Coast of the United States . In 1704 the ship <unk> delivered 23 French women to the colony ; passengers had contracted yellow fever at a stop in Havana . Though most of the " <unk> girls " recovered , numerous colonists and neighboring Native Americans contracted the disease in turn and died . This early period was also the occasion of the importation of the first African slaves , transported aboard a French supply ship from Saint @-@ Domingue in the Caribbean . The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years , growing to 279 persons by 1708 , yet descending to 178 persons two years later due to disease . 
 These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods resulted in Bienville 's ordering relocation of the settlement in 1711 several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the Mobile River and Mobile Bay . A new earth @-@ and @-@ palisade Fort Louis was constructed at the new site during this time . By 1712 , when Antoine Crozat was appointed to take over administration of the colony , its population had reached 400 persons . 
 The capital of La Louisiane was moved in 1720 to Biloxi , leaving Mobile to serve as a regional military and trading center . In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began and it was renamed Fort Condé in honor of Louis Henri , Duc de Bourbon and prince of Condé . 
 In 1763 , the Treaty of Paris was signed , ending the Seven Years ' War , which Britain won , defeating France . By this treaty , France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain . This area was made a part of the expanded British West Florida colony . The British changed the name of Fort Condé to Fort Charlotte , after Charlotte of Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz , wife and queen with King George III . 
 The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists ; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile . The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 as a result of the new British rule and religious tolerance . Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir , a decree passed by France 's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism , and ordered all Jews out of France 's colonies . Most of these colonial @-@ era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina ; they added to the commercial development of Mobile . In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860 , though the town 's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period . During the American Revolutionary War , West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies . 
 While the British were dealing with their rebellious colonists along the Atlantic coast , the Spanish entered the war in 1779 as an ally of France . They took the opportunity to order Bernardo de Galvez , Governor of Louisiana , on an expedition east to retake West Florida . He captured Mobile during the Battle of Fort Charlotte in 1780 , as part of this campaign . The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony west of the Mississippi River , which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . Their actions were condoned by the revolting American colonies , partially evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack , representative of the American Continental Congress . Due to strong trade ties , many residents of Mobile and West Florida remained loyal to the British Crown . The Spanish renamed the fort as Fortaleza Carlota , and held Mobile as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1813 , when it was seized by United States General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812 .

 By the time Mobile was included in the Mississippi Territory in 1813 , the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people . The city was included in the Alabama Territory in 1817 , after Mississippi gained statehood . Alabama was granted statehood in 1819 ; Mobile 's population had increased to 809 by that time . 
 As the river frontage areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters who developed the cotton plantation economy with the use of slave labor , Mobile 's population exploded . It came to be settled by attorneys , cotton factors , doctors , merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas . Mobile was well situated for trade , as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi . By 1822 the city 's population was 2800 . 
 From the 1830s onward , Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades . Many slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South . There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes , food , and supplies for the slave traders and their wards . The city 's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North ; by 1850 10 % of its population was from New York City , which was deeply involved in the cotton industry . Mobile was the slave @-@ trading center of the state until the 1850s , when it was surpassed by Montgomery . 
 The prosperity stimulated a building boom was underway by the mid @-@ 1830s , with the building of some of the most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point . This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics . The waterfront was developed with wharves , terminal facilities , and fireproof brick warehouses . The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt ; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation . 
 With the economy so focused on one crop , Mobile 's fortunes were always tied to those of cotton , and the city weathered many financial crises . Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas , but many households had domestic slaves , and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats . The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde . Among them was Cudjoe Lewis , who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade . 
 By 1853 , fifty Jewish families lived in Mobile , including Philip Phillips , an attorney from Charleston , South Carolina , who was elected to the Alabama State Legislature and then to the United States Congress . Many early Jewish families were descendants of Sephardic Jews who had been among the earliest colonial settlers in Charleston and Savannah . 
 By 1860 Mobile 's population within the city limits had reached 29 @,@ 258 people ; it was the 27th @-@ largest city in the United States and 4th @-@ largest in what would soon be the Confederate States of America . The free population in the whole of Mobile County , including the city , consisted of 29 @,@ 754 citizens , of which 1195 were free people of color . Additionally , 1785 slave owners in the county held 11 @,@ 376 people in bondage , about one @-@ quarter of the total county population of 41 @,@ 130 people . 
 During the American Civil War , Mobile was a Confederate city . The H. L. Hunley , the first submarine to sink an enemy ship , was built in Mobile . One of the most famous naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay , resulting in the Union taking control of Mobile Bay on August 5 , 1864 . On April 12 , 1865 , three days after Robert E. Lee 's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse , the city surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely . 
 On May 25 , 1865 , the city suffered great loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street . The explosion left a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 m ) deep hole at the depot 's location , and sank ships docked on the Mobile River ; the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city . 
 Federal Reconstruction in Mobile began after the Civil War and effectively ended in 1874 when the local Democrats gained control of the city government . The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile . One example can be provided by the value of Mobile 's exports during this period of depression . The value of exports leaving the city fell from $ 9 million in 1878 to $ 3 million in 1882 . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 The turn of the 20th century brought the Progressive Era to Mobile . The economic structure developed with new industries , generating new jobs and attracting a significant increase in population . The population increased from around 40 @,@ 000 in 1900 to 60 @,@ 000 by 1920 . During this time the city received $ 3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels . During and after World War I , manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile 's economic health , with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries . 
 During this time , social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened , however . The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites ; and the white Democratic @-@ dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation . In 1902 , the city government passed Mobile 's first racial segregation ordinance , segregating the city streetcars . It legislated what had been informal practice , enforced by convention . Mobile 's African @-@ American population responded to this with a two @-@ month boycott , but the law was not repealed . After this , Mobile 's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy . 
 In 1911 the city adopted a commission form of government , which had three members elected by at @-@ large voting . Considered to be progressive , as it would reduce the power of ward bosses , this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power , as only the majority could gain election of at @-@ large candidates . In addition , poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised . Mobile was one of the last cities to retain this form of government , which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice . But Alabama 's white yeomanry had historically favored single @-@ member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice . 
 The red imported fire ant was first introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile . Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America . The ants were carried in the soil used as ballast on those ships . They have spread throughout the South and Southwest . 
 During World War II , the defense buildup in Mobile shipyards resulted in a considerable increase in the city 's white middle @-@ class and working @-@ class population , largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to work in the shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field . Between 1940 and 1943 , more than 89 @,@ 000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries . 
 Mobile was one of eighteen United States cities producing Liberty ships . Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company ( ADDSCO ) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them . ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department . Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation , a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation , focused on building freighters , Fletcher @-@ class destroyers , and minesweepers . The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions , increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs . 
 A race riot broke out in May 1943 of whites against blacks . ADDSCO management had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards , although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities . That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders , previously reserved for whites ; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24 . The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order , but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work , keeping them away for their safety . 
 In the late 1940s , the transition to the postwar economy was hard for the city , as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry . Eventually the city 's social structure began to become more liberal . Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force , the paper and chemical industries began to expand . No longer needed for defense , most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses . Following the war , in which many African Americans had served , veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice , especially in the Jim Crow South . During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races . Unlike in the rest of the state , by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated . 
 The Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949 , allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards ( IDB ) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas . The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962 . George E. McNally , Mobile 's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction , was the driving force behind the founding of the IDB . The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce , believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area , considered the new IDB as a serious rival . After several years of political squabbling , the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious . While McNally 's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry , the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions . 
 In 1963 , three African @-@ American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School . This was nearly a decade after the United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional . The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year , leading to the desegregation of Mobile County 's school system . 
 The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 , eventually ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans . But whites in the state had more than one way to reduce African Americans ' voting power . Maintaining the city commission form of government with at @-@ large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority , as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city . 
 In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base was closed by the Department of Defense , dealing Mobile 's economy a severe blow . The closing resulted in a 10 % unemployment rate in the city . This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered in a period of economic depression that lasted through the 1970s . The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work . 
 Mobile 's city commission form of government was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden , which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court . Finding that the city had adopted a commission form of government in 1911 and at @-@ large positions with discriminatory intent , the court proposed that the three members of the city commission should be elected from single @-@ member districts , likely ending their division of executive functions among them . Mobile 's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor @-@ council form of government , with seven members elected from single @-@ member districts . This was approved by voters . As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century , African @-@ American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice . Since the change to single @-@ member districts , more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at @-@ large system . 
 Beginning in the late 1980s , newly elected mayor Mike Dow and the city council began an effort termed the " String of Pearls Initiative " to make Mobile into a competitive city . The city initiated construction of numerous new facilities and projects , and the restoration of hundreds of historic downtown buildings and homes . City and county leaders also made efforts to attract new business ventures to the area .

 = = Culture = = 
 Mobile 's French and Spanish colonial history has given it a culture distinguished by French , Spanish , Creole , African and Catholic heritage , in addition to later British and American influences . It is distinguished from all other cities in the state of Alabama . The annual Carnival celebration is perhaps the best example of its differences . Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration , dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period . 
 Carnival in Mobile evolved over the course of 300 years from a beginning as a sedate French Catholic tradition into the mainstream multi @-@ week celebration that today bridges a spectrum of cultures . Mobile 's official cultural ambassadors are the Azalea Trail Maids , meant to embody the ideals of Southern hospitality . 
 = = = Carnival and Mardi Gras = = = 
 The Carnival season has expanded throughout the late fall and winter : balls in the city may be scheduled as early as November , with the parades beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6 . Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras , a moveable feast related to the timing of Lent and Easter . The next day is Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent , the 40 @-@ day penitential season before Easter . 
 In Mobile , locals often use the term Mardi Gras as a shorthand to refer to the entire Carnival season . During the Carnival season ; the mystic societies build colorful floats and parade throughout downtown . Masked society members toss small gifts , known as ' throws , ' to parade spectators . The mystic societies , which in essence are exclusive private clubs , also give formal masquerade balls , usually by invitation only , and oriented to adults . 
 Carnival was first celebrated in Mobile in 1703 when colonial French Catholic settlers carried out their traditional celebration at the Old Mobile Site , prior to the 1711 relocation of the city to the current site . Mobile 's first Carnival society was established in 1711 with the Boeuf Gras Society ( <unk> Ox Society ) . Celebrations were relatively small and consisted of local , private parties until the early 19th century . 
 In 1830 Mobile 's <unk> de <unk> Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade . The <unk> got their start when Michael Krafft , a cotton factor from Pennsylvania , began a parade with rakes , hoes , and cowbells . The <unk> introduced horse @-@ drawn floats to the parades in 1840 with a parade entitled " Heathen Gods and Goddesses " . The Striker 's Independent Society , formed in 1843 , is the oldest surviving mystic society in the United States . 
 Carnival celebrations in Mobile were canceled during the American Civil War . In 1866 Joe Cain revived the Mardi Gras parades when he paraded through the city streets on Fat Tuesday while costumed as a fictional Chickasaw chief named <unk> . He celebrated the day in front of the occupying Union Army troops . In 2002 , Mobile 's Tricentennial celebrated with parades that represented all of the city 's mystic societies . 
 Founded in 2004 , the Conde Explorers in 2005 were the first integrated Mardi Gras society to parade in downtown Mobile . The society has about a hundred members and welcomes men and women of all races . In addition to the parade and ball , the Conde Explorers hold several parties throughout the year . Its members also perform volunteer work . The Conde Explorers were featured in the award @-@ winning documentary , The Order of Myths ( 2008 ) , by Margaret Brown about Mobile 's Mardi Gras .

 Since 1985 the government of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven @-@ member city council . The mayor is elected at @-@ large , and the council members are elected from each of the seven city council single @-@ member districts ( <unk> ) . A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business . This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government , which used three city commissioners who were elected at @-@ large , was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the Voting Rights Act in the 1975 case Bolden v. City of Mobile . Due to appeals , the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system . Municipal elections are held every four years . 
 The first mayor elected under the new system of single @-@ member district ( <unk> ) voting was Arthur R. Outlaw , who served his second term as mayor from 1985 – 1989 . His first term had been under the old system , from 1967 – 1968 . Mike Dow defeated Outlaw in the 1989 election and went on to serve as mayor for four terms , from 1989 – 2005 . His " The String of Pearls " initiative , a series of projects designed to stimulate redevelopment of the city 's core , is credited with reviving much of downtown Mobile . Upon his retirement , Dow endorsed Sam Jones as his successor . 
 Sam Jones was elected in 2005 as the first African @-@ American mayor of Mobile . He was re @-@ elected for a second term in 2009 without opposition . His administration continued the focus on downtown redevelopment and bringing industries to the city . He ran for a third term in 2013 but was beaten by Sandy Stimpson . Stimpson took office on November 4 , 2013 . 
 As of November 2013 , the seven @-@ member city council is made up of Fredrick Richardson , Jr. from District 1 , Levon <unk> from District 2 , C.J. Small from District 3 , John C.

 = Congregation Beth Israel ( Meridian , Mississippi ) = 
 Congregation Beth Israel in Meridian , Mississippi , is a Reform Jewish congregation founded in 1868 and a member of the Union for Reform Judaism . The congregation 's first permanent house of worship was a Middle Eastern @-@ style building constructed in 1879 . The congregation moved to another building built in the Greek Revival style in 1906 , and in 1964 moved to a more modern building , out of which they still operate . 
 The congregation was initially made up of only ten families but grew to include 50 members by 1878 . By the time their second building was built in 1906 , the congregation included 82 members , and Meridian as a whole had grown to include 525 Jewish residents by 1927 . By the 2000s there were fewer than forty , mostly elderly Jews remaining in the city , however , and the congregation no longer has a full @-@ time rabbi . Former rabbis include Judah Wechsler , after whom the Wechsler school was named , and William Ackerman , whose wife Paula Ackerman became the first woman to perform rabbinical duties in the country after her husband 's unexpected death . 
 In 1968 , the education building of the new complex was bombed by members of the Ku Klux Klan . Pieces of glass were salvaged from the destruction and are now incorporated into the front windows of the current synagogue building . The congregation owns and maintains a historic cemetery at 19th Street and 15th Avenue which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 . 
 = = History = = 
 In the early days of Lauderdale County before Meridian was established , the nearby town of Marion was the largest settlement in the area . The families of Abraham <unk> , Isaac Rosenbaum , Leopold Rosenbaum , E. Lowenstein , and Jacob Cohen lived in Marion during these early years . These families , along with other Jews in Marion , worked with Jews from the up @-@ and @-@ coming Meridian to build a temple halfway between the two towns . After the American Civil War , Meridian began to grow rapidly and Marion began to decline . As a result , many of Marion 's Jews elected to move to Meridian . In 1868 , the Jewish community established the first Jewish congregation in Lauderdale County , Beth Israel , and bought the lot which is now the Beth Israel Cemetery for $ 100 ( today $ 2 @,@ 000 ) . 
 The congregation initially consisted of only ten families and met in several temporary locations before moving to a permanent building . These locations included a house on 24th Avenue and 9th Street , a room above Carney 's Grocery Store , and Sheehan Hall . In this interim period , the congregation grew to include 50 members by 1878 , with David <unk> serving as rabbi . The Middle Eastern style building at the corner of 8th Street and 22nd Avenue , constructed by the growing congregation in 1879 , was the first building in the city with gas @-@ powered lighting . Rabbi <unk> was succeeded by Rabbi W. Weinstein , then Rabbi Jacobs , and then Rabbi Judah Wechsler . Wechsler , who became rabbi in 1887 , led a movement to provide public schools for blacks , which culminated in a bond issue to construct the first brick public school building for African Americans in the state . The Wechsler School was named after him and has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Mississippi Landmark . The congregation stayed in this building for several years , before eventually being forced to move due to complaints of flies attracted by horse droppings outside of a nearby retail store . 
 In 1906 , a new Greek Revival octagonal synagogue designed by architect P.J. <unk> and modelled after the Temple of Athena Nike was built at the corner of 11th Street and 24th Avenue . The marble steps leading to the entrance of the building were flanked by large Ionic columns . The new synagogue could seat 500 and featured stained glass windows displaying the Ten Commandments , a menorah , the Star of David , and Noah 's Ark . A fire damaged the building during its first year of operation , and while it was being repaired , services were held at St. Paul 's Episcopal Church . By 1907 , the congregation had grown to include 82 members and was led by Rabbi Max Raisin . By 1927 , the Jewish community in Meridian had grown to 525 people , partly due to an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe . The members of Beth Israel sponsored these newcomers , helping them to find jobs and homes and holding night classes to teach them English . 
 Some of the congregation 's members had preferred a more strict form of worship and a smaller Orthodox congregation , Ohel Jacob , had been formed in 1895 . The two congregations had good relations , however , and a number of Meridian Jews belonged to both . 
 In 1951 , the congregation included 100 members and was the second largest Jewish community in the state . When Rabbi William Ackerman , who had served the congregation from 1924 to 1950 , suddenly died while still in service , Beth Israel asked his wife Paula Ackerman to take his place until they could find a replacement . No women had been ordained at this time , and it would be a full 20 more years before the first woman would be officially ordained in the United States . Nonetheless , without ordination Paula Ackerman served as " spiritual leader " ( the congregation elected not to call her " rabbi " ) for three years until Beth Israel could find another . Despite the unwillingness to call Ackerman " rabbi , " she performed all the duties of a normal rabbi , including conducting weekly Shabbat services , giving sermons , and performing marriages and funerals . In spite of much media attention and criticism from other Jews in the country , the congregation remained united under her leadership . ( Ackerman would later move to her original home of Pensacola , Florida , where she would serve as an interim rabbi at Temple Beth @-@ El for nine months in 1962 until a replacement was found . ) 
 By 1964 , the temple was in need of repairs , and some older members found it difficult to get up the steep marble steps at the entrance . Instead of repairing their 60 @-@ year @-@ old building in downtown , they purchased a 5 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) plot in the Broadmoor residential subdivision of Meridian and built a new synagogue . The new facility , located at 57th Court and 14th Avenue , was dedicated in December 1964 and was composed of a 200 @-@ seat sanctuary , a social hall with a kitchen and a library , and an education building . 
 = = = 1968 Ku Klux Klan bombing = = = 
 During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , the leadership of Beth Israel spoke out against the Ku Klux Klan 's attacks on black churches . In response , Thomas Tarrants of Mobile , Alabama , who had helped bomb the synagogue building of Beth Israel Congregation and its rabbi 's house there bombed Beth Israel 's education building on May 28 , 1968 . The blast was caused by about 15 sticks of dynamite planted by Tarrants and his accomplice , Danny Joe Hawkins , a top hitman in the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan . The force of the blast knocked down several walls of the education building and caved in part of the roof while also destroying a door at the opposite end of the synagogue building . A hole approximately 24 inches ( 61 cm ) in diameter was left in the concrete floor , and damages were estimated to be around $ 50 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 340 @,@ 000 today ) . A reward of $ 10 @,@ 000 was offered by the Meridian City Council , and $ 15 @,@ 000 extra was promised by the Jewish community of the city . According to Sammy Feltenstein , past president of Congregation Beth Israel , pieces of stained glass that survived the bombing were salvaged and adorn the front window of the synagogue today . 
 On June 30 , Tarrants returned to Meridian to bomb the home of Meyer Davidson , an outspoken leader of the Jewish community , on 29th Avenue . The FBI and police chief Roy Gunn convinced Raymond and Alton Wayne Roberts , local Klan members , to gather information about the Klan 's operations . Alton was free on bond after being convicted in connection with the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in 1964 . Leaders of the Jewish communities in Jackson and in Meridian had raised money to pay the two informants , who tipped off the FBI about the attack before it happened . Fifteen police officers were hidden around Davidson 's house shortly after midnight when a car stopped about 50 feet ( 15 m ) away from the house . Tarrants exited the vehicle with a box , later found to include 29 sticks of dynamite , and approached Davidson 's carport . When police ordered him to stop , he dropped the box and fled to his vehicle . Officers then chased him for about 15 blocks before ramming the back of his vehicle , ending the chase . Tarrants opened fire on the policemen with a German @-@ made 9mm submachine gun , striking officer J.M. Hatcher four times in the chest ( though critically injured , the officer survived ) . Tarrants fled through the neighborhood continuing to fire at the policemen . Robert Burton , a resident of the neighborhood , opened his door to see what was going on and was struck by stray bullets . Police eventually found Tarrants in a pool of his own blood in a local resident 's backyard . Kathy Ainsworth , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old fifth grade school teacher from Jackson who had helped with the bombing of Jackson 's synagogue a few months earlier , was found dead in the car with a loaded pistol in her purse . The car 's owner was identified to be Danny Joe Hawkins , who had helped bomb Beth Israel ; he was arrested on robbery charges a few weeks later . Tarrants survived his wounds and was sentenced to a thirty @-@ year term in <unk> prison . He was paroled eight years into his term to enter the University of Mississippi after a religious conversion , and in 1992 he was training missionaries in North Carolina . 
 = = Cemetery = = 
 Besides their main campus in Broadmoor , the congregation also operates Beth Israel Cemetery , listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 . Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue , it was originally outside of Meridian 's city limits and was intended to be a rural cemetery , but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery . The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants , as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian 's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings , neither of which still stands . 
 A stuccoed brick fence with cast iron gates and an iron Star of David enclose the cemetery . Within the walls , there are two main pathways which meet in the center of the cemetery at a circular decorative piece including a fountain . The oldest graves are in the northern half of the cemetery while newer graves were added progressively south . Many grave sites are adorned with well @-@ maintained Victorian era funerary art , which gives the cemetery its historic significance . Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family , which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner , and two marble angels at the entrance of the plot . Other examples include the grave of David L.

 Because the cemetery is so small – only 2 @.@ 9 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) – it cannot be fully compared to such prolific rural cemeteries as Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts , but it was clearly laid out in the rural cemetery fashion . Many of the first people buried here were European immigrants , so that could explain why there are no trees on the property . Jewish cemeteries in Europe are generally not planted with trees because of the possibility that roots could disturb the bodies .

 = September Morn = 
 Matinée de Septembre ( English : September Morn ) is a controversial oil painting on canvas completed in 1911 by the French artist Paul Émile Chabas . Painted over several summers , it depicts a nude girl or young woman standing in the shallow water of a lake , prominently lit by the morning sun . She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture , which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty , huddling against the cold , or sponge bathing . It has also been considered a disingenuous pose permitting the " fetishisation of innocence " . 
 September Morn was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1912 , and although the identity of its first owner is unclear , it is certain that Leon Mantashev acquired the painting by the end of 1913 . It was taken to Russia , and in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917 was feared lost . It resurfaced in 1935 in the collection of Calouste Gulbenkian , and after his death in 1955 was sold to a Philadelphia broker , who donated it anonymously to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ( the Met ) in 1957 . As of 2014 it is not on display . 
 From 1913 on , reproductions of the painting caused controversy in the United States . An art dealer in Chicago was charged with indecency and another in New York was targeted by anti @-@ vice crusader Anthony Comstock , both after displaying September Morn . Over the next few years the work was reproduced in a variety of forms , including on pins and calendars , while censorship and art were debated in newspapers . Chabas ' painting inspired songs , stage shows and films ; eventually some 7 million reproductions were sold , though Chabas – who had not copyrighted September Morn – did not receive any royalties . 
 Although several women claimed to be the model for September Morn , Chabas never revealed her identity . He described the work as " all I know of painting " , and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece . Later writers , however , have described the painting as kitsch , valuable only as a historic artifact . 
 = = Description = = 
 September Morn depicts , from an oblique point of view , a naked blonde girl or young woman standing ankle @-@ deep in the water near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills . The figure is backlit by the morning sun , but fully visible , if a little darker than her surroundings . Her arms are folded about her body , her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow , while her left arm conceals her pubic area . This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold , covering her modesty , or sponge bathing , or as the artist 's " fetishisation of innocence " . 
 Reviews in 1912 noted that the painting was dominated by grays : those of her shaded body , the blue @-@ grays of the September water , the green @-@ grays of the sky , and the pink @-@ grays of the hills behind her . The art critic François Thiébault @-@ Sisson described this as evoking the morning , the young subject preparing to bathe while " light grey vapours are still floating over the lake " . This oil painting on canvas measures 163 @.@ 8 by 216 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 64 @.@ 5 by 85 @.@ 2 in ) , and Chabas 's signature is located in the lower left .

 By the time he painted September Morn , Paul Émile Chabas ( 1869 – 1937 ) already had an established reputation as an academic artist . He regularly submitted to the Paris Salon , first participating in 1886 . He won a third class medal in the Salon of 1895 , and four years later won the Prix National for his painting Joyeux <unk> , which earned him a gold medal at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the Musée des Beaux @-@ Arts de Nantes . In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris , while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores of rivers , lakes , and seas . In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour . 
 Chabas studied under artists such as Tony Robert @-@ Fleury , William @-@ Adolphe Bouguereau , and Albert <unk> . Although his earlier works were generally portraits , most of the painter 's later production consisted of nude girls and young women . The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings , which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings . September Morn is typical of his style . 
 J. Valmy @-@ <unk> , in a 1910 overview of the artist , attributes Chabas 's style to the painter 's time at the family summer home along the <unk> ; he identifies the " grace of adolescence , its undefinable charm , [ and ] its chaste nudity " of the models with Chabas 's reminiscences of his youth . The art historian Bram Dijkstra has argued otherwise , stating that " no artist was more assiduous in exploiting the prurient possibilities of the woman @-@ child " than Chabas , whom he considers to have " emphasized analogies of nude little girls and the familiar poses of vanity or physical arousal given to adult women " . 
 = = = Nudity and art = = = 
 Female nudes were the dominant subject of painting in French Salons at the end of the 19th century . Female models had become more common than male ones beginning in the early 19th century , first serving allegorical roles or as muses , but eventually becoming individuals " who could be classified and whose history could be written " . In academic art – such as that of Chabas – the models were not portrayed as they were , but as idealized nudes , based on classical ideals ; the body hair of women models , for instance , would not be shown , and the pubic area was rendered smoothly . The hostess Suzanne Delve , who later claimed to have stood for September Morn , said that models were willing to provide " service to art " by posing nude for such works . 
 Not all forms of nude imagery were acceptable in France . The end of the 19th century had seen the introduction of various laws against pornography , images of adults and children meant to " provoke , incite , or stimulate debauchery " . Works targeted were initially those meant for wide distribution ( and thus , the lower class ) . However , the Australian art historian Fae Brauer writes that the line between art and pornography was blurred by the early 1910s ; even tighter laws , introduced in 1908 , had resulted in censorship of modernist works . For instance , three paintings by Kees van Dongen ( including two of his daughter ) were rejected from the Salon d 'Automne between 1911 and 1913 on grounds of indecency . 
 The United States had , since colonial times , generally been more puritan in terms of art than Europe . In the mid- and late @-@ 19th century the country 's government implemented laws against obscenity , such as the Tariff of 1842 which banned the importing of foreign works of art deemed obscene . By the end of the 19th century , an uneasy understanding had been reached : museums could hold works depicting nudity , but commercial works ( including photographs of artwork ) could be – and were – confiscated . Tensions remained over the issue of whether nudes represented European @-@ style sophistication ( a trait important to the upper @-@ class ) or encouraged behaviors which threatened families and encouraged " impure imaginations " . 
 = = Creation ; identity of model = = 
 Chabas began work on September Morn in mid @-@ 1910 at Talloires on the shores of Lake Annecy in Haute @-@ Savoie , some 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) south @-@ east of Paris . The model , whom he never identified but referred to as " Marthe " , was well known to his family . Owing to the financial situation of the sixteen @-@ year @-@ old 's family , " Marthe " had to work to support her mother . On the first day of painting , " Marthe " entered the morning water and instinctively recoiled at its chilliness . Chabas approved of this pose , saying that it was " perfect " . Over the course of two summers he worked on the painting , half an hour every morning . The work was completed on a September morning in 1911 , giving the painting its name . In 1935 , responding to claims that " Marthe " was living in poverty , Chabas explained that she had continued posing for him until she was 28 , when she married a rich industrialist , and that she was now aged 41 , plump , and had three children . 
 Numerous women have claimed or been claimed to be the model , some presenting different versions of events . In 1913 , a Miss Louise Buckley , performing in Eugene , Oregon , said that she had been paid $ 1 @,@ 000 and posed in the artist 's studio . The Paris @-@ based artist Jules Pages , meanwhile , stated that the woman depicted in September Morn had been a 25 @-@ year @-@ old of good character who earned her living as an artist 's model , but had gone into hiding after the controversy over the painting . Other claimants included a Swedish model named Gloria and a variety actress named Irene Shannon ; the latter made the claim in the lead @-@ up to a vaudeville skit called " November Mourning " . 
 In 1937 , twenty @-@ four years after September Morn caused controversy in the United States , the Parisian hostess Suzanne Delve declared that she had been the model . In her account , Chabas – who had known her since she was an infant – had her pose nude in his studio and later painted Lake Annecy in her absence . Delve described her nervousness at the first session , her mother chatting to her to distract her mind while Chabas 's wife played soothing music on the piano . She said she took her pose " instinctively " and that the controversy over the painting had ruined her life , as no Frenchman would want to marry a woman marred by scandal . 
 Yet another version is presented by the Metropolitan Museum of Art ( the Met ) in their 1966 catalogue of French holdings , including September Morn . According to this telling , Chabas completed the painting over three summers at Lake Annecy , though his peasant model served only as the basis for the figure 's body . The head was based on a sketch of a young American , Julie Phillips , which Chabas had completed upon observing her and her mother dining in Paris ; finding her profile to his liking , he silently drew her , then introduced himself and " apologized for his presumption " .

 = = = Paris Salon and first sale = = = 
 Chabas first exhibited September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30 , 1912 . Because he did not plan to sell it , he gave a price of 50 @,@ 000 francs ( $ 10 @,@ 000 ) – more than he expected anybody to pay . For the painting , and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight , Chabas won a Medal of Honor , receiving 220 of 359 possible votes . At the Salon , the painting was uncontroversial , and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio . 
 Sources are unclear as to the painting 's provenance after the Salon . According to the Met , the New York @-@ based Philip ( or Philippe ) Ortiz , manager of the New York Branch of Braun and Company , purchased it in late 1912 . According to a 1933 report in the Middletown Times Herald , he paid 12 @,@ 000 francs ( $ 2 @,@ 400 ) for the work , but never brought the painting back to the United States . However , Brauer suggests that Ortiz sent it to his gallery in New York , where it caused a controversy . According to Time , the painting was acquired by Leon Mantashev c . 1913 , after the painting was returned to Chabas . 
 A 1935 article in the Montreal Gazette , meanwhile , stated that the original September Morn had yet to go to the United States , and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev . According to Chabas , this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting , but was unwilling to pay the asking price . In her memoirs , Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York , and that – although he had been interested in acquiring the original – he had been unable to do so . Although it is possible that the original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913 , it is clear that reproductions did .

 A full @-@ size reproduction of September Morn was displayed in a window of Jackson and <unk> , a photography shop in Chicago , Illinois , in March 1913 . A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent , insisted it be taken down . The mayor of the city , Carter Harrison , Jr . , agreed with the policeman 's decision , and deemed that the image could be sold , but should not be displayed in public as children could see it . Fred Jackson , the owner , was charged with indecency , and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18 . 
 In front of a jury , the city 's art censor Jeremiah O 'Connor testified that September Morn was lewd and should not be displayed in public , but rather only in a museum exhibition . W. W. Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed , arguing that , as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public , September Morn had to be banned . Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors , educators , and clergy , such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young and the head of the Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton . 
 Jackson , acting as his own lawyer , highlighted the hypocrisy of censoring the painting while a nude statue of Diana stood in front of the Montgomery Ward Building . He called upon painters , poets , and sculptors as his witnesses , including the artist Oliver Grover and the art critic Walter Smith . In his testimony , Grover stated " A nude woman is no more indecent than a bare tree . Men and women weren 't born with overcoats on . Anyhow , indecency may be decidedly apart from nudity . " 
 After less than an hour of deliberations , the jury found for Jackson , allowing him to reinstate the image in his display ; Jackson was so pleased that he promised a free copy of September Morn to each juror . Ten days after the trial Mayor Harrison went to the city council and proposed stricter obscenity laws . The city government agreed , and imposed a $ 25 – 100 fine for displaying nude art along public roads and in places frequented by children . By September Jackson ( together with fellow art dealers Samuel Meyer and William Kuhl ) had been found in violation of this law . Mayor Harrison later stated that he was " through " with the painting , saying " Chicago has been made the laughing stock of the whole country because of this bathing girl picture " . 
 = = = = New York = = = = 
 Further controversy arose in New York in May 1913 , two months after the conclusion of the Chicago trial . Anthony Comstock , head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and nationally recognized for his campaigns against " smut " , saw September Morn – sources differ as to whether it was the original or a print – on display in the window of Braun and Company , an art dealership on West 46th Street . Rushing inside , he raged " There 's too little morn and too much maid ! Take it out ! " . A clerk , James Kelly , removed the work , but Ortiz , the gallery 's manager , reinstated it in the window after returning from his lunch break . 
 Comstock threatened Ortiz with legal action , and the manager – unaware that Comstock could not arrest him , and fearful that he could cause trouble for the gallery – was initially frightened . He consulted with Arthur Brisbane of the New York Evening Journal , who told him he had nothing to fear , and sent some reporters to cover the story . The following day , the controversy was highly covered in the press , who hailed Ortiz as " one art expert with the courage to stand up against Comstock and his dictatorship " . Following Comstock 's visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company , ogling September Morn . The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of September Morn , so that it could remain in his window . 
 After two weeks , when the dealership had sold every print it had , Ortiz removed the display . In a letter to the editor of The New York Times , he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself , and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop , who blocked paying customers from entering it . Ultimately , Comstock did not pursue legal action . The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn 's status as a work of art , whereas Gerald Carson , writing in American Heritage , attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work . 
 The controversy promoted polemics regarding September Morn and censorship , and multiple editorial cartoons ; one depicted a young woman bathing , only her head showing , with a caption attributed to Comstock reading " Don 't you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water ? " . Comstock called the work " demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young " , arguing that it must be suppressed in the interest of the children . He emphasized that " the law is the law ... the picture will have to come out of the window " . Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew 's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach , explaining that " so vivid a display of nudity as September Morn " would best not be displayed in the United States , owing to the people 's relative lack of appreciation for art . 
 Other , more positive , views were also expressed . The suffragist Inez Milholland defended September Morn , stating that it was " exquisite and delicate , depicting perfect youth and innocence " , and found it " funny , if it weren 't so sad " that such a work would be censored while more titillating film posters were left untouched . The social activist Rose Pastor Stokes wrote that this " glorious work of art " was a " rare " depiction of " the loveliest dream that nature ever made real — the human Body Beautiful " and that shame over one 's body should not be blamed on September Morn , but on a failed education system . The artist James Montgomery Flagg proclaimed " only a diseased mind can find anything immoral in September Morn " . 
 In his 1931 autobiography , the public relations pioneer Harry Reichenbach claimed responsibility for the controversy surrounding September Morn – and the work 's resulting popularity . He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2 @,@ 000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell , and then hired him for $ 45 so that he could unload the stock . They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display . Reichenbach , he stated , then contacted public figures to protest against the display . When there was no response , he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership , where some young children , whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each , lusted over the display . The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work , prints of which had already increased in price – from 10 cents to a dollar . 
 = = = = Widespread reproduction and imitation = = = = 
 A 1937 Salt Lake Tribune article stated that , after the 1913 controversies , reproductions of September Morn were shown " on the front page of every newspaper in the land " . Ortiz required these newspapers to pay a charge and mention his copyright , otherwise face a penalty of $ 500 to $ 1000 ; Chase recalled that Vogue had been one of those charged . These newspaper reproductions , however , were sometimes censored . Fred L. Boalt of The Seattle Star , covering a local exhibit of a reproduction , explained his newspaper 's rationale for such censorship : " For humane as well as other reasons , [ ... ] the Star artist has painted in a short petticoat . He didn 't want to do it . He suffered . But we made him do it . " 
 Lithograph copies of September Morn were mass @-@ produced for popular sale , extending the success that followed the scandal , and were widely hung in private homes . Reproductions were featured on a variety of products , including cigar bands , postcards , bottle openers , statuettes , watch fobs , and candy boxes ; the model was also popular as a tattoo . September Morn was the first nude used for calendars , and by the late 1950s it had featured on millions . A couplet referring to Chabas 's work , " Please don 't think I 'm bad or bold , but where its deep it 's awful cold " , was widely circulated . 
 Media and merchandise 
 Allusions to the painting were common in vaudeville acts , becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit . Stage imitations of the painting were also created . In 1913 , for instance , Florenz Ziegfeld , Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model as part of his Follies . In this successful version of September Morn , the subject bore a sheer cape , with leaves placed strategically over her body , and stood on a stage made @-@ up as water . A burlesque act , deeming itself the " September Morning Glories " , was also created , as was a three @-@ act musical based on the painting . The latter – featuring a fifty @-@ strong chorus line – was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill , Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago . In Milwaukee , a man wearing " little or no clothing " passed himself off as " September Morn " at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair ; he was brought to trial and fined $ 25 . Theatrical references to the painting continued into the 1950s . For instance , in Tennessee Williams 's 1957 play Orpheus Descending , the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he " might keep turning the light on to take another look at it " . 
 September Morn also inspired several films . A two @-@ reel production by Pathé , titled September Morn , was released in February 1914 and followed the misadventures of a sailor who gets a tattoo of the model . After his girlfriend disapproves , he tries clothing the naked woman with a ripped skirt , but this fails to gain his lover 's approval ; ultimately , he ends up with a fully clothed nude and the text " Votes for Women " inked on his arm . Meanwhile , September Mourning , a November 1915 release produced by L @-@ KO , portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of a young woman in the park , then invading a school for girls . Robert <unk> , reviewing for Moving Picture World , found the film funny , but considered it to lack plot . A third film , Lois Weber 's Hypocrites , portrayed " The Naked Truth " ( an uncredited Margaret Edwards ) in a manner similar to Chabas 's model . 
 Several songs inspired by September Morn were likewise released . Musicians Frank Black and Bobby Heath penned a song , " September Morn " , based on the painting , and Aubrey Stauffer of Chicago published sheet music ( for voice and piano ) of " Oh , You September Morn " , from Gillespie and Tannehill 's musical . At Tin Pan Alley , Henry I. Marshall composed two works , a waltz for piano titled " Matin de Septembre ( September Morn ) " , and a piece for voice and piano titled " September Morn ( I 'd Like to Meet Her ) " , the latter featuring lyrics by Stanley Murphy . Both were published through Jerome H. Remick & Co. in 1913 . 
 As interest grew , purity societies attempted to ban reproductions of September Morn , and people in possession of them ran the risk of confiscation and fines . Postcards bearing the painting were banned from the postal system . Harold Marx , a New Orleans art dealer who displayed a reproduction , was arrested a month after being told to take the painting down ; displays of reproductions were also forcibly removed in Miami and Atlanta . In Chicago , a man was charged with disorderly conduct after bringing home a reproduction . Irene Deal , who dressed in a union suit and posed as " Miss September Morn " in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , as a publicity stunt , was controversially fined $ 50 for disorderly conduct . In 1914 , students at the College of Wooster in Wooster , Ohio , burned a copy of the painting for being against their religious beliefs . 
 Ultimately some 7 million reproductions of September Morn , prints of which remained popular as late as the 1960s , were sold . Reichenbach characterized this popularity as a " laugh on the overzealous guardians of virtue " in which the entire American populace participated . Inspired by the commercial success of September Morn , displays of images of nude women became more common ; a New York Times reader wrote in 1915 that they had become " increasingly vulgar and suggestive " . 
 In 1937 Life deemed September Morn " one of the most familiar paintings in the world " , and a retrospective Toledo Blade article characterized the model as having become America 's number one pin @-@ up girl . Writing in 1957 , Considine declared September Morn to be " the most controversial painting in the history of [ the United States ] " , and the New York Post declared it " the most famous nude till the Marilyn Monroe calendar " . Carson wrote in 1961 that September Morn had caused " the most heated controversy over nudity , art , and morals " in the United States since Hiram Powers ' statue The Greek Slave in the 1840s . 
 = = = Russia and Paris = = = 
 The oil baron Leon Mantashev acquired the original September Morn in c . 1913 , for a price of $ 10 @,@ 000 and brought it with him to Russia . After the outbreak of the October Revolution the painting was feared destroyed . Following Mantashev 's escape from Russia , pieces of his sizeable collection that were considered to have artistic value were sent to museums , but there was no information regarding works such as September Morn . By 1933 Chabas was seeking information regarding his work 's fate , which The Milwaukee Journal suggested was " hanging in some crowded Russian room , its owner perhaps completely ignorant of its world fame " . At the time several American galleries had copies purported to be the original . 
 The painting , however , was safe ; Mantashev had smuggled it out of the country , reportedly " rip [ ping ] it out of its frame " when the revolution broke out . In the early 1930s , in desperate need of funds , he sold September Morn to the Armenian art collector and philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian for $ 30 @,@ 000 ; it was the last painting he owned . A United Press reporter discovered the painting , which was framed as a tondo , in Gulbenkian 's Paris home in 1935 . There it hung with works by artists such as Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne . By 1937 September Morn was on display in the Musée du Luxembourg , hung between works by Jean @-@ François <unk> and Eugène Carrière . After Gulbenkian 's death in 1955 , the painting was acquired by <unk> and Company of New York . 
 = = = Acquisition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art = = = 
 September Morn was purchased by the Philadelphia broker and sportsman William Coxe Wright for $ 22 @,@ 000 in 1957 . In April of that year he offered it to the Philadelphia Museum of Art , but the painting was rejected for having " no relation to the stream of 20th century art " . Eventually he anonymously donated the work – valued at an estimated $ 30 @,@ 000 – to the Met in New York City . Speaking for the museum , Dudley T. Easby explained that , although the painting could not be classified as a masterpiece , it was nevertheless " a part of art history in view of the controversy that raged around the picture in earlier years " . 
 After acquisition , in September 1957 the painting was displayed near the Met 's front entrance , taking a place previously occupied by the <unk> Altarpiece . This position of honor was held for several weeks . Hughes reported a " veritable pilgrimage " of visitors came to see the painting , which she considered to add a " fresh , popular appeal " to the Met which drew museum @-@ goers who would never have come otherwise . By then , the earlier scandal of the model 's nudity had lessened ; discussing an exhibit of the painting in Toledo , Ohio , Alan <unk> of the Toledo Blade quoted a viewer as saying that 1950s America was so inundated with racy calendar art that the painting " couldn 't stand the competition " . 
 After September Morn was acquired by the Met , it was displayed at several venues , including the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco in 1958 , the Toledo Museum of Art in Toledo , Ohio ( also 1958 ) , and by the Municipal Art Commission of Los Angeles in 1959 . Six years later it was again exhibited at Palace of the Legion of Honor , as part of an exhibition of works collected by the Wrights . In 1971 , the Met removed September Morn from display and placed it in storage ; Walter <unk> of The Milwaukee Journal wrote that the once @-@ racy painting was now considered " too tame and banal " . As of September 2014 , the Met 's website lists the painting as not on display , though it had been hung in the museum around 2011 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In 1913 , Chabas stated that he was " pained and humiliated " by the controversy over September Morn , though he later expressed more positive views . He described the work as " all I know of painting " , and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece . In a 1914 interview , he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting , as it " was [ his ] wife 's favorite picture " . At the time of his death in 1937 , Chabas had only a single picture in his room : a reproduction of the painting , completed from memory ; he had boasted " If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it , I could make a perfect copy . " However , not having copyrighted the work , he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States ; he recalled , " Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars . " 
 Reviewing the painting after the Salon , <unk> in the Larousse <unk> illustré praised Chabas 's technique as drawing " of a rare purity " , and modeling " of a remarkable delicacy " . Henri Frantz , reviewing the Paris Salon for The International Studio , described September Morn as " one of the [ Salon ] ' s most remarkable figure subjects " , highlighting the nude 's " graceful form " . In Le Temps , François Thiébault @-@ Sisson found that , despite an " excessively translucent technique " , the painting had " indisputable charm " and included " superior , very artistic , and delicately composed " imagery . A 1913 article in the Oregon Daily Journal described the model as " beautifully drawn " , and suggested that " it requires a powerful imagination to find anything suggestive in the work " . 
 Later reviews were less positive . The director of the Met , James <unk> , wrote in 1957 that September Morn stood at " different ends of a wide spectrum " than the works of Old Masters and " modern giants " , but was important in helping viewers " realize the full benefit of our heritage " in their explorations of past and present art . That year , the Montreal Gazette 's art critic opined that the painting was banal and unacceptable for display in the Met 's main hall . The reviewer suggested that September Morn , with its " delicate , pearly tonality and simple , sparse , airy composition " , would be best served by being displayed among works considered better by early 20th @-@ century collectors but since reviewed poorly , to " <unk> [ e ] for the public the danger of too @-@ hasty judgments " . 
 In 1958 , Blake @-@ More Godwin of the Toledo Museum of Art stated that , although September Morn was certainly art , it was not " great art " and was overshadowed by the controversy it had created ; the painting , he said , " bears the same relationship to art as a minor poem does to the classic and the imperishable " . Three years later , in an article in The Kenyon Review , Alfred Werner described September Morn as a " classic of kitsch " and " the ' idealized ' nude at its worst " : " without a wrinkle of the skin , without any breathing of the flesh ... pink , soft , spineless " . This classification of kitsch has been applied by several further writers , including Kendrick and the film scholar Norman Taylor . 
 Several writers have included September Morn in lists of works depicting children with erotic or pornographic subtexts . Brauer argues that although the nude " seems to embody the moral purity at puberty " , this innocence is actually a fetishistic mechanism which both allowed the work to pass the censors and be eroticised . She concludes that the painting is " <unk> provocative " , and that Chabas was protected from censure by his status as an established artist and father . Such views have not been universally held . For instance , the historian Paul S. Boyer describes September Morn as " charmingly innocent " , and the art writer Elizabeth <unk> finds the painting to be " offensive only on the grounds of blandness " .

 Lismore ( Scottish Gaelic : Lios Mòr , pronounced [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ] possibly meaning " great enclosure " , or " garden " ) is an island of some 2 @,@ 351 hectares ( 9 @.@ 1 sq mi ) in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland . The climate is damp and mild , with over 166 centimetres ( 65 in ) of rain recorded annually . This fertile , low @-@ lying island was once a major centre of Celtic Christianity , with a 6th @-@ century monastery associated with Saint Moluag and later became the seat of the medieval Bishop of Argyll . There are numerous ruined structures including a broch and two 13th @-@ century castles . 
 During the 19th century various new industries were introduced , including lime quarrying . During the early decades of this century the population exceeded 1 @,@ 000 followed by a lengthy decline . Although resident numbers are now less than 200 , there was a small increase from 2001 to 2011 . About a third of the population were recorded as Gaelic speaking at the former date . The modern economy is largely based on farming , fishing and tourism and the largest settlement is Achnacroish . Various shipwrecks have been recorded in the vicinity . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Gaelic name , <unk> , means " garden " or " enclosure " , and mòr is simply " big " or " great " reflecting either the fertility of the island amidst mountainous surroundings , or the presence of a defined area surrounding the early monastery . One of the earliest English language references is to " <unk> " recorded in the 16th century . 
 Achnacroish is from Achadh na <unk> and means " the field of the cross " . The other small settlements are Clachan ( village with a church ) and Port Ramsay opposite Eilean Ramsay ( Ramsay 's isle ) . Most of the surrounding islets have descriptive names such as Eilean Dubh ( black island ) , Eilean nan <unk> ( isle of the <unk> ) and Pladda ( flat island , from Old Norse ) . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The island of Lismore lies in Loch Linnhe , north east of Mull , in the Argyll and Bute council area . To the east is an arm of Loch Linnhe known as the Lynn of Lorn . Composed almost entirely of Dalradian limestone with interbedded black slate , Lismore has fertile soil and an abundance of trees and shrubs including ash and sycamore . The topography consists of sheltered furrows of land between raised areas that run longitudinally up the island 's spine . 
 The area of the island is 2 @,@ 351 hectares ( 9 @.@ 1 sq mi ) and the highest elevation is Barr Mòr in the south above Kilcheran , which reaches only 127 metres ( 417 ft ) . ( Haswell @-@ Smith ranks Lismore as the 50th offshore Scottish island by height ) . 
 There are several lochs on the island , the largest of which are Loch <unk> in the southwest , Kilcheran Loch 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) further north and Loch Baile a ' <unk> north of Achnacroish . These three water bodies form the Lismore Lochs Special Area of Conservation , which status is accorded as they are amongst the best examples of lakes on a limestone substrate in Scotland . The alkaline waters are very clear and low in nutrients and support the rare Chara <unk> C. rudis and C. <unk> . C. <unk> , has also been recorded . The lochs lie longitudinally down the island and are of roughly similar size . The total surface area of all three combined is approximately 32 hectares ( 79 acres ) and they are inhabited by trout . 
 The whole of Scotland was subjected to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch . A sign of this on Lismore is the presence of rock @-@ cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate both the existence of changing sea @-@ levels and in some areas of the northern coast they also betray the presence of ice by the striation marks on the rocks . 
 Lismore is part of the ancient district of Lorne and is said to lie " in the cockpit " of this territory . In the modern day it is at the heart of the Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area , one of 40 in Scotland . The views from Barr Mòr , the island 's highest point are superlative . Although only of modest size , from there " the <unk> is vast and made so not by its emptiness , but by the throng of high and pointed hills lifting out of the glittering seas and islands . Nowhere else on the Highland coast can you enjoy a view of the mountainous mainland to equal this one . " 
 The offshore islets of Eilean na <unk> and Eilean Dubh in the Lynn of Lorn and Bernera , Dubh Sgeir and Eilean <unk> in the Lynn of Morvern to the west are extensively used by common seals and form the Eileanan <unk> <unk> Lios mòr Special Area of Conservation . The whole island of Bernera is also a SSSI , its limestone maritime cliffs being a key feature along with the presence of the nationally scarce rock whitebeam . Creag Island and Pladda are other islets in the Lynn of Lorn . Eilean nan <unk> , Eilean Loch <unk> , Inn Island , Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay are amongst another cluster of small islands off the north coast . Lismore Lighthouse , built by Robert Stevenson , lies on the small island of Eilean <unk> to the south west with Lady 's Rock a kilometer further away in the same direction .

 Lismore has a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters . The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is Dunstaffnage on the mainland north of Oban .

 There are various Bronze Age cairns on the island . <unk> Castle is an Iron Age broch of an uncertain date that is a prominent landmark on Lismore 's east coast . The walls have an average thickness of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) enclosing a circular court about 12 @.@ 2 metres ( 40 ft ) in diameter . The wall still stands 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high and reaches 4 @.@ 9 metres ( 16 ft ) in the southeast . There is a second possible broch site at An Dun south of Loch <unk> and these are amongst the most southerly examples of these enigmatic fortifications . The are also various duns on the island that may date to the first or second centuries AD . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early Christianity and Scandinavian influence = = = 
 Lismore was an important centre of Celtic Christianity from an early date . The Iona Chronicle records the death of Mo @-@ <unk> ( also known as Moluag ) , who was probably abbot of the Lismore monastery in 594 , and of his successors Neman in 613 and Eochaid in 637 . There is , however , no reason to suppose that this was a daughter house of Columba 's abbey on Iona itself . Lismore probably maintained its status as the principal religious house of the Cenél Loairn during the remainder of the 7th century and the deaths of abbots <unk> c . 700 , Colmán in 704 and <unk> ua <unk> in 718 are recorded in the Annals of Ulster . Five further such obituaries are recorded in the latter half of the 8th century . 
 Lismore was part of the kingdom of Dalriada in the 6th century and probably thereafter until the arrival of the Vikings in the late 8th century , after which it is likely the island was absorbed into the Norse @-@ Gael Kingdom of the Isles . Magnus Barelegs had established direct Norwegian overlordship over this sprawling sea kingdom by 1098 . In that year , Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus which settled much of the boundary between the Scots and Norwegian claims in these islands . Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides but there were a few exceptions including Luing and Lismore , which were retained by the Scots . 
 = = = Medieval period = = = 
 Lismore later became the seat of the medieval Bishopric of Argyll . Prior to the late 12th century the Bishopric of Dunkeld included all of Argyll but sometime between 1183 and 1193 they were separated as apparently the then Bishop John Scotus was unable to speak Gaelic . Lismore became the seat of the new Bishop and he and his successors were known as Episcopi <unk> but a papal mandate in 1249 proposed that the see be transferred to " some more secure and accessible place " . In the event St Moluag 's cathedral at Clachan maintained its position until 1507 when the diocese 's centre was moved to Saddell in Kintyre . It was burned down during the Reformation and only the choir survives in greatly altered form , the nave and western tower having been reduced to their foundations . There is also evidence of an enclosure of likely medieval date . 
 The ruins of <unk> Castle stand on the summit of a rocky promontory on the coast west of Clachan . There is the outline of an oblong hall @-@ house , which may be 13th century and an irregularly shaped bailey , likely of a later date . A tidal fish trap , of unknown age , is located in the small bay to the south @-@ east of the castle . To the north @-@ east of the castle are the remains of a stone @-@ walled fort . 
 The remains of <unk> Castle west of Achnacroish is also thought to date back to the thirteenth century . Built by the MacDougalls around 1290 who held it throughout the fourteenth century , the castle is then thought to have been held by the Bishops of Argyll until the mid sixteenth century . The castle overlooks the island of Bernera . 
 In the 16th century Donald Monro provided a brief description of the island in Scots : <unk> , ane <unk> <unk> <unk> ure is , <unk> <unk> . This <unk> is four myle lang , with ane <unk> kirke in it . ( " Lismore , an isle where lead ore is , opposite Duart . This isle is four miles long , with a parish church on it " . ) Monro 's Description of the Western Isles of Scotland also mentions Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay . He stated that both were " good for corn and store " and had many " Elders and thorns " and that Eilean Droineach was the " habitation of Bishops and Nobles in auld times " . However , the view of Munro ( 1961 ) is that this last comment more properly applies to the larger " Ramsay Isle " . 
 Lismore is the home of the Clan MacLea , who claim kinship with the Livingstone family , and who were recognised by the Lord Lyon in 2002 . The <unk> nam Baran , which is adjacent to the site Saint Moluag 's church , may be the burial ground of its clan chiefs , or " barons " . The current chief , Niall Livingstone of <unk> , is the " <unk> of Saint Moluag " and since the 16th century or earlier , the hereditary keeper of the saint 's crozier or pastoral staff known as the <unk> Mòr .

 In 1707 , the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland and Lismore became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain . Thereafter taxes on whisky distillation rose dramatically and much of Scotland ’ s distillation was either shut down or forced underground until the 1823 Excise Act provided a legal framework for the industry . The remains of at least two illicit stills from this period have been found on Lismore . 
 In 1749 the ruins of the old cathedral were trimmed down from their remaining height , given a roof and turned into a parish church with a bell tower . 
 In the 19th century lime was quarried , particularly on the west coast . The ruined remains of the quarriers cottages can still be seen on Eilean nan <unk> and Inn Island and old lime kilns can be seen at <unk> , Port na <unk> and Port Ramsay , the last lime being produced in 1934 . The remains of another two kilns can be seen at Kilcheran near Lismore Seminary , a Roman Catholic divinity school that was in operation from 1803 to 1828 at a time when the other inhabitants of the island were staunchly Presbyterian . 
 John Stuart McCaig , the architect of McCaig 's Tower in Oban was born on Lismore in the 19th century as was the folklorist Alexander Carmichael . Overlooking Lismore Bay is a Celtic Cross , a memorial to Waverley Arthur Cameron , the son of Duncan Cameron , inventor of the " Waverley " nib pen and the owner of The Oban Times newspaper . Waverley was drowned in 1891 when his yacht foundered off the coast nearby . 
 There have been various other shipwrecks in the vicinity . In 1889 the paddle steamer Mountaineer lived up to its name by clambering onto Lady 's Rock , the damage to which was still visible in 1995 . In 1905 the MacBrayne steamship Clydesdale hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind . The harbour patrol craft <unk> was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with , according to one report , the loss of two lives . The trawler <unk> Solway Firth foundered south of this position in 1977 . 
 Lismore , like other Hebridean islands , has suffered from depopulation since the 19th century , in large part due to the Clearances . In 1798 there were 900 people living on the island and 1399 by 1841 . Over the next 40 years the population more than halved to 621 . By 1961 there were only 155 residents and by the time of the 1991 census 140 . There are various examples of abandoned townships , such as <unk> nam Bard on the east coast . In the 2001 census , the population had risen slightly to 146 , over 45 % of whom were over 60 years old , making it the Scottish island with the oldest population . 
 = = Present day = = 
 The island 's population was recorded as 192 at the 2011 census , an increase of over 30 % since 2001 . During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . The majority of the resident working population are engaged in farming or fishing , and sheep raised on the island have a reputation for quality . Most of the land is owned by the Duke of Argyll , with the farmers being tenants . 
 Prior to 2007 there was no mains supply of drinking water on the island , water being supplied instead from wells and springs . In that year the then Scottish Executive announced plans for a mains supply to be provided at a cost of £ 1 million : a pipe was laid under Loch Linnhe and work was to begin on laying about 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) of pipes across Lismore . However , Scottish Water later decided to supply water from boreholes instead . 
 The island is linked to the mainland by two ferries , a vehicle ferry making the crossing to Oban and a passenger ferry making a shorter crossing from the northern tip of the island to Port Appin . The <unk> is the main road on the island , which it traverses from Kilcheran in the south to Port Ramsay in the north . 
 There are various tourist facilities on Lismore , including a cafe and a post office . Bicycles may be hired at Port Appin . There is no petrol filling station . In 2001 29 % of the population of the island spoke Gaelic and maintaining this heritage is one of the aims of the Comann <unk> Lios Mòr , the Lismore Gaelic Heritage Centre . 
 Lismore is part of the multi @-@ member ward of Oban , Lorn and the Isles in the Argyll and Bute council area . The island is represented by Mike Russell of the SNP at the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh who was elected for the Argyll and Bute constituency in 2011 and by Brendan O 'Hara of the SNP at the Westminster parliament in London .

 " The Piper 's Cave " is a local story about a piper and his dog . According to Alexander Carmichael , the piper entered the Uamh @-@ <unk> ( the " cave of pain " ) and intended to exit through the Uamh @-@ an @-@ <unk> ( the " cave of the man " ) . The sounds of his bagpipes could be heard throughout the island . When the piping ceased the dog emerged sightless and hairless but the piper was presumed to have drowned in one of the cave 's impassable pools and was never seen again . His lament is recorded as : 
 Mis air <unk> <unk> ' us <unk> I was drowning and howling 
 <unk> nan <unk> <unk> Amongst the horrid pools 
 Another story has St Moluag and St <unk> conducting a boat race across the Lynn of Lorn with the first to land on Lismore having the right to found a monastery there . Realising that he was going to lose , Moluag cut off his finger and threw it ashore north of the broch of <unk> , enabling him to claim victory . 
 The Book of the Dean of Lismore was complied by the titular dean , James MacGregor , in the 15th century . Held in the National Library of Scotland , it is " one of the greatest treasures " of early Gaelic writing . However it was written in Fortingall , Perthshire and its connection with Lismore itself , if any , is uncertain . 
 = Typhoon Roy = 
 Typhoon Roy , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Asiang , was the second @-@ most intense January tropical cyclone on record in the Western Pacific basin . Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on January 7 , 1988 , Roy quickly intensified as it moved through the Marshall Islands . By January 9 , the storm intensified into a typhoon and attained its peak intensity the following day . At its peak , sustained winds reached 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) . Slight weakening took place before the storm moved through the Mariana Islands . Continuing westward , the system eventually struck the Philippines as a minimal typhoon before dissipating over the South China Sea on January 19 . 
 Throughout its track , Typhoon Roy was responsible for two fatalities and $ 28 @.@ 5 million ( 1988 USD ) in losses , mainly in the Mariana Islands . Light to moderate structural damage took place across the Marshall Islands as the system moved through the region as a tropical storm . On January 12 , the typhoon caused widespread damage to Guam and Rota as it brushed the two islands , destroying at least 200 homes . Due to the severity of damage wrought by the storm , the name Roy was retired following its usage and was replaced with the name Ryan . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Roy originated from an area of disturbed weather in early January 1988 in the central Pacific . Above average sea surface temperatures in the area allowed for gradual development as convection increased . By January 6 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance for the possibility of it developing into a tropical cyclone ; a mirror system was present in the Southern Hemisphere at the same time . The system south of the equator eventually developed into Tropical Cyclone Anne . By January 7 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression ; shortly thereafter , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the depression . Early on January 8 , the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 08W , at which time the system was located near the Marshall Islands . 
 Tracking nearly due west , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Roy six hours after the first advisory based on satellite data . By this time , the JMA had already classified Roy as a tropical storm . Continued deepening took place as the storm moved through the Marshall Islands ; weather radar data from Kwajalein Atoll indicated the formation of an eye several hours after Roy was named ; this was later supported by satellite information on January 9 , at which time the storm was upgraded to a typhoon . Embedded within a moderate east @-@ southeasterly flow along the south side of a subtropical ridge , the typhoon accelerated , obtaining a forward speed of 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) . 
 During the afternoon of January 10 , Roy reached its peak intensity as a low @-@ range Category 4 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale , attaining peak winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) . At the same time , the JMA estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) along with a barometric pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) . Upon reaching this strength , the storm was situated roughly 945 km ( 587 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Guam . Over the following few days , Roy gradually slowed and weakened as it neared the Mariana Islands . The storm made its closest approach to the islands early on January 12 , passing within 14 km ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) south of Rota . As the storm passed through the region , a new ridge built east of the typhoon , causing Roy to temporarily track southwestward before resuming a westward movement . 
 Moving along the southern edge of the ridge , Roy accelerated again as it headed towards the Philippines . On January 14 , the storm crossed 135 ° E , prompting the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration to issue advisories on Roy , assigning it with the local name Asiang . As it neared the country , wind shear began to increase , resulting in further weakening . On January 16 , Roy made landfall in the Bicol Region as a minimal typhoon before succumbing to shear and increased friction with the mountains of the Philippines . Later that day , the system weakened to a tropical storm before entering the South China Sea . The JTWC downgraded Roy to a tropical depression during the afternoon of January 17 and ceased issuing advisories early the next day . However , the JMA continued to monitor Roy as a tropical storm until the morning of January 18 and declared the system dissipated early on January 19 , at which time the depression was situated roughly 700 km ( 435 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On January 8 , Roy passed near the Majuro island chain in the Marshall Islands as a minimal tropical storm . Sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) and gusts up to 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) affected the area , resulting in minor structural damage . Later that day , the intensifying storm passed close to Kwajalein Atoll , bringing strong winds and large swells . Moderate structural damage took place on Kwajalein Island where winds gusted up to 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Just to the north , more severe damage was recorded on Ebeye Island where low @-@ lying areas were inundated by waves between 6 @.@ 1 and 6 @.@ 7 m ( 20 and 22 ft ) . Approximately one third of the homes on Ebeye were destroyed by the storm . One person was killed and damage was estimated at $ 5 million ( 1988 USD ) . An estimated 3 @,@ 500 people were left homeless as a result of Roy in the Marshall Islands . 
 Ahead of Roy 's arrival in the Mariana Islands and Guam , the public was given sufficient warning by the local disaster preparedness team . An estimated 1 @,@ 200 people evacuated to shelters across Guam and all flights to and from the island were canceled for January 12 . 
 On January 12 , Typhoon Roy passed through the Mariana Islands and Guam , causing moderate structural damage and extensive crop losses . On Guam alone , agricultural losses reached $ 23 @.@ 5 million ( 1988 USD ; $ 47 million 2016 USD ) . Most structural damage was limited to broken windows on the island . Located within 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) of Roy 's eye during its passage of the Mariana Islands , Rota received the worst damage from the cyclone . Winds on the island gusted up to 193 km / h ( 120 mph ) , wreaking havoc to structures and vegetation . At least 200 of the 450 of homes on Rota were destroyed and the remainder were damaged ; 95 % of the power poles fell across the island , resulting in severe disruption to daily life . Roughly 80 % of the concrete homes had their windows blown out . Four people were injured after the roof of one building was blown into another where people had sought shelter . One person died after suffering a heart attack induced by the storm . In the wake of the storm , the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency for Guam . 
 The last area affected by Typhoon Roy was the Philippines , which was struck by the storm on January 16 . Prior to the storm 's arrival , typhoon warnings were raised for 29 provinces in the country , including the capital city of Manila . In the Bicol Region , winds likely reached typhoon intensity ; however , no known damage took place in the area . Continuing westward , the Roy brought gale @-@ force winds to parts of southern Luzon before moving into the South China Sea . Low @-@ lying areas in the storm 's path were flooded by heavy rains and strong winds downed power lines in Sorsogon . 
 = = Records and retirement = = 
 Since the JMA kept reliable records in 1951 , Roy became the ninth known typhoon to develop during the month of January as well as the second most intense during the month , attaining a minimum pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) . It also attained the second @-@ highest sustained winds during January , estimated at 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . According to the JTWC , Roy was the third @-@ most intense typhoon during the month , attaining peak winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) and an estimated pressure of 927 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 37 inHg ) . In addition to intensity records , Typhoon Roy also was an unusually long @-@ lived storm , spanning 12 days from formation to dissipation . This ranks it as the second @-@ longest lived storm during January , just 12 hours short of Typhoon Alice in 1979 . 
 Due to the severity of damage wrought by Typhoon Roy , the name was retired following its usage and replaced with Ryan . Since little damage took place in the Philippines , the name Asiang was not retired and was later used for another cyclone . 
 = European robin = 
 The European robin ( Erithacus rubecula ) , known simply as the robin in the British Isles , is a small insectivorous passerine bird , specifically a chat , that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family ( Turdidae ) , but is now considered to be an Old World flycatcher . Around 12 @.@ 5 – 14 @.@ 0 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) in length , the male and female are similar in colouration , with an orange breast and face lined with grey , brown upperparts and a whitish belly . It is found across Europe , east to Western Siberia and south to North Africa ; it is sedentary in most of its range except the far north . 
 The term robin is also applied to some birds in other families with red or orange breasts . These include the American robin ( Turdus migratorius ) , which is a thrush , and the Australasian robins of the family Petroicidae , the relationships of which are unclear . 
 = = Taxonomy and systematics = = 
 The European robin was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Motacilla rubecula . Its specific epithet rubecula is a diminutive derived from the Latin ruber ' red ' . The genus Erithacus was introduced by French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800 , giving the bird its current binomial name of E. rubecula . 
 The genus previously included the Japanese robin and the Ryukyu robin . These east Asian species were shown in molecular phylogenetic studies to be more similar to a group of other Asian species than to the European robin . In a reorganisation of the genera , the Japanese and the Ryukyu robins were moved to the resurrected genus <unk> leaving the European robin as the sole member of Erithacus . The phylogenetic analysis placed Erithacus in the subfamily <unk> which otherwise contained only African species , but its exact position with respect to the other genera was not resolved . 
 The distinctive orange breast of both sexes contributed to the European robin 's original name of redbreast ( orange as the name of a colour was unknown in English until the sixteenth century , by which time the fruit of that name had been introduced ) . In the fifteenth century , when it became popular to give human names to familiar species , the bird came to be known as robin redbreast , which was eventually shortened to robin . As a given name , Robin was originally a diminutive of Robert . Other older English names for the bird include <unk> and <unk> . In American literature of the late 19th century , this robin was frequently called the English robin . The Frisian <unk> or <unk> is similar to the English name , while Dutch <unk> and French rouge @-@ gorge both refer to the distinctively coloured front . 
 The robin belongs to a group of mainly insectivorous birds that have been variously assigned to the thrushes or " flycatchers " , depending on how these groups were perceived taxonomically . Eventually , the flycatcher @-@ thrush assemblage was re @-@ analysed and the genus Erithacus assigned to a group of thrush @-@ like true flycatchers , the tribe <unk> , that also includes the common nightingale and the Old World chats . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 In its large continental Eurasian range , robins vary somewhat , but do not form discrete populations that might be considered subspecies . Robin subspecies are mainly distinguished by forming resident populations on islands and in mountainous areas . The robin found in Ireland , Britain and much of western Europe , Erithacus rubecula melophilus , occurs as a vagrant in adjacent regions . E. r. <unk> from Northwestern Africa , Corsica , and Sardinia closely resembles melophilus but for a shorter wing length . The northeasternmost birds , large and fairly washed @-@ out in colour are E. r. <unk> . In the southeast of its range , E. r. valens of the Crimean Peninsula , E. r. caucasicus of the Caucasus and N Transcaucasia , and E. r. hyrcanus southeastwards into Iran are generally accepted as significantly distinct . 
 On Madeira and the Azores , the local population has been described as E. r. <unk> , and although not distinct in morphology , its isolation seems to suggests the subspecies is valid ( but see below ) . 
 = = = = Canary Islands robin = = = = 
 The most distinct birds are those of Gran Canaria ( E. r. <unk> ) and Tenerife ( E. r. superbus ) , which may be considered two distinct species or at least two different subspecies . It is readily distinguished by a white eye @-@ ring , an intensely coloured breast , and a grey line that separates the orange @-@ red from the brown colouration . Its belly is entirely white . 
 Cytochrome b sequence data and vocalisations indicate that the Gran Canaria / Tenerife robins are indeed very distinct and probably derived from colonisation by mainland birds some 2 million years ago . In addition , Gran Canaria and Tenerife birds are well distinct genetically between each other . 
 Christian <unk> , Hans @-@ Hinrich Witt and Michael Wink published in 2003 in Avian Science a study called " The phylogeographic differentiation of the European robin Erithacus rubecula on the Canary Islands revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequence data and morphometrics : evidence for a new robin taxon on Gran Canaria ? " . In it they concluded that Gran Canaria 's robin diverged genetically from their European relatives as far back as 2 @.@ 3 million years , while the Tenerife ones took half a million years to make this leap , 1 @.@ 8 million years ago . The reason would be a different colonization of the Canaries by this bird , which arrived to the oldest island first ( Gran Canaria ) and subsequently passed to the neighboring island ( Tenerife ) . 
 A thorough comparison between <unk> and superbus is pending to confirm that the first one is effectively a different subspecies . Initial results suggest that birds from Gran Canaria have wings about 10 % shorter than those on Tenerife . The west Canary Islands populations are younger ( Middle Pleistocene ) and only beginning to diverge genetically . Robins from the western Canary Islands : El Hierro , La Palma and La Gomera ( E. ( r . ) <unk> ) are similar to the European ( Erithacus rubecula ) . 
 Finally , the robins which can be found in Fuerteventura are the European ones , which is not surprising as the species does not breed either in this island or in the nearby Lanzarote , they are wintering <unk> or just passing through during their long migrations between Africa and Europe . 
 = = = Other robins = = = 
 The larger American robin ( Turdus migratorius ) is named for its similarity to the European robin , but the two birds are not closely related . The similarity lies largely in the orange chest patch in both species . This American species was incorrectly shown " feathering its nest " in London in the film Mary Poppins , but it only occurs in the UK as a very rare vagrant . 
 Some South and Middle American Turdus thrushes are also named as robins such as the rufous @-@ collared robin . The Australian " robin redbreast " , more correctly the scarlet robin ( Petroica multicolor ) , is more closely related to the crows and jays than it is to the European robin . It belongs to the family Petroicidae , commonly called " Australasian robins " . The red @-@ billed <unk> ( <unk> lutea ) is sometimes named " Pekin robin " by aviculturalists . Another group of Old World Flycatchers , this time from Africa and Asia , is the genus <unk> ; its members are known as magpie @-@ robins , one of which , the Oriental magpie robin ( C. <unk> ) , is the national bird of Bangladesh . 
 = = Description = = 
 The adult European robin is 12 @.@ 5 – 14 @.@ 0 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) long and weighs 16 – 22 g ( 9 / 16 – 13 / 16 oz ) , with a wingspan of 20 – 22 cm ( 8 – 9 in ) . The male and female bear similar plumage ; an orange breast and face ( more strongly coloured in the otherwise similar British subspecies E. r. melophilus ) , lined by a bluish grey on the sides of the neck and chest . The upperparts are brownish , or olive @-@ tinged in British birds , and the belly whitish , while the legs and feet are brown . The bill and eyes are black . Juveniles are a spotted brown and white in colouration , with patches of orange gradually appearing . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The robin occurs in Eurasia east to Western Siberia , south to Algeria and on the Atlantic islands as far west as the Azores and Madeira . It is a vagrant in Iceland . In the south east , it reaches the Caucasus range . Irish and British robins are largely resident but a small minority , usually female , migrate to southern Europe during winter , a few as far as Spain . Scandinavian and Russian robins migrate to Britain and western Europe to escape the harsher winters . These migrants can be recognised by the greyer tone of the upper parts of their bodies and duller orange breast . The European robin prefers spruce woods in northern Europe , contrasting with its preference for parks and gardens in Ireland and Britain . 
 Attempts to introduce the European robin into Australia and New Zealand in the latter part of the 19th century were unsuccessful . Birds were released around Melbourne , Auckland , Christchurch , Wellington and Dunedin by various local acclimatisation societies , with none becoming established . There was a similar outcome in North America as birds failed to establish after being released in Long Island , New York in 1852 , Oregon in 1889 – 92 , and the Saanich Peninsula in British Columbia in 1908 – 10 . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 The robin is diurnal , although has been reported to be active hunting insects on moonlit nights or near artificial light at night . Well known to British and Irish gardeners , it is relatively unafraid of people and drawn to human activities involving the digging of soil , in order to look out for earthworms and other food freshly turned up . Indeed , the robin is considered to be a gardener 's friend and for various folklore reasons the robin would never be harmed . In continental Europe on the other hand , robins were hunted and killed as with most other small birds , and are more wary . Robins also approach large wild animals , such as wild boar and other animals which disturb the ground , to look for any food that might be brought to the surface . In autumn and winter , robins will supplement their usual diet of terrestrial invertebrates , such as spiders , worms and insects , with berries and fruit . They will also eat seed mixtures placed on bird @-@ tables . 
 Male robins are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour . They will attack other males that stray into their territories , and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation . Such attacks sometimes lead to fatalities , accounting for up to 10 % of adult robin deaths in some areas . 
 Because of high mortality in the first year of life , a robin has an average life expectancy of 1 @.@ 1 years ; however , once past its first year it can expect to live longer and one robin has been recorded as reaching 19 years of age . A spell of very low temperatures in winter may also result in significant mortality . This species is parasitised by the moorhen flea , Dasypsyllus gallinulae . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Robins may choose a wide variety of sites for building a nest , in fact anything which can offer some shelter , like a depression or hole may be considered . As well as the usual crevices , or sheltered banks , odder objects include pieces of machinery , barbecues , bicycle handlebars , bristles on upturned brooms , discarded kettles , watering cans , flower pots and even hats . The nest is composed of moss , leaves and grass , with finer grass , hair and feathers for lining . Two or three clutches of five or six eggs are laid throughout the breeding season , which commences in March in Britain and Ireland . The eggs are a cream , buff or white speckled or blotched with reddish @-@ brown colour , often more heavily so at the larger end . When juvenile birds fly from the nests they are mottled brown in colour all over . After two to three months out of the nest , the juvenile bird grows some orange feathers under its chin and over a similar period this patch gradually extends to complete the adult appearance . 
 = = = Vocalisations = = = 
 The robin produces a fluting , warbling song during the breeding season . Both the male and female sing during the winter , when they hold separate territories , the song then sounding more plaintive than the summer version . The female robin moves a short distance from the summer nesting territory to a nearby area that is more suitable for winter feeding . The male robin keeps the same territory throughout the year . During the breeding season , male robins usually initiate their morning song an hour before civil sunrise , and usually terminate their daily singing around thirty minutes after sunset . Nocturnal singing can also occur , especially in urban areas that are artificially lighted during the night . Under artificial light , nocturnal singing can be used by urban robins to actively shunt daytime anthropogenic noise . A variety of calls are also made at any time of year , including a ticking note indicating anxiety or mild alarm . 
 = = = Magnetoreception = = = 
 The avian magnetic compass of the robin has been extensively researched and uses Vision @-@ Based Magnetoreception , in which the robin 's ability to sense the magnetic field of the earth for navigation is affected by the light entering the bird 's eye . The physical mechanism of the robin 's magnetic sense is not fully understood , but may involve quantum entanglement of electron spins . 
 = = Cultural depictions = = 
 The robin features prominently in British folklore , and that of northwestern France , but much less so in other parts of Europe . It was held to be a storm @-@ cloud bird and sacred to Thor , the god of thunder , in Norse mythology . Robins feature in the traditional children 's tale , Babes in the Wood ; the birds cover the dead bodies of the children . 
 More recently , the robin has become strongly associated with Christmas , taking a starring role on many Christmas cards since the mid 19th century . The robin has appeared on many Christmas postage stamps . An old British folk tale seeks to explain the robin 's distinctive breast . Legend has it that when Jesus was dying on the cross , the robin , then simply brown in colour , flew to his side and sang into his ear in order to comfort him in his pain . The blood from his wounds stained the robin 's breast , and thereafter all robins got the mark of Christ 's blood upon them . 
 An alternative legend has it that its breast was scorched fetching water for souls in Purgatory . The association with Christmas , however , more probably arises from the fact that postmen in Victorian Britain wore red jackets and were nicknamed " Robins " ; the robin featured on the Christmas card is an emblem of the postman delivering the card . 
 In the 1960s , in a vote publicised by The Times , the robin was adopted as the unofficial national bird of the UK . In 2015 , the robin was again voted Britain 's national bird in a poll organised by birdwatcher David Lindo , taking 34 % of the final vote . 
 Several English and Welsh sports organisations are nicknamed " The Robins " . These include the professional football clubs Bristol City , Swindon Town , Cheltenham Town ( whose home colours are red ) and , traditionally , Wrexham FC , as well as the English rugby league team Hull Kingston Rovers ( whose home colours are white with a red band ) . A small bird is an unusual choice , although it is thought to symbolise agility in darting around the field . 
 = Croatian Littoral = 
 Croatian Littoral ( Croatian : Hrvatsko <unk> ) is a region of Croatia comprising the area between Dalmatia to the south , Mountainous Croatia to the north and east , and Istria and the Kvarner Gulf of the Adriatic Sea to the west . The term " Croatian Littoral " developed relatively recently , since the 18th and 19th centuries , reflecting the complex development of Croatia in historical and geographical terms . The term Croatian Littoral is also applied to entire Adriatic coast of modern Croatia in general terms , which is then divided into the Southern Croatian Littoral comprising Dalmatia , and the Northern Croatian Littoral comprising Istria and Croatian Littoral in the strict meaning of the term . Croatian Littoral covers 2 @,@ 830 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 090 square miles ) and has a population of 228 @,@ 725 . More than half the region 's population lives in the city of Rijeka — by far the largest urban centre in the area . 
 The foothills of mountains that form the northeast boundary of the region , as well as islands in the Kvarner Gulf , are a part of the Dinaric Alps , making karst topography especially prominent in the Croatian Littoral . The Cres – Lošinj and Krk – Rab island chains divide the Kvarner Gulf into four distinct areas — Rijeka Bay , Kvarner ( sensu stricto ) , <unk> , and Vinodol Channel . The Cres – Lošinj group also includes the inhabited islands of Ilovik , Susak , Unije , Vele Srakane , and Male Srakane , as well as a larger number of small uninhabited islands . Zadar Archipelago extends to the southeast of the island group . Water significantly contributed to the geomorphology of the area , especially in the Bay of Bakar , a ria located between Rijeka and Kraljevica . The most significant inland bodies of water in the region are the 17 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 10 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ) long Rječina River and Lake Vrana on the island of Cres . 
 The region saw frequent changes to its ruling powers since classical antiquity , including the Roman Empire , the Ostrogoths , the Lombards , the Byzantine Empire , the Frankish Empire , and the Croats , some of whose major historical heritage originates from the area — most notably the Baška tablet . The region and adjacent territories became a point of contention between major European powers , including the Republic of Venice , the Kingdom of Hungary , and the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires , as well as Austria , the First French Empire , the Kingdom of Italy , and Yugoslavia . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Croatian Littoral is a geographical region of Croatia comprising the area between Dalmatia to the south , Mountainous Croatia to the north and east , and Istria and the Kvarner Gulf of the Adriatic Sea to the west . The region encompasses a large part of Primorje @-@ Gorski Kotar County and the coastal part of Lika @-@ Senj County . The island of Pag is sometimes included in the region , although it is normally considered to be part of Dalmatia . The islands of Cres , Lošinj , Krk , and Rab , as well as further comparatively small nearby islands , are also considered part of the region , contributing to an alternate name for the region — Kvarner Littoral or Kvarner . Various definitions exist as to the extent of " Croatian Littoral " and " Kvarner Littoral " as geographical terms . Specifically , Kvarner Littoral is variously considered to extend east to Senj , or even further east . On the other hand , Kvarner is normally considered to include Istria east of Učka mountain , making Kvarner synonymous with the coastal areas and islands of Primorje @-@ Gorski Kotar County . The term " Croatian Littoral " developed relatively recently , since the 18th and 19th centuries , reflecting the complex development of Croatia in historical and geographical terms . The term is also applied to the entire Adriatic coast of modern Croatia in general terms , which is then divided into the Southern Croatian Littoral comprising Dalmatia , and the Northern Croatian Littoral comprising Istria and Croatian Littoral in the strict meaning of the term . 
 Croatian Littoral covers 2 @,@ 830 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 090 square miles ) , has a population of 228 @,@ 725 , and the region as a whole has a population density of 80 @.@ 82 / km2 ( 209 @.@ 3 / sq mi ) . The islands , encompassing 1 @,@ 120 square kilometres ( 430 square miles ) , are home to 39 @,@ 450 residents . More than half the region 's population lives in the city of Rijeka — by far the largest urban centre in the area . All other settlements in the region are relatively small , with only four of them exceeding a population of 4 @,@ 000 : Crikvenica , Mali Lošinj ( the largest island settlement ) , Senj , and <unk> . 
 = = = Topography and geology = = = 
 The foothills of mountains that form the northeast boundary of the region , as well as islands in the Kvarner Gulf , are part of the Dinaric Alps , linked to a fold and thrust belt continuously developing from the Late Jurassic to recent times . The thrust belt is a part of the Alpine orogeny and extends southeast from the southern Alps . <unk> the region was formed as the Adriatic Plate is subducted under structural units comprising the Dinaric Alps . The process formed several seismic faults , with most significant among them being the Ilirska Bistrica – Rijeka – Senj fault , which was the source of several significant earthquakes in past centuries . The Dinaric Alps in Croatia encompass the regions of Gorski Kotar and Lika in the immediate hinterland of the Croatian Littoral , as well as considerable parts of Dalmatia . Their northeastern edge runs from 1 @,@ 181 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 875 ft ) Žumberak to the Banovina region , along the Sava River , and their westernmost landforms are the 1 @,@ 272 @-@ metre ( 4 @,@ 173 ft ) <unk> and the 1 @,@ 396 @-@ metre ( 4 @,@ 580 ft ) Učka mountains in Istria to the west of the Croatian Littoral region . 
 Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps and the Croatian Littoral . Though most of the soil in the region developed from carbonate rock , flysch is significantly represented on the Kvarner Gulf coast opposite Krk . The karst topography developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform , where karstification largely began after the final raising of the Dinarides in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs , when carbonate rock was exposed to atmospheric effects such as rain ; this extended to 120 metres ( 390 ft ) below the present sea level , exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum 's sea level drop . It is surmised that some karst formations are related to earlier drops of sea level , most notably the Messinian salinity crisis . 
 Cres – Lošinj and Krk – Rab island chains divide the Kvarner Gulf into four distinct areas : Rijeka Bay , Kvarner ( sensu stricto ) , <unk> , and Vinodol Channel . The Cres – Lošinj group also includes the inhabited islands of Ilovik , Susak , Unije , Vele Srakane , and Male Srakane , as well as a larger number of small , uninhabited islands . Zadar Archipelago extends to the southeast of the island group . The Krk – Rab island group includes only uninhabited islands in addition to Krk and Rab , the largest among them <unk> , Sveti Grgur , <unk> , and <unk> Otok . The Krk – Rab island group is usually thought to represent a single archipelago with the island of Pag ( southeast of Rab ) and islets surrounding Pag . 
 = = = Hydrology and climate = = = 
 The availability of water varies significantly throughout the region . The area between Rijeka and Vinodol contains numerous freshwater springs that are largely tapped for water supply systems . Water significantly contributed to the geomorphology of the area , especially in the Bay of Bakar , a ria located between Rijeka and Kraljevica . At the seaward slopes of Velebit , in areas near Senj and Karlobag , surface watercourses are sparse . They form losing streams flowing to the sea , while springs of lower yield dry up during summer . The most significant watercourse in the region is the 17 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 10 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ) long Rječina River , flowing into the Adriatic Sea in the city of Rijeka . The islands of Cres , Krk , and Lošinj have significant surface water that is used as the primary water supply source on those islands . The most significant among them is Lake Vrana on the island of Cres , containing 220 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 7 @.@ 8 × 109 cubic feet ) of water . The surface of the freshwater lake is at 16 metres ( 52 feet ) above sea level , while its maximum depth is 74 metres ( 243 feet ) . The Gulf of Kvarner is an especially significant area for the preservation of biodiversity . 
 The Kvarner Gulf islands and the immediate mainland coastal areas enjoy a moderately warm and rainy hot @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( Cfa ) , although the southern part of the Lošinj Island enjoys hot @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( Csa ) as defined by the Köppen climate classification . Areas of the Croatian Littoral further away from the coast enjoy a moderately warm and rainy oceanic climate ( Cfb ) , similar to the continental climate of most inland regions of Croatia . The mean monthly temperature varies throughout the region . On the mainland coast it ranges between 5 @.@ 2 ° C ( 41 @.@ 4 ° F ) ( in January ) and 23 ° C ( 73 ° F ) ( in July ) . On the Kvarner Gulf islands the mean monthly temperature is somewhat higher ; it ranges from 7 @.@ 3 ° C ( 45 @.@ 1 ° F ) ( in January ) to 23 @.@ 8 ° C ( 74 @.@ 8 ° F ) ( in July ) , while at higher elevations , in the mountains found along the northern and eastern peripheral areas of the region , temperatures range between − 1 @.@ 2 ° C ( 29 @.@ 8 ° F ) ( in January ) and 16 @.@ 8 ° C ( 62 @.@ 2 ° F ) ( in July ) . The lowest air temperature recorded in the region , − 16 @.@ 6 ° C ( 2 @.@ 1 ° F ) , was measured in Senj , on 10 February 1956 . The islands of Lošinj , Cres , Krk , and Rab receive the most sunshine during the year — with 217 clear days per year on average . Seawater temperatures reach up to 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) in summer , while dipping to 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) in spring and autumn and as low as 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) in winter . The predominant winter winds are the bora and sirocco . The bora is significantly conditioned by wind gaps in the Dinaric Alps bringing cold and dry continental air — the point where it reaches its peak speed is at Senj , with gusts of up to 180 kilometres per hour ( 97 kn ; 110 mph ) . The sirocco brings humid and warm air , often carrying Saharan sand that causes rain dust . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 In the Early Middle Ages , after the decline of the Roman Empire , the Adriatic coasts of the region were ruled by Ostrogoths , Lombards , and the Byzantine Empire . The Carolingian Empire arose in the last part of the period and subsequently the Frankish Kingdom of Italy took control of the Adriatic Sea 's western coast extending to the Kvarner Gulf , while Byzantine control of the opposite coast gradually shrunk following the Avar and Croatian invasions starting in the 7th century . The region was gradually incorporated into the medieval Kingdom of Croatia by the 11th century , when the kingdom reached its territorial peak , and the city of Senj became the most important centre of the region . Items of significance to Croatian historical heritage originated from the region in that period . The most notable among them is the Baška tablet , one of the oldest surviving inscriptions in the Croatian language . 
 The region continued to be contested throughout the High Middle Ages as the Republic of Venice started to expand its influence and territory , gradually pushing back Croatia , which had been in a personal union of Croatia and Hungary since 1102 . By 1420 , Venice controlled Istria and Dalmatia , as well as all the Kvarner Gulf islands except Krk . The island became a part of the realm in 1481 , but Venice never captured the region 's mainland , which would have entirely linked Venetian possessions in the eastern Adriatic . 
 = = = Habsburg era = = = 
 Ottoman conquests led to the Battle of Krbava field ( 1493 ) and the Battle of Mohács ( 1526 ) , both decisive Ottoman victories , the latter of which caused a succession crisis in the Kingdom of Hungary . In the 1527 election in Cetin , Ferdinand I of Habsburg was chosen as the new ruler of Croatia , under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire , which had extended as far as Lika in the immediate hinterland of the region since 1522 . As the region became a point of contention between the Habsburgs , Ottomans , and Venetians , its defense was given high importance in the newly established Croatian Military Frontier , as exemplified by the Uskoks of Senj . After the Ottoman conquest of their original base in Klis , the Uskoks established a new headquarters in <unk> Fortress as a bulwark against westward expansion by the Ottomans . They also launched raids against Christian communities under Ottoman rule and Venetian commerce and subjects . Increasing conflict between the Uskoks and Venice culminated in 1615 – 1617 <unk> War , which resulted in the resettling of the Uskoks , whose final years in Senj were marked by piracy and looting . Between 1684 and 1689 , the Ottomans were forced to retreat from Lika and the entire hinterland of the region . 
 In 1797 the Republic of Venice was abolished after the French conquest . The Venetian territory was then handed over to the Archduchy of Austria . The territory was returned to France after the Peace of Pressburg in 1805 . However , the former Venetian possessions on the eastern Adriatic shore , including the present @-@ day Croatian Littoral , were joined into a set of separate provinces of the French Empire : the Illyrian Provinces , created in 1809 through the Treaty of Schönbrunn . Days before the Battle of Waterloo , the Congress of Vienna awarded the Illyrian Provinces ( spanning from the Gulf of Trieste to the Bay of Kotor ) to the Austrian Empire . 
 In 1816 the Kingdom of Illyria — an Austrian crown land — was carved out of the former French possession . The territory originally included Carinthia , Carniola , Gorizia and Gradisca , Trieste , Istria , Rijeka , and Civil Croatia south of the Sava River , corresponding to present @-@ day Croatian Littoral and Mountainous Croatia , except the island of Rab . The island and the rest of the former Illyrian Provinces were made a separate crown land , named Kingdom of Dalmatia , in 1817 . Rijeka and Civil Croatia were restored to the Kingdom of Croatia and thus the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen in 1822 , reflecting a series of 18th @-@ century royal letters patent assigning Rijeka to Civil Croatia and the Kingdom of Hungary , giving rise to use of the term " Hungarian Littoral " ( Hungarian : Magyar <unk> ) . 
 Illyria was abolished in 1849 and the crown lands of Carinthia , Carniola , and Austrian Littoral ( German : <unk> Küstenland ) were established in its place , with the latter including the Krk and Cres – Lošinj island groups . Through the Croatian – Hungarian Settlement of 1868 a corpus separatum was formed containing the city of Rijeka , as a territory directly controlled by Hungary . In 1881 , the military frontier , containing the Senj and Velebit foothills , was absorbed by the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia .

 Following World War I , the dissolution of Austria @-@ Hungary , and the Treaty of Trianon , Hungary lost its possessions in the region . In 1918 , a short @-@ lived , unrecognised State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs was formed out of parts of Austria @-@ Hungary , comprising most of the former monarchy 's Adriatic coastline and the entire present @-@ day Croatian Littoral . Later that year , the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs formed the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes — subsequently renamed to Yugoslavia . The new union 's proponents at the time in the Croatian Parliament saw the move as a defence against Italian expansionism such as via provisions of the 1915 Treaty of London . The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and France because of conflicting promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself . 
 The 1919 Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye did transfer the Austrian Littoral to Italy , but awarded Dalmatia to Yugoslavia . Following the war , a private force of demobilized Italian soldiers seized Rijeka and set up the Italian Regency of Carnaro — seen as a harbinger of Fascism — to force the recognition of Italian claims to the city . After sixteen months of the Regency 's existence , the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo redefined the Italian – Yugoslav borders , among other things transferring Zadar and the islands of Cres , Lastovo , and Palagruža to Italy , securing the island of Krk for Yugoslavia , and establishing the Free State of Fiume ; this new state was abolished in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome that awarded Rijeka to Italy and Sušak to Yugoslavia . 
 In April 1941 , Yugoslavia was occupied by Nazi Germany and Italy , the latter annexing or occupying the Croatian Littoral , although the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of World War II and the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy reversed wartime Italian territorial gains , awarding the entire region and adjacent territory to Yugoslavia and the Federal State of Croatia . After the fall of communism , Yugoslavia broke apart as Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991 . Although the region suffered an economic decline during the Croatian War of Independence , there was no fighting in the region . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Since classical antiquity , the area around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures — from Hellenic and Roman cultures , through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers , to the present day . This blending is reflected in the folklore of the area , including <unk> — bell @-@ ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav , listed on UNESCO 's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity . Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an <unk> tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon . A typical decorative motif used in the region is <unk> ( plural : <unk> ) — a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry , usually earrings . Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka , but it is more likely that it is of Venetian origin , as it is similar to the Venetian <unk> motif , used mostly on brooches and pins . 
 The earliest architectural heritage of the region includes ruins of Roman and Byzantine buildings throughout the area and early medieval Croatian burial grounds in the Vinodol area . There are preserved examples of the Romanesque architecture on the island of Krk , in Vinodol , and in the Kastav area — largely churches , monasteries , and fortifications such as <unk> Castle . Several preserved examples of Gothic churches exist on the mainland , but during the Renaissance , construction largely consisted of fortifications because of the Ottoman conquest of the hinterland of the region . The most powerful noblemen in the region , the House of Zrinski and the House of Frankopan , built numerous castles in the area . They include the castles of Trsat , Grobnik , Bakar , Kraljevica , <unk> , Bribir , <unk> , <unk> , Novi Vinodolski , Krk , <unk> and Gradec near <unk> . The most representative piece of Baroque architecture is the St. Vitus Cathedral in Rijeka . 
 The region was birthplace or home to several writers who made their marks in Croatian , Italian , and Austrian literature . These include Ivan Mažuranić — one of the foremost authors of Croatian literature in the first half of the 19th century — Janko <unk> Kamov , Ödön von Horváth , and many others . Chakavian dialect , spoken in the region , is widely present in the works of poets born or living in the region . The most significant artist from the region is Juraj Julije <unk> ( Italian : Giorgio Giulio Clovio ) — a 16th @-@ century miniaturist , illuminator , and artist born in <unk> in Vinodol . 20th @-@ century artists born or active in the region are Romolo <unk> , Jakov <unk> , Vladimir <unk> , Antun Haller , Ivo Kalina , Vjekoslav <unk> <unk> , and many others . Churches and monasteries in the region treasure a great number of works of art . These include a 1535 altar polyptych by Girolamo da <unk> in the Franciscan monastery on <unk> island , while a Paolo Veneziano polyptych from Benedictine abbey in <unk> near Baška is in the collection of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Krk . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of the Croatian Littoral is largely centered on the city of Rijeka , whose economic impact is felt directly not only in the geographic region , but also in other parts of Primorje @-@ Gorski Kotar County — Gorski Kotar and Liburnia ( modern region ) — and a substantial part of Lika @-@ Senj County . The most significant economic activities in the Primorje @-@ Gorski Kotar County are transport , largely based on activities of the Port of Rijeka , shipbuilding and tourism in the coastal areas representing a part of the Northern Croatian Littoral , and forestry and wood processing in the Gorski Kotar region in the hinterland . In the city of Rijeka itself , the most significant economic activities are civil engineering , wholesale and retail trade , transport and storage services , and the processing industry . Tourism , wood processing , and agriculture are the predominant economic activities in Lika @-@ Senj County , where nearly all businesses are small and medium <unk> . 
 In 2010 , two companies headquartered in the Croatian Littoral ranked among the top fifty among Croatian companies by operating income . The highest ranked among them was the Rijeka @-@ based <unk> supermarket chain , which ranked 16th , and Euro Petrol , a petroleum product wholesale and retail company , which ranked 22nd . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 Pan @-@ European transport corridor branch Vb runs through the Croatian Littoral region . The route encompasses the A6 motorway spanning from the Orehovica interchange — part of the Rijeka bypass where the A6 and the A7 motorways meet — to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange , where the corridor route switches to the A1 motorway before proceeding north to Zagreb and Budapest , Hungary . The corridor also comprises a railway line connecting the Port of Rijeka to Zagreb and further destinations abroad . Another significant road transport route in the region is the A7 motorway , connecting Rijeka to Slovenia . The island of Krk is connected to the mainland via the Krk Bridge — comprising a 390 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 280 ft ) reinforced concrete arch , the longest in the world when completed in 1980 . 
 The Port of Rijeka is the largest port in Croatia , handling the greatest portion of the country 's imports and exports . Its facilities include terminals and other structures in the city and in the area reaching from the Bay of Bakar , where the bulk cargo terminal is located , approximately 13 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 miles ) east of Rijeka , to Bršica to the west of Rijeka , where there is a multi @-@ purpose terminal . The Port of Rijeka also serves passenger and ferry lines operated by Jadrolinija to the nearby islands of Cres , Mali Lošinj , Susak , Ilovik , Unije , Rab , and Pag , as well as to Adriatic ports further south , such as Split and Dubrovnik . The line to Split and Dubrovnik also serves the islands of Hvar , Korčula , and Mljet . There are two international airports in the region — Rijeka and Lošinj . Both of the airports serve few flights , but the Rijeka Airport is busier of the two . 
 Pipeline transport infrastructure in the region comprises the Jadranski naftovod ( JANAF ) pipeline connecting the Omišalj oil terminal — a part of the Port of Rijeka — to Sisak and <unk> crude oil storage facilities and terminals and to a terminal in Slavonski Brod further east on the Sava River . JANAF also operates a pipeline between the terminal and the INA 's Rijeka Refinery .

 Jacques started her career in 1944 with an appearance at the Players ' Theatre in London , but came to national prominence through her appearances on three highly popular radio series on the BBC : with Tommy Handley on It 's That Man Again ; with ventriloquist Peter Brough on Educating Archie ; and then with Tony Hancock on Hancock 's Half Hour . After the Second World War Jacques made her cinematic debut in Green for Danger , in which she had a brief , uncredited role .

The role endeared her to the public and the two became staples of British television . 
 In private , Jacques led a turbulent life . She was married to the actor John Le Mesurier from 1949 until their divorce in 1965 , a separation caused by her five @-@ year affair with another man . Jacques , who had been overweight since her teenage years , suffered ill @-@ health soon after the separation from Le Mesurier and her weight rose to nearly 20 stone ( 130 kg ) . She died of a heart attack on 6 October 1980 , at the age of 58 . Her biographer , Francis Gray , considers Jacques had a " talent for larger @-@ than @-@ life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity " , while she could also display " a broader comic mode " as a result of her " extraordinary versatility " .

 = = = Early life : 1922 – 44 = = = 
 Jacques was born Josephine Edwina Jaques on 7 February 1922 at 125 Sandgate High Street , Sandgate , Kent . She was the youngest child of Robin Rochester Jaques ( 1897 – 1923 ) , a serviceman in the British Army and later the Royal Air Force , and Mary Jaques ( née Thorne ) , a nurse who served in the Voluntary Aid Detachment ( VAD ) . 
 The Jaques family were predominantly non @-@ theatrical , with the exception of Mary who appeared in the small role of Harry Hathaway in the Christmas pantomime Robinson Crusoe at the Palace Theatre , Cologne , in 1920 . Mary enjoyed the theatre , and took Jacques to live performances from an early age . The result had a " profound effect " on the young girl , particularly a love of dance . Robin Rochester Jaques , who attained the rank of flight lieutenant with the RAF , was a keen sportsman and became a semi @-@ professional footballer . He signed to Clapton Orient and Fulham F.C. , but his career was cut short when he died in a flying accident on 8 August 1923 . Upon his death , Mary , Jacques and her elder brother Robin moved from Newton in Lincolnshire to London , where Jacques was sent to the Lady Margaret primary school in Chelsea . In July 1930 Jacques started her secondary schooling at the Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith , and also attended a local dance school , the Dean Sisters Academy , where she was a principal dancer in the Academy 's shows . She left Godolphin and Latymer in the summer of 1939 with unremarkable grades . She continued intermittently with amateur theatricals , and in May 1939 appeared with the Curtain Club in Barnes in productions of <unk> Oak and Borgia . 
 At the outbreak of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD ; she served in a mobile unit in London , attending bombed sites during the Blitz . After a reorganisation in the VAD , Jacques sought new work and , in the summer of 1943 , she became a welder in a factory in north London , a job that lasted until the end of the year . Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier , Major Charles Kearney . Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action , although her biographer , Andy Merriman , discovered that Kearney had a wife and children in the United States when he had proposed to Jacques , and had returned to them after the war .

 In 1944 , after being auditioned by Leonard Sachs , Jacques made her professional theatrical debut as Josephine Jacques — adding a " c " to her birth name as she did so — at the Players ' Theatre , London in a revue called Late Joys . Almost immediately she became a regular performer with the company , appearing in music hall revues and playing the Fairy Queen in their Victorian @-@ style pantomimes . Her biographer , Frances Gray , described the Players ' as being Jacques 's drama school , as she acted , directed , wrote lyrics and " developed the persona she was to use in pantomime for years , the large , bossy , but vulnerable fairy queen " . It was while appearing in a Late Joys revue in June 1946 that she made her debut on television , when the show was broadcast on the BBC . While appearing at the Players ' in 1946 she acquired the nickname " Hattie " after performing in the minstrel show Coal Black <unk> for Dixie . A member of the backstage staff compared her " blacked up " appearance with the American actress Hattie McDaniel , known for her work in Gone with the Wind , and Jacques adopted the name for the rest of her life . 
 Jacques made her big @-@ screen debut , briefly and uncredited , in the 1946 film Green for Danger , directed by Sidney Gilliat . In December that year , she joined the Young Vic Theatre Company and played <unk> in The King Stag . The play ran at the Lyric Theatre for a month before going on a five @-@ month tour of the UK . It received favourable reviews ; the Gloucestershire Echo described the piece as " a noble play " , and thought that Jacques was " very solidly in step " . In March 1947 Alberto Cavalcanti 's film Nicholas Nickleby was released , in which Jacques had her first credited big @-@ screen role as Mrs Kenwick . While engaged at the Players ' in June 1947 , Jacques was introduced to the actor John Le Mesurier and the two began a relationship . Le Mesurier was married but estranged from his wife . 
 In August 1947 Ted Kavanagh , the scriptwriter of the BBC Home Service show It 's That Man Again ( ITMA ) , visited the Players ' and invited Jacques to audition for the series , which she did on 18 September , for a fee of five guineas . She became so nervous during the audition that Tommy Handley , the show 's star , held her hand , which she found made her more nervous . Jacques joined the cast of ITMA as the greedy schoolgirl Sophie <unk> , where she " would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges " , before finishing her stories with the catchphrase " But I 'm all right now " . Jacques started her run in ITMA in September 1947 , at the beginning of series eleven , which ran for 38 episodes , and was paid ten guineas per episode . 
 For much of 1948 Jacques continued to record episodes of ITMA for half the week , while spending evenings in the Players ' Theatre ; she also found time during the spring to record the role of Flora in No , No , Nanette for the BBC and appear at the Whitehall Theatre in Bates Wharf with the Under Thirty Theatre Group . Later that year she appeared as a singer at the Three Cripples tavern in the David Lean film Oliver Twist . In September she started recording her second series of ITMA — the show 's twelfth — before returning to the Players ' for the Christmas pantomime , The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood . In the latter performance , The Times commented that Jacques " must surely be among the funniest fairies " in her role as the Fairy Queen <unk> — which was one of her favourite parts . 
 Tommy Handley died suddenly on 9 January 1949 ; the BBC decided that he was " so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance " of ITMA , that they cancelled the show immediately . Jacques later remarked that Handley was " one of the greatest radio performers we have ever known . I learned ... so much from him " . Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife ; shortly after the divorce came through , Jacques proposed to him , asking , " don 't you think it 's about time we got married ? " The couple wed on 10 November that year , at Kensington Registrar 's Office . After a week 's honeymoon in Southsea , she returned to the Players ' where she was engaged to appear as <unk> in the Christmas pantomime Beauty and the Beast .

 In the early months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was released into British cinemas ; it was a film in which Jacques " really made her mark " , according to her biographer , Andy Merriman . Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce . Jacques played Alice , a welder : when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming , she replied " I 've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I know how hard it is . That 's not enough money ! " and the offer was raised accordingly . The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had " the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry [ Niall ] <unk> " . 
 On 6 June 1950 Jacques was cast in the first episode of the weekly radio show Educating Archie as Agatha <unk> . The " Archie " of the title was the ventriloquist 's dummy Archie Andrews , operated by Peter Brough . The first series ran for 29 weeks until 19 December . In the show Jacques appeared alongside Max <unk> , Julie Andrews , Beryl Reid and — in the second series — Tony Hancock . It was on this programme that she first worked with Eric Sykes , who was providing scripts for the series . Sykes had been impressed with Jacques since he visited the Players ' in 1948 . He later wrote that she " moved about the stage with an elegance and grace as if she owned it . At the end of her act , to great applause , she leapt in the air , finishing in the splits , landing as softly as a snowflake in July " . After the show Sykes was introduced to Jacques backstage and thought that the meeting was " the beginning of a new flight " in his professional life . At the end of the series Jacques returned to the Players ' to appear in the Christmas pantomime , Ali Baba and the Thirty @-@ nine Thieves , which she and Joan Sterndale @-@ Bennett had adapted after they had copied it out long @-@ hand at the British Museum . The reviewer in The Times thought that Jacques was " as appealing as last year " , in her performance as Ali Baba 's wife , <unk> . 
 Throughout 1951 Jacques continued to mix work in different media , including appearing as Mrs <unk> in the film Scrooge starring Alastair Sim ; from 3 August until 25 January 1952 she appeared in a second radio series of Educating Archie , as well as appearing in the related stage show , The Archie Andrews Christmas Show at the Prince of Wales Theatre from December 1952 to January 1953 . She again appeared in — and co @-@ adapted — a Christmas pantomime at the Players ' Theatre , Riquet with the Tuft , a French fairy tale by Charles Perrault . In 1952 Jacques also portrayed Mrs Jenks in John Gilling 's comedy horror film Mother Riley Meets the Vampire , co @-@ starring Arthur Lucan and Bela Lugosi . 
 Jacques became pregnant in 1952 , but worked though most of her pregnancy , appearing in the Players ' revue The Bells of St Martins between August and November 1952 : she slid down the table and did the splits at the end — something The Times thought was " especially good " , although The Manchester Guardian considered that she was " monumental of person but surprisingly thin of voice " . Le Mesurier reported that he was " faintly relieved " when the revue came to an end because of her exertions , added to which she appeared in the 27 episodes of the third series of Educating Archie between September 1952 and June 1953 . She then directed — but did not appear in — the Players ' Christmas pantomime of 1952 , Babes in the Wood . In March 1953 Jacques gave birth to her first son , Robin , and returned to work after a few days to film Up to His Neck . Later that year she provided the lead alongside Le Mesurier in the 38 @-@ minute " movie @-@ masque " The Pleasure Garden ; filmed in 1952 , it won the Prix de Fantasie <unk> at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival . From October until April 1954 she was in series four of Educating Archie , while in December 1953 she also appeared in and directed Cinderella at the Players ' ; The Times commented that " Miss Jacques as actress , playing a deliciously arch and absent @-@ minded Fairy Queen , goes a long way to retrieve the failure of Miss Jacques as dramatist " . 
 In 1954 Jacques continued to work on radio . Between April and July she was in Paradise Street , a spin @-@ off series from Educating Archie , while in June she was in Archie in <unk> , a one @-@ off special programme that was a collaboration between Educating Archie and The Goon Show . As well as recording in series five of Educating Archie , she was also cast as Mrs Leathers for 18 episodes of Mrs Dale 's Diary between February and April 1955 . She both produced and directed Twenty Minutes South , first at the Players ' Theatre , and then for 105 performances at the St Martin 's Theatre and finished the year by appearing in seven episodes of The Granville <unk> on ITV between October and December . 
 A second pregnancy led to the birth of a son , Kim , " who came rollicking and laughing into the world in October 1956 , a trifle before his allotted time " , according to Le Mesurier . In June 1956 Jacques appeared in an episode of The Tony Hancock Show on ITV ; this led to the role of Hancock 's secretary , Griselda Pugh , in the BBC radio series Hancock 's Half Hour . She appeared in 16 episodes from November 1956 to February 1957 , alongside Hancock and regulars Sidney James , Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams . Jacques 's arrival on Hancock " provided an additional boost to the series " , according to television historian Richard Webber . She appeared again in five further episodes of Hancock 's Half Hour between April and June 1957 , and again for a further 20 episodes between January and June 1958 , before a special edition on Christmas Day 1958 . She spent much of 1958 at the London Palladium , undertaking 380 performances of the revue Large as Life , alongside Terry @-@ Thomas , Eric Sykes and Harry Secombe . She appeared in the sketches " Concerto for Three <unk> " with Secombe and Sykes , " The Good Old Days " , and the two full company numbers that closed each of the two halves of the show . 
 = = = The Carry On series : 1958 – 63 = = = 
 When the first Carry On film was made in 1958 , Jacques formed part of the cast . This series would go on to employ the same group of actors who would collectively become known as the " Carry On team " . Jacques appeared in 14 of these films over a 15 @-@ year period and like many of her Carry On co @-@ stars , she quickly became typecast . A reoccurring role for Jacques was a no @-@ nonsense matron which she played in five of the films – Carry On Nurse , Carry On Doctor , Carry On Again Doctor , Carry On Camping and Carry On Matron . She became known by the team as a " Mother Hen " figure , and was a close friend to many of her co @-@ stars , including Kenneth Williams and Joan Sims , whom Jacques provided with a great deal of advice and practical help . In return , Sims regarded Jacques as her " greatest friend " , and as " both a sister and a mother to me " . Jacques would frequently invite Sims , Williams and Hawtrey to her house for Christmas dinner . 
 Jacques began her association with the Carry On series in March 1958 with the first film in the series , Carry On Sergeant . She played the small role of Captain Clark , a " battleaxe medical officer " who fails to believe the fabricated ailments of the hypochondriac Private Horace Strong , played by Kenneth Connor . The following year she played " Matron " for the first time in Carry On Nurse , a film which broke that year 's box office records , selling more than 10 million tickets in British cinemas . Although Jacques 's role was still relatively small , she appeared in perhaps the best known scene of the film , in which she retrieves a daffodil from Wilfrid Hyde @-@ White 's buttocks , put there by a mischievous nurse as revenge for his constant harassment of the staff . So popular was Jacques 's scene , that the producers imported two million plastic daffodils from Japan which were then used to promote the comedy . Other characterisations followed , including the formidable maths mistress Grace Short in Carry On Teacher ( 1959 ) and the friendly Police Sergeant Laura Moon in Carry On Constable ( 1960 ) . Of the former film , Derek Prouse of The Sunday Times thought that Jacques " triumph [ ed ] over material so remorselessly juvenile that one is battered into a kind of fascinated admiration " . 
 On 29 January 1960 Jacques appeared in the first episode of the BBC comedy series Sykes and a ... , co @-@ starring with Eric Sykes as a pair of twins ; Richard <unk> and Deryck <unk> were also regulars in the cast . Jacques 's character — Hattie ( Hat ) Sykes — was " a middle @-@ class , slightly pretentious lady struggling to keep her dignity as the men made fools of themselves " . Sykes and a ... went on to run for sixty episodes over nine series during the next five years . According to the media historian Graham McCann , the show was " one of the best @-@ natured , least pretentious and most successful British sitcoms of the 1960s " . Because of the success , Jacques and Sykes " became embedded in the public mind as a priceless comic partnership " ; to capitalise , they released a comedy album entitled Eric and Hattie and Things ! ! ! , but it failed to chart . In September 1960 she starred in her second television series , Our House , alongside Charles Hawtrey , Bernard <unk> and Joan Sims ; Jacques played the librarian Georgina Ruddy , who was forced to keep quiet at work and so made up for it by being extremely noisy at home . Later that year she played minor roles in two films : Watch Your Stern , with many of the Carry On regulars , and School for Scoundrels , opposite Ian Carmichael . After these her screen time increased with the part of Nanette Parry in Make Mine Mink in which she co @-@ starred with Terry @-@ Thomas and Athene Seyler . She later described this as her favourite film . 
 In October 1961 Jacques appeared on Desert Island Discs , and said that she would be too lonely on such a quiet island for someone of her temperament . By this time Carry On had become a leading film franchise , with the author Robert Ross describing it as a " phenomenon " . That year 's film , Carry On Regardless , was the fifth in the series ; Jacques received a fee of £ 100 for the small role of a disgruntled hospital nurse , who appeared briefly on screen alongside the English character actor Kynaston Reeves who played her cantankerous boss . Jacques was initially intended for a major part in the film , but she was unable to commit to a longer role because of ill health . She appeared in her sixth Carry On , Carry On <unk> , in 1963 , as " Peggy Hawkins " , the emotionally neglected wife of taxi @-@ firm boss " Charlie " , played by Sid James . Jacques later named the film as her favourite of the series , as she was allowed to drop her " battleaxe " persona and play the romantic lead opposite James . 
 = = = Private turmoil ; new acting ventures : 1963 – 67 = = = 
 Jacques 's private life became complicated in 1963 . The previous year she had met John Schofield , a cockney used @-@ car dealer , who chauffeured her to a Leukaemia Research Fund event . The couple became romantically involved after the driver gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not . When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home , Le Mesurier moved into a separate room . He later commented about this period : " I could have walked out , but , whatever my feelings , I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain — I had to be certain — that we could repair the damage " . During these upheavals in her personal life , Jacques was surprised to be the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1963 , when she was approached by Eamonn Andrews during rehearsal for the sixth series of Sykes and a .... Although Le Mesurier did not mention the marital situation when being questioned by Andrews , he made the comment that for Jacques " the home comes first " , which Merriman considered had been said " rather pointedly " . Despite the matrimonial upsets , Jacques and Le Mesurier both appeared in the 1963 Tony Hancock film , The Punch and Judy Man . In 1964 Le Mesurier moved out of the marital home , made a decision to protect Jacques from any negative publicity , and allowed her to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity . This ensured that the press blamed him for the break @-@ up , casting Jacques as the victim in the matter . 
 In 1964 , as well as recording four episodes of the radio show Housewives ' Choice , Jacques starred in her own television series , Miss Adventure , as the private investigator Stacey Smith . Although Jacques wanted the series to be full of suspense , the programmes were more comedic and she was disappointed with the results . In August that year she appeared as Madame <unk> in an ITV production of Blithe Spirit . The play 's writer , Noël Coward , felt that " finally someone had delivered a performance that wasn 't overshadowed by Margaret Rutherford " , who had originated the stage role in 1940 and played it in the 1945 film version . 
 Jacques went to Rome in 1966 to film The Bobo with Peter Sellers ; before this she went on a strict diet and lost five stone ( 31 kg ) , although she was disappointed that so few people noticed . She enjoyed the filming experience , calling it " one of the loveliest things I 've worked on " . While she was in Italy , Schofield came out to stay , started an affair with an Italian heiress and broke off his relationship with Jacques ; deeply upset , Jacques , who had had a weight problem since her teens , began eating comfort food and her weight increased to nearly 20 stone ( 130 kg ) .

 In the summer of 1967 the Carry On producer Peter Rogers assembled the cast for the 15th film of the series , Carry On Doctor . Rogers initially chose Joan Sims to play the role of the hospital matron but she declined the part , stating that Jacques 's performance of the role in Carry On Nurse could not be bettered . As such , Rogers cast Jacques as Matron , with Sims accepting a smaller role as the timid assistant of the film 's lead character Francis Bigger , played by Frankie Howerd . Jacques 's screen time was increased from Carry On Nurse , as the producers considered her part to be an extension of the earlier role . Carry On Doctor was released in December of that year , to much success . 
 Jacques started 1968 by appearing with Spike Milligan and Frank Thornton in thirteen episodes of the sketch show The World of Beachcomber , based on the Beachcomber column in the Daily Express newspaper and broadcast on the BBC from January to April . Shortly after the series finished , she appeared alongside Frankie Howerd in his sketch show , Howerd 's Hour , on ITV . She continued her busy schedule with appearances in six films for 1969 , including another with Sellers , The Magic Christian . Here she portrayed a character named Ginger , who was described as a " grotesque figure " , with an " insatiable lust for bestsellers on the atrocities of World War Two " . She also appeared on television alongside Harry Secombe and Roy Castle in Pickwick , which was based on the musical of the same name , and in Carry On Christmas , broadcast on Christmas Eve . Although 1969 had been busy , 1970 was relatively quiet in terms of her professional output : apart from an episode of <unk> , she appeared alongside Willoughby Goddard in a six @-@ episode series of Charley 's Grants . She spent May and June filming Carry On Loving , in which she played Sophie Bliss , released in September that year . Another Carry On film followed in 1971 , Carry On at Your Convenience , where she played Beattie Plummer , the housebound wife of Sid Plummer , played by Sid James . In the same year she completed another series with Sykes , Sykes and a Big , Big Show , a music and sketch programme which had six episodes , broadcast between February and April . 
 Two further Carry On films followed for Jacques in 1972 : Carry On Matron , for which she was engaged in the title role , and Carry On Abroad , as Floella , the fiery Spanish cook at a half @-@ finished hotel . As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey 's last , it also marked a reduction in Jacques 's screen time ; she spent only one week filming her scenes . During post @-@ production , the film 's insurers became concerned about Jacques 's deteriorating health . In a letter to the series producer Peter Rogers , they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film . 
 During the course of 1972 Jacques co @-@ starred in the first series of Sykes , in which she played Hattie Sykes , " the wide @-@ eyed , less @-@ knowing but remarkably patient sister @-@ cum @-@ mother @-@ figure " ; at its height , Sykes had 17 million viewers . In February 1972 Jacques was at home with her son Robin to watch Le Mesurier win the British Academy of Film and Television Arts " Best Television Actor " award for his portrayal of a " boozy British aristocrat ... who became a spy for the Soviets " in Dennis Potter 's television play Traitor . Jacques cried when her ex @-@ husband won the award , and divulged to her son that she " wasn 't crying out of professional resentment or even envy about Joan Le Mesurier ... but from an unhappiness that , through her own actions , she lost John or there was now no @-@ one with whom to spend her life " .

 The year 1974 was difficult for Jacques . Her sons were arrested for possession of cannabis , and her house was searched by police . In the same week that the two boys appeared in court , she received official notification of the intention to appoint her as an OBE . In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour . Later that year , while filming the third series of Sykes , she suffered a cancer scare and lost a considerable amount of weight . Despite this she refused to interrupt the busy production schedule ; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys . 
 In 1976 Jacques appeared in a promotional advertising film for British Rail , which pitted her against racing driver Jackie Stewart in a race to London . From 1976 onwards Sykes and Jacques appeared together in the stage play A <unk> of Sykes , both in the UK and internationally . During the course of the different tours relations between the two stars became increasingly strained and Sykes altered the act several times to ensure he received more acclaim than Jacques . While appearing in Blackpool in 1977 Jacques 's health became problematic as she suffered from arthritis and ulcerated legs , which required daily dressing . Because a dressing room was arranged that avoided her needing to use stairs , Sykes accused her of receiving special treatment . When the show moved to Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) , Sykes " began to behave rather strangely ... and he even accused Hattie ... of not being able to deliver a proper feed line " . By the time the show appeared in Brighton in 1979 the relationship between the two " was rapidly deteriorating " , and , although the pair praised each other in public , Jacques felt hurt by Sykes 's treatment of her . Despite the differences , the pair filmed the seventh series of Sykes in 1979 , and — in April 1980 — the television film Rhubarb Rhubarb ; although her part was a small one , she looked " a little unsteady on her feet " , according to Merriman . 
 = = = = Death and tributes = = = = 
 In May 1980 Jacques 's doctor advised her against travelling to Greece on holiday as planned , so she visited Ireland instead . During the return ferry crossing she told her friend Bruce Copp that " You know I 'm not going to live long " . Her health remained poor , and insurance companies refused to insure her for film work . By October her weight had risen again ; she had problems breathing and was again admitted to Charing Cross Hospital . She took a weekend break from hospital and returned home to Eardley Crescent , where on 6 October she died from a heart attack at the age of 58 ; she was also suffering from kidney failure . 
 Jacques 's funeral took place at Putney Vale Crematorium , where her ashes were scattered . Her sons refused to allow Sykes entry to the funeral because they resented the way he had treated her during the stage show ; Sykes was upset by the exclusion and failed to understand why he had been banned . The other notable absentee from the funeral was Joan Sims , who " stayed in her home and spent the day drinking , reading old letters from Hattie and wallowing in self pity " , according to Merriman . 
 Kenneth Williams was deeply saddened by the loss of his friend , and wrote that " all the chums have died ... one is left marooned on the shore ... the tide is receding and leaving some incongruous wrecks exposed ... I fear I am one of them " . John Le Mesurier described Jacques as " a remarkable lady ... [ who ] had an aura of love and kindness about her " , while her obituary in The Times observed that " she will be remembered with affection by all who saw her " . A month after the funeral , a memorial service was held at St Paul 's , Covent Garden , otherwise known as the Actors ' Church , which was described by Le Mesurier as a " joyous occasion " . 
 A memorial plaque to Jacques is situated in St Paul 's , Covent Garden . In November 1995 a blue plaque was unveiled by Eric Sykes and Clive Dunn — a colleague from her Players ' Theatre days — at her former house : 67 Eardley Crescent , Earls Court , London . In 2002 plaques were unveiled for Jacques , Sid James and Tony Hancock at BBC Broadcasting House in London . 
 In 2011 Jacques and Le Mesurier 's marriage was the subject of a BBC Four biographical film called Hattie , which focused on Jacques 's affair with John Schofield . She was played by Ruth Jones , who Robin Le Mesurier thought " had captured my mother perfectly " . Jones was thrilled at playing Jacques whom she considered to be her comedy heroine , describing her as an " incredibly talented and fascinating woman both on and off screen " . 
 = = Reputation = = 
 The writer Susan <unk> described Jacques as " one of the best @-@ loved British comedy stars " , while Jacques 's obituarist in The Times observed that " she was invariably successful " at making people " laugh with , rather than at you " . Peter Chapman of The Independent stated that Jacques was " blessed with remarkable grace , delicacy and warmth , giving her an almost unique comic appeal " . Sunday Life said that for decades she was " Britain 's favourite silly , sexually frustrated , fat woman " . Nina Wadia of Goodness Gracious Me considers Jacques along with Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor to have " paved the way for younger <unk> in Britain today " , remarking that " if it had not been for women like Hattie and Barbara , there is no way that younger actresses would have any role model , or probably the ambition to do what they do " . 
 Jacques 's biographer , Francis Gray , highlighted two aspects of the actress 's abilities ; in her appearances in the sequence of post @-@ war Dickens adaptations ( Nicholas Nickleby , Oliver Twist , Scrooge and Pickwick ) Jacques " reflected her talent for larger @-@ than @-@ life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity " , while in other films , such as Mother Riley Meets the Vampire , she displayed " a broader comic mode " . In her later career Jacques showed " a comic talent of extraordinary versatility . In Sykes her performance had to be a foil for the main character ; in the Carry Ons she blossomed " . As a singer she was also praised ; Jonathan Cecil of The Spectator said that her " bell @-@ tone voice with its cut @-@ crystal diction — perfect for radio — had an edge of pain which suggested a greater depth to her talents than she was generally allowed to express " . The actor Neville Phillips , who toured with Jacques , described her as having a " pretty voice " and able to " take an innocuous old Victorian or Edwardian ballad and with just a few intonations and expressions give it another meaning entirely " . 
 Gray observes that " Jacques is enduringly associated with the role of hospital matron " and her portrayal of the character in five films had a lasting impact on both her legacy and on the role and view of <unk> in the National Health Service . An article in The Guardian by Mark Lawson mixed fiction with reality when he wrote that " standards of hygiene have slipped since Hattie Jacques ran NHS wards " . According to The Scotsman , the 2003 Labour Party Conference " applauded deliriously because the government has revived Hattie Jacques " , in relation to a change in government policy . After complaints about the NHS in 2008 , the Western Morning News suggested the government should " clone a Hattie Jacques @-@ type matron to run a tight ship everywhere " . NHS nurses have complained about the stereotype : in August 2013 the Nursing Times quoted one matron , who protested that they were " not like Hattie Jacques anymore " . 
 Alan Simpson , the co @-@ writer of Hancock , enjoyed writing for Jacques , and thought that she was " almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy ; you didn 't write for her thinking she 's a woman so we 've got to write the feminine point of view . That made it easier for us " . Neville Phillips thought she was a " complete revelation " , adding " although she was a large lady ( very large , in fact ) , her movements were dainty , light and graceful , and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie ... a subtle , sophisticated actress " . Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size : " She was such a great comedienne ... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn 't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady " . Guy Pearce , writing in the Daily Express , noted that " she always chose to play women in funny situations , rather than refer directly to her weight . She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing ' the <unk> ' . " The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray . Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been " unimaginatively cast as the ' fat person ' " in ITMA , while in Sykes , her weight was rarely referred to — and Jacques said that Sykes " hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change " . Gray considers that " although often cast in broad comedy , she never played it broadly , but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight " . 
 = Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik = 
 The Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> <unk> Dubrovnik ) was a volunteer unit of the Croatian Navy that ran the naval blockade during the siege of Dubrovnik which formed part of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991 – 1992 . It consisted of 23 vessels , mostly of the runabout type , lightly armed and armoured . The unit was crucial in the defence of Dubrovnik , providing a resupply route for the Dubrovnik population and troops defending the besieged city . Boats assigned to the squadron transported approximately 6 @,@ 000 troops and civilians , about 100 wounded and 2 @,@ 000 tonnes of various cargo . A total of 117 personnel served with the squadron during the siege , suffering two fatalities . 
 The siege of Dubrovnik and the associated blockade running operations of the squadron took place from September 1991 until May 1992 , during the peak of the fighting in the Croatian War of Independence . The commencement of the siege preceded the declaration of Croatian independence on 8 October 1991 . In early 1992 , the Dubrovnik area saw fierce fighting while combat operations largely ceased elsewhere in Croatia following the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992 . 
 Sveti Vlaho , the first vessel of the squadron , sunk in late 1991 , was refloated in 2001 and placed on permanent exhibition in Dubrovnik . In 2006 , the squadron was collectively decorated with the Order of Nikola Šubić Zrinski for bravery during the Croatian War of Independence . Surviving squadron members founded a squadron association in 2011 to preserve the heritage of the unit . 
 = = Background = = 
 The 1990 revolt of the Croatian Serbs was centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin , parts of Lika , Kordun , Banovina regions and in eastern Croatian settlements with significant Serb population , and these areas were subsequently declared by the Serbs as the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . The RSK declared its intention to integrate politically with Serbia , and this action was viewed by the Government of Croatia as a rebellion . By March 1991 , the conflict had escalated to war — the Croatian War of Independence . In June 1991 , Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated . This was followed by a three @-@ month moratorium on the decision , but the decision came into effect on 8 October . 
 As the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation , the Croatian National Guard ( ZNG ) was formed in May 1991 . The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( HV ) in November . The development of the Croatian armed forces was hampered by a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo introduced in September . The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war , culminating in the Battle of the barracks , the Siege of Dubrovnik , and the Battle of Vukovar . Even though the Sarajevo Agreement led to a ceasefire in most areas of Croatia , the siege and fighting around Dubrovnik continued until May 1992 .

 The Armed Boats Squadron Dubrovnik was established on 23 September 1991 as a volunteer unit of the Croatian Navy . It served during the Siege of Dubrovnik , and was a key factor in the successful defence of the city . The unit 's first commander was Lieutenant Colonel <unk> Nikolić . 
 Upon formation , squadron was tasked with breaching the Dubrovnik naval blockade and maintaining a route that was instrumental to delivery of materiel necessary to successfully defend the city , including food , fuel , medical supplies , arms and ammunition . The squadron also transported reinforcements arriving from other parts of Croatia and evacuated wounded out of Dubrovnik , and was a lifeline for the besieged troops and civilian population . Its operations began on 23 September 1991 , when the runabout Sveti Vlaho ( English : Saint Blaise ) undertook its first voyage . The squadron consisted of 23 craft of various sizes and 117 volunteers . Craft armaments were light — the Sveti Vlaho had 6 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) steel plate armour as a protection and a Bren light machine gun . All the vessels of the squadron were relatively fast , the fastest among them being capable of achieving 55 knots ( 102 kilometres per hour ; 63 miles per hour ) . The squadron typically deployed its craft in pairs or threes , sailing as close as possible to the Yugoslav Navy vessels when passing <unk> island to reach relative safety of the Rijeka Dubrovačka inlet , in order to utilize blind spots of naval guns . During its existence , the squadron <unk> motored more than 52 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 96 @,@ 000 kilometres ; 60 @,@ 000 miles ) , and transported approximately 6 @,@ 000 troops and civilians , about 100 wounded and 2 @,@ 000 tonnes of various cargo . The unit suffered two combat fatalities . 
 At dawn on 31 October 1991 , the squadron sailed out of Dubrovnik to meet the Libertas convoy — a fleet of civilian vessels , the largest among them being the Jadrolinija shipping line 's Slavija , which was endeavoring to deliver humanitarian aid to the city under siege . The fleet sailed from Rijeka and made several port calls , growing to 29 vessels as it approached Dubrovnik . The convoy , accompanied by the last President of Yugoslavia Stjepan Mesić and the Prime Minister of Croatia Franjo Gregurić , was stopped and searched by the Yugoslav Navy off the island of Mljet before the squadron linked up with the convoy and escorted it to Dubrovnik . The event marked the first large delivery of aid to the city since the beginning of the siege . 
 Sveti Vlaho , the first naval vessel to fly the flag of the Republic of Croatia in combat and the first ship of the squadron , was originally an Italian smuggling runabout that was confiscated by the authorities , fitted with armour and used by the squadron in resupply and blockade @-@ running operations . During one of these missions , while sailing back from a trip to Bol on the Croatian island of Brač , she was chased by a Yugoslav gunboat and driven aground on a beach near Babin Kuk , just 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 kilometres ) north of Dubrovnik . Sveti Vlaho was recovered and continued in service until 6 December 1991 , when she was sunk at Gruž by a <unk> Malyutka anti @-@ tank missile . The unit ceased operations in 1992 as the forces besieging Dubrovnik had been defeated . Sveti Vlaho was the second vessel used by the Croatian Navy , preceded only by a landing craft designated DJB @-@ 103 , which was brought into use eight days earlier . The squadron was disbanded on 29 December 1992 .

 Sveti Vlaho was refloated in 2001 , restored and put on exhibit in Batala Park in Dubrovnik . In May 2006 , the squadron was collectively decorated with the Order of Nikola Šubić Zrinski for the bravery of its members during the Croatian War of Independence ; however , no individual decorations were awarded to squadron members , nor were any promoted as a result of their service . On the 15th anniversary of the arrival of the Libertas convoy in besieged Dubrovnik a celebration was held , but no squadron volunteers were invited to attend . On 11 August 2011 , surviving members of the squadron founded the Armed Boat Squadron Association whose objective is to preserve the heritage of the squadron , document its contribution to the Croatian War of Independence , and render assistance to its members and other similar associations in Croatia to preserve and promote the role that Croatian soldiers played in achieving the Republic of Croatia 's independence . 
 = Sandown Castle , Kent = 
 Sandown Castle was an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII in Sandown , Kent , between 1539 and 1540 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and defended the strategically important Downs anchorage off the English coast . 
 Comprising a keep and four circular bastions , the moated stone castle covered 0 @.@ 59 acres ( 0 @.@ 24 ha ) and had 39 firing positions on the upper levels for artillery , with 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns . It cost the Crown a total of £ 27 @,@ 092 to build the three castles of Sandown , Walmer and Deal , which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences . The original invasion threat passed , but during the Second English Civil War of 1648 – 49 , Sandown was seized by pro @-@ Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months ' fighting . 
 By the 19th century , the castle was suffering badly from the effects of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863 . The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives , carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893 . The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £ 35 to form part of the local sea defences . The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea .

 = = = 16th century = = = 
 Sandown Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon , and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and Charles took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 Sandown and the adjacent castles of Deal and Walmer were constructed to protect the Downs in east Kent , an important anchorage formed by the Goodwin Sands that gave access to Deal Beach , on which enemy soldiers could easily be landed . The stone castles were supported by a line of four earthwork forts , known as the Great Turf , the Little Turf Bulwark , the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark , and a 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) long defensive ditch and bank . Collectively the castles became known as the " castles of the Downs " and cost the Crown a total of £ 27 @,@ 092 . 
 The castle was built between April 1539 and the autumn of 1540 , by a team including Richard <unk> as the surveyor , William Clement as the master carpenter , and Christopher Dickenson as the master mason . It was nearly identical to its sister castle at Walmer , with a tall keep , 83 feet ( 25 m ) across , at the centre , and flanked by four rounded bastions , also called lunettes , and a moat , which was surrounded in turn by a curtain wall . Its curved walls were 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) thick . In total it was approximately 165 by 165 feet ( 50 by 50 m ) across , covering 0 @.@ 59 acres ( 0 @.@ 24 ha ) . The historian John Hale considered the castle to form a transitional design between older medieval English designs and newer Italian styles of defence . 
 Sandown had three tiers of artillery – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels – with a total of 39 firing positions , and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required . The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse , and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the smoke from its guns to escape . It was initially garrisoned by a captain , two lieutenants , two porters , ten gunners and three soldiers , at an annual cost of £ 174 a year . 
 = = = 17th century = = = 
 Although the original invasion threat passed , Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century . A 1616 survey nonetheless reported that a range of repairs were needed , at an estimated total cost of £ 437 , while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at £ 1 @,@ 243 was required . In contrast , an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition , but antiquated in design . A report produced in 1641 suggested that £ 8 @,@ 000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs , including £ 3 @,@ 000 for additional sea defences . 
 Sandown Castle did not play a prominent role during the first English Civil War that broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament ; it was taken by Parliamentary forces at the start of the conflict in 1642 . Following the few years of unsteady peace after 1645 , the Second Civil War broke out in 1648 , this time with Charles ' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies . The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs , protected by Sandown and the other Henrician castles , but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent . 
 Vice @-@ Admiral William Batten had been forced by Parliamentary officials to resign from his post as Commander of the Fleet the previous year , and he now encouraged the fleet to join the Royalist faction . Sir Henry Palmer , a former sailor , accompanied by other members of the Kentish gentry , also called on the fleet to revolt , taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews . Sandown Castle declared for the King , followed shortly afterwards by the garrisons at Deal and Walmer as well . With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control , Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots . 
 Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June , and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with Sandown and the other castles along the Downs . Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged and surrendered on 12 July . An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal , which may have been defended by around 150 men each . Deal was attacked in late July , and in August artillery assaults began on Sandown as well . The Royalists mounted an attack from the fleet on 10 August , with a second attack following on 15 August , involving a landing of 750 men supported by 50 soldiers from Sandown . Neither operation was successful and Sandown finally surrendered on 5 September , a few weeks after the surrender of Deal . 
 In 1649 , Parliament ordered that supplies of ammunition and powder be sent to Sandown and the other castles of the Downs . Fresh earthworks were erected during the Interregnum between Sandown and Deal to address with the threat of Dutch attack . The garrison at Sandown remained substantial during the period , with a governor and 21 soldiers , but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain and 18 men . In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles ' brother , King James II , the townsfolk of Deal seized Sandown Castle on behalf of William III , the Prince of Orange . 
 The former Parliamentarian , Colonel John Hutchinson , was infamously detained by the Crown at Sandown in 1664 ; his wife , Lucy , who subsequently widely publicised his case , described the castle as ruinous and his imprisonment there as inhumane . After several months Hutchinson died in the castle , his doctor blaming his physical decline on the conditions in which he had been kept .

 In 1785 , the sea broke through the outer walls of the castle , and coastal erosion continued over the next few years . The castle was initially described as being " barely habitable " , but by 1793 it was considered " unfit for habitation . " It was repaired and garrisoned again during the French Revolutionary Wars , with two new artillery batteries being constructed to the north of the castle . Early in the 19th century the castle was used as by the early coastguard for the suppression of local smuggling . 
 Coastal erosion continued during the 19th century . As a consequence , the War Office sold off the reusable materials of the fortification for £ 564 in 1863 and demolished the upper parts of the castle , leaving a level platform across the lower parts of the keep and the bastions . Part of the stone was purchased by the Earl of Granville and used in his building work at Walmer Castle , while other masonry was reused in the construction of Deal Pier . The sea continued to erode the remaining stonework and destroyed one of the adjacent artillery batteries – the other was converted for use by the coastguard . In 1882 the Royal Engineers used explosives to remove around 600 tonnes ( 590 long tons ; 660 short tons ) of masonry from the castle for use in the construction of an officer 's house at Dover Castle , causing further damage . 
 In 1883 architectural historian Hayter Lewis complained to the British Archaeological Association that more needed to be done to protect the ruins , contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast . Despite this , concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea , and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton . The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £ 35 for use as part of their local sea defences . Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall , although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion . The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument .

 North Carolina Highway 54 ( NC 54 ) is a 55 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 89 km ) primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina . The highway serves the Research Triangle area , between Burlington and Raleigh , connecting the cities and towns of Chapel Hill , Durham , Morrisville and Cary . The highway also links the campuses of University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University . 
 NC 54 runs from U.S. Highway 70 ( US 70 ) in Burlington along Chapel Hill Road through the downtown area of Graham . Turning to the southeast the route runs through some of the outskirts of Burlington before moving through a predominantly rural area . Approaching Chapel Hill , the highway follows the NC 54 " Bypass " around the town and runs concurrently with US 15 / US 501 until reaching Raleigh Road . At Raleigh Road , NC 54 continues to the east crossing Interstate 40 ( I @-@ 40 ) and running through the outskirts of Durham . The road continues to follow I @-@ 40 as it enters into Research Triangle Park and Morrisville . NC 54 follows Chapel Hill Road until reaching the downtown area of Cary where it uses Maynard Road as a bypass . On the eastern side of Cary , NC 54 turns back onto Chapel Hill Road and follows the road until reaching Hillsborough Street near Raleigh . At <unk> Street , NC 54 turns to the east to follow the street through west Raleigh and along the NC State Fairgrounds . The highway ends at I @-@ 440 / US 1 west of downtown Raleigh . 
 NC 54 first appeared as an original state highway running from NC 75 in Pittsboro to Moncure . However by 1928 the route was recommissioned as a secondary road which remains today as Moncure Pittsboro Road . The current NC 54 was signed in 1929 from Graham to US 70 south of Durham . In 1930 it was further extended through Rockingham to the Virginia border , however in 1940 much of that routing was renumbered as NC 87 . The route was further extended in 1953 where it ran concurrent along US 70A until reaching US 1 in Cary . The Chapel Hill Bypass was completed in 1956 and NC 56 was rerouted from its downtown Chapel Hill routing to the new bypass . The last major change to the routing occurred in 1963 when NC 54 was extended along <unk> Street to the new US 1 freeway ( present day I @-@ 440 ) .

 NC 54 east begins in western Burlington at the intersection of US 70 / NC 62 ( Church Street ) and Chapel Hill Street . This intersection is a right @-@ in / right @-@ out intersection with US 70 eastbound ; access to and from westbound US 70 is provided through South O 'Neal Street . NC 54 is also signed along this sub @-@ 500 @-@ yard ( 460 m ) segment of O 'Neal Street . 
 NC 54 follows Chapel Hill Road to the intersection of NC 49 / NC 100 ( Maple Avenue ) in downtown Graham . NC 54 joins NC 49 north on Harden Street through downtown . The route roughly parallels I @-@ 40 to the south as it enters into the downtown area of Graham . NC 49 / NC 54 turns to the northeast before intersecting NC 87 ( West Elm Street ) . After the intersection the road turns east and follows along a concurrency with NC 49 and NC 87 . NC 87 turns off at Main Street in downtown Graham . Three blocks to the east NC 49 exits at East Elm Street . NC 54 begins its turn southeast and crosses I @-@ 40 / I @-@ 85 at its exit 148 . NC 54 remains on Harden Street until it crosses the Haw River , and is known from that point solely as NC 54 . 
 After crossing the river , NC 54 remains relatively parallel to the Haw River . The route passes east of <unk> where it also passes by a country club along with a large manufacturing plant . Immediately after passing the plant , the road intersects the southern terminus of NC 119 at an intersection with East Main Street . After the intersection the road turns more toward the east and runs through an area which is primarily rural with multiple neighborhoods surrounding the route . After passing through the unincorporated community of Oaks , the road makes a gradually turn from its southeastern direction towards an eastern direction . Several farms lie adjacent to the road as most of the neighborhoods dissipate . NC 54 finishes its eastern turn as it enters another unincorporated community , White Cross . The route briefly turns to northeasterly , however turns back to a gradual southeastern direction after passing by a quarry . 
 As the road nears Carrboro , several neighborhoods and businesses are found adjacent to the highway . Before intersecting Old Fayetteville Road , the highway begins to widen from a two lane road , to a four lane divided highway . The highway passes by a strip mall immediately after passing Old Fayetteville Road , and intersects Main Street before turning to the south . NC 54 follows a limited access highway known as the NC 54 Bypass , <unk> the south side of Carrboro and Chapel Hill . The highway has diamond interchanges at Jones Ferry Road , Greensboro Street along with South Columbia Street , where NC 86 has its southern terminus and US 15 / US 501 joins NC 54 . The road becomes Fordham Boulevard , where the highway begins to turn north to head toward Durham .
