 Hickok willed her personal papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park , part of the US National Archives . Her donation was contained in eighteen filing boxes that , according to the provisions of her will , were to be sealed until ten years after her death . In early May 1978 , Doris Faber , as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt , became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes , and was astounded to discover that they contained 2 @,@ 336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok , and 1 @,@ 024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt . Most of them dated to the 1930s , but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt 's 1962 death . Hickok 's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum , where they are available to the public . 
 Based on these letters , Terry Baum and Pat Bond wrote the play , <unk> : A Love Story , the Romance of Lorena Hickok and Eleanor Roosevelt .

 The episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by John Holmquist . Drew Barrymore returned as Brian 's ex @-@ girlfriend Jillian , and The Hills stars Lauren Conrad and Audrina Patridge guest starred as themselves in both cartoon form and live @-@ action form . The episode featured live @-@ action sequences with Jay Leno , Craig Ferguson and Jimmy Fallon from their respective talk shows , The Tonight Show , The Late Late Show and Late Night . In addition to the major guest stars , actresses Sarah Utterback and Kate Todd guest starred in the episode as Lindsay Lohan and Heidi Montag , respectively . The episode marked Utterback 's second appearance on the show , having previously provided the voice for Lohan in the season four episode " The Father , the Son and the Holy Fonz " . John Viener , a writer for Family Guy , provided the voice of Jillian 's husband , Derek Wilcox . Recurring guest voice actors James Burkholder , Jackson Douglas , Ralph Garman , Camille Guaty , writer Danny Smith , actor André Sogliuzzo , writer Alec Sulkin , and voice actor Wally Wingert also made minor appearances . 
 The fact that Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was originally announced in October 2008 . Creator Seth MacFarlane told Fox News , " I thought it would be funny to see if we could get [ Conrad ] to read very , very dense historical documents centering around the second World War , [ ... ] Lauren did one scene where she had to read a paragraph on scientific self @-@ analysis , which I thought was funny . " The staff was impressed with Conrad 's performance , saying that she " took it very seriously . " Conrad praised her time at the show , calling it " amazing " , and said that " they destroy me in it . I 'm totally making fun of myself . [ ... ] It was funny , I had to go over historical facts and like , biology and weird formulas I had no idea about . " Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills , " because America likes dumb people " , and that " The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb , and then discover that I 'm actually a genius , [ ... ] It 's a more exaggerated version of who I am , but fun to play . " 
 Conrad first met MacFarlane while recording a Laguna Beach : The Real Orange County clip for the season five episode " Prick Up Your Ears " . She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character . Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode . In an interview with People , she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting , and even calls herself an " awful actor " and admits that she cannot memorize lines . However , she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines . Even though she enjoyed the experience , she said that " [ acting is ] not really something I 'm interested in . " She had to do a lot of research before recording , because " there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words " and she " had to say it as if it was coming to [ her ] very easily . " Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would " really understood what [ she ] was talking about , it would come through a little more true . " MacFarlane commented on this , saying , " She made an effort [ to understand the text ] , so let me just put it that way . " He ultimately praised her performance , calling it " surprisingly fantastic " , and said : " She came in , and she 'd prepared before she even arrived . She hired an acting coach , with her own money , and she nailed it . She never once complained , and it was a long session . There was a lot of dialog . Her stamina was astonishing . "

 " We Love You , Conrad " includes several pop culture references . When Jillian and Peter are planning the wedding , Peter points out that only the last three words that musician Sting sings are understandable . At the restaurant , Jillian says that her fiancé speaks " Orange " , instead of Mandarin . Stewie calls Caitlyn Jenner ( then Bruce ) an " elegant , beautiful Dutch woman . " The Genesis cave from Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan appears in the episode , and the scene is mirrored line for line . The episode depicts The Hills star Spencer Pratt as an orangutan from Planet of the Apes . When Brian , Lauren Conrad and Stewie are watching The Hills , it suddenly cuts to footage from The A @-@ Team . In an attempt to impress Lauren , Brian wears Austin Powers glasses . The episode also makes references to actress Lindsay Lohan and the cartoon character Mr. Magoo . The promotional image for this episode , featuring Brian , Lauren Conrad and Stewie with his woman 's disguise , is a parody of an " iconic " The Hills photoshoot with Audrina Patridge , Conrad and Whitney Port . In addition , the title of the episode itself refers to Bye Bye Birdie , a 1960 @-@ Broadway musical . Lastly , the episode includes a reference of Bill Cosby having sexual relations with " The Hills " star Lauren Conrad .

 = Nikephoros ( Caesar ) = 
 Nikephoros ( Greek : Νικηφόρος ) , also Latinized as Nicephorus or <unk> , was the second son of Byzantine emperor Constantine V ( reigned 741 – 775 ) and Caesar of the Byzantine Empire . He was engaged in a plot against his half @-@ brother , Leo IV ( r . 775 – 780 ) , which cost Nikephoros his title , and was the focal point of numerous usurpation plots during the subsequent reigns of his nephew , Constantine VI ( r . 780 – 797 ) , and of Constantine 's mother , Irene of Athens ( r . 797 – 802 ) . He was therefore blinded and exiled to a monastery for most of his life , probably dying in the island of <unk> sometime after 812 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and first conspiracies = = = 
 Nikephoros was born in the late <unk> ( circa 756 / 758 ) to Emperor Constantine V and his third wife Eudokia . Nikephoros was Constantine 's third son overall , following the future Leo IV , who was born 750 to Constantine 's first wife Irene of Khazaria , and Christopher , who was born in circa 755 to Eudokia . Either Christopher or Nikephoros were possibly twin brothers to Eudokia 's and Constantine 's only daughter , <unk> . On April 1 , 769 , Eudokia was crowned as Augusta , and on the same occasion Christopher and Nikephoros were crowned and raised to the rank of Caesar , while their younger brother Niketas was made <unk> . Nikephoros had two other younger brothers , Anthimos and <unk> , who were also named <unk> at later dates . 
 When Constantine V died in 775 , his eldest son Leo IV ascended the Byzantine throne . Soon , Leo caused a rift with his half @-@ brothers , when he confiscated a large amount of gold reserved for their use and distributed it to the army and the citizens of Constantinople as a <unk> . Then , in spring 776 , a conspiracy headed by Nikephoros and involving a number of middle @-@ ranking courtiers was discovered . Nikephoros himself was stripped of his rank , but otherwise not harmed , while the other plotters were tonsured as monks and exiled to Cherson in the Crimea . 
 When Leo IV died in October 780 , his sole heir was the young Constantine VI , his son by the Empress Irene of Athens . Due to Constantine 's being underage , a regency was instituted under Irene , but this was not well received among leading officials . Not only was rule by a woman alien to the military @-@ dominated establishment of the time , but Irene was also a confirmed iconophile , an adherent of the veneration of holy images . This was regarded as heresy by the state @-@ sponsored doctrine of Iconoclasm , which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V 's memory . A number of them , including the Postal <unk> ( foreign minister ) Gregory , the former strategos ( governor ) of the Anatolic Theme Bardas and Constantine , the commander of the Excubitors guard regiment , consequently favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne . Barely a month and a half after Leo 's death , the plot was discovered . Irene had the conspirators exiled , and Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests , removing them from the line of succession . To confirm this before the people , on Christmas Day 780 , Nikephoros and his brothers were forced to perform the communion service in the Hagia Sophia . 
 Nikephoros and his brothers disappear from the sources until 792 , when the return of Irene to power ( after having been ousted in a military revolt in 790 ) , coupled with the disastrous defeat of Constantine VI at Marcellae against the Bulgars , caused widespread discontent among the troops . Some of the imperial guard regiments , the tagmata , proclaimed Nikephoros as emperor , but Constantine reacted swiftly : he arrested his uncles , and while Nikephoros was blinded , the others had their tongues slit . They were then imprisoned at a monastery in Therapia . 
 = = = After 792 = = = 
 Nikephoros is no longer mentioned by name after 792 ; instead , the brothers are mentioned collectively . It is therefore questionable whether he is to be included in subsequent events , although traditionally ( including in reference works like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium ) it is held that he did share in his brothers ' fate and died after 812 . 
 After Empress Irene deposed her son in 797 , the brothers were visited at the monastery by some of their supporters and persuaded to seek refuge in the Hagia Sophia . If it had been hoped that Constantinople 's populace would be moved to proclaim one of them emperor , their hopes were dashed . No uprising in their support materialized , and Irene 's trusted eunuch advisor Aetios managed to extricate the brothers and send them to exile in Athens . There , they were again the subject of a conspiracy : in March 799 , a certain <unk> , " archon of the Slavs in <unk> " in southern Thessaly , together with local troops from the theme of Hellas ( to which Athens belonged ) , planned to proclaim one of them emperor . The plot was foiled , but the brothers were again moved to <unk> in the Marmara Sea , and Nikephoros 's brothers were blinded as well . 
 The brothers are mentioned for the last time in 812 , when a group of disgruntled soldiers tried to proclaim the brothers emperors in the aftermath of the fall of <unk> to the Bulgars . Emperor Michael I <unk> ( r . 811 – 813 ) , however , promptly dismissed the soldiers involved and moved the brothers to the island of <unk> , where they died sometime later . 
 = Waterbuck = 
 The waterbuck ( Kobus ellipsiprymnus ) is a large antelope found widely in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . It is placed in the genus Kobus of the family Bovidae . It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833 . The thirteen subspecies are grouped under two varieties : the common or <unk> waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 177 – 235 cm ( 70 – 93 in ) and the average height is between 120 and 136 cm ( 47 and 54 in ) . A sexually dimorphic antelope , males are taller as well as heavier than females . Males reach approximately 127 cm ( 50 in ) at the shoulder , while females reach 119 cm ( 47 in ) . Males typically weigh 198 – 262 kg ( 437 – 578 lb ) and females 161 – 214 kg ( 355 – 472 lb ) . The coat colour varies from brown to grey . The long , spiral horns , present only on males , curve backward , then forward and are 55 – 99 cm ( 22 – 39 in ) long . 
 Waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature . A gregarious animal , the waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals . These groups are either nursery herds with females and their offspring or bachelor herds . Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of five years , but are most dominant from the age of six to nine . The waterbuck can not tolerate dehydration in hot weather , and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water . Predominantly a grazer , the waterbuck is mostly found on grassland . In equatorial regions , breeding takes place throughout the year , but births are at their peak in the rainy season . The gestational period lasts for seven to eight months , followed by the birth of a single calf . 
 Waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas along rivers , lakes and valleys . Due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water , the waterbuck have a sparse ecotone distribution . The IUCN lists the waterbuck as being of Least Concern . More specifically , the common waterbuck is listed as of Least Concern while the defassa waterbuck is Near Threatened . The population trend for both the common and defassa waterbuck is downwards , especially that of the latter , with large populations being eliminated from certain habitats because of hunting and human disturbance . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 The scientific name of the waterbuck is Kobus ellipsiprymnus . The waterbuck is one of the six species of the genus Kobus and belongs to the family Bovidae . It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833 . The generic name Kobus is a New Latin word , originating from an African name , koba . The specific name ellipsiprymnus refers to the white elliptical ring on the rump , from the Greek <unk> ( ellipse ) and <unk> ( <unk> , hind part ) . The animal acquired the vernacular name " waterbuck " due to its heavy dependence on water as compared to other antelopes and its ability to enter into water for defence . 
 The type specimen of the waterbuck was collected by South African hunter @-@ explorer Andrew Steedman in 1832 . This specimen was named Antilope ellipsiprymnus by Ogilby in 1833 . This species was transferred to the genus Kobus in 1840 , becoming K. ellipsiprymnus . It is usually known as the common waterbuck . In 1835 , German naturalist Eduard Rüppell collected another specimen , which differed from Steedman 's specimen in having a prominent white ring on its rump . Considering it a separate species , Rüppell gave it the Amharic name " defassa " waterbuck and scientific name Antilope defassa . Modern taxonomists , however , consider the common waterbuck and defassa waterbuck a single species , K. ellipsiprymnus , given the large number of instances of hybridisation between the two . Interbreeding between the two takes place in the Nairobi National Park owing to extensive overlapping of habitats . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Not many fossils of the waterbuck have been found . Fossils were scarce in the Cradle of Humankind , occurring only in a few pockets of the <unk> . On the basis of Valerius Geist 's theories about the relation of social evolution and dispersal in ungulates during the Pleistocene , the ancestral home of the waterbuck is considered to be the eastern coast of Africa - with the Horn of Africa to the north and the East African Rift Valley to the west . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 37 subspecies of the waterbuck had been initially recognised on the basis of coat colour . They were classified into two groups : the Ellipsen waterbuck group and the Defassa waterbuck group . Owing to the large number of variations in the coat colour in the Defassa waterbuck group , as many as 29 subspecies were included in it ; the Ellipsen waterbuck group consisted of eight subspecies . In 1971 , however , the number of subspecies was reduced to thirteen ( four for the Ellipsen waterbuck group and nine for the Defassa waterbuck group ) . Though they occur in Zambia as well , their ranges are separated by relief features or by the Muchinga escarpment . The subspecies have been listed below ( along with notes about the former subspecies which were recombined into a single subspecies ) : 
 K. e. ellipsiprymnus ( Ellipsen waterbuck , common or Ringed waterbuck ) group : Found in the Webi Shebeli river valley in southeastern Ethiopia ; the Juba and Webi Shebeli river valleys in Somalia ; essentially east of the Rift Valley in Kenya and Tanzania ; east of the Rift Valley in the middle Zambezi and Luangwa valleys in Zambia ; Malawi ; Mozambique ; east of the <unk> River in the Caprivi Strip of Namibia ; eastern and northern Botswana ; Zimbabwe ; and eastern and northern Transvaal in South Africa . Its distribution slightly overlaps that of the typical defassa along the Rift Valley in Kenya and Tanzania , and that of the Crawshay defassa in the Rift Valley in Zambia .

 = = Description = = 
 The waterbuck is the largest amongst the six species of Kobus . It is a sexually dimorphic antelope , with the males nearly 7 percent taller than females and around 8 percent longer . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 177 – 235 cm ( 70 – 93 in ) and the average height is between 120 and 136 cm ( 47 and 54 in ) . Males reach approximately 127 cm ( 50 in ) at the shoulder , while females reach 119 cm ( 47 in ) . The waterbuck is one of the heaviest <unk> a newborn typically weighs 13 @.@ 6 kg ( 30 lb ) , and growth in weight is faster in males than in females . Males typically weigh 198 – 262 kg ( 437 – 578 lb ) and females 161 – 214 kg ( 355 – 472 lb ) . The tail is 22 – 45 cm ( 8 @.@ 7 – 17 @.@ 7 in ) long . 
 The waterbuck is of a robust build . The shaggy coat is reddish brown to grey , and becomes progressively darker with age . Males are darker than females . Though apparently thick , the hair is sparse on the coat . The hair on the neck is , however , long and shaggy . When sexually excited , the skin of the waterbuck secretes a greasy substance with the odour of musk , giving it the name " greasy kob " . This secretion also assists in water @-@ proofing the body when the animal dives into water . The facial features include a white muzzle and light eyebrows and lighter insides of the ears . There is a cream @-@ coloured patch ( called " bib " ) on the throat . Waterbuck are characterised by a long neck and short , strong and black legs . Females have two nipples . <unk> glands , foot glands and inguinal glands are absent . 
 The common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck are remarkably different in their physical appearances . Measurements indicate greater tail length in the latter , whereas the common waterbuck stand taller than the defassa waterbuck . However , the principal differentiation between the two types is the white ring of hair surrounding the tail on the rump , which is a hollow circle in the common waterbuck but covered with white hair in the defassa waterbuck . 
 The long , spiral horns curve backward , then forward . Found only on males , the horns range from 55 to 99 cm ( 22 to 39 in ) in length . To some extent , the length of the horns is related to the bull 's age . A rudimentary horn in the form of a bone lump may be found on the skulls of females . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature , though some migration may occur with the onset of monsoon . A gregarious animal , the waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals . The various groups are the nursery herds , bachelor herds and territorial males . Herd size increases in summer , whereas groups fragment in the winter months , probably under the influence of food availability . As soon as young males start developing horns ( at around seven to nine months of age ) , they are chased out of the herd by territorial bulls . These males then form bachelor herds and may roam in female home ranges . Females have home ranges stretching over 200 – 600 hectares ( 0 @.@ 77 – 2 @.@ 32 sq mi ; 490 – 1 @,@ 480 acres ) . A few females may form spinster herds . Though females are seldom aggressive , minor tension may arise in herds . 
 Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of five years , but are most dominant from the age of six to nine . Territorial males hold territories 4 – 146 hectares ( 0 @.@ 015 – 0 @.@ 564 sq mi ; 9 @.@ 9 – 360 @.@ 8 acres ) in size . Males are inclined to remain settled in their territories , though over time they may leave inferior territories for more spacious ones . Marking of territories includes no elaborate rituals - dung and urine are occasionally dropped . After the age of ten years , males lose their territorial nature and replaced by a younger bull , following which they recede to a small and unprotected area . There is another social group , that of the satellite males , which are mature bulls as yet without their own territories , who exploit resources , particularly mating opportunities , even in the presence of the dominant bull . The territorial male may allow a few satellite males into his territory , and they may contribute to its defence . However , gradually they may deprive the actual owner of his territory and seize the area for themselves . In a study in the Lake Nakuru National Park , only 7 percent of the adult males held territories , and only half of the territorial males tolerated one or more satellite males . 
 Territorial males may use several kinds of display . In one type of display , the white patch on the throat and between the eyes is clearly revealed , and other displays can demonstrate the thickness of the neck . These activities frighten trespassers . Lowering of the head and the body depict submission before the territorial male , who stands erect . Fights , which may last up to thirty minutes , involve threat displays typical of bovids accompanied by snorting . Fights may even become so violent that one of the opponents meets its death due to severe abdominal or thoracic wounds . A silent animal , the waterbuck makes use of flehmen response for visual communication and alarm snorts for vocal communication . Waterbuck often enter water to escape from predators which include lions , leopards , cheetahs , African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles ( leopards and spotted hyenas prey on juveniles ) . However , it has been observed that the waterbuck does not particularly like being in water . Waterbuck may run into cover when alarmed , and males often attack predators . 
 = = = Diseases and parasites = = = 
 Waterbuck are susceptible to ulcers , <unk> infection and kidney stones . Other diseases from which these animals suffer are foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease , <unk> fever , yellow fever , bluetongue , bovine virus diarrhoea , brucellosis and anthrax . The waterbuck is more resistant to rinderpest than are other antelopes . They are unaffected by tsetse flies but ticks may introduce parasitic protozoa such as Theileria parva , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . 27 species of ixodid tick have been found on waterbuck - a healthy waterbuck may carry a total of over 4000 ticks in their larval or nymphal stages , the most common among them being Amblyomma <unk> and Rhipicephalus <unk> . Internal parasites found in waterbuck include tapeworms , <unk> , <unk> and several helminths . 
 = = Diet = = 
 The waterbuck exhibits great dependence on water . It can not tolerate dehydration in hot weather , and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water . However , it has been observed that unlike the other members of its genus ( such as the kob and puku ) , the waterbuck ranges farther into the woodlands while maintaining its proximity to water . With grasses constituting a substantial 70 to 95 percent of the diet , the waterbuck is predominantly a grazer frequenting grasslands . Reeds and rushes like Typha and Phragmites may also be preferred . A study found regular consumption of three grass species round the year : Panicum <unk> , Echinochloa <unk> and Andropogon <unk> . Hyparrhenia <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Oryza <unk> along with annual species were the main preference in the early rainy season , while long life grasses and forage from trees constituted three @-@ fourths of the diet in the dry season . 
 Though the defassa waterbuck were found to have a much greater requirement for protein than the African buffalo and the <unk> oryx , the waterbuck was found to spend much lesser time on browsing ( eating leaves , small shoots and fruits ) in comparison to the other grazers . In the dry season about 32 percent of the 24 @-@ hour day was spent in browsing , whereas no time was spent on it during the wet season . The choice of grasses varies with location rather than availability ; for instance , in western Uganda , while Sporobolus pyramidalis was favoured in some places , Themeda triandra was the main choice elsewhere . The common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck in the same area may differ in their choices ; it has been observed that while the former preferred Heteropogon contortus and Cynodon dactylon , the latter showed less preference for these grasses . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Waterbuck are slower than other antelopes in terms of the rate of maturity . While males become sexually mature at the age of six years , females reach maturity within two to three years . Females may conceive by the age of two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years , and remain reproductive for another ten years . In equatorial regions , breeding takes place throughout the year , and births are at their peak in the rainy season . However , breeding is seasonal in the Sudan ( south of Sahara ) , with the mating season lasting four months . The season extends for even longer periods in some areas of southern Africa . Oestrus lasts for a day or less . 
 Mating begins after the male confirms that the female is in oestrus , which he does by sniffing her vulva and urine . A resistive female would try to bite or even fight off an advancing male . The male exhibits flehmen , and often licks the neck of the female and rubs his face and the base of his horns against her back . There are several attempts at mounting before the actual copulation . The female shifts her tail to one side , while the male clasps her sides with his forelegs and rests on her back during copulation , which may occur as many as ten times . 
 The gestational period lasts for seven to eight months , followed by the birth of a single calf . Twins are rare . Pregnant females isolate themselves and into thickets as parturition approaches . Newborn calves can stand on their feet within half @-@ an @-@ hour of birth . The mother eats the afterbirth . She communicates with the calf by bleating or snorting . Calves are kept hidden for two to three weeks or even two months . At about three to four weeks , the calf begins following its mother , who signals it to do so by raising her tail . Though bereft of horns , mothers will fiercely defend their offspring from predators . Calves are weaned at eight months , following which time they join groups of calves of their own age . Young females remain with their mothers in nursery herds , or may also join bachelor herds . The waterbuck lives to 18 years in the wild and 30 years in captivity . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The waterbuck is native to southern and eastern Africa ( including countries such as Angola , Botswana , The Democratic Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Kenya , Namibia , South Africa , Tanzania and Uganda ) besides a few countries of western and northern Africa such as Chad , Côte d 'Ivoire , Ghana , Mali , Niger , Nigeria and Senegal . Though formerly widespread in sub @-@ Saharan Africa , its numbers have now decreased in most areas . 
 The common waterbuck is found east of the Eastern African Rift . Its southern range extends to the Hluhluwe @-@ Umfolozi Game Reserve ( KwaZulu Natal ) and to central Namibia . By contrast , the defassa waterbuck inhabits western and central Africa . The defassa waterbuck occurs west of the Albertine Rift and ranges from Eritrea to Guinea Bissau in the southern Sahel , its most northerly point of distribution being in southern Mali . Its range also stretches east of the Congo basin through Zambia into Angola , while another branch extends to the Zaire River west of the Congo basin . While the common waterbuck is now extinct in Ethiopia , the defassa waterbuck has become extinct in Gambia . 
 Waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas alongside rivers , lakes and valleys . Due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water , the waterbuck have a sparse distribution across ecotones ( areas of interface between two different ecosystems ) . A study in the Ruwenzori Range showed that the mean density of waterbuck was 5 @.@ 5 per square mile , and estimates in the Maasai Mara were as low as 1 @.@ 3 per square mile . It has been observed that territorial size depends on the quality of the habitat , the age and health of the animal and the population density . The greater the age of the animal or the denser the populations , the smaller are the territories . In Queen Elizabeth National Park , females had home ranges 21 – 61 hectares ( 0 @.@ 081 – 0 @.@ 236 sq mi ; 52 – 151 acres ) in area whereas home ranges for bachelor males averaged between 24 – 38 hectares ( 0 @.@ 093 – 0 @.@ 147 sq mi ; 59 – 94 acres ) . The oldest female ( around 18 years old ) had the smallest home range . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) lists the waterbuck as of Least Concern . More specifically , the common waterbuck is listed as of Least Concern while the defassa waterbuck is Near Threatened . The population trend for both the common and defassa waterbuck is decreasing , especially that of the latter , with large populations being eliminated from their habitats due to Poaching and human settlement . Their own sedentary nature too is responsible for this to some extent . Numbers have fallen in Queen Elizabeth National Park , Murchison Falls National Park , Akagera National Park , Lake Nakuru National Park , and Comoé National Park . Population decrease in the Lake Nakuru National Park has been attributed to heavy metal poisoning in the animals . While cadmium and lead levels were dangerously high in the kidney and the liver , copper , calcium and phosphorus deficiency was noted . 
 Over 60 percent of the defassa waterbuck populations thrive in protected areas , most notably in Niokolo @-@ Koba , <unk> , Mole , Bui , Pendjari , Manovo @-@ Gounda St. Floris , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> , Virunga , Omo , Mago , Murchison Falls , Serengeti , and Katavi , Kafue and Queen Elizabeth National Parks , the national parks and hunting zones of North Province ( Cameroon ) , <unk> River Forest Reserve , Nazinga Game Ranch , <unk> Valley , Awash Valley , <unk> and Arly @-@ Singou . The common waterbuck occurs in Tsavo , Tarangire , <unk> , Kruger and Lake Nakuru National Parks , Laikipia , <unk> , Luangwa Valley , Selous and Hluhluwe @-@ Umfolozi game reserves and private lands in South Africa .

Angle exposed him as Matt Striker again , before defeating him for the third consecutive time . Striker went on to compete on Heat and appear in WWE 's developmental territory , Deep South Wrestling . 
 Striker developed a heel ( villainous ) teacher gimmick , calling WWE his school and hosting a segment called Matt Striker 's Classroom on Raw , which debuted on December 12 .

 = Virus = 
 A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms . Viruses can infect all types of life forms , from animals and plants to microorganisms , including bacteria and archaea . 
 Since Dmitri Ivanovsky 's 1892 article describing a non @-@ bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants , and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898 , about 5 @,@ 000 virus species have been described in detail , although there are millions of types . Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most abundant type of biological entity . The study of viruses is known as virology , a sub @-@ speciality of microbiology . 
 While not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell , viruses exist in the form of independent particles . These viral particles , also known as virions , consist of two or three parts : ( i ) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA , long molecules that carry genetic information ; ( ii ) a protein coat , called the capsid , which surrounds and protects the genetic material ; and in some cases ( iii ) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell . The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others . Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope . The average virion is about one one @-@ hundredth the size of the average bacterium . 
 The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear : some may have evolved from plasmids — pieces of DNA that can move between cells — while others may have evolved from bacteria . In evolution , viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer , which increases genetic diversity . Viruses are considered by some to be a life form , because they carry genetic material , reproduce , and evolve through natural selection . However they lack key characteristics ( such as cell structure ) that are generally considered necessary to count as life . Because they possess some but not all such qualities , viruses have been described as " organisms at the edge of life " , and as replicators . 
 Viruses spread in many ways ; viruses in plants are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap , such as aphids ; viruses in animals can be carried by blood @-@ sucking insects . These disease @-@ bearing organisms are known as vectors . Influenza viruses are spread by coughing and sneezing . Norovirus and rotavirus , common causes of viral gastroenteritis , are transmitted by the faecal – oral route and are passed from person to person by contact , entering the body in food or water . HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood . The range of host cells that a virus can infect is called its " host range " . This can be narrow , meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species , or broad , meaning it is capable of infecting many . 
 Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus . Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines , which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection . However , some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections . Antibiotics have no effect on viruses , but several antiviral drugs have been developed . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word is from the Latin neuter <unk> referring to poison and other noxious liquids , from ' the same Indo @-@ European base as Sanskrit <unk> poison , Avestan <unk> poison , ancient Greek <unk> poison ' , first attested in English in 1398 in John <unk> 's translation of Bartholomeus Anglicus 's De Proprietatibus Rerum . Virulent , from Latin <unk> ( poisonous ) , dates to c . 1400 . A meaning of " agent that causes infectious disease " is first recorded in 1728 , before the discovery of viruses by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892 . The English plural is viruses ( sometimes also viri or vira ) , whereas the Latin word is a mass noun , which has no classically attested plural ( however in Neo @-@ Latin <unk> is used ) . The adjective viral dates to 1948 . The term virion ( plural virions ) , which dates from 1959 , is also used to refer to a single , stable infective viral particle that is released from the cell and is fully capable of infecting other cells of the same type . 
 = = History = = 
 Louis Pasteur was unable to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected using a microscope . In 1884 , the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter ( known today as the Chamberland filter or Chamberland @-@ Pasteur filter ) with pores smaller than bacteria . Thus , he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution . In 1892 , the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus . His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration . Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria , but did not pursue the idea . At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium – this was part of the germ theory of disease . In 1898 , the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent . He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing , but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles , he called it a <unk> <unk> <unk> ( soluble living germ ) and re @-@ introduced the word virus . Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature , a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley , who proved they were particulate . In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul <unk> passed the first animal virus – agent of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease ( <unk> ) – through a similar filter . 
 In the early 20th century , the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered a group of viruses that infect bacteria , now called bacteriophages ( or commonly phages ) , and the French @-@ Canadian microbiologist Félix d 'Herelle described viruses that , when added to bacteria on agar , would produce areas of dead bacteria . He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions ( lowest virus concentrations ) , rather than killing all the bacteria , formed discrete areas of dead organisms . Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension . <unk> were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera , but their promise was forgotten with the development of penicillin . The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes , and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria . 
 By the end of the 19th century , viruses were defined in terms of their infectivity , their ability to be filtered , and their requirement for living hosts . Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals . In 1906 , Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph , and , in 1913 , E. Steinhardt , C. Israeli , and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue . In 1928 , H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens ' kidneys . Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s , when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production . 
 Another breakthrough came in 1931 , when the American pathologist Ernest William <unk> and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilized chickens ' eggs . In 1949 , John Franklin Enders , Thomas Weller , and Frederick Robbins grew polio virus in cultured human embryo cells , the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs . This work enabled Jonas Salk to make an effective polio vaccine . 
 The first images of viruses were obtained upon the invention of electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll . In 1935 , American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it was mostly made of protein . A short time later , this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts . The tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be crystallised and its structure could therefore be elucidated in detail . The first X @-@ ray diffraction pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and <unk> in 1941 . On the basis of her pictures , Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955 . In the same year , Heinz Fraenkel @-@ <unk> and Robley Williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its protein coat can assemble by themselves to form functional viruses , suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host cells . 
 The second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery and most of the over 2 @,@ 000 recognised species of animal , plant , and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years . In 1957 , equine <unk> and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhea ( a <unk> ) were discovered . In 1963 , the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg , and in 1965 , Howard Temin described the first retrovirus . Reverse transcriptase , the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA , was first described in 1970 , independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore . In 1983 Luc Montagnier 's team at the Pasteur Institute in France , first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved . The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils , so molecular techniques have been used to compare the DNA or RNA of viruses and are a useful means of investigating how they arose . In addition , viral genetic material may occasionally integrate into the germline of the host organisms , by which they can be passed on vertically to the offspring of the host for many generations . This provides an invaluable source of information for <unk> to trace back ancient viruses that have existed up to millions of years ago . Currently , there are three main hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses : 
 Regressive hypothesis 
 Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells . Over time , genes not required by their parasitism were lost . The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that , like viruses , can reproduce only inside host cells . They lend support to this hypothesis , as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell . This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis , or reduction hypothesis . 
 Cellular origin hypothesis 
 Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that " escaped " from the genes of a larger organism . The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids ( pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells ) or transposons ( molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell ) . Once called " jumping genes " , transposons are examples of mobile genetic elements and could be the origin of some viruses . They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950 . This is sometimes called the vagrancy hypothesis , or the escape hypothesis . 
 Co @-@ evolution hypothesis 
 This is also called the virus @-@ first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same time as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years . Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat . However , they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called <unk> agents . Viroids are important pathogens of plants . They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication . The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own . It is , therefore , a defective virus . Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell , it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells . In similar manner , the <unk> <unk> is dependent on <unk> , which infects the protozoan <unk> <unk> . These viruses , which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell , are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses . 
 In the past , there were problems with all of these hypotheses : the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way . The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles . The virus @-@ first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells . Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre @-@ date the divergence of life into the three domains . This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re @-@ evaluate these three classical hypotheses . 
 The evidence for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses . To date , such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct . However , it seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor , and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms . 
 Prions are infectious protein molecules that do not contain DNA or RNA . They can cause infections such as scrapie in sheep , bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( " mad cow " disease ) in cattle , and chronic wasting disease in deer ; in humans , <unk> diseases include Kuru , Creutzfeldt – Jakob disease , and Gerstmann – <unk> – <unk> syndrome . Although prions are fundamentally different from viruses and viroids , their discovery gives credence to the theory that viruses could have evolved from self @-@ replicating molecules . 
 = = Microbiology = = 
 = = = Life properties = = = 
 Opinions differ on whether viruses are a form of life , or organic structures that interact with living organisms . They have been described as " organisms at the edge of life " , since they resemble organisms in that they possess genes , evolve by natural selection , and reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves through self @-@ assembly . Although they have genes , they do not have a cellular structure , which is often seen as the basic unit of life . Viruses do not have their own metabolism , and require a host cell to make new products . They therefore cannot naturally reproduce outside a host cell – although bacterial species such as rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same limitation . Accepted forms of life use cell division to reproduce , whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells . They differ from autonomous growth of crystals as they inherit genetic mutations while being subject to natural selection . Virus self @-@ assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life , as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self @-@ assembling organic molecules . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Viruses display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes , called morphologies . In general , viruses are much smaller than bacteria . Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres . Some <unk> have a total length of up to 1400 nm ; their diameters are only about 80 nm . Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope so scanning and transmission electron microscopes are used to visualise virions . To increase the contrast between viruses and the background , electron @-@ dense " stains " are used . These are solutions of salts of heavy metals , such as tungsten , that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain . When virions are coated with stain ( positive staining ) , fine detail is obscured . Negative staining overcomes this problem by staining the background only . 
 A complete virus particle , known as a virion , consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid . These are formed from identical protein subunits called capsomeres . Viruses can have a lipid " envelope " derived from the host cell membrane . The capsid is made from proteins encoded by the viral genome and its shape serves as the basis for morphological distinction . <unk> coded protein subunits will self @-@ assemble to form a capsid , in general requiring the presence of the virus genome . Complex viruses code for proteins that assist in the construction of their capsid . Proteins associated with nucleic acid are known as <unk> , and the association of viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic acid is called a nucleocapsid . The capsid and entire virus structure can be mechanically ( physically ) probed through atomic force microscopy . In general , there are four main morphological virus types : 
 <unk> 
 These viruses are composed of a single type of <unk> stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure , which may have a central cavity , or tube . This arrangement results in rod @-@ shaped or filamentous virions : These can be short and highly rigid , or long and very flexible . The genetic material , in general , single @-@ stranded RNA , but ssDNA in some cases , is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein . Overall , the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres . The well @-@ studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus . 
 <unk> 
 Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near @-@ spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry . A regular icosahedron is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub @-@ units . The minimum number of identical capsomeres required is twelve , each composed of five identical sub @-@ units . Many viruses , such as rotavirus , have more than twelve capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry . <unk> at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called <unk> . <unk> on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called <unk> . <unk> are in essence flat and <unk> , which form the 12 vertices , are curved . The same protein may act as the subunit of both the <unk> and <unk> or they may be composed of different proteins . 
 <unk> 
 This is an icosahedron elongated along the fivefold axis and is a common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages . This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end . 
 Envelope 
 Some species of virus envelop themselves in a modified form of one of the cell membranes , either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum , thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope . This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome ; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host . The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy . Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity . 
 Complex 
 These viruses possess a capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral , and that may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall . Some bacteriophages , such as <unk> phage T4 , have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail , which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres . This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe , attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell . 
 The poxviruses are large , complex viruses that have an unusual morphology . The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid . The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function . The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface . The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic , ranging from ovoid to brick shape . <unk> is one of the largest characterised viruses , with a capsid diameter of 400 nm . Protein filaments measuring 100 nm project from the surface . The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope , therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral . In 2011 , researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces , Chile . Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis , it can be seen with a basic optical microscope . In 2013 , the <unk> genus was discovered in Chile and Australia , and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and <unk> . 
 Some viruses that infect Archaea have complex structures that are unrelated to any other form of virus , with a wide variety of unusual shapes , ranging from spindle @-@ shaped structures , to viruses that resemble hooked rods , teardrops or even bottles . Other archaeal viruses resemble the tailed bacteriophages , and can have multiple tail structures . 
 = = = Genome = = = 
 An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species ; as a group , they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants , animals , archaea , or bacteria . There are millions of different types of viruses , although only about 5 @,@ 000 types have been described in detail . As of September 2015 , the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 75 @,@ 000 complete genome <unk> but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered . 
 A virus has either a DNA or an RNA genome and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus , respectively . The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes . Plant viruses tend to have single @-@ stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double @-@ stranded DNA genomes . 
 Viral genomes are circular , as in the <unk> , or linear , as in the adenoviruses . The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome . Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses , the genome is often divided up into separate parts , in which case it is called segmented . For RNA viruses , each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid . However , all segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious , as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses . 
 A viral genome , irrespective of nucleic acid type , is almost always either single @-@ stranded or double @-@ stranded . Single @-@ stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid , analogous to one @-@ half of a ladder split down the middle . Double @-@ stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids , analogous to a ladder . The virus particles of some virus families , such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae , contain a genome that is partially double @-@ stranded and partially single @-@ stranded . 
 For most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single @-@ stranded DNA genomes , the single strands are said to be either positive @-@ sense ( called the plus @-@ strand ) or negative @-@ sense ( called the minus @-@ strand ) , depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . Positive @-@ sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell . Negative @-@ sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive @-@ sense RNA by an RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase before translation . DNA nomenclature for viruses with single @-@ sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature , in that the template strand for the viral mRNA is complementary to it ( − ) , and the coding strand is a copy of it ( + ) . However , several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are <unk> in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double @-@ stranded replicative intermediate . Examples include <unk> , which are ssDNA plant viruses and <unk> , which are ssRNA viruses of animals . 
 Genome size varies greatly between species . The smallest viral genomes – the ssDNA <unk> , family <unk> – code for only two proteins and have a genome size of only two kilobases ; the largest – the <unk> – have genome sizes of around two megabases which code for about 2500 proteins . 
 In general , RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses because of a higher error @-@ rate when replicating , and have a maximum upper size limit . Beyond this limit , errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive . To compensate for this , RNA viruses often have segmented genomes – the genome is split into smaller molecules – thus reducing the chance that an error in a single @-@ component genome will incapacitate the entire genome . In contrast , DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the high fidelity of their replication enzymes . Single @-@ strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule , however , as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case . 
 = = = Genetic mutation = = = 
 Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms . These include a process called antigenic drift where individual bases in the DNA or RNA mutate to other bases . Most of these point mutations are " silent " – they do not change the protein that the gene encodes – but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs . <unk> shift occurs when there is a major change in the genome of the virus . This can be a result of recombination or reassortment . When this happens with influenza viruses , pandemics might result . RNA viruses often exist as <unk> or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences . Such <unk> are a prime target for natural selection . 
 Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages ; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses or ( offspring ) that have unique characteristics . This is called reassortment or viral sex . 
 Genetic recombination is the process by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined to the end of a different DNA molecule . This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied . Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses . 
 = = = Replication cycle = = = 
 Viral populations do not grow through cell division , because they are acellular . Instead , they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves , and they assemble in the cell . 
 The life cycle of viruses differs greatly between species but there are six basic stages in the life cycle of viruses : 
 Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface . This specificity determines the host range of a virus . For example , HIV infects a limited range of human <unk> . This is because its surface protein , gp120 , specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found on the surface of CD4 + T @-@ Cells . This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication . Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes , or changes of non @-@ enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter . 
 Penetration follows attachment : <unk> enter the host cell through receptor @-@ mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion . This is often called viral entry . The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells . Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose , and fungi one of chitin , so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall . However , nearly all plant viruses ( such as tobacco mosaic virus ) can also move directly from cell to cell , in the form of single @-@ stranded nucleoprotein complexes , through pores called <unk> . Bacteria , like plants , have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell . However , given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size , some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall , while the viral capsid remains outside . 
 <unk> is a process in which the viral capsid is removed : This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation ; the end @-@ result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid . 
 Replication of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome . Replication involves synthesis of viral messenger RNA ( mRNA ) from " early " genes ( with exceptions for positive sense RNA viruses ) , viral protein synthesis , possible assembly of viral proteins , then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression . This may be followed , for complex viruses with larger genomes , by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis : " late " gene expression is , in general , of structural or virion proteins . 
 Assembly – Following the structure @-@ mediated self @-@ assembly of the virus particles , some modification of the proteins often occurs . In viruses such as HIV , this modification ( sometimes called maturation ) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell . 
 Release – Viruses can be released from the host cell by lysis , a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present : This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses . Some viruses undergo a <unk> cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host 's chromosome . The viral genome is then known as a " provirus " or , in the case of bacteriophages a " prophage " . Whenever the host divides , the viral genome is also replicated . The viral genome is mostly silent within the host . However , at some point , the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus , which may lyse the host cells . <unk> viruses ( e.g. , HIV ) typically are released from the host cell by budding . During this process the virus acquires its envelope , which is a modified piece of the host 's plasma or other , internal membrane . 
 The genetic material within virus particles , and the method by which the material is replicated , varies considerably between different types of viruses . 
 DNA viruses 
 The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell 's nucleus . If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface , these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane ( e.g. , herpesviruses ) or – more usually – by receptor @-@ mediated endocytosis . Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell 's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery , and RNA processing machinery . However , viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves . In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell 's nuclear membrane to access this machinery , while in bacteria it need only enter the cell . 
 RNA viruses 
 Replication usually takes place in the cytoplasm . RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication . The polarity ( whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins ) of single @-@ stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism ; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single @-@ stranded or double @-@ stranded . All RNA viruses use their own RNA <unk> enzymes to create copies of their genomes . 
 Reverse transcribing viruses 
 These have ssRNA ( Retroviridae , <unk> , <unk> ) or dsDNA ( <unk> , and Hepadnaviridae ) in their particles . Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ( retroviruses ) , use a DNA intermediate to replicate , whereas those with DNA genomes ( pararetroviruses ) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication . Both types use a reverse transcriptase , or RNA @-@ dependent DNA polymerase enzyme , to carry out the nucleic acid conversion . Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process ; pararetroviruses do not , although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus . They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme , e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine . An example of the first type is HIV , which is a retrovirus . Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae , which includes Hepatitis B virus . 
 = = = Effects on the host cell = = = 
 The range of structural and biochemical effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive . These are called <unk> effects . Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell . The causes of death include cell lysis , alterations to the cell 's surface membrane and apoptosis . Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus @-@ specific proteins , not all of which are components of the virus particle . 
 Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell . Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally . This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years . This is often the case with herpes viruses . Some viruses , such as Epstein – Barr virus , can cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy , while others , such as papillomaviruses , are established causes of cancer . 
 = = = Host range = = = 
 Viruses are by far the most abundant biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together . They infect all types of cellular life including animals , plants , bacteria and fungi . However , different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species @-@ specific . Some , such as smallpox virus for example , can infect only one species – in this case humans , and are said to have a narrow host range . Other viruses , such as rabies virus , can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range . The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals , and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans . The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Classification seeks to describe the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them on the basis of similarities . In 1962 , André <unk> , Robert Horne , and Paul <unk> were the first to develop a means of virus classification , based on the Linnaean hierarchical system . This system bases classification on phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species . Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties ( not those of their hosts ) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes . Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed . However , viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class , as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond Order . As such , the Baltimore Classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy . 
 = = = ICTV classification = = = 
 The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) developed the current classification system and wrote guidelines that put a greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity . A unified taxonomy ( a universal system for classifying viruses ) has been established . The 9th <unk> Report defines the concept of the virus species as the lowest taxon ( group ) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa . However , at present only a small part of the total diversity of viruses has been studied , with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20 % of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before , and samples from the environment , such as from seawater and ocean sediments , finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel . 
 The general taxonomic structure is as follows : 
 Order ( <unk> ) 
 Family ( <unk> ) 
 Subfamily ( <unk> ) 
 Genus ( <unk> ) 
 Species ( <unk> ) 
 In the current ( 2013 ) ICTV taxonomy , 7 orders have been established , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The committee does not formally distinguish between subspecies , strains , and isolates . In total there are 7 orders , 103 families , 22 subfamilies , 455 genera , about 2 @,@ 827 species and over 4 @,@ 000 types yet unclassified . 
 = = = Baltimore classification = = = 
 The Nobel Prize @-@ winning biologist David Baltimore devised the Baltimore classification system . The ICTV classification system is used in conjunction with the Baltimore classification system in modern virus classification . 
 The Baltimore classification of viruses is based on the mechanism of mRNA production . Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves , but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family . Viral genomes may be single @-@ stranded ( ss ) or double @-@ stranded ( ds ) , RNA or DNA , and may or may not use reverse transcriptase ( RT ) . In addition , ssRNA viruses may be either sense ( + ) or antisense ( − ) . This classification places viruses into seven groups : 
 I : dsDNA viruses ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) 
 II : ssDNA viruses ( + strand or " sense " ) DNA ( e.g. <unk> ) 
 III : dsRNA viruses ( e.g. <unk> ) 
 IV : ( + ) ssRNA viruses ( + strand or sense ) RNA ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> ) 
 V : ( − ) ssRNA viruses ( − strand or antisense ) RNA ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> ) 
 VI : ssRNA @-@ RT viruses ( + strand or sense ) RNA with DNA intermediate in life @-@ cycle ( e.g. Retroviruses ) 
 VII : dsDNA @-@ RT viruses ( e.g. <unk> ) 
 As an example of viral classification , the chicken pox virus , varicella zoster ( <unk> ) , belongs to the order <unk> , family Herpesviridae , subfamily <unk> , and genus <unk> . <unk> is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase . 
 = = Role in human disease = = 
 Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold , influenza , chickenpox , and cold sores . Many serious diseases such as Ebola virus disease , AIDS , avian influenza , and SARS are caused by viruses . The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence . Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent , such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 ( <unk> ) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome . There is controversy over whether the <unk> , previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses , could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans . 
 Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism , which depends largely on the viral species . Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis , the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell . In multicellular organisms , if enough cells die , the whole organism will start to suffer the effects . Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis , resulting in disease , they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism . An example would include the ability of the herpes simplex virus , which causes cold sores , to remain in a dormant state within the human body . This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses , including Epstein – Barr virus , which causes glandular fever , and varicella zoster virus , which causes chickenpox and shingles . Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus . However , these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial , as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens , such as Yersinia pestis . 
 Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections , where the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the host 's defense mechanisms . This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections . People chronically infected are known as carriers , as they serve as reservoirs of infectious virus . In populations with a high proportion of carriers , the disease is said to be endemic . 
 = = = Epidemiology = = = 
 Viral epidemiology is the branch of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans . Transmission of viruses can be vertical , which means from mother to child , or horizontal , which means from person to person . Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV , where the baby is born already infected with the virus . Another , more rare , example is the varicella zoster virus , which , although causing relatively mild infections in humans , can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby . 
 Horizontal transmission is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations . Transmission can occur when : body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity , e.g. , HIV ; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing , e.g. , hepatitis C ; exchange of saliva by mouth , e.g. , Epstein – Barr virus ; contaminated food or water is ingested , e.g. , norovirus ; aerosols containing virions are inhaled , e.g. , influenza virus ; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host , e.g. , dengue . The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include population density , the number of susceptible individuals , ( i.e. , those not immune ) , the quality of healthcare and the weather . 
 Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases . Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted . It is important to find the source , or sources , of the outbreak and to identify the virus . Once the virus has been identified , the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines . When vaccines are not available , sanitation and disinfection can be effective . Often , infected people are isolated from the rest of the community , and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine . To control the outbreak of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001 , thousands of cattle were slaughtered . Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms . Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks , but are known for most infections . Somewhat overlapping , but mainly following the incubation period , there is a period of <unk> — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal . This , too , is known for many viral infections , and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks . When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population , community , or region , they are called epidemics . If outbreaks spread worldwide , they are called pandemics . 
 = = = Epidemics and pandemics = = = 
 Native American populations were devastated by contagious diseases , in particular , smallpox , brought to the Americas by European colonists . It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas , but the numbers have been estimated to be close to 70 % of the indigenous population . The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population . 
 A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic . The 1918 flu pandemic , which lasted until 1919 , was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus . The victims were often healthy young adults , in contrast to most influenza outbreaks , which predominantly affect juvenile , elderly , or otherwise @-@ weakened patients . Older estimates say it killed 40 – 50 million people , while more recent research suggests that it may have killed as many as 100 million people , or 5 % of the world 's population in 1918 . 
 Most researchers believe that HIV originated in sub @-@ Saharan Africa during the 20th century ; it is now a pandemic , with an estimated 38 @.@ 6 million people now living with the disease worldwide . The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS ( UNAIDS ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981 , making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history . In 2007 there were 2 @.@ 7 million new HIV infections and 2 million HIV @-@ related deaths . 
 Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the <unk> . <unk> are filament @-@ like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever , and include <unk> and <unk> . Marburg virus , first discovered in 1967 , attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola . Ebola Virus Disease has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified . The worst and most recent one is the West Africa epidemic . 
 = = = Cancer = = = 
 Viruses are an established cause of cancer in humans and other species . Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons ( or animals ) . Cancer viruses come from a range of virus families , including both RNA and DNA viruses , and so there is no single type of " <unk> " ( an obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming retroviruses ) . The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity and mutations in the host . Viruses accepted to cause human cancers include some genotypes of human papillomavirus , hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus , Epstein – Barr virus , Kaposi 's sarcoma @-@ associated herpesvirus and human T @-@ lymphotropic virus . The most recently discovered human cancer virus is a polyomavirus ( Merkel cell polyomavirus ) that causes most cases of a rare form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma . Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer . Infection by human T @-@ lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic <unk> and adult T @-@ cell leukemia . Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix , skin , anus , and penis . Within the Herpesviridae , Kaposi 's sarcoma @-@ associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi 's sarcoma and body cavity lymphoma , and Epstein – Barr virus causes Burkitt 's lymphoma , Hodgkin 's lymphoma , B lymphoproliferative disorder , and nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse <unk> that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years . 
 = = = Host defence mechanisms = = = 
 The body 's first line of defence against viruses is the innate immune system . This comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non @-@ specific manner . This means that the cells of the innate system recognise , and respond to , pathogens in a generic way , but , unlike the adaptive immune system , it does not confer long @-@ lasting or protective immunity to the host . 
 RNA interference is an important innate defence against viruses . Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double @-@ stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) . When such a virus infects a cell , it releases its RNA molecule or molecules , which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces . A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex , is activated , which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA . Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not <unk> fully inside the cell , and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle 's inner capsid . Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion . 
 When the adaptive immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus , it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non @-@ infectious . This is called humoral immunity . Two types of antibodies are important . The first , called IgM , is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks . The second , called IgG , is produced indefinitely . The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection , whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past . IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out . 
 Antibodies can continue to be an effective defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell . A protein that is in cells , called <unk> , can attach to the antibodies on the surface of the virus particle . This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell 's <unk> system . 
 A second defence of vertebrates against viruses is called cell @-@ mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells . The body 's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell 's surface , and , if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there , the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus @-@ specific T @-@ cells proliferate . Cells such as the macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation . The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism . This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present . Its role in immunity is complex ; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours . 
 Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way . HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion . This is known as " escape mutation " as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response . These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration , blockade of antigen presentation , cytokine resistance , evasion of natural killer cell activities , escape from apoptosis , and antigenic shift . Other viruses , called neurotropic viruses , are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them . 
 = = = Prevention and treatment = = = 
 Because viruses use vital metabolic pathways within host cells to replicate , they are difficult to eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host cells in general . The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection , and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication . 
 = = = = Vaccines = = = = 
 Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses . Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses . Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) associated with viral infections such as polio , measles , mumps and rubella . Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live @-@ attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . <unk> vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live @-@ attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated . 
 = = = = Antiviral drugs = = = = 
 Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues ( fake DNA building @-@ blocks ) , which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication . The life @-@ cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive . This is because these analogues lack the hydroxyl groups , which , along with phosphorus atoms , link together to form the strong " backbone " of the DNA molecule . This is called DNA chain termination . Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for Herpes simplex virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and Hepatitis B virus infections . <unk> is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs . Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle . HIV is dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the HIV @-@ 1 protease for it to become fully infectious . There is a large class of drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this enzyme . 
 Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus . In 80 % of people infected , the disease is chronic , and without treatment , they are infected for the remainder of their lives . However , there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon . The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed . 
 = = Infection in other species = = 
 Viruses infect all cellular life and , although viruses occur universally , each cellular species has its own specific range that often infect only that species . Some viruses , called satellites , can replicate only within cells that have already been infected by another virus . 
 = = = Animal viruses = = = 
 Viruses are important pathogens of livestock . Diseases such as foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease and bluetongue are caused by viruses . Companion animals such as cats , dogs , and horses , if not vaccinated , are susceptible to serious viral infections . Canine parvovirus is caused by a small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in pups . Like all invertebrates , the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections . However , most viruses co @-@ exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease . 
 = = = Plant viruses = = = 
 There are many types of plant virus , but often they cause only a loss of yield , and it is not economically viable to try to control them . Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms , known as vectors . These are normally insects , but some fungi , nematode worms , and single @-@ celled organisms have been shown to be vectors . When control of plant virus infections is considered economical , for perennial fruits , for example , efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds . Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells . 
 Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses . One of the most effective is the presence of so @-@ called resistance ( R ) genes . Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell , which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots . This stops the infection from spreading . RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants . When they are infected , plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses , such as salicylic acid , nitric oxide , and reactive oxygen molecules . 
 Plant virus particles or virus @-@ like particles ( <unk> ) have applications in both biotechnology and nanotechnology . The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures and can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression in a variety of heterologous systems . Plant virus particles can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology . 
 = = = Bacterial viruses = = = 
 Bacteriophages are a common and diverse group of viruses and are the most abundant form of biological entity in aquatic environments – there are up to ten times more of these viruses in the oceans than there are bacteria , reaching levels of 250 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 bacteriophages per millilitre of seawater . These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell . Within a short amount of time , in some cases just minutes , bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein . These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell , helper proteins , which help assembly of new virions , or proteins involved in cell lysis . Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane , and , in the case of the T4 phage , in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released . 
 The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA . These enzymes , called restriction endonucleases , cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells . Bacteria also contain a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past , which allows them to block the virus 's replication through a form of RNA interference . This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection . 
 = = = Archaean viruses = = = 
 Some viruses replicate within archaea : these are double @-@ stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes . These viruses have been studied in most detail in the thermophilic archaea , particularly the orders <unk> and <unk> . Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes that are related to the genes of the viruses . Most archaea have CRISPR – Cas systems as an adaptive defense against viruses . These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA , which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference . 
 = = Role in aquatic ecosystems = = 
 A teaspoon of seawater contains about one million viruses . Most of these are bacteriophages , which are harmless to plants and animals , and are in fact essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems . They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities , and are the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment . The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth . Viral activity may also contribute to the biological pump , the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean . 
 Microorganisms constitute more than 90 % of the biomass in the sea . It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 % of this biomass each day and that there are 15 times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea . Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms , which often kill other marine life . The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water , where there are fewer host organisms . 
 Like any organism , marine mammals are susceptible to viral infections . In 1988 and 2002 , thousands of harbor seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus . Many other viruses , including <unk> , herpesviruses , adenoviruses and <unk> , circulate in marine mammal populations . 
 = = Role in evolution = = 
 Viruses are an important natural means of transferring genes between different species , which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution . It is thought that viruses played a central role in the early evolution , before the diversification of bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes , at the time of the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth . Viruses are still one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Life sciences and medicine = = = 
 Viruses are important to the study of molecular and cell biology as they provide simple systems that can be used to manipulate and investigate the functions of cells . The study and use of viruses have provided valuable information about aspects of cell biology . For example , viruses have been useful in the study of genetics and helped our understanding of the basic mechanisms of molecular genetics , such as DNA replication , transcription , RNA processing , translation , protein transport , and immunology . 
 <unk> often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying . This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance , or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome . In similar fashion , <unk> uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases , as they can specifically target cells and DNA . It shows promising use in the treatment of cancer and in gene therapy . Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time , and interest in this approach is increasing , because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria . Expression of heterologous proteins by viruses is the basis of several manufacturing processes that are currently being used for the production of various proteins such as vaccine antigens and antibodies . Industrial processes have been recently developed using viral vectors and a number of pharmaceutical proteins are currently in pre @-@ clinical and clinical trials . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 <unk> involves the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases . Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells . <unk> <unk> ( T @-@ <unk> ) , for example , is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene , which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells , deleted and replaced with a human gene ( GM @-@ CSF ) that stimulates immunity . When this virus infects cancer cells , it destroys them and in doing so the presence the GM @-@ CSF gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body . The dendritic cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system . Having completed successful clinical trials , this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015 . Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called oncolytic viruses . 
 = = = Materials science and nanotechnology = = = 
 Current trends in nanotechnology promise to make much more versatile use of viruses . From the viewpoint of a materials scientist , viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles . Their surface carries specific tools designed to cross the barriers of their host cells . The size and shape of viruses , and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface , is precisely defined . As such , viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications . A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution . The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials , opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine . 
 Because of their size , shape , and well @-@ defined chemical structures , viruses have been used as templates for organizing materials on the nanoscale . Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. , using <unk> mosaic virus ( <unk> ) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors . In this application , the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non @-@ fluorescent dimers that act as <unk> . Another example is the use of <unk> as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics . 
 = = = Synthetic viruses = = = 
 Many viruses can be synthesized de novo ( " from scratch " ) and the first synthetic virus was created in 2002 . Although somewhat of a misconception , it is not the actual virus that is synthesized , but rather its DNA genome ( in case of a DNA virus ) , or a cDNA copy of its genome ( in case of RNA viruses ) . For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA ( once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA ) is infectious when introduced into a cell . That is , they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses . This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies . The ability to synthesize viruses has far @-@ reaching consequences , since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct , as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available . As of March 2014 , the full @-@ length genome sequences of <unk> different viruses , including smallpox , are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health . 
 = = = Weapons = = = 
 The ability of viruses to cause devastating epidemics in human societies has led to the concern that viruses could be <unk> for biological warfare . Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory . The smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication . There are only two centers in the world that are authorized by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus : the Vector Institute in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States . Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded . As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side @-@ effects , it is no longer used routinely in any country . Thus , much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox , and would be vulnerable to the virus . 
 = Florida Cracker Horse = 
 The Florida Cracker Horse is a breed of horse from Florida in the United States . It is genetically and physically similar to many other Spanish @-@ style horses , especially those from the Spanish Colonial Horse group . The Florida Cracker is a gaited breed known for its agility and speed . The Spanish first brought horses to Florida with their expeditions in the early 16th century ; as colonial settlement progressed , they used the horses for herding cattle . These horses developed into the Florida Cracker type seen today , and continued to be used by Florida cowboys ( known as " crackers " ) until the 1930s . 
 At this point they were superseded by American Quarter Horses needed to work larger cattle brought to Florida during the Dust Bowl , and population numbers declined precipitously . Through the efforts of several private families and the Florida government , the breed was saved from extinction , but there is still concern about its low numbers . Both The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust consider breed numbers to be at a critical point . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The Florida Cracker Horse is also known as the Chickasaw Pony , Seminole Pony , Prairie Pony , Florida Horse , Florida Cow Pony and Grass Gut . The modern breed retains the size of its Spanish ancestors , standing 13 @.@ 2 to 15 hands ( 54 to 60 inches , 137 to 152 cm ) high and weighing 750 to 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 340 to 450 kg ) . They are found mainly in bay , black and gray , although grullo , dun and chestnut are also seen . Roan and pinto colors are occasionally found . They have straight or slightly concave profiles , strong backs and sloping croups . They are known for their speed and agility and excel at trail and endurance riding , and are also used extensively as stock horses . They are sometimes seen in Western riding sports such as working cow horse , team roping and team penning . The Florida Cracker is a gaited horse , with the breed association recognizing two gaits , the running walk and amble , in addition to the regular walk , trot , canter and gallop . The single @-@ footed ambling gait is known as the " coon rack " by some breed enthusiasts . The foundation genetics of the breed are the same as many others developed from Spanish stock in North and South America , including the Paso Fino , Peruvian Paso and Criollo . The Cracker horse is very similar in type and genetics to the Carolina Marsh Tacky and the Banker horse , both Spanish @-@ style breeds from the eastern United States , but DNA testing has proven that these are separate breeds . 
 = = History = = 
 Horses first arrived on the southeast North American mainland in 1521 , brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region , where they were used by officers , scouts and livestock herders . Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida . By the late 16th century , horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing , especially in what is now northern Florida and southern Georgia . The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs , <unk> , Spanish <unk> , Sorraias , Andalusians and other Iberian breeds . Overall , they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds , including short backs , sloping shoulders , low set tails and wide foreheads . 
 The early cattle drivers , nicknamed Florida crackers and Georgia crackers , used these Spanish horses to drive cattle ( eventually known as Florida Cracker cattle ) . The cowboys received their nickname from the distinctive cracking of their whips , and the name was transferred to both the horses they rode and the cattle they herded . Through their primary use as stock horses , the type developed into the Florida Cracker horse , known for its speed , endurance and agility . From the mid @-@ 16th century to the 1930s , this type was the predominant horse in the southeastern United States . During the American Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) , both belligerents purchased large amounts of beef from Florida , and the Spanish horses bred there were highly desired as riding horses . During this time , there was also a continual introduction of new Spanish blood from Cuba , as horses were traded between the two areas . During the Dust Bowl ( 1930 – 1940 ) , large western cattle were moved into Florida , bringing with them the parasitic <unk> . Cattle with this parasite needed to be treated frequently . The cowboys found that the Florida Cracker horses , bred for working smaller cattle , were not able to hold the western cattle . They replaced the smaller horses with American Quarter Horses . This resulted in the Florida breed almost becoming extinct . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 The breed 's survival during the 20th century is owed to a few families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive . John Law Ayers was one such breeder ; in 1984 , he donated his herd of pure @-@ bred Cracker horses to the state of Florida . With them , the state started three small herds in Tallahassee , Withlacoochee State Forest and Paynes Prairie State Preserve . By 1989 , however , these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families were all that remained of the breed . In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a registry was established . After the registry was created , 75 horses designated as " foundation horses " and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered . These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as purebreds by breed experts – partbred horses were denied entry to the registry . As of 2009 , around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry . 
 Effective July 1 , 2008 , the Florida House of Representatives declared the Florida Cracker Horse the official state horse . As of 2009 there are three main bloodlines of Cracker stock , as well as a few smaller lines . The state of Florida still maintains two groups of Ayers @-@ line horses in Tallahassee and Withlacoochee for breeding purposes and a display group in the Paynes Prairie Preserve . The state annually sells excess horses from all three herds , and individual breeders also send horses to the <unk> Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at " critical " status , as part of the Colonial Spanish Horse family , meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is fewer than 2 @,@ 000 and there are fewer than 200 registrations annually in the United States . The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be " critical , " meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today . However , breed numbers are slowly on the rise . 
 = = = Chickasaw horse = = = 
 The original Chickasaw horse , bred by the Chickasaw Indians using horses captured from De Soto 's expedition , became extinct after being used to create the Florida Cracker Horse and having some influence on the Quarter Horse . Some sources still use the Chickasaw name to describe the Florida Cracker Horses of today . In the 1970s there was a surge of interest in recreating the Chickasaw using horses bearing strong resemblances to the original breed , but this has since died out and the breed association no longer exists . 
 = Chiming Fountain = 
 The Chiming Fountain , also known as Cupid 's Fountain , the John Staehli Fountain , Portland 's City Park Fountain and Washington Park Fountain , is an outdoor cast iron fountain and sculpture built in 1891 by John " Hans " Staehli . It is installed in Washington Park in Portland , Oregon , United States . The fountain 's name derives from the sound made when water drips from the upper basin . Staehli designed the fountain to serve as a watering trough for horses pulling carriages into the park . Based on a Renaissance fountain , it was originally painted white and included a statuette of a boy , possibly depicting Cupid , though the figure was damaged and permanently removed from the sculpture before or during the 1940s . 
 The fountain was restored in 1960 , but no longer functioned . Its condition was deemed " treatment urgent " by the Smithsonian Institution 's " Save Outdoor Sculpture ! " program in February 1994 . Since then , its water @-@ pumping function has also been restored . Chiming Fountain has been included in published biking and walking tours of Portland and has been mentioned as a highlight of Washington Park in guides recommending family @-@ friendly activities in the city . 
 = = Description and history = = 
 The decorative fountain is located at the junction of Southwest Sacajawea Boulevard and Southwest Sherwood Boulevard in the main circle of Washington Park . It was designed by John " Hans " Staehli , a woodcarver from Switzerland who immigrated to Portland and was known for his decorative carvings of churches . The fountain was commissioned by the city in 1891 for $ 400 and completed by Staehli later that year , becoming the city 's second piece of public art . It served as a watering trough for horses pulling carriages into the park . The fountain has been given many different names , but is most commonly referred to as Chiming Fountain , in reference to the sound made by water dripping from the upper basin . 
 The fountain is made of cast iron and measures approximately 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) tall with a 7 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) diameter . It has a pedestal and two round bronze basins separated by a narrow post , and stands in an octagonal concrete base which served as a retaining pool . The pedestal has four horned gargoyle @-@ like figures . On the bottom of the pedestal 's west side is an unsigned inscription which reads : " J. Staehli / Portland , Org . / 64 Second St. " 
 Staehli 's design is based on a Renaissance fountain and was originally painted white . The central post originally held a figure of a boy carrying a staff ( or possibly a fish or a torch ) from which water spouted . Some sources suggest the figure depicted Cupid , hence one of the fountain 's nicknames , " Cupid 's Fountain " . According to Portland Parks & Recreation , the figure was last recorded in 1912 in a photograph of Willis McElroy 's band in the nearby bandstand . However , in the 1920s , freezing weather expanded water in the fountain , damaging the figure . The boy statuette was removed from the fountain and discarded by the 1940s , and it was not replaced . 
 The city planned to remove the fountain in 1960 due to disrepair . However , Mayor Terry Schrunk instructed the parks bureau to begin a restoration after Francis J. <unk> , a local longshoreman and advocate for historic preservation , appealed its removal . Much of its original decoration was absent , so replicas of existing pieces were constructed at a cost of $ 450 . The restoration cost around $ 1 @,@ 775 , including assembly and installation . Despite its restoration , the fountain was no longer functional . Its condition was deemed " treatment urgent " by the Smithsonian Institution 's " Save Outdoor Sculpture ! " program in February 1994 . Since then , the fountain 's plumbing has been restored . According to Smithsonian , the fountain is administered by the City of Portland 's Metropolitan Arts Commission .

 The fountain has been included in published biking and walking tours of the city , including one which described it as " elegant " . It was also mentioned as a highlight of Washington Park in the 2010 guidebook Best Places : Portland and by Delta Sky Magazine . Similarly , Chiming Fountain has been included in descriptions of the park in guides recommending child @-@ friendly activities and sites in the city . These guides include the website <unk> and the 2009 book The 10 Best of Everything Families : An Ultimate Guide for Travelers , which listed Washington Park as one of the ten " Best Parks and Playgrounds " in the Northwestern United States . 
 = 2013 Penn State Nittany Lions football team = 
 The 2013 Penn State Nittany Lions football team represented Pennsylvania State University in the 2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season . The team was coached by Bill O 'Brien and played its home games in Beaver Stadium in University Park , Pennsylvania . They were a member of the Big Ten Conference and its Leaders Division . Penn State was ineligible to play in a bowl game for the 2013 season , the second season of a four @-@ year ban , due to NCAA sanctions imposed in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal . 
 Before the season , Penn State had an open competition to win the starting quarterback position ; true freshman Christian Hackenberg won and started all 12 games for the Nittany Lions . Hackenberg headlined their recruiting class , which also featured tight end Adam Breneman . John Butler was named Penn State 's new defensive coordinator upon the departure of Ted Roof . Most predicted Penn State would have a similar season to that of the 2012 team , which won eight games and lost four , but there was uncertainty , as injuries could decimate the team , which was already thin at many positions including offensive line and linebacker , while surprise performances from key players could lift them to success . 
 Penn State opened the season with two non @-@ conference wins , but lost to the UCF Knights , who ultimately went on to a BCS bowl , the Fiesta , in their third game . Entering conference play , the Nittany Lions were 3 – 1 , and in their first conference game they lost to Indiana before defeating Michigan in a quadruple @-@ overtime thriller . They alternated losses and wins for the remainder of the season , losing to Ohio State , Minnesota , and Nebraska , and defeating Illinois , Purdue , and Wisconsin . 
 Despite the team never being ranked , several players earned national and conference recognition , headlined by wide receiver Allen Robinson , who was named the Big Ten Conference Receiver of the Year and earned first team all @-@ conference and All @-@ American honors before subsequently announcing he would forgo his senior season and enter the 2014 NFL Draft . Senior John Urschel , an offensive guard , won the William V. Campbell Trophy — sometimes referred to as the " academic Heisman " . Hackenberg was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year . Additionally , backup quarterback Tyler Ferguson , who lost the preseason quarterback competition to Hackenberg , announced his intent to transfer . Soon after the season , two coaches — Ron Vanderlinden and Charlie Fisher — left Penn State for undisclosed reasons , though there was speculation that O 'Brien forced them out . A few weeks later , O 'Brien accepted the head coaching position with the Houston Texans , leaving the Nittany Lions after two seasons . Early in 2014 , the Nittany Lions hired James Franklin to replace O 'Brien as head coach for the 2014 season .

 Despite NCAA sanctions including limited scholarships and a bowl ban , Penn State retained their top recruit : quarterback Christian Hackenberg . They finished with the 24th ranked recruiting class according to ESPN , who cited retention of top prospects Hackenberg and tight end Adam Breneman , as well as adding depth in the secondary , overall giving them a " B " rating . Linebacker recruit Zayd <unk> never enrolled at Penn State after several instances of legal trouble . Entering camp , Hackenberg and Ferguson vied for the starting quarterback position ; ultimately , Hackenberg won the job , and Ferguson served as the backup .

 Coming off an 8 – 4 season during which , according to USA Today 's Paul <unk> , " Attrition robbed Penn State of everything but the kitchen sink , or so we heard , so it was quite surprising when the sink , a few walk @-@ ons , a mathematician , a local kid and a rookie coach went 8 @-@ 2 after a sluggish start , pushing back against storm clouds and bringing PSU back from the abyss of life post @-@ NCAA sanctions . " Many college football analysts expected the Nittany Lions to perform similarly in 2013 , although almost all season outlooks noted that the team could take a major step back from 2012 if they were hampered by injuries , or could surprise everyone and win more games than they did in 2012 . 
 A solid backfield anchored by Zach Zwinak , a trio of established tight ends plus a promising newcomer , and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively , while a new coordinator ( John Butler ) , a " borderline All @-@ American " linebacker ( Glenn Carson ) , and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary , the latter of which was " dramatically improved " , highlighted projected progress defensively . Also , a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed , which provided intrigue entering the season . For Penn State to achieve success , they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions . SBNation.com asserted , " If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt , and the other one stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton ( who missed four games last year ) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt ( and linemen often get hurt ) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down . " ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote , " In short , like last year , PSU is a bit of a wild card . If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven , it should surpass last year 's record . If it doesn 't , it might be fortunate to get to seven wins . "

 Note : Though the game was held at a neutral site , Penn State wore white uniforms and was considered the away team . 
 Prior to the game , Penn State coach Bill O 'Brien hoped to keep his choice between Tyler Ferguson and Christian Hackenberg as starting quarterback a secret until the first snap . However , the night before the game , media reports began to surface that Hackenberg was going to be the starter . Hackenberg did start for the Nittany Lions , while Oklahoma transfer Drew Allen started for Syracuse , who had a quarterback competition as well . After Hackenberg played the first two drives for Penn State , Ferguson came in and promptly fumbled the football for a turnover and did not return . Allen Robinson , the Big Ten 's leading receiver in 2012 , did not start for what O 'Brien said was , " between me and Allen " , but he did play in the second half . 
 After a scoreless first quarter , the second quarter featured three turnovers , and at half time , Penn State led 6 – 3 with two field goals from senior kicker Sam Ficken . On Penn State 's first drive in the second half , Allen Robinson returned and caught a screen pass , which he ran for 25 yards , and then a 51 @-@ yard touchdown pass to make the score 13 – 3 . On the ensuing drive , however , Syracuse came right back and scored a touchdown via a Jerome Smith 10 @-@ yard run . Early in the fourth quarter , Ficken made his third field goal of the day , a career @-@ long 46 yards . Later in the quarter , Hackenberg threw a 54 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Eugene Lewis to make the score 23 – 10 . When only down by 6 points , Syracuse got the ball around their own 45 @-@ yard line with a little over two minutes left , but turned the ball over via an interception with under two minutes to play . 
 Hackenberg was named the Big Ten freshman of the week after totaling 278 passing yards , two touchdowns , and two interceptions , and Ficken was named Big Ten special teams player of the week , redeeming himself from the 2012 season , after kicking three field goals including a career @-@ long 46 @-@ yard kick . Seniors DaQuan Jones and Stephen Obeng @-@ Agyapong led the team defensively with nine tackles , including three for a loss , and a sack at defensive tackle , and eight tackles , a sack , a forced fumble that he recovered , and an interception at safety and linebacker respectively . After it was announced that Penn State lost senior tight end Matt Lehman for the season with a knee injury during the game , O 'Brien announced that Obeng @-@ Agyapong might practice with the tight ends to help replace him . 
 = = = September 7 vs. Eastern Michigan = = = 
 Prior to the game , Penn State was predicted to have the advantage on both sides of the ball at every position , and as such , was expected to win handily . Coming into the game , Penn State had sustained injuries two of their top tight ends , Matt Lehman and Kyle Carter . Lehman suffered a knee injury against Syracuse and was out for the season , while Carter was " day @-@ to @-@ day " with an arm injury , but played in the game . The Lions wanted to focus on improving their running game , which was lackluster against Syracuse ; Eastern Michigan allowed 202 rushing yards on 5 @.@ 8 yards per carry in week one . Defensively , linebacker depth was an issue for the Lions . Safety Stephen Obeng @-@ Agyapong was expected to step up and take snaps at linebacker , in addition to speculation he could end up on offense . At half time , the Nittany Lions honored the 1973 Penn State Nittany Lions football team and retired the number of Penn State 's only Heisman Trophy winner , number 22 John Cappelletti . 
 After both teams ' first drives ended without points , Eastern Michigan got good field position to start their second drive , and attempted a 35 @-@ yard field goal , but after a low snap , Penn State defender Jordan Lucas tackled the holder for a loss , and the kick never got off , for a turnover on downs . Penn State failed to capitalize , however , as Hackenberg threw another incomplete pass on third down , starting the game with one completion in five attempts . Eastern Michigan scored first after the ball slipped from Hackenberg 's hands and was returned for a touchdown by Hunter Matt for 11 yards , giving Eastern Michigan a 7 – 0 advantage with 4 : 01 in the first quarter . Penn State responded on their next drive scoring a touchdown on a 2 @-@ yard Zach Zwinak run , capping a 6 @-@ play , 67 @-@ yard drive that included a 43 @-@ yard reception to Allen Robinson to put the ball inside the 10 @-@ yard line . Penn State 's next drive featured a hurry up offense , which Penn State calls " NASCAR " , included 15 + yard completions to Jesse James and Matt <unk> , and culminated with two consecutive runs by Bill Belton , the latter of which went for a 5 @-@ yard touchdown making the score 14 – 7 . Eastern Michigan 's ensuing drive had some success , as they got to Penn State 25 @-@ yard line prior to kicker Dylan Mulder pushing a 42 @-@ yard field goal attempt to the right of the goal posts . At the end of the first half , Penn State got into field goal range with under a minute to go , and Sam Ficken converted a 39 @-@ yard field goal , his Penn State record 14th straight , to make the score 17 – 7 with 17 seconds in the half . Penn State got the ball to start the second half , but exchanged punts with Eastern Michigan for their first three drives , both teams punting the ball away on their first three drives . On their fourth drive of the half , Penn State got to the board – on a six play drive that included a 20 @-@ yard run by Zwinak on 3rd and 24 ( after two sacks ) and a subsequent fourth down conversion , and then culminated with a 7 @-@ yard touchdown run by Zwinak making the score 24 – 7 . After a quick punt , Penn State began to grind it out offensively prior to Hackenberg finding Robinson for a 45 @-@ yard touchdown pass to make it 31 – 7 . Later in the quarter , Belton broke loose for a 51 @-@ yard touchdown run , putting him over 100 rushing yards on the day making the score 38 – 7 . After Eastern Michigan punted for the 10th time in the game , Penn State brought in Tyler Ferguson at quarterback to replace Hackenberg , who had already amassed 311 passing yards , a Penn State single game freshman record . On that drive , Akeel Lynch became the third Nittany Lion to rush for a touchdown , an 18 @-@ yard run with under five minutes to go . That would be the final scoring play of the game ; Penn State won 45 – 7 . 
 The Penn State defense struggled with defending the bootleg play early on , but recorded a shut out ( the seven points for Eastern Michigan were off an offensive fumble ) and limited Eastern Michigan to 183 total yards . They were led by senior defensive tackle DaQuan Jones , who recorded nine tackles and two sacks , Glenn Carson , who recorded 10 tackles , and <unk> Wartman , who recorded six tackles and three pass deflections . On offense , the " running back by committee " approach proved successful – the two non @-@ starters , Belton and Lynch , each recorded 108 rushing yards . One problem offensively was third down efficiency ; the Lions were just 1 of 10 on third downs , bringing them to 2 of 26 on the season . One writer called Jones the game 's MVP , noting his statistics , plugging holes opened by the offensive line , and overall " dominance " , noting that he " put on an absolute display " . 
 = = = September 14 vs. UCF = = = 
 This was the two teams ' first meeting since 2004 , and the meeting reunited O 'Brien and George O 'Leary , under whom O 'Brien was a graduate assistant in 1995 , his first season coaching . The two squads are also set to meet in Ireland to open the 2014 season . In an article in The Patriot @-@ News , writer Bob Flounders asserted that if the Nittany Lions beat the Knights of UCF , they would be on a fast track to a 5 – 0 start , which would have been their first since 2008 . As this was Penn State 's first night game with a particularly young team , keeping emotions in check was a key , as was improving third down efficiency ( the Lions were 2 @-@ for @-@ 26 on the season ) good for dead last in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) . UCF , who was 2 – 0 coming into the game , went 10 – 4 in 2012 , and was led by their running back <unk> Murray , who graduated . As such , their top offensive player was quarterback Blake Bortles . Defensively , they had only allowed one scoring play all season . Penn State students organized a " whiteout " , in which the entire student section dons white . Outside linebacker Mike Hull returned after missing the prior game against Eastern Michigan . 
 UCF got the ball to start the game at their nine @-@ yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return , and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an efficient drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6 / 7 passing for 65 yards and a 4 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson . Penn State took over and got two first downs , the latter of which as a fourth down conversion , before a 44 @-@ yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6 @-@ yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game . Penn State moved the ball on their next drive , but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position , with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58 @-@ yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14 – 7 UCF . Penn State 's special teams responded with a 44 @-@ yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis , but their offense went three @-@ and @-@ out , and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory , the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21 – 7 . On Penn State 's ensuing drive , Sam Ficken kicked a career @-@ long 47 @-@ yard field goal . UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive , but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27 , 2012 with 1 : 17 in the half , but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season , a 57 @-@ yard try as time expired . At the half , UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards , compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards . Penn State got the ball to start the second half , but punted on their first drive . UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25 @-@ yard pass . Penn State came right back with a touchdown of their own . UCF 's ensuing drive brought them to the one yard line , but Penn State held them to a field goal , making the score 31 – 17 . Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State 's next drive , and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game . Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5 : 43 remaining in the game . UCF went three @-@ and @-@ out , and on their punt , the snap went over the punter 's head , and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25 . Penn State took advantage , scoring on a 5 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left . Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score , and failed to do so , so ultimately UCF held on to win by three . 
 Penn State 's defense had excelled in their first two games , but regressed significantly against Central Florida , particularly with poor tackling , which some attributed to their practice strategy of " thud " tackling , in which one does not actually take a player to the ground , instead making a " thud " to stop a player . Several media outlets speculated that the Lions used this due to their lack of scholarship players in the wake of sanctions imposed due to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal . Defensive coordinator John Butler renounced that assertion , commenting he employed " thud " when he coached at South Carolina . Penn State 's linebackers were also criticized ; Glenn Carson and <unk> Wartman received criticism for not being as strong as the 2012 team 's Michael <unk> and Gerald Hodges . In addition , 2012 Big Ten Freshman of the Year defensive end Deion Barnes " barely wreaked any havoc " , and DaQuan Jones , whose strong play had previously compensated for Barnes ' weak play , was held to just five tackles . The offense , however , was considered a " bright spot " ; they gained 455 total yards , though receiver Allen Robinson commented that a fast start would have helped them gain more early momentum : " We are in the Big Ten playing against some great offenses and people are going to put points up early , so we need to get going early and start off fast . " Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week accolades for the second time in the first three weeks of the season . 
 = = = September 21 vs. Kent State = = = 
 Penn State came into the game 2 – 1 , while the Kent State Golden Flashes entered 1 – 2 , including 0 – 1 in conference play , though this was a non @-@ conference matchup . Kent State was expected to be without their star offensive weapon , wide receiver and running back Dri Archer , who suffered lingering effects from an ankle injury sustained in week one . In 2012 , Archer rushed for 1 @,@ 429 yards and scored 16 touchdowns , led the Golden Flashes in receptions and receiving yards , and recorded three kickoff returns for touchdowns ; he even received some Heisman hype ( he did not win ) . Without Archer , Kent State would have to more heavily rely on their freshman quarterback Colin Reardon , who had " not exactly dazzled " in Kent State 's first three games , but had yet to throw an interception . Picking up the slack in the running game was <unk> Durham , who had a total of 152 rushing yards in their first three games . The game also featured two top sophomore defensive ends – NFL prospects Roosevelt Nix for Kent State and Deion Barnes for Penn State , neither of whom had gotten off to a particularly strong start to the season , but both of whom had won their conference 's freshman of the year award in 2012 . Penn State also looked to rebound from sloppy tackling the previous week against UCF that underscored an overall poor defensive performance . Offensively for Penn State , a quarter of the way through the season , one ESPN writer projected Allen Robinson to win the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year award , and Christian Hackenberg to win the Big Ten Freshman of the Year award for their strong performances through the first three games . That duo along with the running back trio of Zach Zwinak , Bill Belton , and Akeel Lynch led Penn State 's offense , which was coming off a performance in which they had scored 31 points , into the game . 
 In heavy rain that announcer Kevin Kugler described as a " deluge " , Penn State 's Blue Band wore ponchos in the stands during a " blue out " , to support the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape . After Penn State went three @-@ and @-@ out to start the game , Kent State got excellent field position at the opposition 's 36 @-@ yard line after Penn State committed kick catching interference on the punt , but failed to capitalize as their kicker , Anthony <unk> , missed a 31 @-@ yard field goal . Penn State 's next drive stalled , and on fourth down , quarterback Christian Hackenberg executed a " pooch punt " , in which the quarterback lines up in the shotgun formation , and punts the ball , for 44 @-@ yards pinning Kent State inside their 10 @-@ yard line . Penn State drove down the field late in the first quarter getting it to the five @-@ yard line , when Hackenberg had the ball slip from his hand backing Penn State up to the 15 @-@ yard line , but on the subsequent play , Hackenberg completed a 15 @-@ yard pass to Bill Belton for a touchdown to culminate a 9 @-@ play , 87 @-@ yard drive encapsulating 3 : 39 . Kent State 's offense again proved ineffective , and Penn State 's proved strong , as they drove down the field on a 10 @-@ play , 82 @-@ yard drive ending with Zach Zwinak running for a 2 @-@ yard touchdown . Towards the end of the first half , the teams began to exchange punts , and the half ended with Penn State ahead 14 – 0 . In the third quarter , Hackenberg threw an interception , but on the next drive , Kent State threw an interception and Penn State got the ball back . Later in the quarter , Penn State ran a 51 @-@ yard drive that got them inside the ten @-@ yard line down to the one , at which point Zwinak ran for a touchdown , his second of the game . Later in the quarter , Penn State began another drive that spilled into the fourth quarter on which Akeel Lynch was the primary running back for the Lions , running for a total of 78 yards en route to Sam Ficken booting his first field goal of the game , a 25 @-@ yarder . In the middle of the fourth quarter , Penn State embarked on a drive that milked over five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes off the clock and culminated with Zwinak rushing for his third touchdown of the game , a one @-@ yard score with 6 : 42 to play . After another lackluster drive by Kent State , they punted for the ninth time , and on Penn State 's ensuing drive , Tyler Ferguson entered at quarterback , and Von Walker , a member of Penn State 's " run @-@ on " program , entered at running back , and on the drive , Ficken kicked a personal record 54 @-@ yard field goal , the longest by a Penn State player since 1979 , which was the final scoring play of the game , whose final score was 34 – 0 . 
 Penn State 's defense excelled , shutting out an opponent for the first time since the 2010 season , also against Kent State . The Lions held Kent State to 190 total yards – just 56 rushing yards , and allowed them to move into Penn State territory only twice out of 14 drives . In the post game media conference , Coach Bill O 'Brien commended his defensive coordinator John Butler for his hard work in practice the previous week to rebound from an embarrassing performance against Central Florida . Defensive end Deion Barnes recorded his first sack of the season , and safety Ryan Keiser made his first career interception , while linebacker Glenn Carson led the team with seven tackles . Offensively , Penn State was led by their tandem at running back – trio Zach Zwinak , who had three touchdown rushes , excelling in the grind @-@ it @-@ out style of play Penn State employed in the rain , Bill Belton rushed for 90 yards on 13 carries and had a receiving touchdown , and Akeel Lynch had a " career day " , rushing for 123 yards on just 14 carries . The passing game faltered in the rainy conditions , as Christian Hackenberg frequently forced the ball to Allen Robinson for incomplete passes – Robinson finished with 3 receptions , and Hackenberg with 22 incomplete passes and an interception . Penn State did improve on third downs , converting 7 @-@ of @-@ 18 , but remained in the bottom of the FBS , 120 out of 123 teams . 
 = = = Bye week # 1 – September 28 , 2013 = = = 
 After their first four non @-@ conference games , Penn State had their first of two mid @-@ season bye weeks , this one heading into conference play . Off the field , Penn State received relief from sanctions imposed in wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal ; based on a recommendation from independent integrity monitor George Mitchell , Penn State was allowed to have five additional scholarships in 2014 , and up to the full 25 by 2015 , meaning they would have the full 85 by the 2016 season . 
 “ The decision is the result of a thoughtful and deliberative process to ensure we reached the most appropriate outcome . During our discussions , we had the benefit of engaging with Senator Mitchell ’ s expert perspective and the views of our Big Ten colleagues . ” – Rita Hartung Cheng , chair of the NCAA executive committee meetings regarding Mitchell 's annual report 
 The reduction of penalties led to an article in The Patriot News on whether Penn State achieved an " unequivocal " bye week victory , perhaps even their biggest victory of the season . 
 On the field , several keys for improvement were identified within the media , including finding a secondary receiver to Allen Robinson , strengthening the secondary , and continuing improvement on third downs . Also , Penn State 's tight end tandem , which struggled during non @-@ conference play , needed to improve , particularly as Penn State had a young quarterback in Christian Hackenberg who would face tougher defenses in conference play . 
 = = = October 5 vs. Indiana = = = 
 In their second game away from Beaver Stadium of the season , the Nittany Lions traveled to Bloomington , Indiana for their game against the Indiana Hoosiers , their first conference opponent . This was the teams ' 17th meeting , with Penn State owning a 16 – 0 record coming into the game . Indiana featured the Big Ten 's best passing offense in 2012 , led by quarterback Chase Coffman , who returned in 2013 . Indiana entered the game with a record of 2 – 2 . As they had in 2012 , struggled defensively in their first four games , averaging giving up nearly 33 points per game . Their offense however , had shined thus far , and had come into their previous game , a 45 – 28 loss to Missouri , averaging 50 points per game , but sputtered against the Tigers . A preview on SB Nation noted that Indiana 's pass first offense might " cause problems " for Penn State , though it expressed some optimism , as Mike Hull finally returned and Adrian Amos moved from safety to cornerback . Offensively for Penn State , balancing the running game with the passing game was a key – in the previous season 's game against Indiana , Penn Statewide receiver Allen Robinson caught 10 passes for 197 yards and 3 touchdowns – as this was expected to be a developmental game for freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg . There was no conclusive advantage on special teams . 
 Penn State got the ball to start the game , and drove down the field with relative ease ( facing only one third down ) prior to stalling at their 26 @-@ yard line and turning the ball over on downs . After an Indiana three and out , Penn State ran another drive at the end of which they turned over on downs . Each team ran one more drive before Indiana attained first downs on three consecutive plays , ultimately culminating their possession with a five @-@ yard touchdown pass from quarterback Nate Sudfeld to Isaiah Roundtree , making the score 7 – 0 at the end of the first quarter . Penn State responded on their second drive of the second quarter via a 46 @-@ yard pass from Hackenberg to Robinson to tie the game . Later , Mitch Ewald kicked a short field goal to re @-@ take the lead . Penn State had a chance to tie the game again when kicker Sam Ficken attempted a 42 @-@ yard field goal , but Indiana blocked the kick , and with their ensuing momentum drove down the field at the end of the half , ultimately ending with Ewald hitting a field goal as time expired . After halftime , Indiana ran a quick drive on which they punted before Penn State ran a 13 @-@ play , 80 @-@ yard drive that concluded with Robinson catching his second touchdown of the game , a 26 @-@ yard pass from Hackenberg . Indiana responded with a quick score ; they converted a two @-@ point conversion to take a 21 – 14 lead . Late in the third quarter , Hackenberg threw a fade pattern to Robinson in the corner of the end zone , which Robinson corralled , but he landed on his back out of bounds , and came up either with the wind knocked out , or some sort of back injury . Penn State settled for a field goal , and at the end of three , Indiana led 21 – 17 . The fourth quarter entrenched the Hoosiers ' lead , as they totaled 23 points to only 7 for Penn State , winning the game 44 – 24 , their final score coming on a safety . 
 Dubbed the " low point ... of the Bill O 'Brien era " and Penn State 's first ever loss to the Hoosiers , lack of execution was a primary problem for the Nittany Lions ; Penn State was just one @-@ of @-@ five on fourth down conversion attempts , a few of which they attempted while in Sam Ficken 's field goal range , and on two field goal attempts , there were two botched snaps , the first of which led to a blocked kick , the latter getting past the holder and rolling 31 yards by the time Ficken fell on the ball for a turnover on downs . O 'Brien also conceded that poor coaching did not help the Lions , and that he tried to " manufacture " momentum at several points in the game : " We coached very average today . " − Bill O 'Brien 
 = = = October 12 vs. Michigan = = = 
 In the teams ' first meeting since the 2010 season , the Nittany Lions looked to achieve their fourth consecutive win in the series , however even a hometown paper , the York Daily Record , predicted the Lions would lose , albeit in a close game , citing Michigan 's superiority on both offense and defense , as well as coaching , compared to Penn State 's superiority on special teams and intangibles . 
 Penn State 's edition of SB Nation also predicted the Lions would lose citing the Wolverines ' better athletes , but noted that Michigan 's quarterback Devin Gardner has thrown as many interceptions as touchdowns ( 8 ) coming into the game , and that Penn State 's best chance to win would be if Michigan turned the ball over frequently . Coming off an embarrassing loss against Indiana , Penn State 's coach Bill O 'Brien was " focused " all week and refused to talk to the media about the prior week 's loss , focusing strictly on the Michigan game , which was Homecoming for Penn State , was expected to be the first sellout of the season , and featured a whiteout , led by the student section . O 'Brien noted , " it would be crazy to think this is just another game " . The game was Penn State 's second national broadcast of the year , with Penn State alumnus Matt Millen providing color commentary on Penn State 's homecoming weekend . Michigan , coming off a 42 – 13 victory over Minnesota , entered the game with a win @-@ loss record of 5 – 0 , one of two remaining undefeated teams in the Big Ten ( the other was Ohio State , who was 6 – 0 , and whom the Lions are scheduled to play on October 26 ) . Michigan 's defense , led by their star cornerback Blake Countless , who was tied for the NCAA lead with four interceptions entering the game , had yet to allow a rushing touchdown , and was expected to receive a boost from the return of their 2012 All @-@ Big Ten linebacker Jake Ryan , who tore his anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) the prior season . As such , a key for Penn State was to match Michigan 's physicality in strong offensive line play and establish the line of scrimmage , both on offense and defense , as the game would be won in the trenches . The game was described as a " critical juncture " . Before the game , Penn State realized that , due to a Ticketmaster glitch , it had oversold student section tickets , and was forced to offer several alternate packages in order not to have to boot students . 
 With a Goodyear blimp overhead , Michigan got the ball to start the game , and on their first play from scrimmage , they lost three yards when DaQuan Jones made a tackle for a loss stopping Fitzgerald Toussaint ; the loss decimated the drive , which ended in a three @-@ and @-@ out . Penn State 's drive was no more successful – after one first down , Christian Hackenberg threw an interception . On Michigan 's ensuing drive , however , they were set up on another third down and long , and Penn State 's Jordan Lucas picked off Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner 's pass , setting Penn State up in the red zone . Penn State capitalized , as Hackenberg threw a 12 @-@ yard touchdown pass to senior receiver Brandon Felder . Michigan struck right back , getting two first downs in the running game prior to Gardner throwing a 59 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Devin <unk> to tie the game . Penn State did not get a first down on their next drive and tried to convert fourth down deep in their own territory , but failed , setting Michigan up with excellent field position . Penn State 's defense , however , responded , with Glenn Carson sacking Gardner to put Michigan out of field goal range , forcing a punt that Michigan downed around the five yard line . On Michigan 's next drive , their kicker Brendan Gibbons made a 47 @-@ yard field goal . After Penn State again punted , Michigan embarked on a drive that included a third @-@ and @-@ long conversion , but ultimately ended when Gardner threw an interception to Penn State defensive end Anthony Zettel , who started over Deion Barnes . It took Penn State only one play to capitalize ; Hackenberg threw a 20 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Jesse James to put Penn State back up 14 – 10 . Penn State struck again later in the quarter , again via a touchdown pass from Hackenberg to Felder . Late in the first half , Penn State defensive end C. J. Olaniyan sacked Gardner for the second time , forcing a fumble , which Penn State recovered , but their drive stalled , and they punted . Penn State held a 21 – 10 advantage at halftime . 
 On Penn State 's first play from scrimmage in the second half , Zach Zwinak fumbled , and it was returned for a touchdown by Frank Clark to pull within four points . After another Penn State drive stalled , Michigan drove down the field , and was faced with a third @-@ and @-@ short before a freshman offensive lineman committed a dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to back up Michigan to face a third and long ; on that play Olaniyan recorded his third sack of the day , and Michigan punted . On Penn State 's ensuing drive , they turned the ball over again , this time via a Hackenberg interception ; Michigan capitalized by kicking a field goal . When Penn State got the ball back , they ran a sustained , balanced drive ( 4 run plays , 5 pass plays , 50 yards ) down the field during which they went to Bill Belton in the running game ( as Zwinak had fumbled previously in the half ) that culminated with Sam Ficken kicking a 45 @-@ yard field goal to go up by 4 points . Michigan promptly drove right back down the field , and Gardner threw a touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon to take the lead for the second time , 27 – 24 . In the fourth quarter , Ficken attempted a 47 @-@ yard field goal , but missed , and Penn State 's 10 @-@ play 45 @-@ yard drive came up empty . Michigan took advantage of their ensuing field position and ran a quick drive that ended with a 37 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Gardner to <unk> , putting them on top by 10 with 10 : 28 to go . On Penn State 's ensuing drive , they converted a fourth down and one near midfield prior to a penalty and then a sack setting up a third and long on which Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass , so they were forced to settle with pulling within 7 ; Sam Ficken kicked a 43 @-@ yard field goal . Michigan tried to run out the clock on their next drive , and Penn State burned all three of their timeouts . Though they were at one point within field goal range , they committed a five @-@ yard delay of game penalty that pushed them out of range , and they had to punt . Penn State got the ball with 50 seconds left and no timeouts at their own 20 @-@ yard line . Needing a touchdown to tie the game , Penn State 's first play of scrimmage was a pass from Hackenberg to Robinson along the sideline that was ruled incomplete on the field , but was reviewed and overturned and counted as a 14 @-@ yard gain . The next play was an acrobatic catch by Felder for 29 yards , and then a pass down the sideline to Robinson for 36 yards to put the ball inside the one yard line with 29 seconds remaining . Michigan then called their final timeout . Hackenberg then attempted a quarterback sneak over the right side for a touchdown ; the play was reviewed and the call was confirmed , and Ficken made the extra point to tie the game with 27 seconds left . Michigan took the ball at their own 35 , drove it to the other 35 , and lined Gibbons up to attempt a 52 @-@ yard field goal , which he missed short . Penn State got the ball with two seconds left , but downed the ball to send the game into overtime . 
 Penn State got the ball to start overtime , but went three @-@ and @-@ out and Ficken missed a field goal . Michigan used their entire possession to try to center the ball for Gibbons , and then they attempted a field goal , but it was blocked , to send the game into a second overtime . Michigan got the ball to start the second overtime , achieved one first down , and Gibbons redeemed himself , kicking a 25 @-@ yard field goal . Ficken responded , tacking on a 36 @-@ yard field goal to tie the game at 37 , headed into a third overtime . Penn State got the ball to start the third overtime , but on their first play , an end @-@ around to Robinson that he fumbled and was recovered by Clark to set up Michigan with a chance to win the game with any score . Gibbons had an opportunity to win the game , but missed wide , and sent the game into a fourth overtime . Michigan got the ball to start the fourth overtime , and stalled , leaving Gibbons to attempt a 40 @-@ yard field goal , which he made to put the Wolverines on top 40 – 37 . Penn State then needed a field goal to tie , or a touchdown to win . Faced with a fourth down and one , O 'Brien sent his team out on the field to go for it , and they converted via a two @-@ yard run by Belton . Three plays later , Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass intended for Robinson in the end zone , but officials called pass interference on the play , which occurred in the end zone , resulting in the ball being placed at the two yard line . On Penn State 's next play , Hackenberg handed the ball off to Belton , who ran it in for a two @-@ yard touchdown , winning the game for Penn State . 
 The four @-@ overtime game was the longest in Big Ten Conference history . For their performance in the game , Athlon Sports named Hackenberg as both its Big Ten and National Freshman of the Week , and Olaniyan as its Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week . Hackenberg threw for over 300 yards for the third time , already moving him into a tie for third @-@ most all time in Penn State history , tied with Daryll Clark , and behind Matt McGloin and Kerry Collins ; it was the third time he had been named freshman of the week . Olaniyan recorded 2 @.@ 5 sacks and forced a fumble ( that was recovered by DaQuan Jones ) , and this was his first career Big Ten Player of the Week accolade . ESPN named the game the best of the season 's first half , and Robinson 's catch late in regulation was named the number @-@ one play on Sports Center 's Top Ten .

 After Penn State 's quadruple overtime win against Michigan , they tried to get healthy , with veterans being held out of a scrimmage that occurred during the week of practice , instead working on conditioning . One ESPN writer opined that defensive coordinator John Butler needed to emphasize reworking the secondary , similar to how he had focused on reworking the defensive line , which was successful during the prior week 's game . Also , Penn State needed to find additional " playmakers " to supplement Allen Robinson in the receiving game , as well as determine who would lead the running game , as Zach Zwinak had fumbled against Michigan and was taken out , and Bill Belton took over and performed well . Half way through the season , ESPN.com rated Robinson as the team 's offensive MVP , and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones as the team 's defensive MVP . The midseason report noted that Penn State had a grueling schedule in the second half of the season that would test the depth of its defense , limited by lack of scholarship players . Lancaster Newspapers concurred with ESPN , awarding their first half offensive and defensive MVPs to Robinson and Jones respectively as well , adding Sam Ficken as special teams MVP . The column also called sophomore defensive end Deion Barnes the biggest disappointment of the first half , noting that he had even been relegated out of the starting lineup . Quarterback Christian Hackenberg , who had started the first six games and had a " halftime " in the bye week , as there were still six games to play , viewed the bye week as a bonus : " We have a couple more days to prepare , get a good game plan and get ready to go to a hostile environment and play a really good football team . I think it 's more of a bonus for us . " Coach Bill O 'Brien concurred , asserting that Penn State 's win against Michigan gave Hackenberg confidence and development . 
 = = = October 26 vs. Ohio State = = = 
 In Penn State 's second nationally @-@ televised , prime time game , which was to be called by Nittany Lion alumnus Todd Blackledge , the Lions entered the game underdogs , even according to their local media . The opening line put Ohio State 14 @.@ 5 point favorites . Pre @-@ game buildup focused on Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller , for whom there " is no good way to stop " , and who Bill O 'Brien called one of the top five players in the country . In tandem with star running back Carlos Hyde , Ohio State was expected to score a lot of points , even against Penn State 's improved defense ; a preview from York Daily Record writer Frank <unk> gave Ohio State the edge on offense , citing the tandem of Miller and Hyde , defense , citing playmaking game @-@ changers Noah Spence and Ryan <unk> , who play defensive end and linebacker respectively , special teams , noting their punt blocking ability and return game , coaching , noting that Ohio State had not yet lost under Urban Meyer , and intangibles , citing the sold @-@ out crowd in prime time . Keys to the game for Penn State were to contain Miller , not get beaten over @-@ the @-@ top in coverage , and running the ball , so as to avoid becoming one @-@ dimensional offensively . Ohio State needed to contain Penn State receiver Allen Robinson with their star cornerback Bradley Roby , " ride Hyde " ( run the ball with Carlos Hyde ) , and get pressure on freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg . Penn State made a few changes on their depth chart for the game , including placing Bill Belton and Zach Zwinak on the first team separated with an " OR " . Also , Deion Barnes and Anthony Zettel were listed with an OR between their names ; Zettel started the previous week against Michigan . 
 Ohio State got the ball to start the game , and promptly drove down the field on a 7 @-@ play , 75 @-@ yard drive culminating with a touchdown run by Carlos Hyde . Penn State responded with a solid drive of their own , running 12 plays and getting to the 12 @-@ yard line before Christian Hackenberg threw an interception in the end zone . The two teams exchanged punts , and then Ohio State scored , this time via a 39 @-@ yard run from their quarterback Braxton Miller . Hackenberg threw another interception late in the quarter , and Ohio State , early in the second quarter , capitalized with another touchdown . After scoring again , Penn State scored points for their first time to make the score 28 – 7 , off a 12 @-@ yard touchdown reception by Brandon Felder . Ohio State scored twice more , and the halftime score was a 42 – 7 Ohio State advantage . After exchanging punts to start the second half , Zach Zwinak lost a fumble in Penn State territory for the second consecutive week , and for the second consecutive week , he did not carry the ball after it . It took Ohio State only two plays to take advantage , scoring a touchdown on a Miller pass to <unk> Wilson . On Penn State 's next drive , Tyler Ferguson replaced Hackenberg at quarterback due to an injury he sustained earlier in the game , Ferguson was no more effective , as Penn State ultimately punted . Ohio State scored once more in the third quarter , and they led 56 – 7 headed into the fourth quarter . After another touchdown for Ohio State , Ferguson threw a touchdown pass to Allen Robinson in which Robinson caught the screen pass behind the line of scrimmage , " runs around , weaving thru traffic from one sideline to the other , and finishes in the end zone for a touchdown " . That would be the final scoring play of the game , which ended 63 – 14 . 
 In what linebacker Mike Hull described as " the worst game I 've experienced " , Penn State allowed the most points it had since 1889 , when they lost to the Duquesne Athletic Club on November 25 , 1889 64 – 5 . Ohio State totaled 686 total yards , whereas Penn State totaled 357 . The game thrust the Buckeyes into consideration to play in the 2014 BCS National Championship Game , while it subjugated Christian Hackenberg , who " wasn 't ready for Ohio State or the ' Shoe " , according to an article on Bleacher Report . An article from SBNation.com noted , " This Penn State one is a talented but extremely flawed one , flawed , especially defensively , in ways that are blatant and clear and easy for any well @-@ coached offense to exploit , and flawed on offense with youth and with inexperience , destined to repeat the past because they must before it gets any better . " 
 = = = November 2 vs. Illinois = = = 
 Coming off a shellacking against Ohio State , Penn State looked to rebound behind a strong defensive effort against Illinois . Linebacker Mike Hull noted , " Practice Monday and ( Tuesday ) was real energetic and we were smacking people out there . We ’ re ready to play another game on Saturday and get that taste of losing out of our mouth . " Keys to the game included moving on from the prior Saturday 's defeat , limiting big plays on defense , containing Illinois quarterback Nathan Scheelhaase , and protecting quarterback Christian Hackenberg . A pre @-@ game analysis of statistical comparisons between the two squads gave Penn State an advantage in most offensive and defensive stats , while it gave Illinois an advantage on special teams . The analyst blamed sanctions imposed by NCAA president Mark Emmert in wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal for that disparity , citing scholarship reductions hampering depth . 
 Illinois got the ball to start the game , and on their opening drive , Scheelhaase threw an interception , setting up Penn State at their own 16 , from which they ran a 7 @-@ play , 84 @-@ yard drive highlighted by a 47 @-@ yard pass to Allen Robinson , and culminating with Bill Belton rushing for a 1 @-@ yard touchdown . Penn State scored on their second drive as well , a lengthy 17 @-@ play drive that encapsulated 7 : 15 , and resulted in Christian Hackenberg running for a 9 @-@ yard touchdown early in the second quarter to take a 14 – 0 lead . After another Illinois punt , Penn State again drove down the field , but Sam Ficken missed a 37 @-@ yard field goal , his first miss on a kick inside of 40 yards on the season . On the final drive of the first half , Illinois finally achieved points , with kicker Taylor <unk> making a 21 @-@ yard field goal as time expired . After Penn State 's first second @-@ half drive faltered , Illinois took the field , and embarked on a 13 @-@ play , 88 @-@ yard drive , ended by an 8 @-@ yard touchdown run from Josh Ferguson . At the end of the third quarter , Penn State led 14 – 10 . In the fourth quarter , the two teams each failed to score on their first drive , but on Illinois ' second , Scheelhaase connected with Ferguson on a 7 @-@ yard pass to finish off a 13 @-@ play , 77 @-@ yard drive and take the lead for the first time in the game . Penn State 's ensuing drive had promise , but ultimately ended when Belton lost a fumble at the two @-@ yard line . Illinois failed to capitalize , however , and went three @-@ and @-@ out . Taking the field in Illinois territory , Penn State drove into field goal range , at which point Ficken made a 37 @-@ yard field goal to tie the game at 17 with 0 : 41 remaining . Illinois got the ball back , but after a false start penalty on them and a subsequent off @-@ sides penalty on Penn State , they called timeout , and ran one additional play , on which Penn State recorded their first sack of the game . Time expired . In overtime , Penn State 's second overtime game in their past three , they got the ball to start , and were faced with a third @-@ down situation needing 11 yards to convert at the 15 @-@ yard line . Coming out of a timeout following a holding penalty that brought back a touchdown , Kyle Carter made his first and only reception of the day , a 15 @-@ yard touchdown pass thrown into a tight window by Hackenberg on one of Penn State 's " favorite " plays known simply as " pearl " . Illinois did not achieve a touchdown on their subsequent drive , as Ryan Keiser intercepted a pass on its first play , ending the game with Penn State emerging victorious , 24 – 17 . 
 In a victory that coach Bill O 'Brien refused to describe as either " ugly " or " fortunate " despite a variety of media sources doing so , one article from Lancaster Newspapers described the game by saying , 
 This was some bad football played by two teams going nowhere , both ailing mentally and emotionally over having been beaten on the road in their previous outings by a combined 88 points . And after a long day of players and coaches and officials throwing up all over each other , the truth that Illinois has not won a Big Ten game since Nov. 8 , 2011 ... Which is to say , it came down to Illinois doing what it does , which is finding a way to lose , and Penn State doing what it ( more often than not ) does , which is to find a way to win . 
 Offensively , Penn State totaled 25 first downs , two fewer than Illinois , but 490 total offensive yards , exceeding Illinois by 79 . Allen Robinson caught 11 passes , and was the only Penn State receiver with more than three catches . The shuffled offensive line on which Donovan Smith did not start , " yes , allowed a sack , and yes , committed a few penalties , but generally opened up gaping holes in the run game , gave Hackenberg plenty of time to throw , and controlled the line of scrimmage " . Running back Bill Belton set career highs with both 36 rushes and 201 yards , and was named Big Ten co @-@ offensive player of the week . It was the first time a Penn State player had rushed for over 200 yards since Larry Johnson in 2002 . Defensively , Penn State stopped Illinois for a loss of yardage on only four plays , and though linebackers Mike Hull and Glenn Carson combined for 24 tackles , they had no interceptions , forced fumbles , sacks , or tackles for loss between them . The secondary struggled , though did record two interceptions , mitigating their overall ineffectiveness , much of which , however , stemmed from defensive coordinator John Butler 's incessant third @-@ down blitzes , leaving one @-@ on @-@ one coverage for overmatched cornerbacks such as Jordan Lucas . 
 = = = November 9 vs. Minnesota = = = 
 In the teams ' first meeting since 2010 , Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium to face a Minnesota team looking for their fourth consecutive Big Ten victory , and their eighth win of the season , which would have been their first time since the 2003 season . There was consensus among both Penn State 's and Minnesota 's SB Nation sites , as well as independent picks , that Minnesota would win a relatively close game . Minnesota 's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference ( 20th in the nation ) , but Penn State 's defense was also pretty good against the run , making it a good matchup . Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a running game that , in theory , was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak , and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points . Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers and running the football . Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill , recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy , coached from the press box . 
 Penn State received the opening kickoff , however on their first play from scrimmage , Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down . Penn State 's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four @-@ yard line , but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota , who drove down the field for a 15 @-@ play , 96 @-@ yard drive , highlighted by a 24 @-@ yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down to get down to the Penn State four @-@ yard line , from which point they scored two plays later via a 1 @-@ yard run by David Cobb . Penn State responded , however , with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38 @-@ yard run , and ultimately a 6 @-@ yard touchdown scamper . At the end of the first quarter , Minnesota led 10 – 7 . In the second quarter , Minnesota wasted no time , embarking on a 13 @-@ play , 70 @-@ yard drive that lasted 6 : 54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6 @-@ yard touchdown . Penn State responded , driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5 : 57 , culminating with Ficken kicking a 27 @-@ yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone . Late in the half , Minnesota drove down the field , and Nelson completed a 24 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Williams , putting Minnesota on top 24 – 10 at the half . Receiving the second half kickoff , Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39 @-@ yard run by Cobb , but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day , which they downed inside the one @-@ yard line . Penn State achieved two first downs , but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive , which ended with a punt , but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory . The break did not materialize with any points , but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line . Dreadful field position continued when , after driving for several yards , Minnesota 's punt settled inside the five yard line , again setting Penn State up with a long field . In the waning moments of the third quarter , Penn State relied on Zwinak , who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room . There was no scoring in the third quarter . Penn State failed to convert a third down ( they had still not converted any in the game ) , but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty , giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game , but ultimately turned the ball over on downs . After a Minnesota punt , Penn State , for the first drive of the game , relied on their passing game to drive down the field , but , when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory , failed to convert . On Minnesota 's ensuing possession , however , they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock , and went three @-@ and @-@ out . Hoping not to again blow an opportunity , Penn State moved promptly down the field , and got into the red zone . While there , a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota , giving Penn State the ball at the two @-@ yard line , from where they fumbled , and Minnesota recovered , and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball , winning the game 24 – 10 , after no scoring in the second half . 
 Following their victory and awarding of the Governor 's Victory Bell , Minnesota players , purportedly " a little excited after ... the team ’ s first win over the Nittany Lions in nearly a decade " , broke the trophy . For Penn State , though coming off a 200 @-@ rushing yard performance , Belton took a back seat in the rushing attack to Zwinak after fumbling in the first quarter . In total , The Morning Call graded Penn State 's offense by awarding them a C- , noting the lack of scoring despite opportunities in Minnesota territory , though noting Zwinak 's resurgence as a mitigating factor . They awarded the defense the same grade , noting that though they improved in the second half , they were " torched " on consecutive drives early in the game . They summarized Penn State 's coaching with a comment from O 'Brien : " It seemed like , when we made a call , they had the right call for it . " In total , the article asserted that overall , Minnesota was the superior team . <unk> 's Ben Jones predominantly concurred , giving the offense a C- , but giving the defense a C + , noting that the defense did keep Penn State competitive in the game . 
 = = = November 16 vs. Purdue = = = 
 Coming off a loss to Minnesota the preceding week , Penn State looked to defeat Purdue , which they had in every meeting since 2004 . Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling , having lost 38 – 14 the prior week against Iowa , and 56 – 0 the week before that against Ohio State , and entering the game with a 1 – 8 record , the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal . At his mid @-@ week press conference , Bill O 'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury , for which he sustained surgery . There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury , and Geno Lewis , who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54 @-@ yard touchdown pass against Syracuse , but had recently been relegated to special teams , was also expected to receive increased playing time in Penn State 's second @-@ to @-@ last home game of the season . 
 Penn State received the opening kickoff , and on their first play from scrimmage , featured six offensive linemen ( albeit unsuccessfully , as Bill Belton rushed for a one @-@ yard loss ) , before driving down the field on a 13 @-@ play , 75 @-@ yard drive that culminated with Belton rushing for a five @-@ yard touchdown ; he carried the load on the drive , rushing the ball eight times for 36 yards . Penn State would never relinquish that lead . Purdue subsequently went three @-@ and @-@ out , and Penn State responded with another long drive ( 10 plays , 66 yards ) that again culminated with a rushing touchdown , this time from Zach Zwinak on a one @-@ yard run , his tenth touchdown of the season , becoming the 16th Penn State player to eclipse 10 , and the first since 2008 , when both Evan Royster and Daryll Clark did . Purdue 's ensuing drive ended in the second quarter when quarterback Danny Etling threw a two @-@ yard touchdown pass to Justin <unk> , making the score 14 – 7 Penn State . Bill Belton lost a fumble on Penn State 's next drive , but Purdue turned the ball over right back to Penn State when Jordan Lucas intercepted an Etling pass . Zwinak rushed for his second one @-@ yard touchdown of the game on the ensuing possession . The Nittany Lions scored once more in the first half , via an eight @-@ yard pass from Christian Hackenberg to Adam Breneman , but on the ensuing kickoff , Purdue 's Raheem Mostert scored a touchdown on a 100 @-@ yard return , thus ending the first half with a score of 28 – 14 , Penn State holding the advantage . Purdue came out of halftime with a vengeance , driving down the field for 84 @-@ yards , ultimately pulling within 7 points on an 11 @-@ yard rush by Etling . The first field goal of the game occurred on Penn State 's subsequent drive , a 29 @-@ yarder from Sam Ficken putting the Nittany Lions ahead 31 – 21 . The Boilermakers turned the ball over again on their next drive , and Penn State capitalized when Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game . Purdue turned the ball over on downs their final drive of the third quarter , though Hackenberg threw an interception giving Purdue an opportunity early in the fourth quarter ; again , a fumble eliminated any chance of a scoring drive coming to fruition , and Penn State went up 45 – 21 when Hackenberg rushed for a 4 @-@ yard touchdown to culminate an 11 @-@ play , 74 @-@ yard drive that encapsulated over a third of the fourth quarter , and ended with 4 : 27 to play . That would be the final scoring drive of the game , which Penn State won by the aforementioned score , 45 – 21 . 
 In a game in which Penn State dominated the line of scrimmage , the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes , allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football , despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam 's goal of 400 yards . Purdue 's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State 's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa , and Penn State used it as motivation , dominating the line of scrimmage , which numerous offensive lineman noted was " fun " . Starting center Ty Howle , who noted , " It 's fun , knowing you can go out there and impose your will each play . It 's a lot of fun . " and all @-@ conference guard John Urschel , who agreed , saying , " This was a real fun game for us , with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys . The offensive linemen really enjoyed it . We were having a blast . When you 're an offensive lineman and you 're getting yards , you want to run the ball over and over again . " Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game , and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season . Aside from offensive accomplishments , the defense was also impressive , particularly play from Jordan Lucas , who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with " swagger " , and who , during the game , intercepted a pass , garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the " top playmaker in the secondary " . Despite jubilation from the victory , including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible ( the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal ) , seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second @-@ to @-@ last game at Beaver Stadium . The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota , and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O 'Brien since their first two in 2012 . 
 = = = November 23 vs. Nebraska = = = 
 On Senior Day at Penn State , the final home game of the season , the 6 – 4 Lions were set to host the 7 – 3 Nebraska Cornhuskers , however despite the Huskers having the better record , the opening line gave Penn State a two @-@ point advantage . Earlier in the week , it was announced that , in addition to the 14 seniors , Penn State would honor defensive tackle Kyle <unk> , offensive tackle Garry Gilliam , and wide receiver Alex Kenney on the field prior to the game ; none of the three planned to return for the 2014 season despite each having an additional year of eligibility . Offensively for Penn State , Biletnikoff Award semifinalist wide receiver Allen Robinson entered the game by far Penn State 's biggest threat in the passing game , with three times more receptions ( 81 ) entering the game than Penn State 's second receiver , Brandon Felder ( 27 ) . Perhaps the biggest opportunity for Penn State 's offense to achieve success against Nebraska 's defense , however , was through the running game , either on the coattails of Bill Belton or Zach Zwinak ; Nebraska 's run defense had frequently been " gouged " against Big Ten offenses . Similarly , Nebraska 's offense would have an opportunity to continue to achieve success through its running game , led by Ameer Abdullah , who entered the game averaging 6 @.@ 5 yards per carry . He had picked up the slack in the absence of their prior starter at quarterback Taylor Martinez , sidelined due to injury . Penn State coach Bill O 'Brien predicted that whichever team committed fewer turnovers would win , as both teams had previously experienced problems with turnovers , both entering the game with negative turnover margins . Both teams entered the game with freshmen quarterbacks , in Christian Hackenberg for Penn State , and Tommy Armstrong for Nebraska , but both teams ' primary playmakers came from outside the quarterback position , with Robinson for Penn State , and Abdullah for Nebraska . According to York Daily Record writer Frank <unk> , Penn State 's offense was more consistent than Nebraska 's , who committed too many turnovers , giving Penn State the edge . Defensively , Penn State was hit @-@ or @-@ miss in their secondary as well as in stopping the run , so Nebraska , who was also inconsistent , held a slight edge with their playmakers Randy Gregory and <unk> Evans , Nebraska also held an edge on special teams due to consistency and depth , but Penn State had superior coaching as well as intangibles , with a " roaring crowd " on Senior Day . With two hit @-@ or @-@ miss squads , most writers thought this would be a relatively close game , though a plurality leaned towards Nebraska edging out a victory , however some thought that Penn State 's seniors would come out with a vengeance , never having defeated Nebraska since they joined the Big Ten , and the " resilient " group would use that motivation to eke out a victory in their final game at Beaver Stadium . 
 Shortly before the game , Penn State announced tailback Bill Belton would not play due to illness , leaving Zach Zwinak to carry the load in the running game in the snow . Nebraska received the opening kickoff , and promptly went three @-@ and @-@ out , forcing a punt , which though Penn State returner Jesse Della Valle fumbled , but the Lions recovered , setting up Penn State at their own 23 yard line , but they too went three @-@ and @-@ out . Nebraska 's second drive , however , got off to a much better start , as Ameer Abdullah rushed for a 25 @-@ yard gain on the drive 's first play , but ultimately Penn State 's defense held on a later third down and short play , forcing another punt . Penn State 's subsequent drive showed promise , with Zwinak rushing for a few first downs ( on one of which Nebraska star defensive back <unk> Evans was injured ; he returned a few drives later ) , however they eventually punted , and for the second time , Alex Butterworth pinned them inside the 20 , and Nebraska failed to execute , punting for the third time ; on the punt return , Della Valle redeemed himself with a 25 @-@ yard return into Nebraska territory . Penn State took advantage of the field position , and in the waning seconds of the first quarter , Hackenberg threw a two @-@ yard touchdown to Adam Breneman after Zwinak rushed the ball six times for a total of 27 yards ; Sam Ficken missed the extra point , his first extra point miss of the season . Penn State led at the end of the first quarter , 6 – 0 . On Nebraska 's next drive , they entered with senior Ron Kellogg III at quarterback , after Armstrong 's ineffectiveness . Kellogg III came in firing on all cylinders , completing his first three passes , before Abdullah ran for a first down , and then Kellogg III completed another pass , this time for a touchdown on a 27 @-@ yard pass to Quincy <unk> . Nebraska made the extra point , taking a one @-@ point lead . Penn State 's next drive stalled , and again Butterworth was able to pin Nebraska inside the 20 on the ensuing punt . Nebraska subsequently went three @-@ and @-@ out , setting Penn State up with solid field position at their own 37 @-@ yard line . They got one first down , and were positioned for another , but Felder dropped a pass , and Penn State 's ensuing punt was blocked after Butterworth dropped the low snap , setting up Nebraska in Penn State territory . Nebraska recorded the game 's first third down conversion en route to getting the ball in the red zone . On a snap to Abdullah from the wildcat formation , he ran up the middle , but fumbled into the end zone , and Della Valle recovered in the end zone , setting Penn State up with some momentum at their 20 @-@ yard line , however they were unable to capitalize , going three @-@ and @-@ out . Nebraska 's ensuing drive stalled , and they punted . Penn State came out trying to score before the half , and they did achieve a few first downs , but ultimately punted , and Nebraska downed the ball to go into half time leading by one . Coming out of the half , the snow showers returned , and Penn State got the ball to start the half , and they did convert a third down for the first time of the game , however again , their drive stalled , and Butterworth punted the ball for the sixth time . Nebraska faced a third @-@ and @-@ long on their next drive , and on the play , C. J. Olaniyan sacked the quarterback , and forced and recovered a fumble , setting Penn State up inside the Nebraska 10 yard line . Two plays later , with the snow increasing in intensity , Hackenberg ran a play @-@ action bootleg and rolled right , running for a 7 @-@ yard touchdown , putting Penn State up 13 – 7 , as this time , Ficken made the extra point . The lead did not last long ; Kenny Bell returned the ensuing kickoff for a 99 @-@ yard touchdown , the second consecutive week Penn State surrendered a return touchdown . Back where they started at the beginning of the half in terms of scoring differential , Penn State got the ball inside their own 20 after Geno Lewis fumbled the kickoff return ( he recovered ) . Penn State achieved a first down on the drive , but a false start penalty set up a third @-@ and @-@ long situation from which they could not recover . They punted . Nebraska also punted on their next drive , and the punt was downed at the one @-@ yard line . They did not remain in the shadow of their own goal post for long , as Zwinak rushed for four yards , and then , on a play action pass , Hackenberg threw a 43 @-@ yard pass to Allen Robinson . Two plays later , however , Evans intercepted Hackenberg 's pass , giving Nebraska good field position at their own 48 . They capitalized , kicking a field goal , going up by four . The Huskers led 17 – 13 at the end of the third quarter . On the first play of the fourth quarter , Jesse James caught a pass in the flat on a third @-@ and @-@ three , and ran down the sideline for a 46 @-@ yard touchdown putting Penn State up 20 – 17 . Penn State quickly got the ball back , and looked to milk clock with Zwinak running the football , however two incomplete passes decimated the drive , and they punted it back to Nebraska . After exchanging punts , Nebraska embarked on a drive that had a 62 @-@ yard run by Abdullah called back due to a personal foul penalty called . The foul occurred deep into the run , so Nebraska still got the ball at Penn State 's 27 @-@ yard line . Subsequently , they moved the ball into the red zone , and got it down to the one @-@ yard line before a false start backed them up to the six @-@ yard line ... one play later , they called timeout , and on the next play , Kellogg III scrambled and got to the one @-@ yard line before he and Mike Hull collided , jarring the ball loose , but the ruling was that Nebraska maintained possession , and Smith made a 19 @-@ yard field goal to tie the game at 20 . When Penn State received the subsequent kickoff , they ran the ball several times , and ultimately punted the ball away with 1 : 40 remaining from their 38 @-@ yard line ; it was downed at the five @-@ yard line , setting up Nebraska with two of their three timeouts and 1 : 31 remaining . Nebraska was backed up inside their one on third @-@ and @-@ long , and threw a long pass that fell incomplete , however Jordan Lucas was flagged for pass interference . The next series , however , was decimated by penalties , and ultimately , Nebraska punted the ball away , and the game went into overtime , Penn State 's third OT game of the season ( they won the first two ) . In overtime , Penn State got the ball first , and after failing to achieve a first down , lined up to attempt a field goal , but the typically reliable Ficken missed another kick , and Nebraska conservatively positioned themselves for a field goal try on their ensuing possession . They lined up for a 37 @-@ yard field goal , but committed a false start penalty backing them up five yards . It did not matter , however , as Smith hit a 42 @-@ yard field goal to win the game , 23 – 20 . 
 Nebraska dominated Penn State on special teams , and ultimately , that advantage led to their victory . If it were not for Sam Ficken missing an extra point in the first quarter , Nebraska would not have been able to settle for a field goal late in the second half to send the game into overtime . In addition to the missed extra point , Penn State allowed a kickoff to be returned for a touchdown for the second straight week , and had a punt blocked . Bill O 'Brien commented , " We ’ ll continue to work hard in special teams . They ’ re good kids working hard . " Offensively , Penn State 's was plagued by dropped passes that hindered Christian Hackenberg 's overall performance , while the running game , though led by Zach Zwinak who rushed for 149 yards , was one @-@ dimensional , as backup Akeel Lynch could muster only nine yards on five carries . Penn State 's defense was " in control for long stretches " , but ultimately allowed a third @-@ string quarterback to win the game , and also allowed Ameer Abdullah to rush for 147 yards . Prior to the game , Penn State 's seniors were lauded with a video tribute that noted , " [ Penn State was ] led by your commitment , led by your loyalty , by your actions , led by example . " This was their third overtime game of the season , but their first overtime loss since 2002 . 
 = = = November 30 vs. Wisconsin = = = 
 In their final game of the season , Penn State looked to play spoiler and try to prevent Wisconsin from achieving a 10 @-@ win season and BCS Bowl opportunity in coach Gary Andersen 's first season with the Badgers , who entered the game with a 9 – 2 record and were 24 @-@ point favorites to win the game . The Badgers entered the game still employing their quintessential offensive philosophy even under their new coach – a power running game behind a physical offensive line led by two of the top rushers in the country , Melvin Gordon and James White , both of whom were on the preseason watchlist for the Doak Walker Award ( given to the nation 's best running back ) and the former of whom was named one of ten semifinalists for the award in mid @-@ November . White , a tough runner in the middle of the field , had emerged in recent weeks , whereas Gordon , a speedster , led the team in rushing and led the country with an 8 @.@ 2 yards @-@ per @-@ carry average . Wisconsin 's offense also featured a strong passing game , highlighted by quarterback Joel Stave and favorite target Jared <unk> , however one game preview asserted that Penn State 's defense matched up well against the Badgers ' offense . Defensively , Wisconsin entered the game the fifth @-@ best scoring defense in the country , allowing just 13 @.@ 4 points per game . The " stingy " defense , the preview noted , would likely prove problematic for Penn State . 
 Penn State received the opening kickoff , and after achieving a first down , Christian Hackenberg threw a 68 @-@ yard pass to fellow freshman Adam Breneman for a touchdown , the first offensive touchdown Wisconsin had allowed in the previous eight quarters . Wisconsin failed to respond , going three @-@ and @-@ out , and punting on their subsequent drive . Penn State , though they began with poor field position , converted a few third downs , gained 52 yards on a bubble screen to Allen Robinson , and ultimately was faced with a fourth down and inches in the red zone , but committed a false start penalty bringing on the field goal unit . The field goal was blocked , continuing Penn State 's special teams woes , however their defense remained stout , forcing another punt , however on the Lions ' ensuing drive , Hackenberg threw his first incomplete pass of the day , forcing a punt . In the waning minutes of the first quarter , the Badgers embarked on a drive in which they scored several first downs from both the running game and passing game . At the end of the quarter , they trailed 7 – 0 , but were threatening , and a few minutes later , tied the game via a 4 @-@ yard pass from Joel Stave to tight end Brian Wozniak . Later in the quarter , Wisconsin converted a third down and 16 situation , and ultimately scored a touchdown on a pass from Stave to Jeff Duckworth . On their next drive , Penn State was set up in the red zone after a pass interference call in the end zone that broadcaster Ed Cunningham criticized , and a few plays later scored a touchdown via a 3 @-@ yard pass to Geno Lewis . Lewis was uncovered on the goal line play , and though Wisconsin coach Gary Andersen ran down the sideline signalling for a timeout , it was not granted , and the play stood . At the half , the score was tied at 14 . After Wisconsin 's opening drive stalled , the Nittany Lions embarked on a demoralizing drive that fostered widespread defensive confusion from Wisconsin and ultimately ended when Jesse James caught a 7 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Hackenberg to put Penn State on top 21 – 14 . On the ensuing Wisconsin drive , Penn State freshman linebacker sacked Stave and forced a fumble that defensive end C. J. Olaniyan returned deep into Wisconsin territory . Penn State earned points , with Ficken redeeming himself on a 28 @-@ yard field goal to put Penn State up by 10 points . On the next two drives , each team went three @-@ and @-@ out . At the end of the third quarter , Wisconsin was near midfield during a drive in which they looked to pull within a field goal ; at the end of the quarter , Penn State led 24 – 14 . On one of the first plays of the fourth quarter , Trevor Williams intercepted Stave 's pass , ending a scoring threat , and furthering the Nittany Lions ' momentum . Penn State started their drive at their own 28 @-@ yard line , and had a third down and short , but a false start backed them up to a third and long ; Hackenberg was unfazed , however , as he threw a 59 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis , putting Penn State up by three possessions , 31 – 14 . Down three scores , Wisconsin desperately needed a touchdown , and tried to convert a fourth down and 23 , but Penn State recorded a sack , and subsequently got the ball with 9 : 49 to play . They failed to execute , and about a minute later , punted the ball away . Wisconsin drove down the field and pulled within 10 , 31 – 21 , on a Wozniak reception , his second touchdown catch of the day . Penn State got the ball off an onside kick with good field position , and faced a third down and three , but Donovan Smith committed his fourth false start of the day , and Penn State had to throw the ball , and the pass was incomplete . Penn State 's subsequent punt was blocked . On the ensuing drive , Jack Russell kicked a career long 48 @-@ yard field goal to pull Wisconsin within seven points . Penn State started their drive after Wisconsin kicked it deep inside their own 20 @-@ yard line . Penn State got some decent yardage on first down , but committed another false start , backing them up . Zwinak came through for the Lions , however , rushing on third @-@ and @-@ nine for 61 yards , his longest run of the season . From there , Penn State 's drive stalled , and with 35 seconds left , Ficken attempted a 31 @-@ yard field goal , but missed , and Wisconsin consequently needed to drive the length of the field to score a touchdown , and they did get into Penn State territory , but ultimately , with nine seconds left , Stave threw the ball into the end zone , and Penn State safety Ryan Keiser came away with the interception for a touchback . Christian Hackenberg took a knee to end the game , and the Nittany Lions concluded their upset , winning 31 – 24 . 
 20 @-@ year Big Ten Conference veteran Bill <unk> was the game 's referee , his final game before retiring . <unk> was the referee for the 2011 BCS National Championship Game , and past recipient of the Golden Whistle Award , given by the National Association of Sports Officials . In the game , Penn State sent its seniors off by upsetting Wisconsin , ending the Badgers ' hopes of playing in a BCS Bowl Game . Using the fact that they were 24 @-@ point underdogs as motivation , the Lions won the game by playing sound , fundamental football , not turning the ball over , while scoring two touchdowns subsequently off of Wisconsin interceptions . The game was Penn State 's first road win in Big Ten conference play . After the game , to fulfill a bet , linebacker Glenn Carson cut the hair of offensive linemen ( and roommates ) Ty Howle and Adam Gress , both of whom had long hair that stuck out of their helmets that " bothered " Carson .

 Less than a week after the season 's conclusion , backup quarterback Tyler Ferguson announced his plans to transfer from the university to somewhere he would have an opportunity to start , rather than be Christian Hackenberg 's backup for the remainder of his career . Later , it was announced that though he originally intended to transfer to Western Kentucky ( WKU ) , at which Bobby Petrino was head coach ; when Petrino accepted the head coaching position at Louisville , Ferguson changed his plans , and transferred there . In early December , it was reported that quarterbacks coach Charlie Fisher and linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden , the latter of whom was a holdover from the Joe Paterno era , departed , with speculation that they were forced out by Bill O 'Brien . 
 = = = Departure of Bill O 'Brien = = = 
 Several weeks after the departure of those assistants , reports began to surface that O 'Brien had interviewed for the Houston Texans ' head coaching position to replace Gary Kubiak , who was fired late in the season . Subsequently , the two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract , and on January 3 , 2014 , the Texans held a press conference announcing O 'Brien as their new head coach . Assistant head coach and wide receivers coach Stan Hixon , safeties coach Anthony Midget , defensive coordinator John Butler , running backs coach Charles London , and strength coach Craig Fitzgerald submitted resignations on January 6 , and most were expected to follow O 'Brien to the NFL , leaving only offensive line coach Mac McWhorter , who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at Penn State , defensive line coach Larry Johnson , a long @-@ time member of the staff , and tight ends coach John <unk> , as assistant coaches on the staff , and thus making Penn State more attractive of a coaching position to a new coach , as he could bring in his own staff . 
 Early candidates for the job included former Rutgers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Greg <unk> , Penn State alumni Al Golden , who was the coach of the Miami and Mike Munchak , who was the coach of the Tennessee Titans prior to his dismissal , and Pennsylvania native James Franklin , Vanderbilt 's head coach , as well as Larry Johnson , Penn State 's defensive line coach . In the ensuing days , ESPN reported that the search committee , led by athletic director David Joyner , targeted Munchak , Franklin , and Golden as its top three candidates , but that Johnson remained in the mix . On Sunday , January 5 , 2014 , Golden took himself out of contention for the position , while Munchak appeared to be an emerging strong candidate . Over the next few days , however , Franklin emerged as the top candidate , and on January 11 , he was officially named and introduced as Penn State 's head coach . Upon his hiring , questions began to surface about whether he would retain Johnson or bring back Vanderlinden , the latter of whom was Maryland 's head coach when Franklin was on its staff in 2000 , to the staff ; unlike when O 'Brien was hired and announced that he would retain the pair at his introductory press conference , Franklin simply noted that he would meet with the pair , but commented that he is " fiercely loyal " to his assistants from Vanderbilt , and intended to bring many with him to Penn State . Ultimately , neither Johnson nor Vanderlinden were on Franklin 's staff for the 2014 season , with the former accepting a position with rival Ohio State . 
 <unk> , Penn State named Johnson , the lone remaining holdover from the Joe Paterno era , the interim head coach in an effort to stabilize the program to prevent recruit defection , as well as prevent current players , namely quarterback Hackenberg , whose father commented that he was undecided on whether or not to return , from transferring . A few weeks later , however , it appeared Hackenberg would return , as Ferguson followed through on his plans to transfer , and Franklin lauded Hackenberg in his introductory press conference . After the announcement of O 'Brien 's departure , star wide receiver Allen Robinson , a junior , declared that he would forgo his senior season , and enter the 2014 NFL Draft ; according to projections from a CBSSports.com mock draft , Robinson would likely be selected in the late first round .

 On March 7 , 2006 , WWE 's official website featured a video of " The Miz " stating that he was headed to SmackDown ! and throughout April , SmackDown ! aired vignettes hyping his debut . When Mizanin actually attempted to make his debut on the April 21 , 2006 episode of SmackDown ! , however , he was , in storyline banned from entering the arena by " network executive " Palmer Cannon who told him that he had been " canceled " before having security escort him from the premises . 
 The Miz debuted as SmackDown ! ' s " host " on June 2 , 2006 , announcing the planned card at the top of the show and attempting to hype up the crowd . Other " host " duties included backstage interviews and hosting a bikini contest . The hosting duties seemed sporadic at best , with some weeks having little to no involvement of Miz at all . Starting in July , Miz , along with Ashley Massaro , became host of the annual Diva Search competition on both Raw and SmackDown ! . 
 After the end of the Diva Search competition , The Miz returned exclusively to SmackDown ! and as a heel , starting his in @-@ ring competition with win over Tatanka in September 2006 episode of SmackDown ! . After this win he , along with commentator Michael Cole , began to note whenever possible that he was " undefeated " , though he only wrestled five matches over the next two months , defeating such superstars as Matt Hardy , Funaki , and Scotty 2 Hotty . At the same time he began a feud with Diva Search winner Layla El , who spurned his advances on more than one occasion , leading to Miz helping Kristal defeat her in various competitions . Soon , however , Miz and Kristal found themselves being stalked by The Boogeyman . This began a feud in which the Boogeyman ended The Miz 's winning streak at December 's Armageddon event . 
 Following a brief absence from television , The Miz returned to SmackDown ! to host an interview segment called Miz TV . After the unsuccessful segment , The Miz returned to in @-@ ring competition with a more intense style and began to pick up wins once again . On the June 11 , 2007 episode of Raw , Mizanin faced off against Snitsky in a match to determine a draft pick for SmackDown ! . Snitsky easily defeated The Miz to give ECW the draft pick , but after constantly assaulting The Miz after the match , the referee reversed the decision and awarded the match to Miz , thus allowing SmackDown ! a draft pick . SmackDown ! ' s pick was then revealed to be Chris Masters . 
 Miz was drafted from SmackDown ! to ECW on June 17 , 2007 , as part of the 2007 Supplemental Draft . He was absent from the first few weeks of ECW , though he was the subject of backstage mentions between matches and had several short Miz TV Crashes ECW video segments . He made his debut on the July 10 episode of ECW in a match against Nunzio , which he won .

 = Ljótólfr = 
 Ljótólfr is a minor character in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga , who is purported to have flourished in the mid @-@ 12th century . The Orkneyinga saga was compiled in about 1200 , and documents the reigns of the earls of Orkney . It depicts Ljótólfr as a nobleman who lived on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis . During the 12th century , the Hebrides formed part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles . 
 The Orkneyinga saga relates how Ljótólfr was a friendly acquaintance of the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson , who is one of the major characters of the entire saga . The saga states that Ljótólfr housed Sveinn for some time on Lewis , and took in Sveinn 's brother , who was banished from Orkney . Ljótólfr 's son , Fugl , appears in the saga , although he is depicted at being at odds with Sveinn , until a relative of Fugl 's negotiates peace between the two . Several historians have considered Ljótólfr to be an ancestor of Clan MacLeod ; one of these considered Ljótólfr to be the eponymous ancestor of the clan — although the current understanding of the clan 's ancestry regards another man as the eponym .

 In the 11th century , the earls of Orkney were at the height of their power . The Earl of Orkney , Þórfinnr Sigurðarson , also ruled Caithness and Sutherland , and seems to have controlled the western seaboard of Scotland , and the Hebrides . Historian Magnús <unk> described the political situation of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man during the 11th and early 12th century as being unstable , and suffering from the rivalries of petty kings and chieftains . In 1079 , the Hebridean warlord Gofraidh <unk> was able to unite the Hebrides and the Isle of Man into an effective independent kingdom . In 1098 – 9 , the Norwegian king Magnús Óláfsson invaded the Hebrides , and asserted his right over the islands ; he did so again in 1102 – 3 . He is thought to have planned to unite Orkney , the Hebrides , and the Isle of Mann , under the control of his son . In 1103 , Magnús was slain in Ireland , and no Norwegian king set foot in the islands for over a century and a half . With Magnús ' death , the Outer Hebrides were brought back under the control of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles , whose kings tactfully recognised Norwegian sovereignty . In 1156 , the kingdom was partitioned following an inconclusive sea battle between the warlord Somhairle mac Gille Brighde , and the Manx king Gofraidh mac Amhlaibh : the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Gofraidh , but the Inner Hebrides were ruled separately by Somhairle . Two years later , Somhairle successfully invaded the Isle of Man , took the throne , and ruled the entire Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1164 . 
 = = Ljótólfr in the Orkneyinga saga = = 
 One of the most prominent characters of the Orkneyinga saga is the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson , who lived on the island of <unk> , in Orkney . The saga relates how Sveinn 's father , Óláfr Hrólfsson , was one of several chieftains who supported Páll Hákonsson , Earl of Orkney , in a victorious sea battle against a fleet led by Ölvir Rósta in support of Rögnvaldr Kolsson , who had been appointed the earl of half of Orkney by the King of Norway . Óláfr was later burned to death inside his own house by Ölvir , the grandson of Frakökk , an ambitious woman , portrayed as a villain in the saga . Frakökk attempted to win the Earldom of Orkney for her descendants — particularly Ölvir . 
 The saga relates how in Orkney , Sveinn murdered one of the earl 's followers , and immediately fled to the Bishop of Orkney . The bishop protected Sveinn by sending him away to the Suðreyjar , into the care of <unk> Hundason , a chieftain on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree . Later , in early spring , the saga relates how Sveinn travelled to Atholl , where he stayed for a long period of time . From Atholl , Sveinn made his way back towards Orkney by land , and on the journey northwards , he passed through Thurso , in Caithness . The saga notes that Sveinn was accompanied by Ljótólfr , and that Sveinn had spent much of the previous spring with Ljótólfr . The chieftain who lived at Thurso was an earl named Óttarr , who is described as " a man worthy of honour " . Earl Óttarr was a brother of Frakökk , and the saga relates how Ljótólfr negotiated a truce between Sveinn and Earl Óttarr , after Sveinn 's father was killed by Ölvir . 
 The saga states that Sveinn made numerous Viking expeditions throughout the Hebrides , and into the Irish Sea zone . On one such occasion , Sveinn set up a base on the Isle of Man , where he married a wealthy widow . Some time later , Sveinn and his men were attacked by a force led by <unk> , and in consequence Sveinn left the island and sailed north into the Hebrides to Lewis . 
 Further on in the saga , it is stated that Sveinn 's brother , Gunni Óláfsson , had children with Margrét <unk> , mother of Haraldr Maddaðarson , Earl of Orkney , Mormaer of Caithness . Because of this relationship with his mother , Haraldr banished Gunni from the earldom , and enmity arose between Sveinn and the earl . Sveinn then sent Gunni to stay with Ljótólfr on Lewis , with whom Sveinn himself had stayed at an earlier time . The saga also states that at this time , Ljótólfr 's son , Fugl , was with Haraldr , and consequently there was a " coldness " between Fugl and Sveinn . The saga relates that Sveinn stole a ship from Fugl , who had been travelling to Orkney to meet Haraldr . However , subsequently a relation of Fugl 's , named <unk> , who became a friend of Sveinn , succeeded in making peace between the two . Historian Garreth Williams noted that <unk> 's name is Gaelic in origin , and like Ljótólfr and Fugl , he is described as being originally from the Hebrides . The saga also states that he was from a good family . 
 = = Links to Clan MacLeod = = 
 Captain F. W. L. Thomas , a 19th @-@ century antiquarian , proposed that Ljótólfr was the eponymous progenitor of Clan MacLeod . However , today the accepted understanding is that the clan 's eponymous ancestor is another man , Leod , who flourished about a century after Ljótólfr . Leod 's name , and the modern surname MacLeod , are considered to be ultimately derived from the Old Norse personal name Ljótr . This name is derived from the Old West Norse word <unk> , meaning " foul " , " ugly " , " misshapen " . The personal name Ljótólfr is composed of two elements — the first , <unk> , is derived from the Germanic word meaning " light " , " shining " ; the second element , <unk> , is derived from a Germanic word meaning " wolf " . While the current understanding of Leod 's ancestry does not include a man named Ljótólfr , the 20th @-@ century clan historian Alick Morrison considered it possible that Ljótólfr could be an ancestor of Leod , albeit on his distaff side ; Morrison even suggested that Leod 's name could have been derived from Ljótólfr . 
 The MacLeods have two main branches — Sìol <unk> ( Scottish Gaelic : " seed of Tormod " ) and Sìol <unk> ( " seed of <unk> " ) . Sìol <unk> was the dominant family on Lewis from the Late Middle Ages until the end of the 16th century . The Gaelic names Tormod and <unk> are derived from the Old Norse names Þórmóðr and Þórketill . Thomas noted that these names were also those of two men with Lewis connections , who are both recorded in the 13th @-@ century kings ' saga Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar . One of these men was Þórketill <unk> , who according to the saga , was slain near the Isle of Skye in about the year 1230 . Thomas proposed that this man could be a grandson of Ljótólfr . Another man who appears in the saga , Þórmóðr <unk> , was forced to flee Lewis , leaving behind his wife , retainers , and goods ; according to Thomas , this shows that Þórmóðr was a resident on the island . Thomas noted that Þórmóðr <unk> was married in about 1231 , and on the assumption that each generation could be estimated to be 30 years , Thomas gave Þórmóðr 's birth at 1201 ; his ( supposed ) father , Þórketill , at 1171 ; Þórketill 's father Þórmóðr at 1141 ; and this man 's father at 1111 . Thomas concluded that the elder Þórmóðr would have been born at about the time Ljótólfr flourished on Lewis . 
 = Give It Away ( Red Hot Chili Peppers song ) = 
 " Give It Away " is a song by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers from the group 's fifth studio album , Blood Sugar Sex Magik . It was released as the lead single from their album on September 4 , 1991 , by Warner Bros. Records . The music was written by guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea during a jam session months prior to the album recording sessions . Vocalist Anthony Kiedis wrote the song 's most prevalent lyrical refrain in response to an experience he shared with former girlfriend Nina Hagen regarding altruistic behavior and the value of selflessness . 
 While several radio stations initially refused to air the song because they felt it lacked melody , " Give It Away " went on to achieve international fame . It peaked at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks in late 1991 , giving the band their first ever number one single . In 1992 the single charted inside the top 75 of the U.S. Hot 100 in the wake of the huge success of the record 's second single " Under the Bridge " . " Give It Away " also became the band 's first top ten hit in the United Kingdom , where it peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart . 
 The accompanying music video , which was directed by French film @-@ maker Stéphane Sednaoui , was put into heavy rotation on music @-@ television stations such as MTV and added to the band 's success . Since its release , " Give It Away " has gone on to receive numerous accolades , including a Grammy Award for the Best Hard Rock Performance With Vocals in 1992 . Steve Huey of Allmusic noted that while the single " didn 't achieve the massive pop success of its follow @-@ up , ' Under the Bridge ' [ ... ] it did become one of the band 's most instantly recognizable songs . " 
 " Give It Away " has been performed live by the band over 700 times , the most out of any of the band 's songs . The band performed the song as part of a guest appearance during the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show , which was headlined by Bruno Mars on February 2 , 2014 . 
 = = Origins and recording = = 
 Guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of " Give It Away " during jam sessions in the early 1990s . Following the Chili Peppers ' tour in support of Mother 's Milk ( 1989 ) , the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone . During their tenure in the group , the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for " Give It Away " . The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter , but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers ' upcoming record . Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed , and upon hearing the rest of the Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting " give it away , give it away , give it away now " . The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band 's new record , but it was not until he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit . Kiedis said , " I was so struck by Flea 's bass part , which covered the whole length of the instrument 's neck , that I jumped up and marched over to the mic , my notebook in tow . I always had fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind . " 
 The song was recorded between April and June 1991 at The Mansion in Los Angeles , California . Through the recording of " Give It Away " came a practice of crafting songs that the band would continue to use on every album following Blood Sugar Sex Magik . When the group encountered difficulty in composing a bridge for the song , it developed a tool the members colloquially termed " face @-@ offs " . Flea and Frusciante were unable to come to an agreement on guitar or bass progressions , but separately crafted part of the song . The band then reconvened at a later time and chose the most appropriate inclusion . With " Give It Away " , a chorus and verse had already been written but a bridge was lacking , so thus they partook in a " face @-@ off " . 
 = = Lyrics and meaning = = 
 The lyrical meaning behind " Give It Away " is centered on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior . The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase " give it away " , which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend — punk rock singer Nina Hagen — in the early 1980s . Hagen was several years Kiedis ' senior and became a role @-@ model during his drug addiction to heroin : " she realized how young and inexperienced I was then , so she was always passing on gems to me , not in a preachy way , just by seizing on opportunities . " When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked , and commented to Hagen that it was " really cool " . Upon expressing this , Hagen immediately told him to keep it . Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable , and explained to Kiedis that " if you have a closet full of clothes and you try to keep them all , your life will get very small . But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like , if you give it to them , the world is a better place . " 
 The act was something that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life . Growing up in Los Angeles , he had always thought differently from Hagen . Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking , the vocalist believed one must take what one wants , as no one else will provide . Instead , he now adopted Hagen 's philosophy : " It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing . That stuck with me forever . Every time I 'd be thinking ' I have to keep , ' I 'd remember ' No , you gotta give away instead . ' When I started going regularly to [ drug and alcohol ] meetings , one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic . Every time you empty your vessel of that energy , fresh new energy comes flooding in . " Flea 's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics . During the verses , Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long @-@ time friend River Phoenix , musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust . 
 = = Music and composition = = 
 " Give It Away " is performed in the time signature of 4 / 4 time . The track begins with a distinctively " dry " guitar tone that is similar in style to the rest of the record . Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of Blood Sugar Sex Magik by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band 's previous album Mother 's Milk . This caused the record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects — those that did , however , were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s . For " Give It Away " , along with the rest of the album , Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on " big " sounds : " What you hear is what you get — there 's not a lot of trickery . A lot of people want the biggest sound , with walls of guitar and huge drums . But I don 't think those things matter . " The song follows a traditional verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse structure ; when Kiedis begins singing , Frusciante jumps into a funk @-@ oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass @-@ line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard . 
 During the chorus , Kiedis sings " Give it away , give it away , give it away now " repeatedly over a more rapid guitar riff before Frusciante provides , according to Steve Huey of Allmusic , a " sudden contrast to Kiedis ' hyperactivity in the form of a languid solo pre @-@ recorded and dubbed backwards over the rhythm track . " The solo was recorded in one take because Frusciante had developed a preference towards speedy execution and a raw feeling ; according to Flea , " We did very little fix @-@ up stuff . John 's philosophy was that he would only play a solo twice . He 'd play it once , and if he didn 't like it or we didn 't like it , he 'd play it again — completely different . And that was it . " " Give It Away " also makes use of other instruments like the jew 's harp , which was played by band friend Pete Weiss . The song continues through several verses and choruses before reaching a bridge that introduces the outro , which consists of " a hard @-@ rocking riff " that , according to Huey , strongly resembles the main riff from Black Sabbath 's " Sweet Leaf " from their 1971 record Master of Reality . Kiedis repeats " Give it away now " for several measures before the guitar , bass and drums drop out . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " Give It Away " was released as the lead single from Blood Sugar Sex Magik in early September 1991 , shortly before the record went on sale . Warner Bros. sought to premiere the song on a popular rock radio station in Texas , but were turned down when the format refused to air the track — they told employees at the label to " come back to us when you have a melody in your song " . The band then embarked on a short press tour through Europe in order to promote the record ; it was during this time that KROQ @-@ FM , a Los Angeles @-@ based modern rock station , began to place " Give It Away " on heavy rotation . According to Kiedis , " That was the beginning of the infusion of those songs into mass consciousness . " 
 Critical reception to the song , much like the album , was highly positive . Jeff Vice of Deseret News noted " [ this ] dynamic first single that pays homage to Bob Marley , may start a new musical trend with its brilliant Rasta @-@ funk . " Patrick MacDonald of The Seattle Times commented that " [ Blood Sugar Sex Magik ] includes one of the best songs the Peppers have done — ' Give It Away ' , the first single . The hook is irresistible and the message , about ' material excess , ' is delivered simply and straightforwardly . " Steve Huey of Allmusic felt the song was enhanced by Kiedis ' lyrics , which were " a free @-@ associative mixture of positive vibes , tributes to musical heroes , and free love , and their literal meaning was often as difficult to understand as Kiedis ' nasal , staccato enunciation . But that distinctive vocal style helped make the most comprehensible lines even catchier and more memorable , greatly enhancing the song 's appeal . " He continued by praising the track 's music , " John Frusciante 's guitar should not be underappreciated either ; his noisy , scratchy funk @-@ rock work add [ s ] depth and texture to the powerhouse rhythm section of Flea and Chad Smith . " Jay Clarke of the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch felt " Give It Away " was " a journey into the funky world of Kiedis and Flea . This song <unk> better than the heaviest metal or the most hard @-@ core rap . " Tom Moon of Rolling Stone noted , " The pummeling ' Give It Away ' [ ... ] established a template for rock punctuated by the <unk> relentlessness of hip @-@ hop that would be appropriated by everyone . " 
 Since the song 's release , it has become a notable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' success and has won a variety of accolades . " Give It Away " won a Grammy award at the 35th Ceremony in 1993 for the " Best Hard Rock Performance " . In 1994 " Give It Away " was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's unordered list of the " 500 Songs That Shaped Rock " ; in 2002 Kerrang ! placed the song at number 67 in their list of the " 100 Greatest Singles of All Time " ; in 2004 Q included it in their unordered list of the " 1001 Songs You Must Own ! " ; and VH1 awarded the song the 50th spot in its 2009 compilation of the " 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs " . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " Give It Away " was made by French fashion photographer and director Stéphane Sednaoui . Kiedis wanted the video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of the material Warner Bros. sent for him to choose from : " I started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked good to me . Everything was the same , boring , homogenized , contrived shit . " Upon finding Sednaoui 's reel , however , Kiedis noticed it was " like nothing else . It was slower and poetic , shot in black and white . It seemed like authentic art , not something shot for MTV . " He and Flea met with Sednaoui to talk about the video , for which the director proposed a " very desolated [ and ] very graphic landscape , " while heavily focusing on the band members with little to no outside influence . It was decided that the video would be filmed in black and white while Sednaoui took the idea of painting the band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done . Sednaoui recalls that he was " amazed by what [ the band ] gave me because they went far far far beyond what I was expecting and I think that 's one of my best experiences in that regard " . The overall mood of the video was intended to be a personification of the song , which is upbeat and lively . 
 Sednaoui experimented with a variety of cinematography techniques including wide @-@ angle lenses , shots from below the subjects , superimposition , vertically cut screens displaying different angles of the same shot , reverse film effects , multiple lighting situations and flashy clothing to convey his concept . Frusciante noted the feeling of the video to be extremely vibrant and over the top : " When it was us just painting ourselves silver and wearing these big silver boots and stuff , I mean it felt like glam rock or something . " The video begins with a wide @-@ angle shot of Flea in a desert setting wearing pants with several gold colored horns protruding from each leg . The bassist is standing in a meditative stance and brings his arms together above his head when the music begins to play . The video then transitions between a variety of shots edited together that consist of the four band members standing with their eyes closed ; the band dancing around in a dimly lit setting ; a ground view of Frusciante playing a reflective silver Fender Stratocaster in between his legs while wearing pants made up entire of small pieces of mirror ; the band members moving around with full makeup on ; and the band members dancing <unk> . Kiedis adopted a deliberately outlandish wardrobe which incorporated gold lipstick , thinly braided hair , revealing meshed shorts and bright silver boots . 
 During the backwards guitar solo , Frusciante was filmed waving a large aluminum ribbon ; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui 's desire for the guitarist to do so , believing he would tell the director " ' Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass , buddy ' but [ Frusciante ] gladly went off and made love to the air with this dancing ribbon . He would have danced around for hours with that thing . " The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo . While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard , much of it was improvised or made up on the spot over the two @-@ day shoot . During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics , which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video . Where the video begins in what appears to be the daytime , it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun . 
 The video — which cost an estimated $ 140 @,@ 000 to produce — was completed while Kiedis and Frusciante were on a promotional trip through Europe in support of Blood Sugar Sex Magik . When the vocalist first saw it , he was " more hysterically ecstatic about that piece of visual footage than anything [ the band had ] ever done . " Warner Bros. executives , however , were worried that the content would be " too weird " or " too artsy " for the general public and favored a more traditional premise in contrast to the experimental approach Sednaoui took . The video was ultimately released without being edited by the record label ; since then it has been widely credited as being a considerable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers ' success and greatly increased their international popularity . Journalist Jeff Apter noted the video 's " funky brew of goofy looks , a subtle invasive hook , Flea 's spindly fingered baseline and Kiedis ' crotch @-@ hugging shorts made the clip essential viewing across MTV throughout the last few months of 1991 . " Steve Huey of Allmusic commented in his review of the song that " MTV jumped all over the visually distinctive video . " It was nominated for three awards — " Best Alternative Video " , " Breakthrough Video " , and " Best Art Direction " — at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards , for which it won the latter two .
