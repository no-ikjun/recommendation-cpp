 Maureen Ryan of Variety blamed both seasons ' low viewership on " the questionable scheduling decisions " made by then ABC president Paul Lee , saying that the series " has received lackluster promotion , especially [ for its second season ] . The botched rollout of season two included a changed premiere date and episodes that were difficult to access in advance on Marvel ’ s dreadful media site . Capping the mishandling is the fact that the full first season was only made available on <unk> days before season two began , which frustrated viewers who might have wanted to jump on board in advance .

 Arguing for the renewal of the series for a third season following its low viewership , Ryan said that " letting the show die would be a serious mistake , for the network and for the bigger Disney @-@ ABC conglomerate ... These days , entertainment properties have to be viewed not just through the lens of their ratings ( admittedly weak for Agent Carter ) . They have to be evaluated within the context of the overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus , and what Agent Carter adds to Disney @-@ ABC is simply too valuable to give up ... [ bringing ] something different to the company 's superhero portfolio . " She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast , that it should explore other opportunities , such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app , or being sold to Netflix , where " fans of super @-@ heroic storytelling already flock to " and Agent Carter 's " status as a period piece — which may have harmed it on broadcast — could be a real draw for Netflix viewers " . Ryan also felt Marvel " could copy what CBS is doing with Star Trek " by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee , where consumers could access Marvel 's films and televisions shows " as well as premium exclusives like a third season of Agent Carter " . Ryan concluded , " A third Agent Carter season could help solidify Marvel 's standing not just with female fans , but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling . " 
 When the series was canceled shortly after the release of Captain America : Civil War , in which Carter dies , Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources felt that " for all intents and purposes " Carter had " effectively been phased out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe " , and the universe had subsequently lost " a wonderful role model and ... inspiration " to fans of the character and series . Damore lamented the fact that the second season 's cliffhanger ending had been left unresolved , and that viewers would never get the chance to see Carter 's " happy ending " , despite knowing she gets one , leaving the character 's " fate unfulfilled , languishing in the obscurity of ' what could have beens ' " . She also noted that Marvel had now lost " the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events , not the least of which is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D. " , and added that despite making " leaps and bounds for women in the MCU , the same [ could not ] be said for people of color , " wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like Hazel Ying Lee , one of 38 Women Airforce Service Pilots who died in the line of duty , or Black women like Harriet Ida <unk> and Frances Wills , the first two Black members of the United States Naval Reserve .

 Deir al @-@ Balah or Dayr al @-@ Balah ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> translated Monastery of the Date Palm ) is a Palestinian city in the central Gaza Strip and the administrative capital of the Deir el @-@ Balah Governorate . It is located over 14 kilometers ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) south of Gaza City . The city had a population of 54 @,@ 439 in 2007 . The city is known for its date palms , after which it is named . 
 Deir al @-@ Balah dates back to the Late Bronze Age when it served as a fortified outpost for the New Kingdom of Egypt . A monastery was built there by the Christian monk Hilarion in the mid @-@ 4th @-@ century AD and is currently believed to be the site of a mosque dedicated to Saint George , known locally as al @-@ Khidr . During the Crusader @-@ Ayyubid wars , Deir al @-@ Balah was the site of a strategic coastal fortress known as " Darum " which was continuously contested , dismantled and rebuilt by both sides until its final demolition in 1196 . Afterward , the site grew to become a large village on the postal route of the Mamluk Sultanate ( 13th @-@ 15th centuries ) . It served as an episcopal see of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem in Ottoman times until the late 19th @-@ century . 
 Under Egyptian control Deir al @-@ Balah , whose population tripled through the influx of refugees from the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War , was a prosperous agricultural town until its capture by Israel in the Six @-@ Day War . After 27 years of Israeli occupation , Deir al @-@ Balah became the first city to come under Palestinian self @-@ rule in 1994 . Since the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000 , it has witnessed frequent incursions by the Israeli Army with the stated aim of stopping Qassam rocket fire into Israel . Ahmad Kurd , a Hamas member , was elected mayor in late January 2005 . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 " Deir al @-@ Balah , " which in Arabic translates as the " Monastery of the Date Palm , " was named after the grove of date palms that lied to the west of the city . Its name dates back to the late 19th @-@ century , before which the city was locally known as " Deir Mar <unk> " or " Deir al @-@ Khidr " and " Deir Darum " in Ottoman records . " Mar <unk> " translates as " Saint George " while in Islamic tradition al @-@ Khidr could either refer to Saint George or Elijah . The inhabitants of Deir al @-@ Balah associated al @-@ Khidr with Saint George . The town had been named after al @-@ Khidr , the most venerated saintly person throughout Palestine . The mosque in Deir al @-@ Balah which bears his name is traditionally believed by locals to contain his tomb . 
 Up until the later Ottoman era , Deir al @-@ Balah was referred to in Arabic as " Darum " or " <unk> " which derived from the settlement 's Crusader @-@ era Latin name " Darom " or " Doron . " That name was explained by the Crusader chronicler William of Tyre as a corruption of domus Graecorum , " house of the Greeks " ( dar ar @-@ rum ) . More recently , the eighteenth century scholar Albert Schultens supposed its roots are the Ancient Hebrew name " Darom " or " <unk> " , from the Hebrew root for " south " , which referred to the area south of Lydda , i.e. the southern parts of the coastal plain and Judean foothills together with the northern Negev Desert . During early Arab rule , " ad @-@ Darum " or " ad @-@ <unk> " was the name of the southern subdistrict of Bayt Jibrin .

 Deir al @-@ Balah 's history dates back to the mid @-@ 14th @-@ century BC , during the Late Bronze Age . At that time it served as an outpost in the New Kingdom of Egypt on its frontier with Canaan . During the reign of King Ramesses II ( 1303 – 1213 BC ) , Deir al @-@ Balah became the easternmost of six garrisoned fortresses in the Eastern Mediterranean . The string of fortresses began with the Sinai fort in the west , and continued through the " Way of Horus " military road to Canaan . The square @-@ shaped fortress of Deir al @-@ Balah had four towers at each corner and a reservoir . Archaeological findings in Deir al @-@ Balah revealed a large ancient Egyptian cemetery with graves containing jewelry and other personal belongings . The inhabitants of the fortress employed traditional Egyptian techniques and artistic designs in their architectural works . The cosmopolitan aspect of the frontier site is proven by the rich Cypriot , Mycenaean and Minoan findings . 
 Deir al @-@ Balah remained in Egyptian hands until around 1150 BC when the Philistines conquered the southern coastal area of Canaan . The Philistine settlement is thought to have been situated southwest of the excavation site ; its remains are hidden under large sand dunes . Five pits dug into the Late Bronze Age layers and containing Philistine pottery are among the few findings from that period . 
 The archaeological excavations at the Egyptian @-@ period site were executed between 1972 and 1982 , during Israel 's occupation , and headed by Trude Dothan . After the conclusion of the excavations the area was used for farming purposes and is now covered by vegetable gardens and fruit orchards while the main findings can be seen in Israeli museums like the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Hecht Museum in Haifa .

 During Byzantine rule , the first hermitage in Palestine was established by the early Christian monk Hilarion at the site of modern @-@ day Deir al @-@ Balah . Hilarion initially built a small hut there , but during the reign of Constantius II ( 337 – 361 ) he set up the hermitage . Towards the end of his life , the monastery grew and began to attract numerous visitors . Hilarion resided at the monastery for a total of 22 years until his departure for Cyprus where he died in 371 AD . The hermitage was divided into several small cells constructed of mud brick and palm tree branches . According to local tradition and observations from Western travelers in the 19th @-@ century , the prayer hall of the Monastery of Hilarion is currently occupied by the Mosque of al @-@ Khidr . French explorer Victor Guérin noted that two marble columns in the mosque were possibly parts of the Byzantine @-@ era monastery .

 In 632 , during the early period of Islamic rule in Arabia , the Muslim commander Usama ibn Zayd launched a raid against Byzantine @-@ held Darum , which referred not to Deir al @-@ Balah specifically , but to the area south of Lydda which included modern @-@ day Deir al @-@ Balah . The site was one of the first places in Palestine to be annexed by the Rashidun Caliphate following the conquest of Gaza by Amr ibn al- ' As in 634 . Throughout early Muslim Arab rule and until the arrival of the Crusaders in the late 11th @-@ century , " Darum " normally referred to the southern district of Jund Filastin whose capital fluctuated between the towns of Bayt Jibrin or Hebron . 
 The Fatimid caliph al @-@ Aziz Billah ( r . 975 @-@ 996 ) granted his favored vizier , Yaqub ibn Killis , a fief in modern @-@ day Deir al @-@ Balah , as testified by an inscription dating to the 980s located in the city 's al @-@ Khidr Mosque . The fief included a large estate with date palms .

 Deir al @-@ Balah was built on the ruins of the Crusader fort of Darom ( also referred to as " Doron " ) which was built by King Amalric I. The exact date of the fort 's construction is unknown , although it was likely erected after 1153 following Amalric 's capture of Ascalon to the north from the Fatimid Caliphate . As described by William of Tyre , the fort was small , tantum <unk> intra se <unk> quantum est <unk> <unk> ( containing inside as much space as a stone 's throw ) and square @-@ shaped with four towers , one of which was larger than the others . Amalric used Darom as a launching point for several unsuccessful military campaigns against Fatimid Egypt . In addition to its role as a frontier fort on the border of Egypt , Darom also served as an administrative center charged with collecting taxes from the southern areas of the kingdom and customs from caravans and travelers coming from Egypt . It was deemed a permanent threat by the rulers of Egypt . 
 Not long after its construction , a small suburb or village with a church was established by local farmers and traders just outside the fort . According to medieval chronicler William of Tyre , " it was a pleasant spot where conditions of life for people of the lower ranks were better than in cities " . The population of the village consisted of indigenous Eastern Orthodox Christians allied to and protected by the Crusader administration and garrison based in the fort . The inhabitants were considered lower @-@ class , but integral members of society by the Crusaders of European or mixed descent . Because Darom was absent of Greek bishops , in 1168 Pope Alexander III gave the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem direct jurisdiction over the dioceses , putting the largely Greek Orthodox inhabitants under the authority of the Catholic Church . 
 Following Amalric 's withdrawal from his fifth offensive against Egypt in 1170 , Muslim general Saladin , fighting on behalf of the Fatimids , attacked and besieged the fortress as part of his foray into the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem . Despite initial gains , Darom was not captured or destroyed . It later became a stronghold of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller from Jerusalem , led by King Baldwin III . After the Muslim army defeated the Crusaders in the decisive Battle of Hattin in 1187 , their leader Saladin , by then the independent sultan of the Ayyubid dynasty , advanced south and captured both Ascalon and Darom by 1188 . His first order was the fort 's demolition , but he later decided against destroying it . Instead , the fortress was substantially expanded and strengthened . " Darum " , which is what the Muslims called the fortress village , was encased by a wall with 17 strong towers protected by a deep moat with stone @-@ paved sides . It hosted a garrison commanded by the emir ( commander ) Alam ad @-@ Din <unk> and served as a store for supplies and ammunition . 
 The Crusaders recaptured the fortress on 24 May 1191 after a short siege commanded by King Richard the Lionheart . Authority over Darum was assigned to Count Henry I of Champagne , but Richard later had the fortress demolished in July 1193 prior to withdrawing his forces from Ascalon . The Ayyubids rebuilt the fortress soon after in order to use it as a bridgehead to reconquer territories lost in Palestine during the Third Crusade . Nonetheless , in 1196 , Sultan al @-@ Aziz <unk> to have it demolished in case of its capture by the Crusaders . According to 15th @-@ century historian al @-@ Maqrizi , this decision resulted in public resentment since travelers and merchants had significantly benefited from the fort 's protection . In 1226 , Syrian geographer Yaqut al @-@ Hamawi visited Darum and noted it was one of the cities of Lot and contained a ruined castle . 
 = = = Mamluk rule = = = 
 Following its demolition , it is not known how long Darum remained deserted , but it was eventually resettled during Mamluk rule which began in 1250 . For much of the Mamluk era , the town came under the administration of the politically important <unk> of Gaza ( Province of Gaza ) , part of the larger <unk> of Damascus ( Kingdom of Damascus . ) Along with <unk> and Beit Jibrin , Darum was an <unk> ( district ) of the Province of Gaza with its own wali ( governor ) . 
 It became a halting post along the newly introduced regular mail routes connecting Damascus and Cairo , which were run by horse @-@ mounted messengers with colored sashes . Syrian historian Ibn Fadlallah al @-@ Umari did not mention Darum in his list of the route 's stopping points in 1349 , instead noting that al @-@ <unk> was the only post between Rafah and Gaza , suggesting that Darum was not a major settlement at the time . However , 14th @-@ century Egyptian historian Ahmad al @-@ <unk> counters al @-@ Umari 's account , writing that Darum was the last halting post before Gaza . Roads , bridges , postal stations and a khan ( caravanserai ) were built in the town to accommodate the messengers . Pigeon mail service was introduced for which towers were built . Produce available in Darum during this time period included barley , wheat , grapes and grape leaves , olives , raspberries , lemons , figs , sweet melons , pomegranates and dates . Surrounding the town were the encampments of the <unk> <unk> , an Arab clan that also lived around Gaza .

 Sometime prior to the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516 or in the beginning years of Ottoman rule , Darum gained the additional name of " Deir " as in " Deir Darum " after its Byzantine @-@ era monastery . The village continued to thrive during the early Ottoman era in Palestine which is attributed to the urban infrastructure originally established by the Crusaders . Its continued importance also stemmed from its close proximity to Gaza and its position on the former Via Maris trade route . The first Ottoman tax census in 1525 revealed Deir al @-@ Balah was a relatively large village with a religiously mixed population of 87 Christian families and 56 Muslim families . In 1596 it was part of Gaza Sanjak ( District of Gaza ) and had a Muslim majority with 175 Muslim families and 125 Christian families . With an estimated population of 1 @,@ 500 , it was one of eight villages at the time to have between 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 inhabitants . Annual tax revenue from the town amounted to 17 @,@ 300 <unk> . Pierre <unk> named the village Deir K <unk> on his map from 1799 . 
 A substantial part of Deir al @-@ Balah 's inhabitants died in 1862 because of stagnant drinking water originating from the town 's swamps . The swamps were seasonal , forming each winter as a result of flooding which failed to breach the sandstone ridge . A year later , on 29 May 1863 , French explorer Victor Guérin wrote that Deir al @-@ Balah was a small , partly ruined village with a population of 350 . Date farming was the principal economic activity that the inhabitants engaged in . In 1878 , the Palestine Exploration Fund 's Survey of Western Palestine noted Deir al @-@ Balah had grown to become a large village of mud houses " with wells and a small tower " . At the time , it served as a see of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem .

 Deir al @-@ Balah was captured by the British Army following the surrender of Khan Yunis on 28 February 1917 . By April an aerodrome and an army camp were established there and Deir al @-@ Balah became a launching point for British forces against Ottoman @-@ held Gaza and Beersheba to the north and northeast , respectively . Of the 25 British war cemeteries dating from World War I , one of the six largest was built in Deir al @-@ Balah in March 1917 . It continued to be used until March 1918 and contains a total of 724 graves . Deir al @-@ Balah became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine starting in 1922 . A municipal council to administer the town was established by the British authorities in 1946 , but it had limited jurisdiction over civil affairs and provided a few basic services . 
 In 1945 Deir al @-@ Balah had a population of 2 @,@ 560 , all Arabs , with 14 @,@ 735 dunams of land , according to an official land and population survey . Of this , 327 dunams were for citrus and bananas , 472 plantations and irrigable land , 14 @,@ 438 used for cereals , while 39 dunams were built @-@ up land . In the lead @-@ up to the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War , residents of Deir al @-@ Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom , despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers , but they were repelled and suffered casualties . During the war , Egypt captured the town along with other towns in an area that became known as the Gaza Strip . The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs . Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al @-@ Balah . The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity . 
 During the Six @-@ Day War in June 1967 , Deir al @-@ Balah 's mayor Sulaiman al @-@ <unk> briefly led local resistance against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter . The Israeli authorities took control of the springs , an important irrigation source . This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers , damaged the local citrus industry . In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al @-@ Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military @-@ appointed administration . During the course of the Israeli occupation , Deir al @-@ Balah 's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture , largely as a result of building restrictions which hindered organized expansion . 
 When the First Intifada broke out in 1987 , Deir al @-@ Balah 's residents participated in the uprising against Israeli rule . Around 30 residents were killed during the uprising , which formally ended in 1993 with the Oslo Accords between the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel . In 1994 Deir al @-@ Balah was the first city to officially come under the control of the Palestinian National Authority as a result of the Gaza – Jericho Agreement . 
 The city has been frequently targeted in Israeli military incursions since the Second Intifada in 2000 , in part due to Qassam rocket @-@ strikes by Palestinian militants . The areas surrounding the city have also been frequent targets of razing . On 4 January 2004 , Israeli authorities bulldozed around 50 dunams ( 5 hectares ) of land in the Abu al @-@ Ajen area east of Deir al @-@ Balah 's center . Later on 7 January , the Applied Research Institute @-@ Jerusalem ( <unk> ) reported that " Israeli bulldozers staged into al @-@ <unk> area south of Deir el @-@ Balah city under heavy barrage of gunfire and razed 70 dunams ( 7 hectares ) of land planted with guava and orange groves owned by the Abu Holy and Abu <unk> families . " 
 During factional clashes across the Gaza Strip in June 2007 which ended with Hamas gaining control over that territory , at least four paramilitaries from Hamas and Fatah were killed in Deir al @-@ Balah . On 2 January 2009 , Deir al @-@ Balah was shelled by the Israeli Army as part of its month @-@ long offensive Operation Cast Lead .

 Field lacrosse is a full contact outdoor men 's sport played with ten players on each team . The sport originated among Native Americans , and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867 . Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of lacrosse played internationally . The other versions , women 's lacrosse ( established in the 1890s ) and box lacrosse ( which originated in the 1930s ) , are played under significantly different rules . 
 The object of the game is to use a long handled racket , known as a lacrosse stick or crosse , to catch , carry , and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling the ball into an opponent 's goal . The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball . In addition to the lacrosse stick , players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment . Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact . The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field and require the ball to be moved continuously towards the opposing goal . It is sometimes referred to as the " fastest sport on two feet " . 
 Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 52 @-@ member Federation of International Lacrosse , which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years . A former Olympic sport , attempts by the international governing body to reinstate it to the Games have been hampered by insufficient international participation and by the existence of separate governing bodies for the men 's and women 's versions of the sport until 2008 . Field lacrosse is played professionally in North America by Major League Lacrosse . It is also played on a high amateur level by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States , the Australian Senior Lacrosse Championship series , and the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association . 
 = = History = = 
 Known as the " fastest sport on two feet " , lacrosse is a traditional Native American game . According to Native American beliefs , playing lacrosse is a spiritual act used for healing and giving thanks to the " Creator " . They would also play the game to resolve minor conflicts between tribes that were not worth going to war for , thus the name " little brother of war " . These games could last several days and as many as 100 to 1 @,@ 000 men from opposing villages or tribes played on open plains , between goals ranging from 500 yards ( 460 m ) to several miles apart . 
 The first Europeans to observe it were French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley , in the 1630s . The name " lacrosse " comes from their reports , which described the players ' sticks as like a bishop 's crosier — la crosse in French . The Native American tribes used various names : in the Onondaga language it was called <unk> 'es ( " they bump hips " or " men hit a rounded object " ) ; da @-@ nah @-@ wah <unk> ( " little war " ) to the Eastern Cherokee ; in Mohawk , <unk> ( " little brother of war " ) ; and <unk> in Ojibwe . Variations in the game were not limited to the name . In the Great Lakes region , players used an entirely wooden stick , while the Iroquois stick was longer and was laced with string , and the Southeastern tribes played with two shorter sticks , one in each hand . 
 In 1867 , Montreal Lacrosse Club member William George Beers codified the modern game . He established the Canadian National Lacrosse Association and created the first written rules for the game , Lacrosse : The National Game of Canada . The book specified field layout , lacrosse ball dimensions , lacrosse stick length , number of players , and number of goals required to determine the match winner . 
 Women 's lacrosse , a non @-@ contact version of the sport originating in Scotland during the 1890s , is played by twelve players per side , on longer fields and with less protective equipment than the men 's game requires . In the 1930s Canadian businessmen established a version called box lacrosse to create business for ice hockey arenas during the summer months . Box lacrosse is played indoors , with smaller nets , between two teams of six players , and strongly resembles the game its areas were designed for . 
 = = Rules = = 
 Field lacrosse involves two teams , each competing to shoot a lacrosse ball into the opposing team 's goal . A lacrosse ball is made out of solid rubber , measuring 7 @.@ 75 to 8 inches ( 19 @.@ 7 – 20 cm ) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5 @.@ 25 ounces ( 140 – 149 g ) . Each team plays with ten players on the field : a goalkeeper ; three defenders in the defensive end ; three midfielders free to roam the whole field ; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end . Players are required to wear some protective equipment , and must carry a lacrosse stick ( or crosse ) that meets specifications . Rules dictate the length of the game , boundaries , and allowable activity . Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules . 
 The game has undergone significant changes since Beers ' original codification . In the 1930s , the number of players on the field per team was reduced from twelve to ten , rules about protective equipment were established , and the field was shortened . 
 = = = Playing area = = = 
 A standard lacrosse field is 110 yards ( 100 m ) in length from each endline , and 60 yards ( 55 m ) in width from the sidelines . 
 Field lacrosse goals are centered between each sideline , positioned 15 yards ( 14 m ) from each endline and 80 yards ( 73 m ) apart from one another . Positioning the goals well within the <unk> allows play to occur behind them . The goal is 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) wide by 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) tall , with nets attached in a pyramid shape . Surrounding each goal is a circular area known as the " crease , " measuring 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter . 
 If a player enters the " crease " while shooting toward the goal , the referee will call a foul and the ball gets turned over to the other team . 
 A pair of lines , 20 yards ( 18 m ) from both the midfield line and each goal line , divides the field into three sections . From each team 's point of view , the one nearest its own goal is its defensive area , then the midfield area , followed by the attack or offensive area . These <unk> lines are called " restraining lines . " A right angle line is marked 10 yards ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) from each sideline connecting each endline to the nearer restraining line , creating the " restraining box . " If an official deems that a team is " stalling , " that is not moving with offensive purpose while controlling the ball , the possessing team must keep the ball within the offensive restraining box to avoid a loss @-@ of @-@ possession penalty . 
 Field markings dictate player positioning during a face @-@ off . A face @-@ off is how play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal . During a face @-@ off , there are six players ( without considering goalkeepers ) in each of the areas defined by the restraining lines . Three midfielders from each team occupy the midfield area , while three attackmen and three of the opposing team 's defensemen occupy each offensive area . These players must stay in these areas until possession is earned by a midfielder or the ball crosses either restraining line . Wing areas are marked on the field on the midfield line 10 yards ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) from each sideline . This line indicates where the two <unk> @-@ off midfielders per team lineup during a face @-@ off situation . These players may position themselves on either side of the midfield line . During a face @-@ off , two players lay their sticks horizontally next to the ball , head of the stick inches from the ball and the butt @-@ end pointing down the midfield line . Once the official blows the whistle to start play , the face @-@ off midfielders scrap for the ball to earn possession and the other midfielders advance to play the ball . If possession is won by the face @-@ off player , he may move the ball himself or pass to a teammate . 
 The rules also require that substitution areas , a penalty box , coaches area , and team bench areas be designated on the field . 
 = = = Equipment = = = 
 A field lacrosse player 's equipment includes a lacrosse stick , and protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with face mask , lacrosse gloves , and arm and shoulder pads . Players are also required to wear mouthguards and athletic supporter with cup pocket and protective cup . 
 Each player carries a lacrosse stick measuring 40 to 42 inches ( 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 1 m ) long ( a " short crosse " ) , or 52 to 72 inches ( 1 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 8 m ) long ( a " long crosse " ) . In most modern circles the word crosse has been replaced by stick and the terms short stick and long stick or pole are used . The term crosse is still used is in the rulebook and in reference to a " crosse check " ( a check where one 's hands are spread on the crosse and the checker extends his arms into the <unk> ) . On each team up to four players at a time may use a long crosse : the three defensemen and one midfielder . The crosse is made up of the head and the shaft ( or handle ) . The head is roughly triangular in shape and is loosely strung with mesh or leathers and nylon strings to form a " pocket " that allows the ball to be caught , carried , and thrown . In field lacrosse , the pocket of the crosse is illegal if the top of the ball , when placed in the head of the stick , is below the bottom of the stick 's sidewall . The head of a crosse may be 10 inches ( 25 cm ) in length . The maximum width of the head across the top is 4 to 10 inches ( 10 – 25 cm ) , for international competition , or 6 @.@ 5 to 10 inches ( 17 – 25 cm ) according to NCAA regulations . The NCAA instituted stricter specifications to ensure the " safety and integrity of the game . " As the shape of the crosse evolved , dislodging the ball from an opponent 's crosse became more difficult , and defenders used an increased amount of force when checking . The rule change was intended to reduce injuries , as defenders would need less forceful checks in order to dispossess opponents . Beginning January 1 , 2010 , measurements for the crosse shall include the following , in addition to current specifications : 
 From the 1 @.@ 25 @-@ inch measurement to the top of the crosse , the distance between the sidewalls of the crosse must be at least 3 inches . 
 Most modern sticks have a tubular metal shaft , usually made of aluminum , titanium , or alloys , while the head is made of hard plastic . Metal shafts must have a plastic or rubber cap at the end . The heads are strung with string , leather , and mesh . The strings in the pocket are called shooting , accuracy , or " v " strings . 
 The sport 's growth has been hindered by the cost of a player 's equipment : a uniform , helmet , shoulder pads , hand protection , and lacrosse sticks . Many players have at least two lacrosse sticks prepared for use in any contest . Traditionally players used sticks made by Native American craftsman . These were expensive and , at times , difficult to find . The introduction of the plastic heads in the 1970s gave players an alternative to the wooden stick , and their mass production has led to greater accessibility and expansion of the sport .

 = = = = Goalkeeper = = = = 
 The goalkeeper 's responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring by directly defending the 6 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) by 6 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) goal . A goalkeeper needs to stop shots that are capable of reaching over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) , and is responsible for directing the team 's defense . 
 Goalkeepers have special privileges when they are in the crease , a circular area surrounding each goal with a radius of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . Offensive players may not play the ball or make contact with the goalkeeper while he is in the crease . Once a goalkeeper leaves the crease , he loses these privileges . 
 A goalkeeper 's equipment differs from other players ' . Instead of shoulder pads and elbow pads , the goalkeeper wears a chest protector . He also wears special " goalie gloves " that have extra padding on the thumb to protect from shots . The head of a goalkeeper 's crosse may measure up to 15 inches ( 38 cm ) wide , significantly larger than field players ' . 
 = = = = Defensemen = = = = 
 A defensemen is a player position whose responsibility is to assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring . Each team fields three defensemen . These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field . Unless the defensemen gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass , by doing this they will need to cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back . A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking . 
 Tactics used by a defensemen include body positioning and checking . Checking is attempting to dispossess the opposition of the ball through body or stick contact . A check may include a " poke check " , where a defensemen thrusts his crosse at the top hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball ( similar to a billiards shot ) , or a " slap check " , where a player applies a short , two @-@ handed slap to the hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball . A " body check " is allowed as long as the ball is in possession or a loose ball is within five yards of the opposing player and the contact is made to the front or side of the torso of the opposing player . Defensemen preferably remain in a position relative to their offensive counterpart known as " topside " , which generally means a stick and body position that forces a ball carrier to go another direction , usually away from the goal . 
 = = = = Midfielders = = = = 
 Midfielders contribute offensively and defensively and may roam the entire playing area . Each team fields three midfielders at a time . One midfielder per team may use a long crosse , and in this case is referred to as a " long @-@ stick midfielder . " Long @-@ stick midfielders are normally used for defensive possessions and face @-@ offs but can participate in offense as long as he is not subbed off . 
 Over time , the midfield position has developed into a position of specialties . During play , teams may substitute players in and out freely , a practice known as " on the fly " substitution . The rules state that substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players ' bench . Teams frequently rotate the midfielder specialists off and on the field depending on the ball possession . Some teams have a designated face @-@ off midfielder , referred to as a " <unk> " midfielder ( an acronym for " face @-@ off and get @-@ off " ) , who takes the majority of face @-@ offs and is quickly substituted after the face @-@ off . Some teams also designate midfielders as " offensive midfielders " or " defensive midfielders " depending on their strengths and weaknesses .

 Each team fields three attackmen at a time , and these players generally remain on the offensive half of the field . 
 = = = Duration and tie @-@ breaking methods = = = 
 Duration of games depends upon the level of play . In international competition , college lacrosse , and Major League Lacrosse , the total playing time is 60 minutes , composed of four 15 @-@ minute quarters . High school games typically consist of four 12 @-@ minute quarters but can be played in 30 @-@ minute halves , while youth leagues may have shorter games . The clock typically stops during all dead ball situations such as between goals or if the ball goes out of bounds . The method of breaking a tie generally consists of multiple overtime periods of 5 minutes ( 4 in NCAA play ) in which whoever scores a goal is awarded a sudden victory . A quicker variant of the sudden victory is the Braveheart method in which each team sends out one player and one goalie ; it is then sudden victory . International lacrosse plays two straight 5 @-@ minute overtime periods , and then applies the sudden victory rule if the score is still tied . 
 = = = Ball movement and out of play = = = 
 Teams must advance the ball or be subjected to loss of possession . Once a team gains possession of the ball in their defensive area , they must move the ball over the midfield line within 20 seconds . If the goalkeeper has possession of the ball in the crease he must pass the ball or vacate the area within four seconds . Failure by the goalkeeper to leave the crease will result in the opposite team being given possession just outside the restraining box . Once the ball crosses the midfield line , a team has 10 seconds to move the ball into the offensive area designated by the restraining box or forfeit possession to their opponents . The term used to define moving the ball from the defensive to offensive area is to " clear " the ball . Offensive players are responsible for " riding " opponents , in other words attempting to deny the opposition a free " clear " of the ball over the midfield line . 
 If a ball travels outside of the playing area , play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball , unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot . In that case , possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area . 
 = = = Penalties = = = 
 For most fouls , the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one fewer player for a short amount of time . Penalties are classified as either personal fouls or technical fouls . Personal fouls are of a more serious nature and are generally penalised with a 1 @-@ minute suspension . Technical fouls are violations of the rules that are not as serious as personal fouls , and are penalised for 30 seconds or a loss of possession . Occasionally a longer penalty may be assessed for more severe infractions . Players penalised for 6 personal fouls must leave the game . The penalised team is said to be playing man down defense while the other team is on the man up , or playing " extra man offence . " During a typical game , each team will have three to five extra man offence opportunities . 
 = = = = Personal fouls = = = = 
 Personal fouls ( PF ) include slashing , tripping , illegal body checking , cross checking , unsportsmanlike conduct , unnecessary roughness , and equipment violations . While a stick @-@ check ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player 's stick in order to knock the ball loose ) is legal , a slashing violation is called when a player viciously makes contact with an opposing player or his stick . An illegal body check penalty is called for any contact where the ball is further than 5 yards ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) from the contact , the check is from behind , above the shoulders or below the knees , or was avoidable after the player has released the ball . Cross checking , where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance , is illegal in field lacrosse . Both unsportsmanlike conduct and unnecessary roughness are subject to the officiating crew 's discretion , while equipment violations are governed strictly by regulations . 
 = = = = Technical fouls = = = = 
 Technical fouls include holding , interference , pushing , screening , " warding off " , stalling , and off @-@ sides . A screen , as employed in basketball strategy , is a blocking move by an offensive player , by standing beside or behind a defender , to free a teammate to shoot , or receive a pass . <unk> off occurs when an offensive player uses his free hand to control the stick of an opposing player . 
 Offside has a unique implementation in field lacrosse . Instituted with rule changes in 1921 , it limits the number of players that are allowed on either side of the midfield line . Offside occurs when there are fewer than three players on the offensive side of the midfield line or when there are fewer than four players on the defensive half of the midfield line ( note : if players are exiting through the special @-@ substitution area , it is not to be determined an offside violation ) . 
 A technical foul requires that the defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team be placed in the penalty box for 30 seconds . As with a personal foul , until the penalty time expires , no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short . The player ( or a replacement ) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength .

 College lacrosse , a spring sport in the United States , saw its earliest program established by New York University in 1877 . The first intercollegiate tournament was held in 1881 featuring four teams : New York University , Princeton University , Columbia University , and Harvard University . This tournament was won by Harvard . The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association ( USILA ) was created in 1885 , and awarded the inaugural Wingate Memorial Trophy to the University of Maryland as national champions in 1936 . The award was presented to the team ( or teams ) with the best record until the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) instituted a playoff system in 1971 . The NCAA sponsored its premier Men 's Lacrosse Championship with the 1971 tournament where Cornell University defeated University of Maryland in the final . In addition to the three divisions in the NCAA , college lacrosse in the United States is played by non @-@ varsity Men 's Collegiate Lacrosse Association and National College Lacrosse League club teams . 
 Lacrosse was first witnessed in England , Scotland , Ireland and France in 1867 when a team of Native Americans and Canadians traveled to Europe to showcase the sport . The year after , the English Lacrosse Association was established . In 1876 , Queen Victoria attended an exhibition game and was impressed , saying , " The game is very pretty to watch . " Throughout Europe , lacrosse is played by numerous club teams and is overseen by the European Lacrosse Federation . Lacrosse was brought to Australia in 1876 . The country sponsors various competitions among its states and territories that culminate in the annual Senior Lacrosse Championship tournament . 
 In 1985 , the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association ( <unk> ) was established , with twelve universities in the Ontario and Quebec provinces competing in the intercollegiate league . The league plays its season during the autumn . Unlike the NCAA , the <unk> allows players that are professional box lacrosse players in the National Lacrosse League to participate , stating that " although stick skills are identical , the game play and rules are different " . 
 Professional field lacrosse made its first appearance in 1988 with the formation of the American Lacrosse League , which folded after five weeks of play . In 2001 , professional field lacrosse resurfaced with the inception of Major League Lacrosse ( MLL ) , whose teams , based in the United States and Canada , play during the summer . The MLL modified its rules from the established field lacrosse rules of international , college , and high school programs . To increase scoring , the league employed a sixty second shot clock , a two point goal for shots taken outside a designated perimeter , and reduced the number of long sticks to three rather than the traditional four . Prior to the 2009 MLL season , after eight seasons , the league conformed to traditional field lacrosse rules and allowed a fourth long crosse . The MLL has been bolstered by a ten year television contract with ESPN in 2007 .

 The Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) is the international governing body of lacrosse and it oversees field , women 's and box lacrosse competitions . In 2008 , the International Lacrosse Federation and the International Federation of Women 's Lacrosse Associations merged to form the FIL . The former International Lacrosse Federation was founded in 1974 to promote and develop the game of men 's lacrosse throughout the world . The FIL now sponsors the World Lacrosse Championship and Under @-@ 19 World Lacrosse Championships which are played under field lacrosse rules . It also oversees the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship played under box lacrosse rules , and the Women 's Lacrosse World Cup and an under @-@ 19 championship under women 's lacrosse rules .

 Lacrosse at the Olympics was a medal earning sport in the 1904 Summer Olympics and the 1908 Summer Olympics . In 1904 , three teams competed in the games held in Saint Louis , Missouri . Two Canadian teams , the Winnipeg Shamrocks and a team of Mohawk people from the Iroquois Confederacy , and an American team represented by the local St. Louis A.A.A. lacrosse club participated , and the Winnipeg Shamrocks captured the gold medal . The 1908 games held in London , England , featured only two teams , representing Canada and Great Britain . The Canadians again won the gold medal in a single championship match by a score of 14 – 10 . 
 In the 1928 Summer Olympics , 1932 Summer Olympics , and the 1948 Summer Olympics , lacrosse was a demonstration sport . The 1928 Olympics featured three teams : the United States , Canada , and Great Britain . The 1932 games featured a three @-@ game exhibition between a Canadian All @-@ star team and the United States . The United States was represented by Johns Hopkins Blue Jays lacrosse in both the 1928 and 1932 Olympics . In order to qualify , the Blue Jays won tournaments in the Olympic years to represent the United States . The 1948 games featured an exhibition by an " All @-@ England " team organized by the English Lacrosse Union and the collegiate lacrosse team from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute representing the United States . This exhibition ended in a 5 – 5 tie . 
 There are obstacles to reestablishing lacrosse as an Olympic sport . One hurdle was resolved in 2008 , when the international governing bodies for men 's and women 's lacrosse merged to form Federation of International Lacrosse . Another obstacle is insufficient international participation . In order to be considered as an Olympic sport the game must be played on four continents , and with at least a total of 75 countries participating . According to one US Lacrosse representative in 2004 , " it ’ ll take 15 @-@ 20 years for us to get there . " For the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , Georgia and 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia , efforts were made to include lacrosse as an exhibition sport , but these failed .

However , Haudenosaunee nation is not a member of the Pan American Sports Organization .

 = Robert Stroud = 
 Robert Franklin Stroud ( January 28 , 1890 – November 21 , 1963 ) , known as the " Birdman of Alcatraz " , was an American federal prisoner and author who has been cited as one of the United States ' most notorious criminals . During his time at Leavenworth Penitentiary , he reared and sold birds and became a respected ornithologist , but because of regulations , he was not permitted to keep birds at Alcatraz , where he was incarcerated from 1942 to 1959 . Stroud was never released from the Federal prison system . 
 Born in Seattle , Washington , Stroud ran away from his abusive father at the age of 13 , and by the time he was 18 , he had become a pimp in the Alaska Territory . In January 1909 , he shot and killed a bartender who had attacked one of his prostitutes , for which he was sentenced to 12 years in the federal penitentiary on Puget Sound 's McNeil Island . Stroud gained a reputation as an extremely dangerous inmate who frequently had confrontations with fellow inmates and staff , and in 1916 , he killed a guard . Stroud was convicted of first @-@ degree murder and sentenced to hang , but after several trials , his sentence was eventually commuted to life imprisonment . 
 Stroud began serving life in solitary confinement at Leavenworth , where in 1920 , after discovering a nest with three injured sparrows in the prison yard , he began raising them , and within a few years had acquired a collection of some 300 canaries . He began extensive research into them after being granted equipment by a radical prison @-@ reforming warden , publishing Diseases of Canaries in 1933 , which was smuggled out of Leavenworth and sold en masse , as well as a later edition ( 1943 ) . He made important contributions to avian pathology , most notably a cure for the hemorrhagic septicemia family of diseases , gaining much respect and some level of sympathy among ornithologists and farmers . Stroud ran a successful business from inside prison , but his activities infuriated the prison staff , and he was eventually transferred to Alcatraz in 1942 after it was discovered that Stroud had been secretly making alcohol using some of the equipment in his cell . 
 Stroud began serving a 17 @-@ year term at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on December 19 , 1942 , and became inmate # 594 . In 1943 , he was assessed by psychiatrist Romney M. Ritchey , who diagnosed him as a psychopath , but with an I.Q. of 134 . Stripped of his birds and equipment , he wrote a history of the penal system . 
 In 1959 , with his health failing , Stroud was transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield , Missouri , where he stayed until his death on November 21 , 1963 , having been incarcerated for the last 54 years of his life , of which 42 were in solitary confinement . He had been studying French near the end of his life . Robert Stroud is buried in Metropolis , Illinois . Author Carl <unk> considers Stroud to have been " possibly the best @-@ known example of self @-@ improvement and rehabilitation in the U.S. prison . " 
 = = Early life and arrest = = 
 Stroud was born in Seattle , the eldest child of Elizabeth Jane ( née McCartney 1860 @-@ 1938 ) and Benjamin Franklin Stroud . His mother had two daughters from a previous marriage . His father was an abusive alcoholic , and Stroud ran away from home at the age of 13 . His parents both had German ancestry . 
 By the time he was 18 , Stroud had made his way to Cordova , Alaska , where he met 36 @-@ year @-@ old Kitty O ’ Brien , a prostitute and dance @-@ hall entertainer , for whom he pimped in Juneau . According to Stroud , on January 18 , 1909 , while he was away at work , an acquaintance of theirs , barman F. K. " Charlie " Von Dahmer , had allegedly failed to pay O 'Brien for her services and beat her , tearing a locket from her neck that contained a picture of her daughter that was of sentimental value . That night , after finding out about the incident , Stroud confronted Von Dahmer on Gastineau Avenue , and a struggle ensued , resulting in the latter 's death from a gunshot wound . Stroud went to the police station , and turned himself and the gun in . According to police reports , Stroud had knocked Von Dahmer unconscious , and then shot him at point @-@ blank range . 
 Stroud 's mother , Elizabeth , retained a lawyer for her son , but he was found guilty of manslaughter on August 23 , 1909 , and sentenced to 12 years in the federal penitentiary on Puget Sound 's McNeil Island . Stroud 's crime was handled in the federal system , as Alaska at that time was still a federal territory , and not a state with its own judiciary .

 Known as Prisoner # 1853 @-@ M , Stroud was one of the most violent prisoners at McNeil Island , frequently feuding with fellow inmates and staff , and was also prone to many different physical ailments . Stroud reportedly stabbed a fellow prisoner who had reported him for stealing food from the kitchen . He also assaulted a hospital orderly who had reported him to the prison administration for attempting to obtain morphine through threats and intimidation , and had also reportedly stabbed another fellow inmate who was involved in the attempt to smuggle the narcotics . On September 5 , 1912 , Stroud was sentenced to an additional six months for the attacks , and was transferred from McNeil Island to the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth , Kansas . On March 26 , 1916 , after being there six months , Stroud was reprimanded by cafeteria guard Andrew F. Turner for a minor rule violation that would have annulled Stroud 's visitation privilege to meet his younger brother , whom he had not seen in eight years . With a six @-@ inch shiv , Stroud stabbed Turner through his heart . 
 Stroud was convicted of first @-@ degree murder , and sentenced to death by hanging on May 2 . He was ordered to await execution of his sentence in solitary confinement , but this was thrown out in December by the U.S. Supreme Court . In a second trial held on May 28 , 1917 , he was also convicted , but received a life sentence , which Stroud appealed , and Solicitor General John W. Davis " confessed error " because he wanted Stroud to receive the death penalty . As a result , Stroud was tried for a third time in May 1918 , and on June 28 he was again sentenced to death by hanging . The Supreme Court intervened , upholding the death sentence , which was scheduled to be carried out on April 23 , 1920 . Stroud 's mother appealed to President Woodrow Wilson and his wife , Edith Wilson , and the execution was halted just eight days before it was to be carried out ; the gallows had already been built and viewed by Stroud from his cell . Stroud 's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment . Leavenworth 's warden , T. W. Morgan , strongly opposed the decision given Stroud 's reputation for violence . Morgan persuaded the President to stipulate that since Stroud was originally sentenced to await his death sentence in solitary confinement , those conditions should prevail until the halted execution could be carried out . President Wilson 's Attorney General , Alexander Mitchell Palmer , saw to it that Stroud was sentenced to a lifetime in solitary . 
 = = The Birdman of Leavenworth = = 
 While at Leavenworth in 1920 , Stroud found a nest with three injured sparrows in the prison yard , and raised them to adulthood . Prisoners were sometimes allowed to buy canaries , and Stroud had started to add to his collection to occupy his time raising and caring for his birds , which he could sell for supplies and to help support his mother . According to Stroud , he used a " razor blade and nail for tools " and made his first bird cage out of wooden crates . Soon thereafter , Leavenworth ’ s administration changed , and the prison was then directed by a new warden . Impressed with the possibility of presenting Leavenworth as a progressive rehabilitation penitentiary , the new warden , Bennett , furnished Stroud with cages , chemicals , and stationery to conduct his ornithological activities . Visitors were shown Stroud 's aviary , and many purchased his canaries . Over the years , he raised nearly 300 canaries in his cells , and wrote two books , the 60 @,@ 000 @-@ word treatise Diseases of Canaries ( 1933 ) , which had been smuggled out of Leavenworth , and a later edition , Stroud 's Digest on the Diseases of Birds ( 1943 ) , with updated , specific information . He made several important contributions to avian pathology , most notably a cure for the hemorrhagic septicemia family of diseases . He gained respect and also some level of sympathy in the bird @-@ loving field . 
 Stroud ’ s activities created problems for the prison management . According to regulations , each letter sent or received at the prison had to be read , copied , and approved . Stroud was so involved in his business that this alone required a full @-@ time prison secretary . Additionally , most of the time , his birds were permitted to fly freely within his cells , and because of the great number of birds he kept , his cell was filthy . 
 In 1931 , an attempt to force Stroud to discontinue his business and get rid of his birds failed after Stroud and one of his mail correspondents , a bird researcher from Indiana named Della Mae Jones , made his story known to newspapers and magazines . A massive letter campaign and a 50 @,@ 000 @-@ signature petition sent to President Herbert Hoover resulted in Stroud being permitted to keep his birds , and despite prison overcrowding , he was even given a second cell to house them . However , his letter @-@ writing privileges were greatly curtailed . Jones and Stroud grew so close that she moved to Kansas in 1931 , and started a business with him , selling his avian medicines . 
 Prison officials , fed up with Stroud 's activities and their attendant publicity , intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth . Stroud , however , discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas . To this end , he married Jones by proxy , which infuriated the prison 's administrators , who would not allow him to correspond with his wife . Prison officials were not the only ones perturbed with Stroud 's marriage ; his mother was also incensed . They had a close relationship , but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones , believing women were nothing but trouble for her son . Whereas previously she had been a strong advocate for her son , helping him with legal battles , she now argued against his application for parole , and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system . She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937 . 
 In 1933 , Stroud advertised in a publication that he had not received any royalties from the sales of Diseases of Canaries . In retaliation , the publisher complained to the warden , and , as a result , proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz , where he would not be permitted to keep his birds . In the end , however , Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary @-@ selling business at Leavenworth . Stroud avoided trouble for several more years , until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home @-@ made still to distill alcohol . Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out . 
 = = Alcatraz = = 
 On December 19 , 1942 , Stroud was transferred to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary , and became inmate # 594 . He reportedly was not informed in advance that he was to leave Leavenworth and his beloved birds , and was given just 10 minutes ' notice of his departure ; his birds and equipment were sent to his brother as Alcatraz 's strict policies meant that he was unable to continue his avocation . He spent six years in segregation and another 11 confined to the hospital wing there . In 1943 , he was assessed by psychiatrist Romney M. Ritchey , who diagnosed him as a psychopath , but with an I.Q. of 134 ( although his initial report in 1942 based on Leavenworth states that he had an I.Q. of 116 ) . While there , he wrote two manuscripts : Bobbie , an autobiography , and Looking Outward : A History of the U.S. Prison System from Colonial Times to the Formation of the Bureau of Prisons . A judge ruled that Stroud had the right to write and keep such manuscripts , but upheld the warden ’ s decision to ban their publication . After Stroud 's death , the transcripts were delivered to his lawyer , Richard English . 
 Rumors of Stroud 's homosexuality were noted at Alcatraz . According to Donald Hurley , whose father was a guard at Alcatraz , " Whenever Stroud was around anyone , which was seldom , he was watched very closely , as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies . " In an interview with Hurley for his book , a former inmate heard Stroud was always in ' dog block ' ( solitary confinement ) or later in the hospital because he was a ' wolf ' ( aggressive homosexual ) who had a bad temper . " In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster , who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz . Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on one of the problems that prevented parole , that he was an " admitted homosexual . " Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying , " Let 's face it , I am 73 years old . Does that answer your question about whether I would be a dangerous homosexual ? " 
 During his 17 @-@ year term at Alcatraz , Stroud was allowed access to the prison library , and began studying law . Occasionally , he was permitted to play chess with one of the guards . Stroud began petitioning the government that his long prison term amounted to cruel and unusual punishment . In 1959 , with his health failing , Stroud was transferred to the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield , Missouri , where he stayed until his death in 1963 . However , his attempts to be released were unsuccessful . 
 On November 21 , 1963 , Robert Stroud died at the Springfield Medical Center at the age of 73 , having been incarcerated for the last 54 years of his life , of which 42 were spent in solitary confinement . He had been studying French near the end of his life . Stroud is buried in Metropolis , Illinois ( Massac County ) . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Stroud is considered to be one of the most notorious criminals in American history . Robert Niemi states that Stroud had a " superior intellect , " and became a " first @-@ rate ornithologist and author , " but was an " extremely dangerous and menacing psychopath , disliked and distrusted by his jailers and fellow inmates . " However , by his last years , he was seen more favorably , and Judge Becker considered Stroud to be modest , no longer a danger to society , with a genuine love for birds . Given his level of notoriety , the crimes he committed were unremarkable , especially as the assaults he committed had a clear cause . Carl <unk> considers Stroud to have been a " brilliant self @-@ taught expert on birds , and possibly the best @-@ known example of self @-@ improvement and rehabilitation in the U.S. prison . " 
 Because of Stroud 's contributions to the field of ornithology , he gained a large following of thousands of bird breeders , and poultry raisers who demanded his release , and for many years a " Committee to Release Robert F. Stroud " campaigned to have Stroud released from prison . However , because Stroud had killed a federal officer , his punishment in solitary confinement remained intact . In 1963 , Richard M. English , a young lawyer who had campaigned for John F. Kennedy in California , took to the cause of securing Stroud 's release . He met with former President Harry S. Truman to enlist support , but Truman declined . He also met with senior Kennedy @-@ administration officials who were studying the subject . English took the last photo of Stroud , in which he is shown with a green visor . The warden of the prison attempted to have English prosecuted for bringing something into the prison he did not take out : unexposed film . The authorities declined to take any action . Upon Stroud 's death , his personal property , including original manuscripts , was delivered to English , as his last legal representative , who later turned over some of the possessions to the Audubon Society . 
 Stroud became the subject of a 1955 book by Thomas E. Gaddis , Birdman of Alcatraz . Gaddis , who strongly advocated rehabilitation in the prisons , portrayed Stroud in favorable light . This was adapted by Guy Trosper for the 1962 film of the same name , directed by John Frankenheimer . It starred Burt Lancaster as Stroud , Karl Malden as a fictionalized and renamed warden , and Thelma Ritter as Stroud 's mother . Both the book and the film were highly fictionalized , with former inmates stating that Stroud was far more sinister and unpleasant than the character depicted in them . Stroud was never allowed to see the film . Art Carney played Stroud in the 1980 TV movie Alcatraz : The Whole Shocking Story , and Dennis Farina played Stroud in the 1987 TV movie Six Against the Rock , a dramatization of the Battle of Alcatraz of 1946 . 
 In music , Stroud has been the subject of the instrumental " Birdman of Alcatraz " from Rick Wakeman 's Criminal Record ( 1977 ) , a concept album about criminality , and the song " The Birdman " by Our Lady Peace is also about him . Several video games such as <unk> and Team Fortress 2 pay homage to him . 
 = Monte Ne = 
 Monte Ne is an area in the Ozark hills of the White River valley east of Rogers on the edge of Beaver Lake in the U.S. state of Arkansas . From 1901 until the mid @-@ 1930s the area was a health resort and ambitious planned community . It was owned and operated by William Hope Harvey , a financial theorist and one @-@ time U.S. Presidential nominee . Two of its hotels , " Missouri Row " and " Oklahoma Row " , were the largest log buildings in the world . Oklahoma Row 's " tower section " is one of the earliest examples of a multi @-@ story concrete structure . The tower is the only structure of Monte Ne still standing that can be seen at normal lake levels . Monte Ne introduced the first indoor swimming pool in Arkansas , and was also the site of the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas . 
 The Monte Ne resort was not a financial success , due in part to Harvey 's management style . All ventures associated with Harvey 's original Monte Ne concept either were never completed or experienced bankruptcy , and shortly after his death the property was sold off in lots . The remainder of the resort and town was almost completely submerged after Beaver Lake was created in 1964 . All that remains today are foundations and one severely vandalized structure . The area on the edge of Beaver Lake that is still referred to as Monte Ne , is owned and managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and serves mainly as a boat ramp . 
 = = Before Harvey = = 
 The area that would become Monte Ne was known to have had two establishments often considered essential to a pioneer settlement , a grist mill and a distillery . It is unknown when the distillery was built . It was owned in the 1830s by Abe <unk> and his brother @-@ in @-@ law . They also operated a small store . The distillery 's output each day was given as thirty gallons by the Federal whiskey <unk> who resided in the area . The grist mill was built in 1856 , and was owned by J.R. Pettigrew . It would later be owned by James Wyeth and Amelia Crowder Blake , the parents of Betty Blake , who is often referred to as the " Leading Lady " of Rogers , Arkansas , and who would also go on to marry entertainer Will Rogers . In 1875 the post office in the area changed its name from Mountain Springs to Pettigrew 's Mill . The Blakes ' owned the mill till 1882 , when Mr. Blake died . The Mill was later operated by David <unk> from 1889 to 1895 . He sold his interest in the mill to a retired Congregational minister <unk> Bailey . Bailey would later become postmaster . He petitioned the Post Office Department to change the name of the office to <unk> in honor of a well @-@ known vineyard that belonged to his neighbor , Carl A. <unk> . The letter was written in longhand , and the o and l were spaced to close together . As a result , the clerk misread the name as " Vinda " , which is how it was recorded . The area 's name was later changed to Silver Springs . Bailey would sell 325 acres of land and a cabin to Harvey . 
 = = Coin Harvey = = 
 Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William " Coin " Hope Harvey , a well @-@ known businessman , politician , lecturer and author during the 1890s . Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado , Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey 's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver . His most popular pamphlet , entitled Coin 's Financial School , was published in 1893 . Sales were buoyed by Harvey 's involvement in the presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan , and it sold two million copies . Though Bryan lost his bid for President , Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign . However , as a result of an argument before the campaign , he resigned . 
 During the 1900 campaign Harvey had visited Northwest Arkansas , an area known for its unique pristine natural beauty . In October 1900 , he purchased 320 acres ( 130 ha ) of land in Silver Springs , Arkansas ( close to present day Rogers ) , from Reverend Bailey . From that time on he lived in Arkansas , and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people . Leaving his family behind in Chicago , Harvey moved into Rev. Bailey 's run @-@ down log house . Harvey 's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family , and Harvey 's other son Hal , wife Anna , and sister Annette joined them later . The house burned down a few months after they took up residence , and all of the family 's possessions , including Harvey 's large library , were lost . Harvey carried no insurance on the house , and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago and returned to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits . 
 Harvey 's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area , because it was often confused with Siloam Springs , Arkansas . Harvey chose the name Monte Ne , which supposedly combined the Spanish and Omaha Indian words for mountain water , because it " fit the tongue attractively . " Harvey was familiar with European health spas , and wanted to turn Monte Ne into a " watering hole " in the Ozarks . He first commissioned the dredging of a canal , and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring , which created Big Spring Lake . The Creek was then channeled to form what Harvey referred to as " the lagoon . " Limestone retaining walls were built along the banks of the creeks and the lake , and along boardwalks and park areas . Monte Ne quickly became a popular spot for pleasure boating , picnics , and other outdoor activities . Many people noted how clear the water was . The Rogers Democrat said that it looked " like pure alcohol . " 
 = = Hotel rows = = 
 In December 1900 , with US $ 52 @,@ 000 of individual investor 's money and $ 48 @,@ 000 of his own , Harvey formed the Monte Ne Investment Company , which held the deeds to all of the land . The first hotel completed was the Hotel Monte Ne in April 1901 , which opened in May . It was three stories high and had two wings 300 feet ( 91 m ) long . Each room had a doorway to the outside and the hotel was surrounded with wide porches . 
 In April 1904 , Harvey organized the Monte Ne Club House Hotel and Cottage Company with capital stock of $ 250 @,@ 000 . A.O. Clarke from St. Louis , Missouri served as architect and superintendent of the company . Harvey wanted to build five large hotels : a three @-@ story main building called the Club House Hotel and four 300 to 450 foot ( 91 to 137 m ) long " cottage rows " , each to be named for a state bordering on Arkansas . Stock holders in the company received stock certificates that listed privileges such as transportation on the Monte Ne Railroad with 150 lb ( 68 kg ) of baggage and a 25 % discount for the stockholder and his family at the Hotel Monte Ne . Missouri Row , begun in August , 1904 , was the first hotel constructed . This Clarke @-@ designed building was 46 feet ( 14 m ) wide and 305 feet ( 93 m ) long and built of 8 @,@ 000 logs with a concrete floor and red tile roof . Fourteen thousand cubic feet ( 396 m ³ ) of concrete were used . The tiles were shipped from Chicago . The center and two ends of the hotel rose to two stories , the remainder being a single story . Hotel Monte Ne , Missouri Row both featured porches 575 feet ( 175 m ) long . The hotel had forty 16 ft ² ( 1 @.@ 5 m ² ) rooms , each with a fireplace . Harvey employed area carpenters and stonemasons to build Missouri Row . In April 1905 , to save time and money , the work schedule was changed from 9 to 10 hours per day and some wages were cut . Many workers went on strike and , when their demands were not met , they quit . The men formed a union , and although Harvey thought of himself as a friend to the working man , he viewed unions as another kind of monopoly or trust . The strike delayed construction , but by the end of May 1905 , a full workforce was in place . In July , carpet , washstands and furniture , including iron @-@ and @-@ brass bedsteads , were installed in the rooms . <unk> and shells from the Pea Ridge battlefield were sunk into the concrete porch on either side of the main entrance . The hotel opened in September 1905 with room rates of $ 1 a day and $ 6 a week . 
 In February 1907 , with nearly 300 new stockholders , Harvey began construction on his next hotel , Oklahoma Row , also designed by A. O. Clarke . It was built to the west of Missouri Row with a wide lawn . It had a similar log , concrete stone , and tile construction . The dining room was on the north end . Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces , as did the dining room and center hall . Every room featured electric lights , sewerage , and running spring water . The hotel also boasted a three @-@ story concrete tower , one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country . Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey 's funds . Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row , but due to his lack of funds when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event , as there had been when Missouri Row was finished . 
 = = = Theme song = = = 
 In 1901 , Harvey Commissioned a theme song for Monte Ne . " Beautiful Monte Ne " was written by a Rogers local , Edward Wolfe , and copyrighted by Harvey in 1906 .

 = = Railroad = = 
 Harvey needed a way to get people to Monte Ne . In 1900 , there were few adequate roads and automobiles were not yet practical . The natural solution seemed to be to build a railroad from Lowell , Arkansas to Monte Ne . The Arkansas Railroad Commission granted a charter on April 26 , 1902 , and the Monte Ne Railway Company was incorporated in May 1902 , with a capital stock of $ 250 @,@ 000 . Besides Harvey , the company included : Carl A. Starck , P.G. Davidson , A.L. Williams , B.R. Davidson , J.H. McIlroy , J.W. Kimmons , F.F. Freeman , J.F. Felker , Robert H. <unk> and Thomas W. Harvey ( Coin 's brother ) . Another of Harvey 's brothers , who was a banker at Huntington , West Virginia , furnished $ 25 @,@ 000 . Of the 250 shares in the company , 240 were registered in Harvey 's name . The five @-@ mile ( 8 km ) private railroad spur started at the Lowell transfer station . Fourteen thousand oak railway ties were laid running through Cross Hollows , south of Rogers , where two ravines met . It then passed through <unk> , terminating above Big Spring Lake at a Log Cabin depot with open @-@ air waiting rooms . Harvey leased an engine , tender , and a passenger coach from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad . The railway opened on June 19 , 1902 . Harvey imported a 50 foot ( 15 m ) gondola from Venice , Italy in July 1901 to meet guests arriving by rail and carry them to the resort . 
 The gondola was a very popular attraction , and Harvey often promoted Monte Ne as : " the only place in America where the gondola meets the train . " 
 The little railroad went broke a few years later . At about this time , the Arkansas , Oklahoma & Western Railroad ( AO & W ) was forming . The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs , over a distance of approximately 30 miles ( 43 km ) . It was opened for traffic New Year 's Day 1908 , connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City , Pittsburgh and Gulf ( P & G ) at Siloam Springs . AO & W planned to build eastward to Eureka Springs . On December 1 , 1909 the AO & W purchased the Monte Ne railroad . To connect the AO & W and the Monte Ne , a track would have to be laid from Hazelwood , Arkansas on the AO & W to Lowell ; the Frisco line was in the way and they would not allow a connection . AO & W instead built an expensive underpass of the Frisco . The construction of the underpass enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its outbound freight business to the AO & W rather than competitor Frisco . So the line enjoyed a brief but substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company located at <unk> . The underpass still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad . 
 The AO & W went bankrupt a few years later and was bought by another startup railroad , the Kansas City & Memphis Railroad ( KC & M ) in early 1911 . It would build from Cave Springs , Arkansas a few miles west of Rogers , through Fayetteville , Arkansas and towards Memphis , Tennessee . In 1912 the Ozark Land and Lumber Company began construction of a 5 @-@ mile extension east of Monte Ne from the White River to the Piney community and leased the line to the KC & M. The White River bridge consisted of 780 feet of trestle and 2 , 152 foot steel spans making it the longest railroad bridge in Benton County . This extension was used to haul out forestry products . The KC & M entered receivership in 1914 , and in September of that year passenger service to Monte Ne ended . When World War I began , many railroads were seized by the United States government . The KC & M was not seized , and due to unfavorable rulings by the United States Railroad Administration and Arkansas Railroad Commission saw much of its revenue evaporate . In January 1918 Roscoe Hobbs , one of the court @-@ appointed receivers of the KC & M , went to Washington , D.C. to provide testimony to the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the effects of these decisions on small railroads . As part of that testimony Hobbs reported 215 cars from the Rogers White Lime Company and 216 cars of pit props and railroad ties being hauled on the Monte Ne portion of the railway in 1917 . Hobbs was unsuccessful in having the decisions reversed and most portions of the KC & M were abandoned by October 1918 . The Monte Ne portion was used until 1919 . The White River bridge survived longer and was used for horse and foot traffic before becoming unsafe . The steel spans were scrapped during World War II . 
 = = Business = = 
 In August 1901 , Harvey 's son Hal and brother @-@ in @-@ law Ernest Halliday opened a large bathhouse on Silver Springs Creek , across the lagoon from Hotel Monte Ne . The indoor pool was the first in Arkansas . It was 25 by 50 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 by 15 m ) and 7 feet ( 2 m ) deep and included springboards and slides . Water from the spring flowed into the swimming pool , half of which was sectioned off and featured heated water piped in from a wood @-@ fired boiler . The bathhouse also had a two @-@ lane bowling alley . The pool continued to be a popular attraction throughout the life of Monte Ne until the opening of an outdoor pool in <unk> , Arkansas in 1923 . 
 In April , Harvey began seeking industries to move to Monte Ne , but few actually did . Monte Ne 's small downtown area had at one time a general store , a livery stable a gristmill , and a post office . The General store also serve as a host for school plays and as well as a Masonic Lodge . The post office erroneously changed the town 's name to Vinda ( a misreading of a local wine ranch called <unk> ) , but later formally changed it to Monte Ne . 
 Harvey issued his own money , or scrip , which was accepted and used as cash in and around Monte Ne . <unk> was a way of financing his mercantile without requiring operating capital . Harvey would purchase items with the scrip and promised to redeem it within 30 days . If the item did not sell , the scrip had no value . Also in downtown was the Bank of Monte Ne . It was organized by Harvey in 1905 and the building was designed , like many buildings in Monte Ne , by A. O. Clarke . The two @-@ story , 50 by 70 ft ( 15 by 21 m ) building ( usually referred to as the " Bank Block " ) included the bank and a store room on the main floor , as well as a lodge room and offices on the second floor . The building was across the street from the post office . The Interstate Bankers ' Summer Club held their 1906 meeting there and the local Odd Fellows lodge were among the groups who used the upstairs offices . Harvey sold stock in the bank for $ 15 a share . The bank lasted until 1914 . Depositors and lenders were paid off and any other funds were transferred to a bank in Rogers . 
 To help attract tourists , Harvey often brought in musicians and hosted dances and other events to give Monte Ne a constant festive atmosphere . He used the Monte Ne Herald , run by his son Tom , to promote these events . The newspaper only lasted until 1905 , probably due to financial troubles and Harvey 's publication of personal attacks . There were sporting events in Monte Ne such as tennis , croquet , and fox hunting . Monte Ne also had the first golf course , which was built sometime before 1909 . Harvey 's difficult @-@ to @-@ please nature often ended up driving away more people than it attracted . Harvey had a lights @-@ out at 10 p.m. policy , and would cut the main electricity to the town if the policy was disobeyed , prompting disgruntled guests to leave prematurely . He was also criticized for holding events on Sunday and banning children and people who were ill from the resort . 
 = = Roads = = 
 After the Monte Ne Railroad failed , Harvey needed to find other ways for people to get to his resort . He realized the coming importance of the automobile and in 1911 he campaigned for a project he called " The Great White Way " , a turnpike between Monte Ne and Muskogee , Oklahoma . Harvey Requested that a " Good Roads " meeting be held by the Commercial Club of Rogers , however they did not feel that it was their meeting because while fairly well attended hardly any Rogers businessmen were present . Harvey assessed the project would cost Rogers $ 5 @,@ 000 without their permission or consent , and this estimate was far less than what engineers advising the Rogers businessmen believed the cost would be . Ultimately the " Great White Way " project failed , and Harvey blamed the community of Rogers for lack of support . 
 In 1913 he spearhead the founding of The Ozark Trails Association ( OTA ) to promote the building and education of quality highway design , but not actually building or funding them . At first , he was only interested in bringing people to Monte Ne , he stated : " My Personal interest in the Ozark Trails is that they all lead to Monte Ne " However , he seems to have taken on a more egalitarian opinion of the Ozark Trails as time went on because he later said : " My inclination runs toward doing something of a progressive nature that will promote the collective good , and I have now concentrated all that inclination on carrying out a system of roads known as the Ozark Trails . " The Ozark Trails Association became Harvey 's most successful endeavor . Interest in the project spread and membership swelled to 7 @,@ 000 delegates from states as far away as New Mexico . The group built large obelisks , listing the names of the benefactors , along the routes and trails that it sponsored . He even ran for congress on a platform of building a national highway system , but lost to John W. Tillman who had strong support in Washington County . 
 Interest in the group began to waver noticeably when Harvey finally stepped down as president at a 1920 convention in Pittsburg , Kansas that was attended by only 200 delegates . By the mid @-@ 1920s , highways and roads had become completely government @-@ funded and there was no longer a need for local sponsorship . The group 's system of giving them historic names and those of contributors had also become confusing and inefficient because of the myriad names and disputes over different names for the same stretch of roadway . So , the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads ( BPR ) changed all the roadways ' names to uniform numbers , despite fierce protest from the OTA . The group had lost its relevance and disbanded in 1924 , but many of the roads they helped develop became part of the historic U.S. Route 66 . 
 Another group , with no affiliation but with the same name , was created in the early 1970s to promote the maintenance of recreational trails in the Ozarks .

 By 1910 , Harvey was facing serious setbacks . Harvey 's son Hal had died in 1903 and was interred in a mausoleum in Monte Ne . His other son , Tom , had left in 1908 never to return . The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either . Harvey and his wife , Anna , were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage . Harvey 's close friend William Jennings Bryan would fail to find a place for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration . Harvey 's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas would also fail . His Monte Ne was also failing . The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business . Faced with these severe dilemmas , Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand . In February 1920 , he published Common Sense , in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future in the form of a pyramid . 
 Harvey did some deep research into the history of the Ozark Mountains . He claimed that they were some of the oldest mountains in the world and definitely the oldest in the United States . They had been untouched by volcanoes and earthquakes . He believed that the mountains around Monte Ne would eventually crumble and fill the valley with silt and sediment . Figuring that the mountains were approximately 240 ft ( 73 m ) high , Harvey planned to construct a massive concrete obelisk and its capstone would remain above the debris . Archaeologist in the distant future would be able to dig down and find the monument He called the project " The Pyramid " and dedicated the rest of his life to its construction . 
 The first part of the obelisk would be 40 ft ² ( 12 m ² ) and 10 feet ( 3 m ) high . It then would reduce to 32 ft ² ( 9 m ² ) square and rise 35 feet ( 11 m ) . The next segment would be 22 ft ² ( 6 m ² ) and would rise 85 feet ( 26 m ) to become 6 ft ² ( 1 @.@ 8 m ² ) at the top . The total height would be 130 feet ( 40 m ) . In the pedestal there would be 300 ft ² ( 91 m ² ) of floor space . Harvey 's books , explaining 20th century civilization , as well as a world globe , a bible , encyclopedias , and newspapers , were to be placed inside two vaults and hermetically sealed in glass . Harvey also wanted to place in this large room : " numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life , from the size of a needle and safety pin up to a Victrola . " It was estimated that the construction would use 16 @,@ 000 bags of cement , 30 @,@ 000 ft ³ ( 850 m ³ ) of sand , 58 @,@ 000 ft ³ ( 1 @,@ 642 m ³ ) of gravel , and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement . The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts , who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years . To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid , Harvey constructed a 165 feet ( 50 m ) long retaining wall of stone and concrete . 
 He also built a roughly semi @-@ circular , terraced amphitheater at the foundation of the Pyramid which he called the " foyer " . He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project . The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923 , and construction continued off and on for the next five years whenever financing , building materials , and labor were available . Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark , the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design . Those who worked with Harvey noted that he seemed to just " work it out in his mind from day to day . " The result was a unique structure , irregular in formation , with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1 @,@ 000 . The amphitheater averaged 20 feet ( 6 m ) high and 140 feet ( 43 m ) long . In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete chairs and a concrete couch , intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to make a presentation . Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928 . 
 Following the Egyptian mania that gripped the country after the discovery of King Tut 's tomb in 1922 , Harvey 's Pyramid project sparked a lot of interest and was widely reported throughout the US . Tens of thousands of people came to Monte Ne during the 1920s to see its progress . Harvey continued to raise funds from events held at the amphitheater , such as conventions . 
 Harvey moved his office to his cottage next to the amphitheater , as work continued on the Pyramid . In January 1929 , Harvey along with Lowell and H.L. Hardin of Kansas City incorporated the project creating The Pyramid Association . The association was to fulfill Harvey 's Pyramid plans in the event of his death . The estimated cost of the Pyramid itself was $ 75 @,@ 000 , but Harvey exhausted his funds on construction of the amphitheater . The stock market crash of 1929 ended all construction . In a last @-@ ditch effort to save the project , Harvey sent letters to wealthy men asking for funds to complete the project . In his letters he explained that civilization was dying and that only rich men , like the intended readers , could save it , if they could send money for his pyramid . Despite the fact that Harvey claimed his correspondence was " the most important letter ever written " he received no replies and the pyramid was never built . All that remains of the project is a retaining wall and the amphitheater that are under the waters of Beaver Lake most of the time .

 As Harvey 's interests shifted to the Pyramid , Monte Ne 's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled . Activities and events at Monte Ne continued , supported by locals who still visited in large numbers . Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne . The hotel went through several name changes and owners , becoming the White Hotel circa 1912 , the <unk> Inn in 1918 , the Hotel Frances in 1925 , and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel . Monte Ne 's larger hotels continued to be active after they , along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring , were foreclosed and sold at public auction . From 1927 to 1932 , Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row ( often called the Club House Hotels at this point ) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology , a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans . The hotels housed pupils — Missouri Row for boys , Oklahoma Row for girls — and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces . Evans and his family lived in the tower . The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel . In May 1932 , following a mortgage foreclosure against the school , school officials were evicted and the property was sold . 
 After he announced the building of the Pyramid , at age 69 , Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems , but continued to work tirelessly . In 1926 , blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery , and three months of recuperation . In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced . Three days later Harvey married his long @-@ time personal secretary May Leake . In 1930 , he came down with double pneumonia . He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him . 
 Harvey returned to politics after the 1929 stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression . He decided to run for the presidency . He formed The Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne . It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas . Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates , media facilities , upgraded roads , and food concessions , anticipating 10 @,@ 000 delegates . He tented the amphitheater , set up seating , and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside . Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey 's newest book The Book , which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government . In the end only 786 delegates attended , and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on . They nominated Andrae <unk> of Los Angeles for vice @-@ president . The Liberty Party ended up merging with the <unk> Party and Harvey ran for president as an independent , however he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election . Regardless , Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election , and Harvey came in 6th with only 800 votes . 
 Harvey continued to publish his newsletter , The Liberty Bell , and sell his books as his health and eyesight continued to fail . On February 11 , 1936 he died at Monte Ne due to peritonitis after an attack of intestinal influenza . The tomb made to house his son in 1903 was blasted open and Harvey 's simple cheap pine casket and that of his son were placed in a glass casket filled with copies of Harvey 's books and some of his other papers . The tomb was then resealed . A small funeral was held on February 14 , 1936 , and a small plaque bearing the names and dates of the two Harveys was posted . 
 He died with a balance of $ 138 , debt of $ 3000 and no will . The courts decided that the property that was still deeded to the Pyramid foundation belonged to his widow , May , who sold it before moving to Springfield , Missouri , never to return . She died in 1948 .

 The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers , who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment . However , King moved the business back to Rogers the next year . The building then stood idle , becoming victim to vandalism . All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti . Eventually , it was nothing more than an empty , roofless , concrete shell . 
 In 1944 , both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack . Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots . The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm . By 1956 , the building had collapsed , leaving only a small section standing . 
 Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging , although it was run and managed by several different people . In June 1946 , Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training , using the hotel facilities . Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department <unk> 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 25 km ) of the Monte Ne road . In January , six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny , charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet ( 152 m ) of pipe from the swimming pool . A resident of the area , Iris Armstrong opened up a girls ' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922 . She named it Camp <unk> after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name . The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins , named after Greek goddesses , dotted the hillside . Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers . It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies . The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building . In 1955 Dallas Barrack , a Springdale antique dealer , bought Oklahoma Row , and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries . He was to have carried " some of the finest antiques in the area " and believed that " the splendor of the old hotel only adds to their value . " 
 A Baptist church was organized at Monte Ne under the sponsorship of the Benton County Baptist Association as a result of a series of revival meetings conducted there . The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active . For a time in the summer of 1946 , the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances ( old Hotel Mont Ne ) . Although it was not as active as it once was , the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population . 
 The Monte Ne Inn , two to three miles ( 3 to 5 km ) away from where the resort was on highway 94 , opened in 1972 and is still in business . 
 In 1948 , W.T. McWhorter purchased Harvey 's former log home and office and the amphitheater nearby and turned it into a restaurant serving chicken , steak , and fish . There was also a concession stand at the amphitheater that operated until 1957 , selling drinks , candy , souvenirs , and pamphlets about Harvey . 
 In January 1957 , the Tulsa Daily World reported that 30 @,@ 000 tourists visited Monte Ne annually to see Harvey 's now deteriorating dream . The Arkansas State Historical Society held its 1960 annual meeting at Monte Ne and gathered at the amphitheater to hear Clara Kennan , a Rogers native and school teacher who had been fascinated by Monte Ne her whole life , give a talk on Harvey and his Pyramid project . Her oral history and interviews provide some of the best information on Harvey and Monte Ne . 
 = = Beaver Lake = = 
 Discussion of damming the White River for flood control began in the 1930s , and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( COE ) held hearings on building a dam in January 1946 . The new dam would create a lake 50 miles ( 80 km ) long , and one arm would extend to Monte Ne . Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the COE impounded and bought land around the White River . In July 1962 , Mary Powell sold Camp <unk> to the COE , and W.T. <unk> sold his land as well . 
 The Federal Government required that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved . This included the Harvey tomb , and it was no easy task . In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40 @-@ ton tomb and one to move it . The first attempt broke a flatbed truck . Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in . A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey 's tomb . The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey 's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth <unk> . Today , the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake . Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it , causing it to crack . 
 The COE mistakenly believed that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover the area of the large hotels , so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project . Dallas Barrack , who owned Oklahoma Row , felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth . The COE held a sealed @-@ bid auction and J.G. <unk> purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows . He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters . In order to do this , it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel . The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled . The fireplaces , as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down . Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been at the base of the amphitheater . They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel . The chairs are still located in Rogers , however they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance . The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater , because no one wanted to try to move it . 
 For years , stories circulated of a treasure being buried within the amphitheater . W.T. McWhorter was determined to find out if it was true , so he planned to dynamite the amphitheater on the day he was to transfer the deed to the COE . Spectators attended the planned explosion , but it was stopped just in time by COE attorney David Waid . 
 The dam was completed and Beaver Lake was at full height by June 1966 . For all intents and purposes , Harvey 's Monte Ne was gone . However , in times of drought , some of the structures become visible again . The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22 , 1977 , more than 27 feet ( 8 m ) below its average depth , and the amphitheater and bridges were visible for the first time in more than 10 years . Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers , boaters , and fishermen . The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished . 
 In 2006 , the waters of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984 , just above 1 @,@ 100 feet ( 335 m ) . This generated a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted to the edge of the lake to explore the remains . The upper part of the amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake . 
 The flooded Monte Ne has become a site of interest for scuba divers who dive by the amphitheater to get a look at the submerged structure . The water is moderately clear and temperatures comfortable . 
 = = Remains = = 
 A log portion of the original Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits on the east side of Highway 94 in Monte Ne . It is used for storage . The three @-@ story concrete @-@ and @-@ stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake . This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite . Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering . Despite this what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism . It is covered with spray paint and graffiti as well as being cracked and full of debris . In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney . Because of this incident and the general state of the remains , the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower . 
 All that is left of Missouri Row is a four @-@ sided concrete fireplace surrounded by pieces of foundation , a few sets of stairs , metal plumbing , and a retaining wall . East of that , surrounding what is now the Monte Ne boat launch , are remnants of limestone structures . Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne ; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls . The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater . Occasionally , when water levels drop in summer , they can be seen . 
 A few of the roads surrounding the area that was Monte Ne on the edge of Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there . Highway 94 , which once led to Monte Ne , is also called Monte Ne Road . Country Road 1195 which runs along the lake , is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood . Similarly Canal Street is nearby , named for the waterways that Harvey 's gondolas once traveled . 
 = Eric Hosmer = 
 Eric John Hosmer ( born October 24 , 1989 ) is an American professional baseball first baseman for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He has played for the Royals since making his MLB debut on May 6 , 2011 . 
 A highly touted prospect coming out of American Heritage High School in Florida , Hosmer was described as a " left @-@ handed hitter with raw power " by scouts . He was drafted as the third overall pick in the 2008 MLB draft where he received a $ 6 million signing bonus . He advanced relatively quickly in minor league baseball , before debuting in MLB . He finished third in the Rookie of the Year ballot for the 2011 season after hitting .293 with 19 home runs in 128 games . He was the MVP of the 2016 MLB All @-@ Star game . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hosmer 's father , Mike , is a retired firefighter , and his mother , Ileana , is a nurse . His mother was born in Cuba and came to the United States at the age of seven with her family to escape Fidel Castro 's regime , growing up in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . His parents met in 1979 when Mike was assigned to duty at Coral Gables Hospital in Coral Gables , Florida , where Illeana worked . They married four years later . Their first son Mike Jr. was born in 1985 , and Eric was born four years later in Miami . 
 Growing up in Cooper City , Hosmer credited his family for helping him succeed as a baseball player . He began playing baseball at an early age , using a Tony Gwynn <unk> hitter to take practice swings . His father volunteered to do 48 @-@ hour shifts in a firehouse in Liberty City , a tough neighborhood in Miami , to focus on his son 's baseball games which he usually coached . The <unk> traveled all over the state , and as far as Cooperstown , New York , home of the Baseball Hall of Fame , to play in baseball tournaments . At home , Hosmer watched Florida Marlins games to study the hitting techniques of the team players in order to improve his skills . His father helped him with batting practice after finishing long shifts at work , while his mother helped with his homework and taped every baseball game to evaluate Hosmer 's baseball ability and further hone his skills . By the time Hosmer reached high school , he worked out " close to seven hours a day " and mainly ate protein , which helped form his muscular build . Hosmer 's family hired <unk> Marrero , a highly regarded hitting instructor and the father of Washington Nationals first baseman Chris Marrero , to help with their son 's skills . His brother Mike also played baseball , receiving a scholarship to Florida State University . He was never interested in becoming a professional baseball player , however , and currently is a stock broker in Miami . 
 = = High school career = = 
 By the time Hosmer was a teenager , he was a member of several Little League baseball squads that won a couple of state championships . He attended American Heritage School in Plantation , Florida . His parents selected American Heritage because of their rich baseball program , which was considered to be one of the best in the United States , despite the expensive tuition . By Hosmer 's sophomore year , he grew eight inches in size , becoming a powerful prep prospect . In his senior year , Hosmer hit <unk> with 11 home runs , as the team was in the top 10 in USA Today 's Super 25 rankings for most of the year and won a state championship . He attracted twenty or more MLB and college scouts who evaluated Hosmer 's every move . Several of his amateur home runs had popularity in YouTube , which caught the attention of sports agent Scott Boras . He received many achievements while in high school including being named as Florida 's Baseball Player of the Year twice by the Miami Herald , a member of the Rawlings High School Gold Glove team , and the American Amateur Baseball Congress Connie Mack MVP award . Hosmer was offered a baseball scholarship to Arizona State University . Hosmer planned to attend Arizona State if negotiations with an MLB team did not go through . 
 He was named as one of the top five prep baseball players in the country by several scouting agencies by the time he graduated in 2008 , including number two by Rivals.com and third by both RISE Magazine and Sports Illustrated . As " one of high school baseball top power hitters " by scouts , and a consensus top 10 pick , Hosmer was chosen by the Royals in the first round ( third overall selection ) of the 2008 MLB draft . Hosmer remained unsigned for most of the summer while the Royals general manager Dayton Moore and Boras , operating as Hosmer 's agent , negotiated a deal . During negotiations , Hosmer helped lead his team based in Cincinnati , to a second @-@ place finish at the American Amateur Baseball Congress Connie Mack World Series . Both sides agreed to a contract ten minutes before the signing dateline for drafted players on August 15 , 2008 . He received a six million dollar signing bonus , the largest sum given to a draft pick in Royals history . 
 = = Minor leagues = = 
 Soon after signing his contract , the Royals assigned Hosmer , # 30 at the time , to the Idaho Falls Chukars of the rookie level Pioneer League in minor league baseball . Before reporting to the Chukars , Royals general manager Moore told reporters that Hosmer would not be " rushed " to reach the Majors , stating that he needs to advance though the Minor League hierarchy in his " own natural pace " . He played a handful of games with the Chukars before a contract dispute with another Boras client , Pittsburgh Pirates second overall pick Pedro Alvarez delayed Hosmer from playing with the team . Boras had claimed that Alvarez signed his contract after the August 15 deadline had passed , thus won 't report to the Pirates . The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance stating that Hosmer 's contract was also signed past the deadline and that Major League Baseball extended the August 15 deadline without the association 's permission . Both sides settled the claim a month later , allowing Hosmer and Alvarez to join their respective teams . Hosmer never disputed his original contract . Instead of heading back to the Chukars , Hosmer was sent to the Arizona Fall League to train . 
 In Hosmer 's first full season in minor league ball , Hosmer was sent to the Burlington Bees in the Midwest League , the Royals ' other rookie league affiliate . At Burlington , Hosmer struggled at the plate . By June 1 , he hit only one home run in 31 games while leading the team in strikeouts . He missed some time with a left pinkie finger injury . At the end of the season , Hosmer hit .241 with six home runs . He later mentioned the 2009 season as " a tough year " . In 2010 , Hosmer was named the seventh best first base prospect by Scout.com. He started the season with the Royals ' Class A @-@ Advanced affiliate , the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina <unk> where his struggles continued . He was soon diagnosed with astigmatism , an eye condition and had laser surgery to correct the problem . Hosmer returned to the Blue Rocks a week later and his hitting significantly improved . By May 23 he was hitting .388 with a <unk> slugging percentage . He played in the 2010 All @-@ Star Futures Game where he had four hits and two RBI in a 9 @-@ 1 victory . For his effort , Hosmer was promoted to the Northwest Arkansas Naturals of the Class AA Texas League on July 17 , where in his first at @-@ bat he hit a home run . During the playoffs Hosmer hit six home runs , which was individually , the second highest total in a single Texas League playoff series . The team went on to win the Texas League championship . 
 The Royals ' farm system was ranked number one in baseball entering the 2011 season , led by Hosmer and another top prospect , third baseman Mike Moustakas . Most baseball critics agreed that the Royals , a team that was known for mediocrity the past two decades , would be a contender within a couple of years , and they had nine prospects in Baseball America 's top 100 , a record for the publication . Hosmer was ranked as the best first baseman prospect in Major League Baseball prior to the 2011 season . He was also rated the eighth best overall prospect by Baseball America , and the top Royals prospect overall . So much hype was placed on the Royals that general manager Dayton Moore traded the team 's best player , Cy Young Award winner Zack Greinke to the Milwaukee Brewers for four top prospects , to focus on the team 's future . Hosmer began the season with the Royals Class AAA affiliate , the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) . When the Royals purchased Hosmer 's contract on May 5 , 2011 , he was leading the minor leagues with a .439 batting average and the PCL with 43 hits and a .525 on @-@ base percentage .

 HMS Lion was a battlecruiser of the Royal Navy , the lead ship of her class , which were nicknamed the " Splendid Cats " . They were significant improvements over their predecessors of the Indefatigable class in terms of speed , armament and armour . The Lion @-@ class ships were 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) faster , exchanged the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns of the older ships for the same number of 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 343 mm ) guns , and had a waterline belt 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick versus the 6 inches ( 152 mm ) of the Indefatigables . This was in response to the first German battlecruisers , the Moltke class , which were very much larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers , the Invincible class . 
 Lion served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet 's battlecruisers throughout World War I , except when she was being refitted or under repair . She sank the German light cruiser Cöln during the Battle of Heligoland Bight and served as Vice Admiral Beatty 's flagship at the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland . She was so badly damaged at the first of these battles that she had to be towed back to port by the battlecruiser Indomitable and was under repair for more than two months . During the Battle of Jutland she suffered a serious propellant fire that could have destroyed the ship had it not been for the bravery of Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey , the turret commander , who posthumously received the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded . The fire destroyed one gun turret which had to be removed for rebuilding while she was under repair for several months . She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea , although she did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917 . She was put into reserve in 1920 and sold for scrap in 1924 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Lion @-@ class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the Moltke class as the German ships were to the Invincible class . The increase in speed , armour and gun size forced a 65 % increase in size over the Indefatigable class and made them the largest warships in the world . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Lion was significantly larger than her predecessors of the Indefatigable class . She had an overall length of 700 feet ( 210 m ) , a beam of 88 feet 6 @.@ 75 inches ( 27 @.@ 0 m ) , and a draught of 32 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 88 m ) at deep load . She displaced 26 @,@ 270 long tons ( 26 @,@ 692 t ) at load and 30 @,@ 820 long tons ( 31 @,@ 315 t ) at deep load . Lion was 110 feet ( 33 @.@ 5 m ) longer and displaced 8 @,@ 000 long tons ( 8 @,@ 100 t ) more than the earlier ships . She had a metacentric height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Lion had two paired sets of Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines housed in separate engine @-@ rooms . Each set consisted of high @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and a low @-@ pressure turbine driving an inner shaft . A cruising stage was built into the casing of each high @-@ pressure ahead turbine . Her three @-@ bladed propellers were 12 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 73 m ) in diameter on the inner shafts while the outer propellers were 11 feet 8 inches ( 3 @.@ 56 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by 42 Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers in seven boiler rooms . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 70 @,@ 000 shp ( 52 @,@ 199 kW ) , but achieved more than 76 @,@ 000 shp ( 56 @,@ 673 kW ) during her trials , although she did not exceed her designed speed of 28 knots ( 32 mph ; 52 km / h ) . 
 She carried 3 @,@ 500 long tons ( 3 @,@ 600 t ) of coal , and an additional 1 @,@ 135 long tons ( 1 @,@ 153 t ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 5 @,@ 610 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 390 km ; 6 @,@ 460 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Lion mounted eight BL 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk V guns in four twin hydraulically powered BII turrets , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' Q ' and ' X ' from front to rear . Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4 @-@ inch Mark VII guns , most of which were mounted in casemates . The two guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were given gun shields during 1913 – 14 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action . The starboard forward group of four @-@ inch guns was removed after April 1917 . 
 She was built without anti @-@ aircraft guns , but a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss gun on a HA Mark Ic mounting was fitted from October 1914 to July 1915 . This had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . It fired a 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . It had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . A single QF 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) AA gun on a high @-@ angle Mark II mount was added in January 1915 , and another in the following July . These had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . The gun fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of 12 – 14 rounds per minute . It had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . Two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the beam ; fourteen torpedoes were carried . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The armour protection given to the Lions was heavier than that of the Indefatigables ; their waterline belt of Krupp armour measured 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick amidships in contrast to the 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) belt of their predecessors . It thinned to four inches towards the ships ' ends , but did not reach either the bow or the stern . The upper armour belt had a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) abreast the end turrets . The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by 8 to 9 inches ( 203 to 229 mm ) of armour , except for the turret roofs which used 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 64 to 83 mm ) . The thickness of the nickel steel deck ranged from 1 to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 25 to 64 mm ) . Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads 2 @.@ 5 inches thick were fitted abreast the magazine and shell rooms . After the Battle of Jutland revealed her vulnerability to plunging shellfire , one inch of additional armour , weighing approximately 100 long tons ( 102 t ) , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Lion received a fire @-@ control director between mid @-@ 1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing of the guns under the command of the light aloft tower positioned on the foremast . The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target . This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship 's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually . 
 By early 1918 Lion carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1 ½ Strutter on flying @-@ off ramps fitted on top of ' Q ' and ' X ' turrets . Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather .

 Lion was laid down at the Devonport Dockyard , Plymouth , on 29 November 1909 . She was launched on 6 August 1910 and was commissioned on 4 June 1912 . Upon commissioning , Lion became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron , which in January 1913 was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) . Rear Admiral Beatty assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913 . Lion , along with the rest of the 1st BCS , made a port visit to Brest in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June , where Lion entertained the Russian imperial family aboard while in Kronstadt .

 = = = = Battle of Heligoland Bight = = = = 
 Lion 's first action was as flagship of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914 . Beatty 's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks . They turned south at full speed at 11 : 35 am when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary . The brand @-@ new light cruiser Arethusa had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers Strassburg and Cöln when Beatty 's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12 : 37 pm . Strassburg was able to duck into the mists and evade fire , but Cöln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron . Beatty , however , was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser Ariadne directly to his front . He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range – under 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) . At 1 : 10 pm Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire . Beatty 's main body encountered the crippled Cöln shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from Lion . 
 = = = = Raid on Scarborough = = = = 
 The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail . An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful , but a larger @-@ scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards . The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid . But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey , although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well . Admiral Beatty 's 1st BCS , now reduced to four ships , including Lion , as well as Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender 's 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts , was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank . 
 Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns , but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5 : 15 am and fought an inconclusive action with them . Warrender had received a signal at 5 : 40 that the destroyer Lynx was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not . The destroyer Shark spotted the German armoured cruiser Roon and her escorts at about 7 : 00 , but could not transmit the message until 7 : 25 . Admiral Warrender received the signal , as did the battlecruiser New Zealand , but Beatty did not , despite the fact that New Zealand had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty . Warrender attempted to pass on Shark 's message to Beatty at 7 : 36 , but did not manage to make contact until 7 : 55 . Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched New Zealand to search for Roon . She was being overhauled by New Zealand when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 9 : 00 . Beatty ordered New Zealand to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough . 
 The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank ; Beatty 's ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast . This left a 15 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 28 km ) gap between them through which the German light forces began to move . At 12 : 25 , the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper . The light cruiser Southampton spotted the light cruiser Stralsund and signalled a report to Beatty . At 12 : 30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships . Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper 's ships , however , those were some 50 km ( 31 mi ) behind . The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron , which had been screening for Beatty 's ships , detached to pursue the German cruisers , but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions . This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape , and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers . The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape . 
 = = = = Battle of Dogger Bank = = = = 
 On 23 January 1915 , a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements . However , the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty . Contact was initiated at 7 : 20 am on the 24th when the British light cruiser Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser SMS Kolberg . By 7 : 35 the Germans had spotted Beatty 's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to Blücher 's maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) if they were British battlecruisers . 
 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape . The leading ships , Lion , her sister Princess Royal and Tiger , were doing 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) in pursuit and Lion opened fire at 8 : 52 at a range of 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) . The other ships followed a few minutes later but , hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility , they did not score their first hit on Blücher until 9 : 09 . The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 9 : 11 , at a range of 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) , and concentrated their fire on Lion . They first hit her at 9 : 28 on the waterline with a shell that flooded a coal bunker . Shortly afterwards a 21 @-@ centimetre ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) shell from Blücher hit the roof of ' A ' turret , denting it and knocking out the left gun for two hours . At 9 : 35 Beatty signalled ' Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy 's line ' , but Tiger 's captain , believing that Indomitable was already engaging Blücher , fired at Seydlitz , as did Lion , which left Moltke unengaged and able to continue to engage Lion without risk . However , Lion scored the first serious hit of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the working chamber of Seydlitz 's rear barbette at 9 : 40 and ignited the propellant lying exposed . The resulting fire spread into the other turret and burnt out both of them , killing 159 men . Seydlitz returned the damage at 10 : 01 with a 283 @-@ millimetre ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) shell that ricocheted off the water and pierced Lion 's five @-@ inch armour aft , although it failed to explode . However , the resulting 24 @-@ by @-@ 18 @-@ inch ( 610 by 460 mm ) hole flooded the low power switchboard compartment and eventually shorted out two of Lion 's three dynamos . Derfflinger scored the most telling hits on Lion at 10 : 18 when two 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 in ) shells struck her port side below the waterline . The shock was so great that her captain , Ernle Chatfield , thought that she had been torpedoed . One shell pierced the five @-@ inch armour forward and burst in a wing compartment behind the armour . It drove in a 30 @-@ by @-@ 24 @-@ inch ( 760 by 610 mm ) piece of armour and flooded a number of compartments adjacent to the torpedo flat and the torpedo body room . One splinter put a hole in the exhaust pipe of the capstan engine which eventually contaminated the auxiliary condenser with salt water . The other shell hit further aft and burst on the six @-@ inch portion of the waterline belt . It drove in two armour plates about 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) and flooded some of the lower coal bunkers . At 10 : 41 a 283 mm shell burst against the eight @-@ inch armour of ' A ' barbette , but only started a small fire in the ' A ' turret lobby that was quickly put out , although the magazine was partially flooded when a false report was received that it was on fire as well . Soon afterwards Lion was hit by a number of shells in quick succession , but only one of these was serious . A shell burst on the nine @-@ inch armour belt abreast the engine room and drove a 16 @-@ by @-@ 5 @.@ 75 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 88 by 1 @.@ 75 m ) armour plate about two feet inboard and ruptured the port engine 's feedwater tank . By 10 : 52 Lion had been hit fourteen times and had taken aboard some 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) of water which gave her a list of 10 ° to port and reduced her speed . Shortly afterwards her port engine broke down and her speed dropped to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . 
 In the meantime Blücher had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers ; her speed had dropped to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) and her steering gear had been jammed . Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her at 10 : 48 am . Six minutes later Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90 ° turn to port to avoid the submarine , although he failed to hoist the ' Submarine Warning ' flag because most of Lion 's signal halyards had been shot away . Almost immediately afterwards Lion lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power . He ordered ' Course Northeast ' at 11 : 02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper . He also hoisted ' Attack the rear of the enemy ' on the other halyard although there was no connection between the two signals . This caused Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Gordon Moore , temporarily commanding in New Zealand , to think that the signals meant to attack Blücher , which was about 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) to the northeast , so they turned away from the pursuit of Hipper 's main body and engaged Blücher . Beatty tried to correct the mistake , but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze . 
 Lion 's starboard engine was temporarily shut down due to contaminated feed water , but it was restarted and Lion headed home at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12 : 45 . At 2 : 30 the starboard engine began to fail and her speed was reduced to 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . Indomitable was ordered to tow Lion back to port at 3 : 00 , but it took two hours and two tries before she could start to tow Lion , and a further day @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half to reach port at speeds of 7 – 10 knots ( 13 – 19 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 – 11 @.@ 5 mph ) , even after Lion 's starboard engine was temporarily repaired . 
 Lion was temporarily repaired at Rosyth with timber and concrete before sailing to Newcastle upon Tyne to be repaired by Palmers ; the Admiralty did not wish it known that she was damaged badly enough to require repair at either Portsmouth or Devonport Dockyards lest that be seen as a sign of defeat . She was heeled 8 ° to starboard with four cofferdams in place between 9 February and 28 March to repair about 1 @,@ 500 square feet ( 140 m2 ) of bottom plating and replace five armour plates and their supporting structure . She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet , again as Beatty 's flagship , on 7 April . She had fired 243 rounds from her main guns , but had only made four hits : one each on Blücher and Derfflinger , and two on Seydlitz . In return she had been hit by the Germans sixteen times , but only suffered one man killed and twenty wounded . 
 = = = = Battle of Jutland = = = = 
 On 31 May 1916 Lion was the flagship of Admiral Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea . The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea . Hipper 's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3 : 20 pm , but Beatty 's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 3 : 30 . Almost immediately afterwards , at 3 : 32 , he ordered a course change to east south @-@ east to position himself astride the Germans ' line of retreat and called his ships ' crews to action stations . Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard , away from the British , to assume a south @-@ easterly course , and reduced speed to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up . With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet , then about 60 miles ( 97 km ) behind him . Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper . 
 This began what was to be called the ' Run to the South ' as Beatty changed course to steer east south @-@ east at 3 : 45 , paralleling Hipper 's course , now that the range closed to under 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . The Germans opened fire first at 3 : 48 , followed almost immediately afterward by the British . The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships , Lion and Princess Royal , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire . The German fire was accurate from the beginning , but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze . Lion , as the leading British ship , engaged Lützow , her opposite number in the German formation . Lützow 's fire was very accurate , and Lion was hit twice within three minutes of the Germans ' opening fire . By 3 : 54 the range was down to 12 @,@ 900 yards ( 11 @,@ 800 m ) , and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3 : 57 . Lion scored her first hit on Lützow two minutes later , but Lützow returned the favour at 4 : 00 when one of her 305 mm shells hit ' Q ' turret at a range of 16 @,@ 500 yards ( 15 @,@ 100 m ) . The shell penetrated the joint between the nine @-@ inch turret face plate and the 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch roof and detonated over the center of the left @-@ hand gun . It blew the front roof plate and the center face plate off the turret , killed or wounded everyone in the turret , and started a fire that smouldered , despite efforts to put it out that had been thought to have been successful . Accounts of subsequent events differ , but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the eight full propellant charges in the turret working room at 4 : 28 . They burned violently , with the flames reaching as high as the masthead , and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting . The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors , and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded if it had not already been flooded . Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey , the mortally wounded turret commander , was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded . 
 At 4 : 11 pm Lion observed the track of a torpedo fired by Moltke pass astern , but it was thought that the torpedo was fired by a U @-@ boat on the disengaged side . This was confirmed when the destroyer Landrail reported having spotted a periscope before the torpedo tracks were seen . The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 4 : 12 and 4 : 15 . This resulted in Lion hitting Lützow again at 4 : 14 , but Lützow hit Lion several times in return shortly afterwards . The smoke and haze from these hits caused Lützow to lose sight of Lion , and she switched her fire to Queen Mary at 4 : 16 . By 4 : 25 the range was down to 14 @,@ 400 yards ( 13 @,@ 200 m ) , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again . However , it was too late for Queen Mary , which was hit multiple times in quick succession about that time , and her forward magazines exploded . At 4 : 30 the light cruiser Southampton , scouting in front of Beatty 's ships , spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed . Three minutes later she sighted the topmasts of Vice @-@ Admiral Reinhard Scheer 's battleships , but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes . Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen @-@ point turn to starboard in succession . 
 Lion was hit twice more , during what came to be called the ' Run to the North ' , after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north . Beatty 's ships maintained full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range . They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet . At 5 : 40 pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers . The setting sun blinded the German gunners , and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5 : 47 . Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it , but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east , further away from the Germans . By 6 : 35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east @-@ southeast , leading the Grand Fleet , and continuing to engage Hipper 's battlecruisers to their southwest . A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180 ° starboard turn , and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze . At 6 : 44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south @-@ southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper 's ships . Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen knots and altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet . At this moment Lion 's gyrocompass failed , and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again . At 6 : 55 Scheer ordered another 180 ° turn , which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet , which had altered course itself to the south . This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer 's T , and they badly damaged his leading ships . Scheer ordered yet another 180 ° turn at 7 : 13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them . 
 This manoeuvre was successful , and the British lost sight of the Germans until 8 : 05 pm , when Castor spotted smoke bearing west @-@ northwest . Ten minutes later she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and had engaged them . Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only 8 @,@ 500 yards ( 7 @,@ 800 m ) away . Inflexible opened fire at 8 : 20 , followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty 's battlecruisers . Shortly after 8 : 30 the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve 's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them . The Germans were able to fire only a few rounds at them because of the poor visibility and turned away to the west . The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8 : 40 . After this Beatty changed course to south @-@ southeast and maintained that course , ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet , until 2 : 55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course . 
 Lion and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June 1916 where she began repairs that lasted until 19 July . The remains of ' Q ' turret were removed during this period and not replaced until later . She had been hit a total of fourteen times and suffered 99 dead and 51 wounded during the battle . She fired 326 rounds from her main guns , but can only be credited with four hits on Lützow and one on Derfflinger . She also fired seven torpedoes , four at the German battleships , two at Derfflinger and one at the light cruiser Wiesbaden without success . 
 = = = Post @-@ Jutland career = = = 
 She rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet , again as Beatty 's flagship , on 19 July 1916 without ' Q ' turret , but then had the turret replaced during a visit to Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick that lasted from 6 to 23 September . In the meantime , on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet , less the II Squadron , would be leaving harbour that night . The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th , with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines . The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers . Throughout the 19th , Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence , with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea , the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again . Scheer steered south @-@ eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship , which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt . Having realised their mistake the Germans then shaped course for home . The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark , and broke off contact . Both the British and the German fleets returned home , the British having lost two cruisers to submarine attacks and the Germans having a dreadnought damaged by torpedo . 
 Lion became the flagship of Vice @-@ Admiral W. C. Pakenham in December 1916 when he assumed command of the Battlecruiser Fleet upon Beatty 's promotion to command of the Grand Fleet . Lion had an uneventful time for the rest of the war , conducting patrols of the North Sea as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses . She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917 , but never came within range of any German forces . The 1st BCS , including Lion , sailed on 12 December in a futile attempt to intercept the German destroyers that had sunk the convoy en route to Norway earlier that day , but returned to base the following day . Lion , along with the rest of the Grand Fleet , sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway . However , the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot . When the High Seas Fleet sailed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918 to be interned , she was among the escorting ships . Along with the rest of the 1st BCS she guarded the interned ships until she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919 and then placed in reserve in March 1920 . Paid off on 30 March 1922 , despite a press campaign to have her saved for the nation as a memorial , Lion was sold for scrap on 31 January 1924 for £ 77 @,@ 000 to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = HMS Foresight ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Foresight was one of nine F @-@ class destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s . She was assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion . Unlike her sister ships , she does not appear to have been attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 – 36 during the Abyssinia Crisis , nor did she enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 . The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 . Foresight was sent to Gibraltar in mid @-@ 1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir and the Battle of Dakar . The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1941 and Arctic convoys during 1942 . Later that year , Foresight participated in Operation Pedestal , another convoy to Malta . She was torpedoed by an Italian aircraft on 12 August and had to be scuttled the next day .

 The F @-@ class ships were repeats of the preceding E @-@ class destroyers . They displaced 1 @,@ 405 long tons ( 1 @,@ 428 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 940 long tons ( 1 @,@ 970 t ) at deep load . The ships had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet 3 inches ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by three Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . The turbines developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . Foresight carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 760 km ; 7 @,@ 310 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ships ' complement was 145 officers and ratings . 
 The ships mounted four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' in sequence from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . The F class was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 38 shortly after the war began . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Between October 1940 and April 1941 , Foresight had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun . Around this time , she probably had two single 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon light AA guns installed abreast the bridge . By July 1942 , a Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted as was a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast .

 Foresight was ordered on 17 March 1933 from Cammell Laird and was laid down at their Birkenhead shipyard on 31 July , launched on 29 June 1934 , and completed on 15 May 1935 . The ship cost 245 @,@ 428 pounds , excluding government @-@ furnished equipment such as the armament . All of the F @-@ class destroyers were assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla ( DF ) of the Home Fleet , and , Foresight , unlike her sisters , did not leave home waters during the 1930s . The 6th DF was renumbered the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in April 1939 , and Foresight remained assigned to it until July 1940 . World War II began in September and she was tasked to escort the larger ships of the fleet during this time . She played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940 . 
 In late June , the 8th DF was ordered to Gibraltar where they were to form the escorts for Force H. A few days later , they participated in the attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir against the Vichy French ships stationed there . On 13 September , Force H rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French . Ten days later , they attacked Dakar where Foresight and the destroyer Inglefield sank the French submarine <unk> and Foresight sank the submarine Bévéziers on the 25th . She returned home for a refit after the battle and was damaged by a near @-@ miss during a German air raid on Liverpool on the night of 21 / 22 December . 
 On 31 January 1941 , Force H , including Foresight , departed Gibraltar to carry out Operation Picket , an unsuccessful night torpedo attack by eight of Ark Royal 's Fairey Swordfish on the Tirso Dam in Sardinia . The British ships returned to Gibraltar on 4 February and began preparing for Operation Grog , a naval bombardment of Genoa , that was successfully carried out five days later . Two months later , Foresight escorted the aircraft carrier Ark Royal as she flew off aircraft for the beleaguered island of Malta near Sicily on 3 April and again on the 27th . The following month she was part of the escort screen , with five other destroyers , for the battleship Queen Elizabeth and the light cruisers Naiad , Fiji and Gloucester which were joining the Mediterranean Fleet . This was part of Operation Tiger which included a supply convoy taking tanks to Egypt and the transfer of warships to and from the Mediterranean Fleet . Foresight and her sisters had their Two @-@ Speed Destroyer Sweep ( TSDS ) minesweeping gear rigged to allow them to serve as fast minesweepers en route to Malta . Despite this , one merchant ship was sunk by mines and another damaged . Later that month , she escorted the capital ships of Force H as they searched for the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen in the North Atlantic after the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 23 May . Foresight escorted another flying @-@ off mission to Malta on 14 June ; two days later , after German blockade runners reached France , Force H sortied into the Atlantic on a failed search for more blockade runners . Together with her sisters Faulknor , Fearless , Forester and Foxhound , Foresight helped to sink the German submarine U @-@ 138 on 18 June . The ship participated in another Malta convoy in late July , during which she had to scuttle her sister Fearless , after she had been crippled by an airborne torpedo on 23 July . Foresight continued to escort the ships of Force H until October , after she participated in another convoy to Malta , Operation Halberd . During this operation , the ship again served as a fast minesweeper , albeit more successfully than the last time she had done so . 
 The 8th DF returned to Britain after Halberd and resumed their previous task of escorting the ships of Home Fleet for the next six months . In early April 1942 , Foresight , Forester and the light cruiser Edinburgh were part of the close escort for Convoy PQ 14 , bound for Murmansk . The trio were then the close escort for Convoy QP 11 , returning from Murmansk to Iceland , when Edinburgh was torpedoed on 29 April . The two hits disabled her steering and she had to be towed by the sisters . Two days later , they were attacked by three German destroyers which badly damaged the two destroyers and put another torpedo into Edinburgh , crippling her . Foresight had eight men killed and eleven wounded during the battle . The two destroyers took off the survivors from the cruiser and Foresight scuttled the cruiser with a torpedo . Temporarily repaired at Murmansk , the sisters were part of the light cruiser Trinidad 's escort home in May . She had to be scuttled on 15 May by the destroyer Matchless after she was set on fire by a German bomber . Foresight spent June under repair . 
 Foresight was assigned to the convoy escort force for Operation Pedestal , a heavily escorted convoy to Malta in August . On the 12th , she was torpedoed by an Italian Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 bomber at 18 : 45 ; the hit broke her back , knocked out her steering , and killed one officer and three ratings . By the time the destroyer HMS Tartar arrived , Foresight could only steam at two knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) and a towline was secured by 19 : 30 . Shortly afterwards , the towing wire fouled Tartar 's starboard propeller ; another wire was rigged by 20 : 40 , but it had to be slipped when an unknown force of one cruiser and two destroyers was spotted at close range . Around 22 : 30 , Foresight was secured alongside Tartar until 05 : 15 the following day when the cables snapped . Another tow wire was rigged at 06 : 10 , but it was dropped when a submarine periscope was spotted at 09 : 30 and Tartar dropped depth charges as a precautionary measure even though her ASDIC had not detected any submarines . Around that same time several Axis shadowing aircraft were seen and Tartar 's commander thought the likelihood of attack was now too high to proceed . He took off the 181 surviving crew and scuttled Foresight with torpedoes at 09 : 55 at coordinates ( 37 ° 40 ′ N 10 ° 00 ′ W ) .

 = = Production = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 Production for the film began in February 2006 , with a budget of $ 20 – 25 million . Principal photography for the film was shot in Auckland , New Zealand within sixty days . Film editing took ten weeks , while post @-@ production , music mixing , and visual effects took a few months . The film was finished by November 2006 , because the crew " had to rush " to meet the February 16 deadline . The film was directed by Nickelodeon 's Rugrats co @-@ creator and former Hanna @-@ Barbera animator Gábor Csupó , who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat . Although Csupó had never worked on a live @-@ action film before , it " didn 't worry Granat in the least " . Csupó stated that he was interested in making the film because he " had the ambition to do a live @-@ action film for a long time " , but that he " didn 't like anything until I read this book " . He described the book as " beautiful " and said that it " moved [ him ] " . Bridge to Terabithia was cinematographer Michael Chapman 's final film before his retirement . Chapman mentioned in the film 's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one ; " this is such a beautiful story , and it 's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Director Csupó stated that they had no actors initially in mind for the film . The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke . Robb wrote Csupó " such a beautiful , heartwarming letter " that expressed her love for the book and the character . Csupó said that he cast her because of " her letter , her enthusiasm , and her love of the material " . Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began , and " their conversation convinced her that , without a doubt , AnnaSophia was meant for this role " . Levine said that " it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie , that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence . She might be physically different from Leslie in the book , but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical . It was a match made in heaven . " With regard to the character , Robb said " [ Leslie ] ' s one of those people who 's just always lit up , who has this glow about her , and no one can bring her down . Leslie 's such a lively and energetic character , it was really fun for me to become her . " 
 Levine stated that " looking for Jesse was a really tough hunt . We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident , brave leader in Terabithia . That 's a heck of a range for such a young actor . " Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jesse Aarons , but they settled with him because they " felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him " . Hutcherson said that the project appealed to him because of " the real life day @-@ to @-@ day drama as well as the arc of the character Jesse " . 
 The filmmakers cast Robert Patrick as Jess 's hardworking and strict father based on his previous roles in the films Walk the Line , Flags of Our Fathers , and the television series The Unit . Patrick explained that he related to the story because he was " constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid " himself , and that the film 's setting reminded him of where he grew up . He also said that he took on the role because he wanted to star in a film that his children could watch . 
 Csupó said that they cast Bailee Madison as May Belle Aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play the part . He went on to say that " she had such a charm , even before the camera , she was just like a little sweetheart . She was very confident , she showed up , shook hands with everybody , totally sweet and perky . I said ' WOW ! ' — she was just stealing everybody 's heart on the spot . " 
 = = = Design and effects = = = 
 Csupó explained that " it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we 're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story 's integrity and the book 's integrity " , because there was only a brief mention of Jess and Leslie fighting imaginary creatures in the forest in the novel . With that in mind , they " tried to do the absolute minimum , which would be required to put it into a movie version " . 
 In designing the fantasy creatures found in Terabithia , Csupó wanted to make creatures that were " little more artsy , imaginative , fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies " , and drew inspiration from Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott . Dima <unk> came up with the drawings for the creatures with Csupó 's guidance . Csupó chose to have Weta Digital render the 3D animation because he " was impressed with their artistic integrity , the teamwork , the [ fact that ] people were really nice , and also they responded to our designs very positively " . Weta modified some of the creature designs , but ultimately remained faithful to Csupó 's original designs . 
 There were around 100 crew members from Weta working on the effects for the film . Weta was already working on animating the creatures while the film was being shot , and Weta crew members were on @-@ set for all the scenes that involved special effects during the filming . Weta visual effects supervisor Matt Aitken explained that process involved in interpreting the creatures was " split into two steps " . First , natural @-@ looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csupó and <unk> , and this was done mostly through Photoshop collages done by visual effects art director Michael <unk> . The second step was to figure out animation or motion styles that best suited these creatures . 
 Leslie 's costumes in the film were designed to look as if the character " might have made some of them herself " , and they were updated from those described in the book to reflect what would currently be considered eccentric . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel 's author 's son , and his name was featured on its dedication page . The story was based on his real life best friend , Lisa Hill , who was struck by lightning and killed when they were both eight years old . Paterson had asked his mother , Katherine Paterson , if he could write a screenplay of the novel , and she agreed " not only because he 's [ her ] son , but also because he 's a very good playwright " . Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay , mostly because of Leslie 's death ; " if you can believe this , I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just ' hurt ' Leslie a little bit — put her in a light coma and then bring her out " . 
 The most important thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from " a novel that takes place mostly in the characters ' heads to a dynamic visual medium " . Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination . While Paterson focused on " bringing out the emotions of the story , " he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia " because it was too close " . He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film . " What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn 't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way " , David said . Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book . Csupó reasons that the movie " deals with so many issues including friendship , and maybe first innocent love , things like that " , so it " made more sense " to make the characters older . 
 = = Soundtrack = = 
 The film features a musical score by Aaron Zigman , who was hired after Alison Krauss backed out of the job . Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that " ... at times there 's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much " , but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia . He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose " your typical Hollywood Score " ; he then mixed up orchestral melody with " a bit of a modern flavor . " The score he composed for the film is described as " very large " compared to his other work , and Zigman commented that " Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do , I also like big orchestral stuff , and want to do more of that , and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit . " The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13 , 2007 .

 = = = Marketing and promotion = = = 
 The promotion and advertising for the film was met with criticism and controversy . The filmmakers distanced themselves away from the advertising campaign for the film , saying that it was deliberately misleading and made the film seem to be about , or occurring in , a fantasy world . David Paterson was surprised by the trailer , but understood the marketing reasoning behind it , saying : 
 Critics commented on the film 's misleading advertisement campaign . One critic said the film was actually " grounded in reality far more than in fantasy " , while another thought , " far from a computer generated escapist fantasy , this film is an unpretentious and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss " .

 Bridge to Terabithia received positive reviews from film critics . Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 85 % based on 157 reviews , with an average score of 7 @.@ 2 / 10 . The site 's consensus is , that the film is " a faithful adaptation of a beloved children 's novel and a powerful portrayal of love , loss , and imagination through children 's eyes . Dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhance the imaginative film " . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film received an average score of 74 % based on 25 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Bridge to Terabithia " easily the best family feature of the early year " . Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the script for being " utterly recognizable and authentic " , and thought Robb and Hutcherson were " perfectly cast " . Hornaday wrote that although the final five minutes succumbed to " <unk> sentiment " , viewers would remember the film 's " warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love " . Jessica Grose of The Village Voice commended director Csupó for omitting " cutesy tween stereotypes " , and felt Jess 's relationship with his father elevated Bridge to Terabithia from " a good kids movie to a classic contender " . The New York Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background " to find magic in the everyday " , and thought Csupó directed " like someone intimate with the pain of being different , allowing each personality more than a single characteristic " . The reviewer praised all the leads for their strong performances , especially Deschanel and Madison . Catsoulis found the film was able to handle adult topics " with nuance and sensitivity " , and being consistently smart and " delicate as a spider web " , it was the kind of children 's movie " rarely seen nowadays " . Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times praised Hutcherson and Robb 's performances , saying that " the film 's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children 's eyes . The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint . " 
 Despite the critical acclaim , not all reviews were as positive . Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that " for a movie about the power of imagination , Bridge to Terabithia is not as clever as you would hope " . Puig called the film a " serviceable translation " of the novel , but thought the adult characters were caricatured . The reviewer found the real @-@ life portions of the movie were " derivative and simplistic " , but found Jess 's emotional tumult felt " powerfully authentic , and this is where the film finds its truth and soul " . The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern felt that despite the occasional misuse of enchantment — " brief spasms of overproduced fantasy " — the novel 's screen adaptation was told with " agreeable simplicity in between computer @-@ generated monsters " . Morgenstern was disappointed with the performances by the young members of the cast , which he described as " appealing but unpolished " . Morgenstern thought Csupó lacked experience directing actors , and that although Deschanel was the best adult performer , she seemed self @-@ directed . Entertainment Weekly 's Gregory Kirschling was confused by the main characters ' lack of excitement towards Terabithia , and felt the film could not decide if it was " a fantasy or a coming @-@ of @-@ age story " .

 On November 9 , 2007 , Jay @-@ Z appeared on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album . When asked about how the film gave life to this album , he stated " It 's a New York City true story , you know . So as soon as the movie came on , it was like familiar , things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and , you know , different things like that , things I 've seen growing up . So they resonated with me in a way , the story , as well as , I mean , even though everything happens , you know , the way it turns out , you know , it 's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy , because the bad guy , you know , he don 't seem like a bad guy , and the good guy – I mean the good guys are bad . You know , that complex – the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me . I loved the complexity of the human beings " .

 Jay @-@ Z would have the film – American Gangster – playing on the monitors above the recording booth to keep him inspired . In an interview with MTV producer LV from The Hitmen said " Jay would have the beats ... He 'd do the record , and he 'd send it back to us . We 'd fill in the blanks as far as making them full records . From having live horns , live strings , live drummers . This percussion dude , he was coming in with bottles , banging on bottles , just sprinkles of shit . We went all out . We brought in musicians to bring it out . Jay probably just heard a sample and some drums . Once we got the vocals back , we brought in all the extra candy " . 
 Beanie Sigel and Lil Wayne are two of the few featured guest spots on the album , in which Sigel appears on the new version of " Ignorant Shit " , and Lil Wayne joins Jay @-@ Z on the Beastie Boys @-@ sampling " Hello Brooklyn 2 @.@ 0 " . Jay returned the favor on " Mr. Carter " from Lil Wayne 's Tha Carter III .

 Allmusic says that " And that might be the most common complaint about the album – it 's really just another case of Jay @-@ Z being Jay @-@ Z , albeit with different presentation . Unless you know each verse from Reasonable Doubt through Kingdom Come , it might sound like he 's dealing with no variation on well @-@ worn themes , the exact same thoughts and emotions that make up older tracks about his past as a drug dealer – the rise , the arrogance , the <unk> , the fall , and all stages in between . " Yahoo ! Music writer Angus Batey viewed its thematic concept in the context of the " gangsta " ideal , stating " Using a selection of beats built from ' 70s soul and funk , it reflects the period setting ; lyrically , its primary theme is an investigation of the evolution of the gangsta archetype , looking at how the drug dealer became a semi @-@ sympathetic outlaw figure , examining the contradictions inherent in those who chase the American Dream on the far side of legality , and ruminating on what this period of US history might yet come to mean " . Pitchfork Media reviewer Tom Breihan noted that " ' No Hook ' has some of the most complicated rhyme @-@ patterns Jay has tried in years " : Although Jay @-@ Z says American Gangster was inspired by the movie of the same name , he touches on the topics of censorship and the Jena 6 controversy :

 American Gangster received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 83 , based on 25 reviews , which indicates " universal acclaim " . Rolling Stone 's Rob Sheffield commented that the album " definitely doesn 't have any fluff like Kingdom Come 's ' 30 Something ' or ' Beach Chair ' . Jay sounds relaxed , no longer worried about impressing anyone . Instead , he follows the story from the uptown dope @-@ king ambition of ' American Dreamin ' ' to the big @-@ payback crash of " Fallin ' . " Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly wrote that , " While Jay @-@ Z does not make the ambitious leap of trying to write from Lucas ' point of view , he does use the film 's story and period vibe to color his own elaborate legend . On ' American Dreamin ' , a Marvin Gaye sample provides the backdrop as Jay @-@ Z wistfully recounts his early days as a dealer , scheming with his buddies . " Allmusic writer Andy Kellman found it to be " a very good Jay @-@ Z album " . The A.V. Club critic Nathan Rabin commented that Jay @-@ Z " finds inspiration in the Ridley Scott film of the same name , the lush atmosphere of ' 70s soul , and the bracing grit of blaxploitation " . 
 Uncut complimented the " comfortable cruising altitude " of Jay @-@ Z 's delivery and called the album " an effective reminder of what success is about – leaving the hustle behind . " Amy Linden of The Village Voice lauded its retro musical references and stated , " As you 'd expect from ( still ) one of the best <unk> in hip @-@ hop , there 's some killer wordplay here " . The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh commended Jay @-@ Z for his lyricism , stating " he packs his wordy stanzas full of unexpected syllables , clever allusions and unpredictable rhymes schemes . This is probably as close as the new Jay @-@ Z will ever come to sounding like the old Jay @-@ Z " . PopMatters editor Mike Schiller perceived " no narrative thread " , but viewed it as " sonically consistent " and praised Jay @-@ Z 's performance , stating " What American Gangster truly gives us is Jay @-@ Z through and through ... It ’ s superhero music in that Jay ’ s supremacy is never questioned , but it ’ s superhero music that insists on showing off more than just that hero ’ s immense power " . XXL 's Alvin Samuels and described it as " a pot of pure uncut crack music " , while writing " Rediscovering his hustler ’ s ambition , Jay delves into the many facets of the drug game like an OG passing knowledge down to a new jack " . 
 Despite finding its conceptual style flawed , The Observer 's Steve Yates praised Jay @-@ Z 's reflections on fame and " the voracious capitalism ( <unk> and downside ) , which is proving hip hop 's most durable legacy " , adding that " It 's Jay @-@ Z 's and American Gangster 's triumph that reflecting on his appetite seems to have reawakened it " . Sputnikmusic 's Cam commented that lyrically , it " may be the smartest album Jay has ever released " . In a mixed review , Louis Pattison of NME was ambivalent towards its " low @-@ key " style and stated , " You leave ‘ American Gangster ’ longing for more of this don ’ t @-@ give @-@ a @-@ fuck attitude , but the feeling that presides is Jay @-@ Z patting his wallet " . In his consumer guide for MSN Music , Robert Christgau gave the album a one @-@ star honorable mention ( ) , indicating " a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like .

 = Typhoon Faye ( 1982 ) = 
 Typhoon Faye was a long @-@ lived typhoon that struck the Philippines in August 1982 . On August 16 , a weak tropical disturbance was moving towards the southern Philippines . Initially , land interaction with the Philippines with prevented significant development . After crossing the Philippines , the disturbance emerged into the South China Sea and increased in organization . It was upgraded into a tropical storm by midday on August 22 . Thereafter , Faye began to steadily strengthen , and attained typhoon intensity later that day . On August 23 , Typhoon Faye reached its peak intensity , which the storm would maintain for approximately 12 hours . A small cyclone , Faye moved northward on August 24 due to the weakening of a ridge over China . Thereafter , its center was disrupted by land interaction with the Philippines . As such , the storm weakened slightly before striking Luzon on the morning of August 25 . Severe flooding and strong winds were recorded . More than 5 @,@ 000 houses were damaged while 220 @,@ 000 were homeless . Furthermore , around 7 @,@ 000 people sought shelter . There were 18 injuries and 41 deaths in the Philippines . Overall , damage amounted to $ 9 @.@ 6 million ( 1982 USD ) . Across Japan , two people perished . 
 Recurving to the northeast , Faye continued weakening due to strong wind shear , with dissipation as a tropical cyclone occurring on the afternoon of August 27 . The remnants of the typhoon initially continued moving east @-@ northeast before stalling that evening . Faye began to reorganize , and was estimated to have re @-@ attained typical storm strength on August 28 . Faye intensified slightly , nearly attaining typhoon intensity on August 29 , but this trend was short @-@ lived due to increased wind shear . By August 31 , a building ridge to Faye 's north led to a southwest motion as the system steadily weakened . However , Faye managed to maintain its identity as a weak tropical cyclone for several days , before finally dissipating on September 3 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Faye originated from a westward @-@ moving weak area of disturbed weather located within the Philippine Sea in the middle of August . On August 16 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) started monitoring the disturbance for possible development . Initially , little development was expected due to its close proximity to land and Typhoon Ellis . The disturbance was poorly organized and the atmospheric circulation was exposed from the deep convection despite being located near an anticyclone , which tends to favor tropical cyclogenesis . On August 20 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) started tracking the disturbance . Later that day , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also started monitoring the storm , assigning it with the local name Norming . After emerging into the South China Sea , the storm began to intensify . Later on the morning of August 20 , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) for the disturbance . At 0000 UTC on August 21 , the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression . Six hours later , the agency determined that the depression attained tropical storm status , naming it Faye . 
 Tropical Storm Faye slowly tracked west @-@ northwest since a subtropical ridge was situated near Hong Kong ; however , the presence of a cold front and Ellis prevented the ridge for strengthening . Despite moderate wind shear , Faye gradually intensified . Midday on August 22 , the JMA classified Faye as a tropical storm . Meanwhile , the JTWC estimated that Faye reached typhoon status . Over the south China Sea , Faye continued to intensify , and according to the JMA , Faye also attained typhoon intensity on August 23 . That afternoon , the JMA estimated that Faye reached peak intensity of 145 km / h ( 90 mph ) ; it would maintain this intensity for about twelve hours . Around this time , the JTWC expected Faye to move westward since the ridge atop of southern China was expected to build . Instead , the typhoon turned north as the ridge over southern China weakened , and a trough was noted between Ellis and Faye . On the morning of August 24 , the JTWC assessed the peak intensity of the storm at 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) . This intensity is equivalent to a moderate Category 2 hurricane on the United States @-@ based Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . Shortly after its peak , the typhoon started to weaken as its circulation interacted with the Philippines . At 1800 UTC that day , the storm made landfall in Luzon . At that time , the JMA estimated winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . 
 Due to a combination of land interaction and strong wind shear from Typhoon Ellis , Faye became less organized . At 0000 UTC on August 25 , the JMA downgraded Faye to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC reduced it to tropical storm status . After re @-@ emerging into open water , Faye turned northeast under the influence of Typhoon Ellis . Initially , re @-@ intensification was expected to occur ; however , the shear did not relent . Late on August 26 , the JMA estimated that Faye was no longer a tropical storm . By August 27 , Faye began to turn east despite the JTWC forecasting the storm to continue northeast and pass west of Japan . Additionally , Faye continued to weaken , and by that time , all the thunderstorm activity was displaced from the center . At 0600 UTC on August 27 , the JTWC discontinued warnings on the system as only a few areas of thunderstorm activity remained present . Despite this , the JMA continued to track the cyclone . 
 The remnants of Faye continued on an east @-@ northeasterly track , despite indications from tropical cyclone forecast models that the cyclone would move northeast . Late on August 27 , Faye stalled between a trough and Typhoon Gordon . Thus , environmental conditions became considerably more conductive , and Faye began to rapidly intensify again . At 0000 UTC on August 28 , data from both the JTWC and the JMA suggested that Faye regenerated into a tropical storm . Operationally , the JTWC did not resume watching the cyclone until six hours later . At 0900 UTC , the JTWC upgraded Faye back to a typhoon , just a mere 27 hours after the agency discontinued watching the system for the first time . However , data from the JMA indicates that only slight intensification occurred during this time . Shortly thereafter , a Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . Early on August 29 , the JMA estimated that Faye attained winds of 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) , its secondary peak intensity . At 1500 UTC , the JTWC demoted Faye to a tropical storm . Subsequently , Faye began to gradually weaken due to increased wind shear caused by a trough , which resulted in all of the deep convection to become displaced from the center . On August 31 , Faye slowly began drifting westward as a ridge deepened south of Japan . At 0600 UTC on August 31 , the JTWC downgraded Faye to a tropical depression under the anticipation that Tropical Depression Faye would dissipate within 24 to 48 hours . Accelerating , Faye managed to maintain its circulation for much longer than anticipated . On the morning of September 3 , the JMA stopped watching Faye ; the JTWC followed suit around this time as the surface circulation had dissipated within the Sea of Japan . The remnants of the system became absorbed into the monsoon trough , which eventually spawned Typhoon Hope off the west coast of China .

 When Faye struck the central portion of the Philippines , three people were initially reported as missing . The typhoon brought heavy rainfall to Luzon , resulting in overflowing rivers , which in turn flooded low @-@ lying areas . Numerous roads and bridges were washed out . Coconut trees were uprooted , while sugarcane and rice suffered severe damage . There , damage to crops , school buildings , and fish ponds totaled $ 1 @.@ 5 million . When the typhoon veered toward the island nation for the second time , school classes were briefly halted and six flights of the Philippine Airlines were called off . Typhoon warnings were posted for much of the northern portion of the country . 
 Due to its second landfall , Faye brought significant destruction . Forty @-@ one people were killed , at least 19 of which died due to flying debris , drownings or shipwrecks . Offshore Palawan , Faye capsized a boat , killing seven of the 54 aboard ; the remaining were rescued .

 = Jesse L. Brown = 
 Jesse LeRoy Brown ( 13 October 1926 – 4 December 1950 ) was a United States Navy officer . He was the first African @-@ American aviator in the U.S. Navy , a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross , and the first African @-@ American naval officer killed in the Korean War . 
 Born in Hattiesburg , Mississippi , to an impoverished family , Brown was avidly interested in aircraft from a young age . He graduated as salutatorian of his high school , notwithstanding its racial segregation , and was later awarded a degree from Ohio State University . Brown enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1946 , becoming a midshipman . Brown earned his pilot wings on 21 October 1948 amid a flurry of press coverage ; in January 1949 he was assigned to Fighter Squadron 32 aboard the USS Leyte . 
 At the outset of the Korean War , the Leyte was ordered to the Korean Peninsula , arriving in October 1950 . Brown , an ensign , flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir . Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of wingman Thomas J. Hudner , Jr . , who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt , for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 Brown 's successes in the segregated and desegregated U.S. military were memorialized in several books . The frigate USS Jesse L. Brown ( FF @-@ 1089 ) was named in his honor . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Brown was born on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg , Mississippi . He was one of six children born to Julia Lindsey Brown , a schoolteacher , and John Brown , a grocery warehouse worker . He had four brothers , Marvin , William , Fletcher , and Johnny , as well as a sister , Lura . Brown 's ancestry was African American , <unk> , and Choctaw . The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on a fireplace for warmth . As a child , Jesse 's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned . 
 At the beginning of the Great Depression , John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer 's Crossing , 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Hattiesburg , where he worked at a turpentine factory until he was laid off in 1938 . John Brown then moved the family to Lux , Mississippi , to be a part of a sharecropper farm . During this time , Jesse Brown shared a bed with his brothers and attended a one @-@ room school 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) away . His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework , and Jesse Brown walked to school every day . The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse , William , and Julia Brown sang in the church choir . In his spare time , Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton . 
 When Brown was six years old , his father took him to an air show . Brown gained an intense interest in flying from this experience , and afterward , was attracted to a dirt airfield near his home , which he visited frequently in spite of being chased away by a local mechanic . 
 At the age of thirteen , Brown took a job as a paperboy for the Pittsburgh Courier , a black press paper , and developed a desire to pilot while reading in the newspaper about African @-@ American aviators of the time including C. Alfred Anderson , <unk> Jacques Bullard , and Bessie Coleman . He also became an avid reader of Popular Aviation and the Chicago Defender , which he later said heavily influenced his desire to fly naval aircraft . In his childhood he was described as " serious , witty , unassuming , and very intelligent . " In 1937 , he wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in which he complained of the injustice of African @-@ American pilots being kept out of the U.S. Army Air Corps , to which the White House responded with a letter saying that it appreciated the viewpoint . 
 Because the schools closer to his family were of lower quality , in 1939 , Brown lived with his aunt and attended the segregated Eureka High School in Hattiesburg . He was a member of the basketball , football , and track and field teams and he was an excellent student , graduating as the salutatorian in 1944 . During this time , Brown met his future wife , Daisy Pearl Nix . 
 Following graduation , Brown sought to enroll in a college outside of the South . His principal , Nathaniel Burger , advised he attend an all @-@ black college , as his brother Marvin Brown had done , however , he ended up enrolling at Ohio State University as his childhood role model , Jesse Owens , had done . Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year , but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll , feeling he would compete well with white students . 
 Brown took several side jobs to save money for college , including waiting tables at the Holmes Club , a saloon for white U.S. Army soldiers . In this job , Brown was frequently the target of racist vitriol and abuse , but nonetheless persevered , earning $ 600 to pay for college . In the autumn of 1944 , Brown took a segregated train to Columbus , Ohio , and began school at Ohio State . 
 Brown moved into an on @-@ campus boarding house at 61 East Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of the University District in Columbus , and majored in architectural engineering . Brown attempted several times to apply to the school 's aviation program , but was denied because of his race . Brown joined the track and field team as well as the wrestling team , but soon dropped both for financial reasons . He took a job as a janitor at a local Lazarus department store and then was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15 : 30 to midnight each day . In spite of this , he maintained top grades in his classes . Facing difficulties with his academics and the institutional segregation in the city , Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him . Brown rarely returned to Mississippi during the school year , but in the summers he worked at a dry cleaner in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes . 
 During his second year in college , Brown learned of the V @-@ 5 Aviation Cadet Training Program being conducted by the U.S. Navy to commission naval aviation pilots . This program operated at 52 colleges , none of which were predominantly black colleges , so only students such as Brown , who attended integrated colleges , were eligible . In spite of resistance from recruiters , Brown passed the entrance exams . Brown enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve on 8 July 1946 and was admitted to the aviation program , becoming a Seaman Apprentice in the U.S. Navy and a member of the school 's Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps ( NROTC ) program . A $ 50 monthly stipend allowed him to quit his jobs and complete his architectural engineering degree in 1947 . At this time , the NROTC was the normal route to a regular Naval commission , but only 14 out of more than 5 @,@ 600 NROTC students in 1947 were black . 
 = = Career = = 
 On 15 March 1947 , Brown reported to Glenview Naval Air Station in Glenview , Illinois , for Naval Flight Officer training . There , his enlistment ended 15 April and Brown reverted to the rank of midshipman , becoming the only African American in the program . Although he anticipated antagonism , he found the other cadets were generally friendly and welcoming . He found many of the black cooks and janitors hostile to him , however , possibly due to jealousy . Brown got his first flight time aboard a Stearman <unk> trainer aircraft . 
 In spite of the rigors of the initial training , Brown was encouraged by instructors and completed the first phase of training , transferring to Ottumwa Naval Air Station in Ottumwa , Iowa , for the next phase . The Ottumwa training involved intense physical fitness and technical training , which Brown completed . Thereafter , he was moved to Pensacola Naval Air Station in Pensacola , Florida , to train in aircraft flight . 
 In Pensacola , Brown and Nix married in secret , as Naval Cadets were not allowed to marry until their training was complete , under threat of immediate dismissal . Nix took a room in Pensacola , and the two visited one another on weekends . In spite of overt racism from at least one instructor and several classmates at this posting , Brown completed the rigorous training in August 1947 . 
 By June 1948 , Brown had begun training for carrier @-@ based aircraft , and hoped to fly either the F4U Corsair or F6F Hellcat , both of which were fighters . He trained in carrier takeoffs and landings aboard the light carrier USS Wright , after which he was sent to Jacksonville , Florida , for final flight qualifications . On 21 October 1948 , he completed his training and was given his Naval Aviator Badge . This accomplishment was widely publicized , and Brown became known nationally . The Associated Press profiled him and his photograph appeared in Life magazine . Author Theodore Taylor later wrote that through Brown 's efforts to become a pilot , he had broken the " color barrier " which had been longstanding and preventing blacks in naval aviation . 
 Brown was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy on 26 April 1949 . He was assigned to Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Quonset , Rhode Island , as a part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet . Brown reported that incidents of racism and discrimination , which had been harsh late in his training , were substantially relieved once he became an officer . Following his commissioning , Brown was assigned to temporary duty at Norfolk Naval Air Station in Norfolk , Virginia . His daughter , Pamela Elise Brown , was born in December . In January 1949 , Brown was assigned to Fighter Squadron 32 aboard the USS Leyte . Over the next 18 months , the unit conducted numerous training exercises along the East Coast , many of them taking place at Quonset Point . Brown reported here his superiors treated him fairly and held others to equal standards . The unit trained rigorously in aircraft maneuvers . 
 By the outbreak of the Korean War , he had gained a reputation among the others in the squadron as an experienced pilot and a capable section leader . He was well @-@ liked among other pilots and the black stewards and support staff of the carrier . Brown did not socialize much with the other pilots , however , and was known to spend as much time as possible visiting his wife . He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 On the night of 25 June 1950 , ten divisions of the North Korean People 's Army launched a full @-@ scale invasion of the nation 's neighbor to the south , the Republic of Korea . The force of 89 @,@ 000 men moved in six columns , catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise , resulting in a rout . The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment , and was unprepared for war . The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38 @,@ 000 South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south . Most of South Korea 's forces retreated in the face of the invasion . The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea 's capital of Seoul within hours , forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat farther south . 
 To prevent South Korea 's collapse the United Nations Security Council voted to send military forces . The United States Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77 , led by the fleet carrier USS Valley Forge ; the British Far East Fleet dispatched several ships , including HMS Triumph , to provide air and naval support . Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces , these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance . U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops into the country to supplement the air support . All U.S. Navy units , including the Leyte , were placed on alert . At the time , the ship was in the Mediterranean Sea and Brown did not expect to be deployed to Korea , but on 8 August a relief carrier arrived in the area and the Leyte was ordered to Korea . Commanders felt the pilots on the carrier were better trained , and hence needed in the theater . The ship sailed from the Strait of Gibraltar across the Atlantic Ocean and to Quonset , then through the Panama Canal and to San Diego , California , Hawaii , and Japan before arriving in Korea around 8 October . 
 The ship joined Task Force 77 off the northeast coast of the Korean Peninsula , part of a fleet of 17 ships from the Seventh Fleet , including the aircraft carrier USS Philippine Sea , battleship USS Missouri and cruiser USS Juneau . Brown flew 20 missions in @-@ country . These missions included attacks on communication lines , troop concentrations , and military installations around Wonsan , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Following the entrance of the People 's Republic of China into the war in late November 1950 , Brown and his squadron were dispatched to the Chosin Reservoir , where an intense campaign was being fought between the People 's Volunteer Army and the US X Corps . Approximately 100 @,@ 000 Chinese troops had surrounded 15 @,@ 000 U.S. troops , and Brown and other pilots on the Leyte flew dozens of close air support missions every day to prevent the Chinese from overrunning the U.S. troops . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On 4 December 1950 , Brown was part of a six @-@ aircraft flight supporting U.S. Marine Corps ground troops trapped by Chinese forces . At 13 : 38 KST , Brown took off from the Leyte with squadron executive officer Lieutenant Commander Dick <unk> , Lieutenant George Hudson , Lieutenant Junior Grade Bill Koenig , Ensign Ralph McQueen , and Lieutenant Junior Grade Thomas J. Hudner , Jr . , who was Brown 's wingman . During this flight , Brown had the call sign " Iroquois 13 " . The flight traveled 100 miles ( 160 km ) from the Task Force 's location to the Chosin Reservoir , flying 35 to 40 minutes through very harsh wintery conditions to the vicinity of the villages of Yudam @-@ ni and Hagaru @-@ ri . The flight began searching for targets along the west side of the reservoir , decreasing their altitude to 700 feet ( 210 m ) . The mission was a three @-@ hour search and destroy flight as well as an attempt to probe Chinese troop strength in the area . 
 Although the flight spotted no Chinese , at 14 : 40 Koenig radioed that Brown appeared to be trailing fuel . The damage had likely come by small arms fire from Chinese infantry , who were known to hide in the snow and to ambush passing aircraft by firing in unison . At least one bullet had ruptured a fuel line . Brown , losing fuel pressure and increasingly unable to control the aircraft , dropped his external fuel tanks and rockets and attempted to land the craft in a snow @-@ covered clearing on the side of a mountain . Brown crashed into a bowl @-@ shaped valley at approximately 40 ° 36 ′ N 127 ° 06 ′ E. The aircraft broke up violently upon impact and was destroyed . In the crash , Brown 's leg was pinned beneath the fuselage of the aircraft , and he stripped off his helmet and gloves in an attempt to free himself , before waving to the other pilots , who were circling close overhead . The other pilots had thought he had died in the crash . Brown had crash @-@ landed near <unk> @-@ ni , 15 miles ( 24 km ) behind Chinese lines in 15 ° F ( − 9 ° C ) weather , and the other pilots began a Mayday radio to any heavy transport aircraft in the area as they canvassed the mountain for any sign of Chinese ground forces who might threaten Brown . They received a signal that a rescue helicopter would come as soon as possible , but Brown 's aircraft was smoking and a fire had started near its internal fuel tanks . 
 Before it became clear Brown was seriously injured , Hudner attempted in vain to rescue Brown by radioing him instructions for escaping his damaged aircraft . Hudner then intentionally crash @-@ landed his aircraft , ran to Brown 's side and attempted to wrestle him free from the wreck . While Brown 's condition worsened by the minute , Hudner attempted in vain to put out the aircraft fire using snow and to pull Brown from the aircraft . In great pain , Brown began slipping in and out of consciousness . A rescue helicopter arrived around 15 : 00 ; its pilot Lieutenant Charles Ward and Hudner were unable to put out the engine fire with a fire extinguisher , and tried unsuccessfully to free Brown with an axe for 45 minutes . They even considered , at Brown 's request , amputating his trapped leg . Brown lost consciousness shortly thereafter . His last known words to Hudner were , " Tell Daisy I love her . " The helicopter , which was unable to operate in the darkness , was forced to return to base at nightfall with Hudner , leaving Brown behind . Brown is believed to have died shortly thereafter of his injuries and exposure to the extreme cold . No Chinese forces threatened the site , likely owing to the heavy air presence of Brown and Hudner 's unit . 
 Hudner begged superiors to allow him to return to the wreck to help extract Brown , but he was not allowed , as other officers feared an ambush of the vulnerable helicopters resulting in casualties . To prevent the body and the aircraft from falling into Chinese or North Korean hands , the U.S. Navy bombed the aircraft with napalm two days later , with pilots reportedly reciting the Lord 's Prayer over the radio as they watched Brown 's body be consumed by flames . The pilots observed that Brown 's body was still stuck in the aircraft , but his clothes were gone . The remains of both Brown and the aircraft were never recovered . Brown was the first African @-@ American U.S. Navy officer killed in the war . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 For his actions in Korea leading up to his death , Brown was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross , the Purple Heart Medal , and the Air Medal . For the failed rescue attempt , Hudner received the Medal of Honor , the highest valor award presented by the U.S. military . 
 Brown 's shipmates memorialized him in a shipwide newspaper as " a Christian soldier , a gentleman , a shipmate , and friend ... His courage and faith ... shone like a beacon for all to see . " As word of his death spread , Brown inspired numerous other African Americans to become pilots , notably Seaman Apprentice Frank E. Petersen . Petersen would become the first African @-@ American Marine Corps aviator and the first African @-@ American Marine Corps general , being graduated from the Naval Aviation Training Program in 1952 and retiring from the military after 38 years in 1988 with the rank of lieutenant general . 
 On 17 February 1973 , the Navy commissioned the Knox @-@ class frigate USS Jesse L. Brown ( FF @-@ 1089 ) , the third U.S. ship named in honor of an African American . Present at the commissioning ceremony in Boston , Massachusetts , were Daisy Brown Thorne ( who had remarried ) , Pamela Brown , and Hudner , who gave a dedication . The ship was decommissioned on 27 July 1994 and renamed the <unk> after being commissioned with the Egyptian navy . 
 An extensive biography of Brown later was compiled by author Theodore Taylor , who had served in Korea and had been deeply moved by the news of Brown 's death at the time . Taylor interviewed many of Brown 's closest friends and family and consulted Daisy Brown 's personal diary and records from the Leyte 's ship log while preparing his 300 @-@ page book , published in 2007 . 
 In July 2013 , Hudner visited Pyongyang in an attempt to recover Brown 's remains from the crash site . He was told by North Korean authorities to return in September when the weather is more predictable .

With courageous efficiency and utter disregard for his own personal safety , Ensign Brown , while in support of friendly troops in the Chosin Reservoir area , pressed home numerous attacks destroying an enemy troop concentration moving to attack our troops . So aggressive were these attacks , in the face of enemy anti @-@ aircraft fire , that they finally resulted in the destruction of Ensign Brown 's plane by anti @-@ aircraft fire . His gallant devotion to duty was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service . 
 = USS Canonicus ( 1863 ) = 
 USS Canonicus was a single @-@ turret monitor built for the United States Navy during the American Civil War , the lead ship of her class . The ship spent most of her first year in service stationed up the James River , where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the Confederate ironclads of the James River Squadron . She engaged Confederate artillery batteries during the year and later participated in both attacks on Fort Fisher , defending the approaches to Wilmington , North Carolina , from December 1864 to January 1865 . 
 Canonicus was transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Charleston , South Carolina , after the capture of Fort Fisher in January and helped to capture one blockade runner . She was sent to Havana , Cuba , to search for the Confederate ironclad CSS Stonewall and became one of the first ironclads to visit a foreign port . The ship was intermittently in commission from 1872 until she was permanently decommissioned in 1877 . Canonicus was exhibited at the Jamestown Exposition of 1907 before she was sold for scrap the following year . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 The ship was 224 feet ( 68 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , had a beam of 43 feet 4 inches ( 13 @.@ 2 m ) and had a maximum draft of 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) . Canonicus had a tonnage of 1 @,@ 034 tons burthen and displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men . 
 Canonicus was powered by a two @-@ cylinder horizontal vibrating @-@ lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers . The 320 @-@ indicated @-@ horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried 140 – 150 long tons ( 140 – 150 t ) of coal . Canonicus 's main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading , 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 43 @,@ 000 pounds ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) . They could fire a 350 @-@ pound ( 158 @.@ 8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° . 
 The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) wrought iron plates , backed by wood . The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one @-@ inch plates . The ship 's deck was protected by armor 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . A 5 @-@ by @-@ 15 @-@ inch ( 130 by 380 mm ) soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . The base of the funnel was protected to a height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) by 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of armor . A " rifle screen " of 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) armor 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high was installed on the top of the turret to protect the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven , captain of her sister ship Tecumseh . 
 The contract for Canonicus , the first Navy ship to be named for the chief of the Narragansett Indians , was awarded to Harrison Loring ; the ship was laid down in 1862 at their Boston , Massachusetts shipyard . She was launched on 1 August 1863 and commissioned on 16 April 1864 with Commander E. G. Parrott in command . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . As far as is known the ship was not modified after her completion . 
 = = Service = = 
 Canonicus sailed from Boston on 22 April 1864 and arrived at Newport News , Virginia on 3 May for service with the James River Flotilla . She reached the mouth of the Appomattox River by 5 May . By 22 May , the ship was deployed with her sisters Saugus and Tecumseh on the James River where they protected the transports of Major General Benjamin Butler 's Army of the James , supplying the army as it operated on the south bank of the river during the Bermuda Hundred Campaign . On 21 June , Commander Craven of the Tecumseh spotted a line of breastworks that the Confederates were building at Howlett 's Farm and his ship opened fire at the workers . The Confederates replied with a battery of four guns near the breastworks and Saugus and Canonicus joined in the bombardment . A half @-@ hour later , Confederate ships near Dutch Gap joined in , but their fire was ineffective because they were firing blindly at the Union monitors . During the engagement , Canonicus fired forty 15 @-@ inch shells and was hit twice by Confederate shells . One shell pierced the upper part of the funnel and the other struck the deck and ricocheted into the turret ; no one was wounded or killed during the engagement . The ship duelled with Howlett 's Battery on 5 and 6 December , firing 46 shells without being hit in return . The only damage sustained was from the muzzle blast of the right gun that forced the armor at the gun port out about one inch ( 25 mm ) and broke a number of bolts . 
 Reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron , the monitor arrived at Beaufort , North Carolina , accompanied by the sidewheel gunboat Rhode Island , on 15 December 1864 , and took part in the attacks on Fort Fisher , North Carolina . In the first engagement on 24 – 25 December , Canonicus anchored at ranges from 900 – 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 820 – 1 @,@ 100 m ) and fired 144 rounds , Lieutenant Commander George Belknap claiming to have dismounted two Confederate guns . The ship was hit four times , but suffered no casualties and no significant damage . On 13 – 15 January 1865 , during the second attack , Canonicus fired 279 shells at the fort , most on the first day , again claiming to have dismounted two guns . She was hit at least 38 times in return but was only lightly damaged , and three crewmen were wounded . The ship 's flag was twice shot away and replaced each time by Quartermaster Daniel D. Stevens . Stevens was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions . 
 On 17 January 1865 , Canonicus , towed by the steam sloop @-@ of @-@ war Tuscarora , was ordered to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived at Charleston on 19 January . The following month , Canonicus and the monitors Monadnock and Catskill captured a blockade runner that had run aground on Sullivan 's Island on the night of 18 February . The ship , towed by the steamer <unk> , together with Monadnock and other ships steamed to Havana , Cuba in late May in search of the CSS Stonewall and arrived there after the ship had been turned over to the Spanish authorities by her captain . The two monitors were the first American ironclads to arrive at a foreign port and returned to the United States on 6 June . 
 Canonicus arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 June 1869 and was decommissioned five days later . The ship was renamed Scylla on 15 June 1869 , but resumed her former name on 10 August 1869 . She was recommissioned on 22 January 1872 , and cruised the coastal waters of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico whenever she was in commission . Canonicus was finally decommissioned in 1877 at Pensacola , Florida . The elderly monitor was towed to Hampton Roads , Virginia , in mid @-@ 1907 as an exhibit during the Jamestown Exposition as the last survivor of the Civil War monitors . Canonicus was sold for scrap on 19 February 1908 . 
 = Chittenango ovate amber snail = 
 The Chittenango ovate amber snail , scientific name Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , is a species of small air @-@ breathing land snail in the family <unk> , the amber snails . This species was discovered in 1905 , and was reported three years later as a subspecies of the oval <unk> , Succinea ovalis . Several taxonomic reviews took place in the subsequent decades until the end of the 1980s , when the Chittenango ovate amber snail was finally judged to be a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , based on chemical and morphological data . 
 The Chittenango ovate amber snail is endemic to the Chittenango area of Madison County , New York , United States . There is only one population of this species at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York , even though it was believed to have a broader range previously ; based on fossil records , some authors argue that the distribution of this species may have been much wider in the past . In opposition to this , other authors argue that it is impossible to identify this species based on fossil records , because they only allow for examination of shell features . Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive . 
 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis has a small ( an average of 20 @.@ 9 mm in length in adult individuals ) , delicate , ovate shell of 3 ¼ whorls , with deep sutures . The shell is almost translucent , and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white , with a glossy surface . Several internal organs of the animal can be distinguished through the shell 's outer surface . The visible soft parts of the animal are of a pale subtranslucent yellow color , with different markings during distinct stages of development . 
 Studies on the ecology of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent . It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls , in partially sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth . Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection , namely humidity , substrate , temperature , vegetation , and water quality . Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species , and its mating season is from May through July . It lays egg clusters , each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs , at the base of plants , under matted vegetation , or in loose , wet soil . Maturity is reached in five to eight months , and its life span is roughly 2 @.@ 5 years . Some of its predators include insects , amphibians , mammals , birds , and occasionally other snails . 
 Since the time of its discovery in 1905 , there have been many attempts to estimate the population size of this species . Results varied greatly , but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced number of individuals . This coupled with a very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species . Humans frequently invade its habitat , though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures . Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations .

 The snail was first discovered at Chittenango Falls in August 1905 by a field party from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia . In 1908 , Henry Augustus Pilsbry reported the discovery , describing the snail as a subspecies of the widely distributed Succinea ovalis . Because of this , the Chittenango ovate amber snail is referred to in many publications as Succinea ovalis chittenangoensis . 
 Pilsbry placed Succinea ovalis in the subgenus Novisuccinea in 1948 . Alan Solem ( 1976 ) considered this snail to be merely a form of Succinea ovalis , citing similarities in genitalia and radula , and attributing shell differences to , possibly , a marked genetic mutation . Grimm ( 1981 ) considered it to be a distinct species due to external morphological differences ( color and shell shape ) . By 1981 , Succinea ovalis could not be found at the Falls ; however , during sampling for Hoagland ’ s electrophoretic analyses , Succinea ovalis was found at two locations within approximately 16 kilometers of Chittenango Falls . Individuals assigned to Novisuccinea chittenangoensis appeared to be divided into two color morphs , a " gray morph " that was relatively common and widespread at the Falls , and a " red morph " that was restricted to the ledges at the base of the Falls . A preliminary analysis by Hoagland ( 1984 ) stated unequivocally that the red and the gray morphs were two distinct species , possibly in separate genera . Solem examined specimens of the gray morph and assigned it to Succinea putris , an introduced snail possibly from Europe which appears to crowd out all other species . 
 Hoagland and Davis ( 1987 ) subsequently completed a thorough analysis , based on electrophoresis , shell morphology , and internal anatomy , of the <unk> at Chittenango Falls . They divided Succinea into two genera , keeping the Old World Succinea in the genus and elevating the New World Succinea , of the Section Novisuccinea including ovalis and chittenangoensis , to the genus level . They also determined that the Old World Succinea putris is probably a species complex and that the gray morph , although closely related to Succinea putris sensu lato , is a distinct species , which they designated Succinea sp . B. Based on these factors , the species designation Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is considered valid . Both species have been observed with red and gray morphs , bringing into question whether the earlier separation truly represented taxonomic distinctiveness . Currently , Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , Succinea sp . B , and 3 – 4 <unk> spp. are considered to be the only succineid species present at Chittenango Falls . In 2003 , the U.S. Geological Survey ( T. King , unpublished data ) amplified and sequenced the cytochrome oxidase I region of mitochondrial DNA and the ITS @-@ 1 region of nuclear DNA in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and Succinea sp . B. The results ( sequence divergence of 10 – 15 percent ) suggest large differences between the two species . No hybridization was observed . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The only verified extant colony of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is the type population , which is at Chittenango Falls , in Chittenango Falls State Park , 3 @.@ 6 miles north of Cazenovia , between the towns of Cazenovia and Chittenango , in Madison County , New York . At various times in the past , the species has been thought to have a broader range . To date , although many potentially suitable colony sites have been searched , no colony has been conclusively identified as Novisuccinea chittenangoensis outside of the Chittenango Falls area . 
 During the summer of 1982 , " sub @-@ fossil " shells of what appeared to be Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found in the banks on the west side of Chittenango Creek near the Falls . Grimm ( 1981 ) postulated that Pleistocene deposits of what was originally described as Novisuccinea ovalis <unk> ( Baker , 1927 ) are in fact shells of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , and that this species was widely distributed during the Pleistocene epoch . Shell specimens have been recorded from <unk> <unk> , Sangamonian Stage , and <unk> Stage deposits in the states of Arkansas , Illinois , Iowa , Michigan , Missouri , and Nebraska , and in Ontario . Alan Solem , however , questioned the assignment of the fossil succineid shell deposits to any species group . Although Hubricht ( 1985 ) mapped the location of extant populations of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis to include New York , West Virginia , Virginia , Tennessee , and North Carolina , with fossil records from Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , and Arkansas , Hoagland and Davis ( 1987 ) concluded that there is only one verified extant population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and that it is impossible to verify fossil records as being Novisuccinea chittenangoensis based on shell characteristics alone . 
 = = Description = = 
 The shell of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate , slender , acute , and of moderate thickness . The shell suture is deep . The spire is gently convex , laterally compressed , with 3 ¼ whorls . The spire is long , slightly less than half the shell length , and the aperture is very oblique . The shell color is subtranslucent , calcareous pale yellow to white . The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines . The size varies somewhat , but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20 @.@ 9 millimeters ( mm ) in shell length . Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24 mm . 
 Hatchlings measure 1 to 2 mm in shell length , and yearlings average around 10 mm . Measurements of all Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 2002 ranged from 7 to 23 mm . 
 The base color of the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow . The mantle , kidney , and <unk> are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by the thickness of the shell . The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow , tinted with olive , often marked with black streaks and blotches . Over the <unk> is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks . A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive . However , the mark is not present on the hatchlings , making them impossible to identify in the field . The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9 mm in length .

 Until recently , relatively little was known about the biology of the Chittenango ovate amber snail . Studies by investigators at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry ( ESF ) since 1981 have contributed to the base of knowledge about the biology and life history of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . Aloi ( 1985 ) analyzed the population dynamics of the succineid snails at Chittenango Falls . Thomee ( 1986 ) investigated their behavioral ecology , and Molloy and Norton ( 1993 ) developed techniques for captive propagation . Molloy ( 1995 ) reported on the captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and associated field studies related to factors influencing the distribution of Succinea sp . B. Confusion on snail identification may have affected the results of Thomee 's and Aloi 's work , but by the time Molloy 's study was initiated , the identification problems had been resolved . 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis survives in and presumably prefers cool , partially sunlit areas of lush herbaceous growth within the spray zone of the Falls . 
 The habitat of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis lies within the ravine at the base of the 167 @-@ foot @-@ tall waterfall formed by Chittenango Creek as it flows north from its origin toward Oneida Lake . This north @-@ south oriented ravine forms a deep gorge that is shaded or partially shaded throughout most of the growing season , resulting in a microclimate that stays relatively cool during the summer , and because of the creek flow and ice formations , is relatively warm in the winter compared to the surrounding area . Spring thaws and periodic major rainfall events tend to remove vegetation from significant portions of the primary Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat . 
 Pilsbry ( 1948 ) reported that Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was found " on a sloping weedy talus near the foot of the falls . " The only sloping weedy talus is on the east side of the Falls . This area is adjacent to and between the vegetated ledge at the base of the Falls where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis now occurs and the spring @-@ fed watercress beds previously reported to be Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat . Presence of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis has not been verified on the west side of the Falls . 
 Thomee ( 1986 ) mapped the habitat occupied by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . The snails occupied an area of 53 @.@ 7 m2 at the base of the Falls , with most snails found in an area of 11 @.@ 4 m2 . More intense studies from 2002 to 2004 have further defined the occupied habitat . Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a ledge beginning at 4 m from the eastern edge of the Falls and extending to 16 m from the Falls . In addition , Novisuccinea chittenangoensis can be found on the middle ledge 4 m above the primary ledge and in the talus as far as 3 m downslope from the primary ledge . 
 = = = Habitat parameters = = = 
 Five parameters appear to have significance in the preferred habitat : humidity , substrate , temperature , vegetation , and water quality . 
 Humidity : Novisuccinea chittenangoensis appears to require sustained , very high humidity . Active snails were found only when relative humidity approached 100 percent ; during dry periods , snails were found to be relatively inactive . Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls . However , during 2002 , the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found > 5 m from the edge of the ledge nearest the Falls . Recent monitoring ( prior to 2006 ) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season . Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high @-@ humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . 
 Substrate : Novisuccinea chittenangoensis appears to be a <unk> , requiring a substrate either derived from limestone dolomite or rich in calcium carbonate from other sources . The dynamic nature of its habitat does not allow for development of soil . 
 Temperature : The species appears to require the cool , mild temperatures and relatively constant conditions provided by the waterfalls and the mist they generate . Water volume and flow rates within the Chittenango Creek watershed influence the size of the waterfall as well as the mist @-@ zone and the actual temperature at the site . Active Novisuccinea chittenangoensis are generally found at temperatures from 12 to 20 ° C. During warmer periods , snails retreat to cool areas provided by the moist rock and moss , or aestivate in the vegetation . During cold winter temperatures , it is believed that the snails at the Falls retreat into cracks or fissures in the rocks and remain inactive . Various temperature readings were gathered during the summers of 1980 @-@ 1982 . In the spray zone , the rock surface temperatures averaged 16 ° C , the moss averaged 14 ° C , and the combined temperatures of the substrate , water , and vegetation averaged 16 ° C. Seasonal and daily temperature variation has been monitored for 2 years using data loggers that record temperature every hour , but this data has not yet been analyzed ( <unk> , unpublished data ) . 
 Vegetation : Most of the spray zone adjacent to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses , liverworts , and other low herbaceous vegetation , including <unk> purpureum , Angelica atropurpurea , and Aster spp . In addition , watercress <unk> <unk> increased after the 1993 flood event . Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92 cm above the ground and at 1 / 3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp . B. Vegetation is quite sparse on the west side of the Falls , and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp . B. In drier talus adjacent to the mossy areas are various plant species , such as eastern skunk cabbage <unk> <unk> and Angelica atropurpurea , upon which Succinea sp . B has also been found . During periods of heavy water flow , dew , or rain , when the vegetation is saturated , the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation . During drier times , both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm . In the patch of watercress , the vegetation is dense and lush . Although the watercress is dominant , other species include Angelica atropurpurea , jewelweed <unk> capensis and <unk> pallida , forget @-@ me @-@ nots Myosotis <unk> , various mints Mentha spp . , and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans , which again support Succinea sp . B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional <unk> , periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters . 
 Water quality : It may be fair to presume that clean water is necessary to maintain essential habitat and a healthy population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , just as it is to the survival of many other invertebrates ; however , since Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a terrestrial snail , the effects of water quality are expected to be somewhat indirect . While water quality may play a potential role in the success or decline of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , this relationship has not been clearly defined to date . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 The snails mate from May through July , and lay eggs from June through July . They are hermaphroditic ; however , it is unclear if self @-@ fertilization is possible . The eggs , numbering 8 to 14 , are approximately 2 mm in diameter , spherical , transparent , and very distinctive within a cluster . Generally , Novisuccinea chittenangoensis eggs are not found to have a heavy gelatinous layer surrounding the entire cluster , which is associated with egg masses of Succinea sp . B. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis egg clusters are deposited at the base of plants , under matted vegetation , or in loose , wet soil . The young snails hatch in 2 to 3 weeks , measuring barely 2 mm . It is still unclear when the snails mature , although Grimm ( 1981 ) believes they reach maturity in five to eight months , or the spring following hatching . At the end of their first full year of growth , snails observed by Aloi and Ringler ( 1982 ) averaged around 10 mm . By the end of the following year , the adult snails were observed to reach a length of approximately 21 mm ; they then die , completing a life span of about 2 @.@ 5 years . This life span is similar to those in captive populations ( Rosamond Gifford Zoo , unpublished data ) . 
 = = = Feeding habits = = = 
 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis apparently feed on microflora and must obtain high levels of calcium carbonate from their environment for proper shell formation . Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were generally found on green vegetation , whereas Succinea sp . B was more frequently found on dead vegetation . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Predators may include beetles and <unk> fly larvae , many of which specialize in feeding upon snails . Other potential predators may include the northern two @-@ lined salamander ( <unk> <unk> ) , northern dusky salamander ( Desmognathus fuscus ) , and Allegheny Mountain dusky salamander ( Desmognathus <unk> ) , which are common in the talus and on the ledges , as well as various small mammals or passerine birds such as robins and pigeons , which are often seen in or near the habitat . Although predation does not appear to be a limiting factor at this time , its potential impact on a low or stressed population is unclear . The 1978 listing rule included predation by the introduced European snails , Discus rotundatus and <unk> spp. as serious threats to Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . Little is currently known about this relationship . 
 = = = Interspecific relationships = = = 
 Interactions with Succinea sp . B may be having a significant impact on Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , as both species may be competing for food , breeding or wintering habitat . Hubricht ( 1985 ) reported that Succinea putris ( Succinea sp . B of Hoagland and Davis ) is a " very common species within its range . I found no other <unk> with it . It appears to crowd out all other species . " It does not appear that the other sympatric snail species ( e.g. , <unk> spp . ) occurring at the Falls are having a significant impact on Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , as they are thought to be native species . There are no reports of disease or parasites threatening Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . 
 = = Population size = = 
 Accurate population trends are not available for this species . The species was supposedly found " in great abundance " when a field party collected it in 1905 , but was not surveyed again until 1954 , when Hubricht found it in " equal abundance " with Novisuccinea ovalis . Grimm found Novisuccinea ovalis more abundant than Novisuccinea chittenangoensis during field surveys in 1964 , 1965 , and 1973 . In 1972 , Grimm estimated the total Novisuccinea chittenangoensis population at less than 200 , but Solem estimated it at about 500 in 1974 . Three investigators spent two hours searching the habitat in 1973 and located only 13 specimens ; a trip later that summer yielded none . Surveys by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Endangered Species Unit ( beginning in 1976 ) generally uncovered only a few shells or living animals during annual trips , although an intensive search in July 1981 , with Grimm 's assistance , yielded 18 live individuals . 
 Past surveys are suspect , as Grimm ( 1981 ) and Hubricht ( 1985 ) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls . They surmise , rather , that earlier reported specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . However , a review of photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were collected at the Falls when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected . Apparently , Novisuccinea ovalis occurred at or near the Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats . Therefore , relative comparisons between the two species ' abundance is problematic and confusing . 
 During the summer of 1982 , Aloi and Ringler conducted a mark and recapture study in the patch of watercress where the snails appeared most densely . Using two methods ( Jolly and Schnabel ) and two models , they estimated a population of about 300 snails with a density of four snails per square meter of watercress habitat . These snails have subsequently been identified as Succinea sp . B , not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . A 1983 collection of 83 snails for use in electrophoretic studies resulted in removal of 24 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from the population ; unfortunately , their identity was not verified at the time of collection , on top of which Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was thought to be more abundant than it actually was . The population of Succinea sp . B expanded rapidly to an estimate of more than 3 @,@ 000 snails in 1984 , whereas counts of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 1984 indicated the presence of approximately 100 adults . Counts of live Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from 1995 to 2001 yielded an average of five adults per survey with a high of 12 adults in 2001 @.@ and post @-@ reproductive shell counts made at the end of each activity season from 1987 to 2001 generally identified 4 to 20 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis adults . Subsequent studies have shown that Succinea sp . B outnumbers Novisuccinea chittenangoensis by as much as 10 to 1 in the primary habitat areas . 
 In 2002 , the <unk> , ESF , and the USFWS increased the survey effort and conducted a mark @-@ release @-@ recapture study at the Falls . Sixteen surveys were conducted during the study period between July and October 2002 . The final population estimate using the Schumacher @-@ <unk> method was 183 individuals ( 95 percent C.I. : 145 – 222 individuals ) . Population size was also estimated on the basis of capture frequencies , with a final estimate of 206 individuals . Due to differences in survey intensity and questionable species identifications in years past , the validity and comparability of survey data over the 20 @-@ year period do not provide a sound basis for any accurate status statement . The protocol for the mark @-@ release @-@ recapture study was modified slightly and continued in 2003 , 2004 , and 2005 . The Novisuccinea chittenangoensis population was estimated to be 178 in 2003 and 680 in 2004 . Preliminary 2005 survey results show a population slightly larger than the 2004 estimate . 
 In addition to the wild population at Chittenango Falls State Park , efforts to establish captive populations began in 1990 . A captive Novisuccinea chittenangoensis colony was being maintained at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse , New York , however , the last remaining snails died in November 2002 . Other unsuccessful breeding programs were tried in 1990s : at ESF at Syracuse ; at the Wildlife Conservation Park / Bronx Zoo ; an early effort at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo ( then called the Burnet Park Zoo ) ; at the Seneca Park Zoo ( Rochester , New York ) ; and at the Buffalo Zoo . Further experiments are necessary in order to determine what the proper conditions are for maintaining a healthy captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was originally proposed as a Federal endangered species in April 1976 ( 41 FR <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , owing to an apparent decline in the species ’ population coupled with its extremely limited range . Ultimately , however , the species was listed as threatened in July 1978 ( 43 FR <unk> @-@ <unk> ) because of the presumed existence of a second colony in Tennessee and North Carolina . After listing , it was determined that the Tennessee / North Carolina snails were not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , and the Chittenango Falls colony remains the only known population of this species . In 1977 , the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( <unk> ) amended the " List of Endangered , Threatened and Special Concern Fish & Wildlife Species of New York State " to include Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered species in New York . 
 Approximately 57 @,@ 000 visitors come to the park each year for a variety of outdoor recreational activities . The 1978 final rule listing Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as threatened estimated that 60 percent of the habitat at Chittenango Falls was trampled by humans . Human disturbance also continues to threaten Novisuccinea chittenangoensis , although this has been greatly minimized by fencing of the snail 's habitat area at Chittenango Falls . The current strategy for recovering Novisuccinea chittenangoensis includes buffering the species against extinction by perpetuating the extant population at Chittenango Falls at a baseline size , and new attempts in maintaining multiple captive populations . 
 = USS West Bridge ( ID @-@ 2888 ) = 
 USS West Bridge ( ID @-@ 2888 ) was a cargo ship in the United States Navy during World War I. She was begun as SS War Topaz but was completed as SS West Bridge , though she was referred to in some publications under the spelling <unk> . After the ship was decommissioned from the Navy , the ship returned to civilian service as SS West Bridge , but was renamed SS Barbara Cates , and SS Pan Gulf over the course of her civilian career under American registry . Near the end of World War II , the ship was renamed SS Lermontov ( Russian : <unk> ) when she sailed under the Soviet flag . 
 West Bridge was one of the West ships , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) on the West Coast of the United States . The ship was launched in April 1918 and delivered to the U.S. Navy upon completion in May . After commissioning , USS West Bridge sailed from the Pacific Northwest to the East Coast of the United States and joined a convoy of cargo ships headed to France in August . After West Bridge suffered an engine breakdown at sea , the convoy was attacked by two German submarines and West Bridge was torpedoed and abandoned . A salvage crew from American destroyer Smith boarded the ship the following day , and , working with four tugs dispatched from France , successfully brought the ship into port . Four men received the Navy Cross for their efforts in saving West Bridge . 
 After seven months of repair , West Bridge resumed Navy service until her December 1919 decommissioning and return to the USSB . West Bridge was laid up for nearly seven years from 1922 to 1929 , when she was sold for service on an intercoastal cargo service under the name SS Barbara Cates . By 1938 , the ship had been renamed Pan Gulf for service with a subsidiary of the Waterman Steamship Company . During World War II , Pan Gulf made nine roundtrips between the United States and the United Kingdom without incident in wartime convoys . She also sailed between New York and ports on the Gulf Coast and in the Caribbean . In May 1945 , the ship was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend @-@ Lease . Renamed SS Lermontov , the ship sailed in support of the war and continued in civilian service for the Soviets until 1966 , when she was scrapped at Split . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 To replace shipping tonnage lost to German submarines during World War I , the British Shipping Controller sought newly built ships from American shipyards . As part of 700 @,@ 000 long tons ( 710 @,@ 000 t ) of shipping which had been ordered by March 1917 , an order for nine vessels of 8 @,@ 800 long tons deadweight ( DWT ) was placed with J. F. Duthie & Company of Seattle . Because the United States had not yet entered World War I , the Shipping Controller , to skirt neutrality laws , placed orders through various British shipping companies . Although the specific company that placed the order with Duthie is not reported in secondary sources , the company most often used for these orders was the Cunard Steamship Company . As one of the nine ships ordered , J. F. Duthie & Company laid down the keel of War Topaz as the eleventh ship begun at their shipyard . 
 On 6 August 1917 , the Emergency Fleet Corporation — an entity created by the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) shortly after the United States entered the war on 6 April and tasked with overseeing U.S. shipbuilding — requisitioned most ships under construction in the United States ; included among those was War Topaz . By the time of her 24 April 1918 launch , the ship had been renamed West Bridge , becoming one of the West ships , cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States . Just a bit over one month later , on 26 May , the finished West Bridge was delivered to the United States Navy . 
 As completed , the steel @-@ hulled ship was 409 feet 5 inches ( 124 @.@ 79 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) , 54 feet ( 16 @.@ 5 m ) abeam , and drew 24 feet 1 inch ( 7 @.@ 34 m ) . West Bridge had a displacement of 12 @,@ 200 long tons ( 12 @,@ 400 t ) , and her 29 @-@ foot @-@ 9 @-@ inch ( 9 @.@ 07 m ) -deep hold allowed the ship to be rated at 5 @,@ 799 gross register tons ( GRT ) . The ship was powered by a single triple @-@ expansion steam engine built by the Hooven , Owens , & Rentschler Company of Hamilton , Ohio . The engine , with cylinders of 24 1 ⁄ 2 , 41 1 ⁄ 2 , and 72 inches ( 62 , 105 , and 180 cm ) diameter with a 48 @-@ inch ( 120 cm ) stroke , was capable of generating up to 2 @,@ 500 horsepower ( 1 @,@ 900 kW ) , allowing the single screw propeller to move the ship at up 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ) . For her U.S. Navy service in World War I , West Bridge was equipped with one 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) and one 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) gun . 
 = = Military career = = 
 USS West Bridge ( ID @-@ 2888 ) was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 26 May with Lieutenant Commander Mortimer Hawkins , USNRF , in command . West Bridge took on an initial load of flour and departed 10 June for the East Coast . Along the way , the ship developed troubles with her engine , which required her to put in at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone for repairs . Getting under way again on 4 July , West Bridge sailed for New York , arriving on 16 July . 
 After refueling at New York , West Bridge joined Convoy HB @-@ 8 bound for France , sailing on 1 August in company with Navy cargo ship West Alsek , United States Army transport Montanan , and 13 others . Escorted by armed yacht Noma , destroyers Burrows and Smith , and French cruiser Marseillaise , the convoy was some 500 nautical miles ( 900 km ) west of its destination of Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer by the end of the day on 15 August . 
 = = = Torpedo attack = = = 
 At 17 : 40 , West Bridge 's engine broke down once again and her crew was unable to repair it . West Bridge , falling off the back of the convoy and adrift , signaled Marseillaise to request a tow . At sundown , shortly before 18 : 00 , Montanan — still in the convoy , which was by now some 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) ahead of West Bridge — was hit by one of three torpedoes launched by German submarine U @-@ 90 . Montanan began to settle and was quickly abandoned . On West Bridge , Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks . Noma sailed back to West Bridge , ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights , and stood by . At nearly the same time , U @-@ 107 approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship , scoring hits with both . The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold in the front of the ship , while the second hit amidships near the engine room . West Bridge immediately began listing to starboard , and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon the vessel . He and two crewmen remained behind until they felt sure that everyone else had departed . By the time they left the stricken ship , water was up to the gunwales and lapping at the well deck . 
 Immediately after the attack , Noma sped off to depth charge the submarine while sending an SOS for West Bridge , since the initial explosion destroyed the cargo ship 's wireless . Destroyer Burrows arrived to take on West Bridge 's survivors , who had situated themselves about a mile ( 2 km ) from the still @-@ floating West Bridge . After boarding the destroyer , a head count revealed that four men were missing , but it also turned up two female stowaways . 
 By the morning of 16 August , both Montanan and West Bridge were still afloat , albeit with decks awash . Despite attempts to get Montanan under tow , she foundered later in the morning . Meanwhile , Hawkins and his executive officer were taken by boat to West Bridge to assess her situation . After boarding the ship and finding three cargo holds and her engineering spaces completely flooded , Hawkins advised Burrows ' captain that the situation was hopeless and he would only be endangering his ship , crew , and the West Bridge survivors by remaining alongside . Consequently , Burrows departed for Brest , France , leaving destroyer Smith to stand by West Bridge . 
 A volunteer work and salvage party from Smith , led by Lieutenant Richard L. Conolly , and which included Chief Boatswain 's Mate John Henry <unk> , and Construction Mechanic , 3rd class Walter Homer Todd , boarded West Bridge and awaited four tugs which had been dispatched from Brest : the U.S. Navy tug Favorite , two French tugs , and one British tug . Over the course of the next five days , the tugs , joined by patrol yacht Isabel , slowly made their way to the French coast , eventually arriving at Brest . West Bridge was towed over 400 nautical miles ( 740 km ) with only 1 % buoyancy remaining . Conolly , <unk> , and Todd were each awarded the Navy Cross for their efforts in saving West Bridge ; W. W. Wotherspoon , the fleet salvage officer on Favorite was also honored with a Navy Cross , in part for his salvage efforts for West Bridge . 
 The extent of the damage and the condition of West Bridge led to some erroneous reports of her loss . News articles on 24 August in both The New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune reported the loss of West Bridge , and the mistaken information also made it into book form . Authors Benedict Crowell and Robert Forrest Wilson , in their work The Road to France : The Transportation of Troops and Military Supplies , 1917 – 1918 , repeat the misinformation about the loss of West Bridge . 
 After West Bridge underwent seven months of repairs , the ship resumed service with the NOTS through 1 December 1919 , at which time she was decommissioned and handed over to the USSB . 
 = = Interwar years = = 
 Little is known about West Bridge 's activities after her return to the USSB in 1919 , but in June 1922 she was laid up in Philadelphia , where she would remain for almost seven years . In March 1929 , the USSB approved the sale of West Bridge for $ 57 @,@ 000 to the Sudden and Christenson Steamship Company of San Francisco . By May , the ship had been renamed Barbara Cates and was slated for service on the intercoastal freight service of their Arrow Line , which sailed to the Pacific coast from Baltimore ; Norfolk , Virginia ; Savannah , Georgia ; and Jacksonville , Florida . The addition of Barbara Cates and other ships purchased around the same time allowed the Arrow Line to increase its sailings from fortnightly to once every ten days . Barbara Cates ' nine years with the Arrow Line were uneventful . 
 By October 1938 , the ship had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners , the Pan @-@ Atlantic Steamship Company , a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company . The Pan @-@ Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts , and it is likely that Pan Gulf called at typical Pan @-@ Atlantic ports such as Baltimore , Miami , Tampa , New Orleans , Philadelphia , New York , and Boston during this time . 
 In October 1941 , The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pan Gulf had become stuck in the mud off Governors Island after her crew misjudged how far to back out of her berth at the Army base there . The first , unsuccessful attempt to free Pan Gulf from her predicament involved eight tugs , but the ship did not budge . The newspaper , which had also reported that there was no apparent damage to Pan Gulf in the grounding , carried no further reports on the ship . 
 = = World War II and later career = = 
 After the United States entered World War II , Pan Gulf frequently sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic , as well as some in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico . Between April and September 1942 , Pan Gulf made two roundtrips from the U.S. to Liverpool . In September , the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on a load of bauxite in early November , and then sailed on to Galveston , Texas , before returning to New York in mid @-@ February 1943 . 
 In late February , Pan Gulf began the first of a further seven roundtrips to the United Kingdom over the next 21 months , when she sailed from New York in Convoy HX 228 for Halifax . In July , the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) purchased Pan Gulf from the Pan @-@ Atlantic Line , overpaying her value by some 16 times , according to Senator George Aiken ( R @-@ VT ) . 
 On 5 May 1945 , the USMC turned over Pan Gulf to the Far East Shipping Company ( FESCO ) of the Soviet Union under Lend @-@ Lease ; FESCO renamed the ship SS Lermontov ( Russian : <unk> , Russian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) after the poet Mikhail Lermontov . The Soviets armed the ship with a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) gun and other weapons and employed the ship in cargo duties in support of the war . 
 At war 's end , Lermontov remained with FESCO through 1950 . At that time she was transferred to the Black Sea Shipping Company , with which she remained into the 1960s , IMO <unk> . Lermontov was delivered to shipbreakers in Split on 26 June 1966 . 
 = The Doughnut = 
 " The Doughnut " is the nickname given to the headquarters of the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , a British cryptography and intelligence agency . It is located on a 71 @-@ hectare ( 176 @-@ acre ) site in <unk> , in the suburbs of Cheltenham , Gloucestershire , in South West England . The Doughnut houses 5 @,@ 500 employees ; GCHQ is the largest single employer in Gloucestershire . Built to modernise and consolidate GCHQ 's multiple buildings in Cheltenham , The Doughnut was completed in 2003 , and GCHQ moved into the building in 2004 . It is the largest building constructed for secret intelligence operations outside the United States . The Doughnut was too small for the number of staff at its completion , and a second building in a secret and undisclosed location in the ' Gloucestershire area ' now also accommodates staff from GCHQ . The Doughnut is surrounded by car and bicycle parking in concentric rings , and well protected by security . 
 The construction of the building was financed by a private finance initiative and construction costs were greatly increased after difficulties in transferring computer infrastructure to the building . The building is modern in design and built primarily from steel , aluminium , and stone . 
 = = Background = = 
 The construction of the Doughnut in 2003 consolidated the operations previously spread across two sites into a single location , replacing more than 50 buildings in the process . The last staff from the nearby GCHQ site at Oakley were transferred to the Doughnut in late 2011 . 
 The design of the Doughnut reflects GCHQ 's intended new mode of work after the end of the Cold War , with its design facilitating talking among staff , and between them and the Director of GCHQ and his subordinates . It was estimated that anyone in the building could reach any other worker within five minutes . The director of GCHQ has no office ; in 2014 director Iain Lobban described his desk as being located " within the shouting distance of lawyers " . 
 At a cost of £ <unk> , the construction of the Doughnut was funded by a private finance initiative ( PFI ) put forward by a collective that included British facilities management and construction company Carillion , the Danish security company Group 4 / Falck ( now <unk> ) , and the British telecommunications company BT Group . The consortium are scheduled to be paid £ 800m to maintain the Doughnut for 30 years . The creation of the Doughnut was the largest PFI project to date for the British government . The building was designed by the British architect Chris Johnson for the American architectural firm Gensler , and constructed and built by Carillion . 
 In 2004 the chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee , Edward Leigh , criticised the increasing cost of GCHQ 's move to the Doughnut . Leigh said that " It was astonishing GCHQ did not realise the extent of what would be involved much sooner " . Leigh had said in 2003 that GCHQ 's original estimate for the cost of the move was " staggeringly inaccurate " . 
 For security reasons , GCHQ moved its own computers and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut , which caused the cost of its move to increase from £ 41m to £ <unk> over two years . The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost more than three times their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers . HM Treasury paid £ <unk> toward a newly agreed budget of £ <unk> , having initially refused to finance the original high figure . The final cost of GCHQ 's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate . 
 The complexity of the computer network at GCHQ was responsible for the increase in costs . Issues with the network were found while preparing computers for the " Millennium bug " . Simply shutting down each computer individually before restarting them in the Doughnut would have left GCHQ unable to complete key intelligence work for two years , while moving their electronics according to the original schedule without " unacceptable damage " to intelligence gathering would cost £ <unk> . In a review of GCHQ 's move in 2003 , the National Audit Office said government ministers might never have approved the consolidation of facilities had the final cost been known . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Doughnut is divided into three separate four @-@ storey structures , identical in design and connected at the top and bottom . With a total floor area of 140 @,@ 000 square metres ( 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , the building contains two circular blocks , internally divided by a " street " covered in glass . Construction materials were primarily steel , aluminium , and stone , particularly granite and local limestone from the Cotswolds ; designers incorporated recycled materials in the steelwork and the construction of desks . The design of the Doughnut was subsequently nominated for an award to " highlight improvements to the built and landscaped environment " given by Cheltenham 's Civic Society . 
 A circular walkway named " The Street " runs throughout the building . An open @-@ air garden courtyard lies in the middle of the Doughnut ; this garden is large enough to contain the Royal Albert Hall . The courtyard has a memorial to GCHQ staff who have been killed on active service ; some five staff died in the War in Afghanistan . Below the garden are banks of supercomputers . The Doughnut is 21 metres ( 70 ft ) high and 180 metres ( 600 ft ) in diameter . Individual spaces in the Doughnut include the 24 / 7 / 365 area where people working in " ... small 12 @-@ hour shifts monitor GCHQ systems and news bulletins . " The ' Action On ' programme enables the 24 / 7 / 365 staff to act " quickly and freely " to supply information to British armed forces to help their operations . The Doughnut 's Internet Ops Centre ( <unk> ) , is where " the best technical capabilities [ are matched ] with the most urgent operational requirements " according to Charles Moore who visited the Doughnut in 2014 for the Daily Telegraph . 
 The structure of the Doughnut is designed to minimise any potential effect of a fire or a terrorist attack on the building ; it also includes independent power generators which can supply power to the facilities in an emergency . About 3 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 850 mi ) of fibre optics were installed in the Doughnut by British Telecom , and about 10 @,@ 000 km ( 6 @,@ 000 mi ) of electrical wiring were used in the building . 
 The Doughnut is surrounded by car and bicycle parking in concentric rings , guarded by a two @-@ metre metal fence and half a dozen vehicle checkpoints . The Doughnut is served by an underground road . 
 Facilities available to staff at the Doughnut include a 600 @-@ seat restaurant , shops , a gym , and a prayer or quiet room . Exhibits from the history of GCHQ are displayed throughout the building , including the radios used by the Portland Spy Ring . 
 = = History = = 
 The Doughnut was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 2004 . The then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Gordon Brown , visited the Doughnut in 2008 , and praised the staff working there in a speech . The Doughnut has twice been visited by Charles , Prince of Wales , since its opening . Charles was accompanied by Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall in 2011 , on his second visit to the Doughnut . 
 The Doughnut was already too small for the number of GCHQ staff at its completion , as a vast expansion in the number of employees had occurred as a consequence of the September 11 attacks in 2001 . The staff numbered almost 6 @,@ 500 by 2008 . The addition of a two @-@ storey office block and a three @-@ story car park to the Doughnut was proposed in 2008 , but eventually suspended in 2011 . The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ 's former site at Oakley . Though it was initially felt that the Doughnut would be adequate for the new staff , 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the ' Gloucestershire area ' . The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused ' annoyance ' among local residents in <unk> . It was believed that the arrival of new staff may have further affected local parking but GCHQ stated the presence of the new employees would have been offset by redundancies . 
 Access to the Doughnut is rarely granted to representatives from the media , but it was visited for the March 2010 BBC Radio 4 documentary GCHQ : Cracking the Code , by The Sun newspaper in December 2010 , by Charles Moore for an interview with GCHQ director Iain Lobban for the Daily Telegraph in October 2014 , and by historian and writer Ben Macintyre who visited the Doughnut for a series of articles for The Times in October 2015 in anticipation of the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill .

The Doughnut was illuminated with yellow light to mark GCHQ staff 's support for Guide Dogs and by a spectrum of colours to mark the International Day Against Homophobia , <unk> and <unk> .

 " And I 'm Joyce Kinney " was broadcast on January 16 , 2011 , as a part of an animated television night on Fox , and was preceded by American Dad ! , The Simpsons and the second episode of the animated series Bob 's Burgers . It was followed by Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane 's spin @-@ off , The Cleveland Show . Family Guy was watched by 7 @.@ 08 million viewers , according to Nielsen ratings , despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC , Undercover Boss on CBS and the Golden Globe Awards on NBC . The episode also acquired a 3 @.@ 7 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , beating American Dad ! , The Simpsons , Bob 's Burgers and The Cleveland Show , in addition to significantly edging out all four shows in total viewership . The episode 's ratings decreased significantly from the previous week 's episode , largely due to the lead @-@ in that had been provided by the NFL Wild Card game that preceded the " Animation Domination " line @-@ up . 
 Television critics reacted with mixed reaction toward the episode , with one critic calling the storyline " pretty dull . " In a simultaneous review of the episodes of American Dad ! , The Simpsons and Bob 's Burgers that preceded the show , and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it , The A.V. Club 's Rowan Kaiser wrote , " I don 't have much to say about tonight 's Family Guy . Last week , we had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season . That didn 't happen this week at all . " Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school , stating , " Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating , if you 're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent . " He concluded his review by praising " the burning bush " joke , and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating , the worst rating of the night . It was beaten by the American Dad ! episode " Fart @-@ Break Hotel " , The Cleveland Show episode " How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta ? " , The Simpsons episode " Flaming Moe " , and the Bob 's Burgers episode " Crawl Space " . In a slightly more positive review of the episode , Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its " silly side jokes , " but felt disappointed by the ending to the show , commenting , " it didn 't follow any real logic [ ... ] It was an easy way out , as if they 'd written themselves into a corner . " Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags , writing , " at least there were some funnier moments in this one . Unfortunately , a lot of those came in the cutaways . And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them . " Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star , adding that " it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star . " 
 The episode was among four other episodes submitted by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination , in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category . " And I 'm Joyce Kinney " was submitted , along with " Halloween on Spooner Street " , " Road to the North Pole " , " New Kidney in Town " and " Trading Places " . The series was successfully nominated in 2009 , but failed to merit an award . Mark Hentemann , executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process , " We had internal discussions in the writers ' room , and it seemed like we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children 's shows in animation . We assumed we would not get anywhere , and so it was a great surprise when we got the nomination . " 
 = O Street Market = 
 O Street Market , also known as Northern Market , is a historic structure located at 1400 7th Street NW in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington , D.C. Built in 1881 , it is one of three 19th @-@ century public market buildings still standing in the city , along with Eastern Market and Georgetown Market . The market was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1968 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 . The most distinctive architectural element of the Gothic Revival building is its corner tower on 7th and O Streets . 
 For decades , the market was a vital shopping destination for area residents . Following World War II , the market and surrounding neighborhood began to deteriorate . The building was slightly damaged during the 1968 Washington , D.C. , riots , but was restored and reopened in 1980 . Renovations were to begin in 2003 , but in February of that year , the building 's roof collapsed under snow following a historic blizzard . A decade later , the rehabilitated building reopened as part of a $ 325 million mixed @-@ use development , CityMarket at O.

 Following the Civil War , local government officials led by Board of Public Works head Alexander " Boss " Shepherd sought to change the image of Washington , D.C. , as a small , unattractive city . Among the many improvements Shepherd planned was the replacement of the city 's existing public markets with new , brick facilities in heavily populated neighborhoods . One of the older markets , Northern Liberties Market at Mount Vernon Square , was razed in 1872 . Many vendors refused to leave the market and several were killed during the demolition . With the help of businessmen , other vendors started the Northern Liberty Market Company ( NLMC ) , which in 1875 opened a new public market at 5th and K Streets NW , in what is the present @-@ day Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood . 
 Shepherd nevertheless moved ahead with plans for a city @-@ owned public market , and allocated land for the facility on the southwest corner of Square 446 ( a city block bounded by 6th , 7th , O , and P Streets NW ) . As he did with many citywide improvement projects , Shepherd awarded contracts to businesses in which he owned large amounts of stock . After this corrupt practice was discovered , Shepherd was relieved of his post and many of the city projects he spearheaded were abandoned — including the new market . 
 The Northern Liberties Market struggled financially , as many residents found it too far from the commercial district on 7th Street . The NLMC sought to relocate , and in 1881 purchased the southwest corner of Square 422 ( a city block bounded by 7th , 8th , O , and P Streets NW ) . Butcher Michael Hoover owned Square 422 in the early 1800s and sold it to printer Andrew Rothwell about 1845 . Rothwell made many improvements to the property and added gardens which became popularly known as Rothwell 's Gardens . The NLMC applied for building permits for a $ 15 @,@ 000 ( $ 367 @,@ 810 in 2016 dollars ) , one @-@ story brick building on May 31 , 1881 . The permit was signed by NLMC president Jesse B. Wilson . The new building was named O Street Market to avoid confusion with the company 's other markets .

 The area surrounding the O Street Market , known as Shaw , was demographically mixed . The white population included a large number of German immigrants , many of whom were vendors at the market . 7th Street NW was the heart of the city 's Jewish community , and a significant number of African Americans lived in the neighborhood . The market continued to thrive even as the demographic and retail nature of the area neighborhood dramatically changed . By the 1920s , Shaw was overwhelmingly black , black vendors had supplanted the German American retailers at the market , and black @-@ owned and operated businesses formed new retail corridors along 7th , 9th , and 14th Streets between P and U Streets . The market and Shaw neighborhood both deteriorated after World War II . By the 1960s , the market faced heavy competition from modern grocery stores and fell into disrepair . Local residents picketed the market , which led the city to enforce cleanliness regulations and building codes at the facility . 
 In 1966 , the District of Columbia , the National Capital Planning Commission , and the Redevelopment Land Agency ( RLA ; a joint city @-@ federal agency overseeing redevelopment in the city ) announced the establishment of the Shaw Urban Renewal Area . The 1968 riots caused only minor damage to the building , but the market did not reopen afterward . The closure of the market and many other nearby businesses caused a widespread decline in the neighborhood , and left local residents without easy access to retail establishments . In 1972 , the Council of the District of Columbia approved a $ 30 @.@ 4 million ( $ 185 @.@ 2 million in 2016 dollars ) plan which , in part , provided for the purchase the O Street Market and its demolition . A modern shopping mall was planned for the site . The RLA purchased the property from the NLMC . Although neighborhood residents wanted the market torn down , the RLA declined to order its destruction . In 1974 , the RLA proposed renovating the O Street Market and making it the retail centerpiece of a revived Shaw neighborhood . The agency awarded a $ 338 @,@ 974 ( $ 1 @,@ 626 @,@ 481 in 2016 dollars ) contract in June 1974 to the firm of James Cox & Sons to renovate the structure . 
 In 1977 , local African American entrepreneur James C. Adkins purchased the market and the rest of Square 422 for $ 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 780 @,@ 999 in 2016 dollars ) . Adkins began construction on a modern grocery store next to the O Street Market , and won a $ 1 @.@ 75 million ( $ 68 @.@ 3 million in 2016 dollars ) loan from the federal Economic Development Administration to help renovate the 1881 market building . Adkins said he would add stalls inside and outside the market and lease them to food and other vendors . Renovation of the historic structure was more costly than anticipated , and Adkins was forced to seek an additional $ 300 @,@ 000 ( $ 978 @,@ 129 in 2016 dollars ) in 1979 to complete its rehabilitation . Adkins , who had also purchased Square 426 , successfully petitioned the National Capital Planning Commission to close 8th Street between P and O Streets NW . Adkins planned to turn the street into a pedestrian mall , parking lot , and landscaped area . Giant Food opened on October 10 , 1979 , and the O Street Market reopened on February 23 , 1980 . 
 On March 31 , 1994 , during the two @-@ decade crime wave of the 1980s and 1990s , the O Street Market was the site of a deadly shooting rampage . Seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Kevin Aaron McCrimmon paid five young men to kill 15 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> A 'Vant , who was known to frequent the market , because A 'Vant had reportedly stolen a car from McCrimmon . At around 7 pm , the five men entered the market and fired more than 30 rounds , killing A 'Vant and wounding eight others ( including a toddler and two elderly women ) . Although there were 399 homicides in the city that year , the event shocked residents because it was such a brazen attack in a public place . 
 By the late 1990s , the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated . The structure fell into disrepair , trash collected around the building , many vendors were squatters without leases , and drug dealers and gang members loitered nearby , driving customers away . The building 's owner fell behind on tax payments , and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose . 
 Because O Street Market is one of only three 19th @-@ century public market buildings remaining in Washington , D.C. , it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 28 , 1995 . It was previously added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on July 24 , 1968 .

 In 2001 , local firm Roadside Development purchased the building with plans to rehabilitate the facility along with the Madison Retail Group . They proposed the partial closure of a 40 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 12 m ) plaza on 8th Street to be replaced with a sidewalk , parking lot , and retail space , and for the addition of new windows in the walls . The D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board refused to authorize these changes , but the renovation of the interior was approved . The last tenants , consisting of small restaurants and shops , vacated the structure in late 2002 in preparation for remodeling set to begin in March or April 2003 . On February 18 , 2003 , following a historic blizzard , the roof collapsed . 
 Redevelopment of the O Street Market was delayed for two years as the developers sought to meet the demands imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board . Community leaders and neighborhood residents regularly called for the project to resume in hopes that it would spur other development and decrease gang activity in the area . 
 Roadside Development proposed a significantly expanded redevelopment in June 2004 that included most of Square 422 . The company determined that the only way to make the O Street Market viable was to greatly enhance parking at the site . It could not do so without building extensive underground parking , and to build the parking garage would require construction of new buildings adjacent to the O Street Market and the Giant Food grocery store . The company initially proposed a $ 100 million project consisting of new construction and renovations which would add condominiums , apartments , a two @-@ story underground parking garage , and either a new or renovated grocery store . By March 2005 , when Roadside Development won its first design and zoning approval reviews , the plan had expanded into a $ 260 million project which included a 180 @-@ room hotel , 300 condominiums , 300 apartments , 700 underground parking spaces , and 7 @,@ 500 square feet ( 700 m2 ) of new retail space . The O Street Market would be restored , renovated and incorporated into a new 65 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 6 @,@ 000 m2 ) Giant Food store . The proposal also called for the city to reopen 8th Street NW .
