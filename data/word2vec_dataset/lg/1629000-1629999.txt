 In Mauritius , a total of 200 people evacuated to storm shelters due to the cyclone . The island was under a Cyclone Warning Class III for 36 hours , and for a few more hours it was under a Cyclone Warning Class IV , the latter meaning wind gusts of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) were reported or expected . Prior to the storm affecting the area , officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban . Due to the threat of the storm , several flights in and out of Mauritius , Réunion , and Rodrigues were canceled . Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea .

 On midday February 23 , Cyclone Gamede moved over St. Brandon island , where a pressure of 960 mbar was recorded . 
 The cyclone affected the country of Mauritius on February 25 . Power was knocked out to 70 % of the island 's population , and some light infrastructure damage was also reported . Food crops were also affected . Despite warnings to remain inside , several people ventured outside during the storm . Gamede killed two on Mauritius , including one who drowned in high waves . 
 The large size of the cyclone resulted in several days of very heavy , continuous rainfall in the mountainous region on Réunion island . The island is the location for several tropical cyclone rainfall records ; due to the <unk> of the island , tropical moisture will travel upward to the volcanic peaks , where it cools and codifies into rainfall . The heaviest totals occurred from February 24 through February 28 . Commerson 's Crater , located at an elevation of 2 @.@ 3 km ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) , reported <unk> mm ( 97 in ) in 48 hours , which is just short of the worldwide record set by an unnamed tropical cyclone in April 1958 . Gamede broke worldwide rainfall records between three and nine days , with its total precipitation amounting to <unk> mm ( 217 in ) in Commerson 's Crater ; Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 remains the wettest tropical cyclone on record , having produced greater totals after ten days . Several locations on the island reported great totals . In a 24 ‑ hour period , Hell @-@ Bourg reported 1489 mm ( 58 @.@ 6 in ) , and in a 72 ‑ hour period , Cilaos reported 2321 mm ( 91 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 The passage of the cyclone left about 100 @,@ 000 homes without power or water on Réunion . The rainfall caused some flood damage , and the combination of precipitation and strong winds caused heavy crop damage , including to the sugar cane and banana crops . Several roads and bridges were damaged on the island . A 520 m ( 1700 ft ) bridge over the Saint Etienne River collapsed near Saint @-@ Louis , with the cost estimated at € 20 million ( 2007 EUR , $ 26 million 2007 USD ) . The bridge , which carried about 50 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , collapsed as river flow increased from the heavy rainfall ; two towns were left temporarily isolated due to the incident . Two people died on the island after attempting to cross rivers during the storm . Nine people were injured on the island , including two who were seriously injured . A peak wind gust of 205 km / h ( 127 mph ) was reported on the island . On June 13 , 2007 , the government of France provided a relief fund to Réunion of € 17 @.@ 6 million ( 2007 EUR ) in aid , including € 9 @.@ 6 million for farmers affected by the cyclone . The assistance provided € 7 @.@ 7 million for repairing roads and infrastructure , including rebuilding the destroyed bridge over the Saint Etienne River . In the immediate aftermath of the storm , officials deployed army resources to establish a temporary aerial bridge while a new bridge was built . 
 Rough waves and strong winds affected a cruise ship to the east of Madagascar ; several windows were broken , though no serious injuries were reported . Along Madagascar 's east coast , Gamede produced squally rain and winds . Gamede had followed shortly after Tropical Cyclones Bondo , Clovis , and Favio , being the fourth tropical cyclone to impact Madagascar in two months . 
 = Sam Allardyce = 
 Samuel " Sam " Allardyce ( / <unk> / ) ( born 19 October 1954 ) , known as " Big Sam " , is an English football manager and former professional player who is manager of the English national team . 
 Allardyce made 578 league and cup appearances in a 21 @-@ year career spent mostly in the Football League , as well as brief spells in the North American Soccer League and League of Ireland . A strong central defender , he had good awareness , heading skills and anticipation . He was signed by Bolton Wanderers from Dudley Town in 1969 and spent nine years at Bolton , helping the club to win the Second Division title in 1977 – 78 . He spent the 1980s as a journeyman player , spending time with Sunderland , Millwall , Tampa Bay Rowdies , Coventry City , Huddersfield Town , Bolton Wanderers ( for a second spell ) , Preston North End , and West Bromwich Albion ( also working as assistant manager ) . During this time he helped Preston to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1986 – 87 . 
 Moving into management , he took charge of Irish club Limerick in 1991 , leading the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 1991 – 92 . He returned to England to coach at Preston North End , also serving briefly as caretaker @-@ manager . He took up his first permanent management role in England at Blackpool in July 1994 , but was sacked after two years having narrowly failed to achieve promotion . He spent January 1997 to October 1999 in charge at Notts County , taking them to the Third Division title in 1997 – 98 . He then returned to Bolton Wanderers as manager , leading the club to promotion out of the First Division via the play @-@ offs in 2001 , as well as a League Cup final and UEFA Cup qualification . Following a spell at Newcastle United from May 2007 to January 2008 , Allardyce managed Blackburn Rovers for a two @-@ year spell from December 2008 . He was appointed West Ham United manager in June 2011 , leading the club to promotion out of the Championship via the play @-@ offs in 2012 , before leaving West Ham in May 2015 after criticism from fans over his playing style . He was appointed Sunderland manager in October 2015 and saved the club from relegation . He was appointed as manager of the English national team in July 2016 . 
 Allardyce has been labelled as a long ball manager by some analysts , though has disputed this perception as " totally and utterly wrong " . He takes a modern , technology and statistics centred approach to tactics and coaching , and has been praised for his organisational and man @-@ management skills . He has been married since June 1974 , and has two children . In September 2006 , Allardyce , and his son , Craig , were implicated in a BBC Panorama documentary for taking " bungs " ( bribes ) ; they strongly denied the allegations and have never been charged with any offences . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Samuel Allardyce was born in October 1954 in a council house on the Old Park Farm Estate , Dudley , the son of Robert Allardyce ( 1916 – 1989 ) and Mary Agnes Allardyce ( 1918 – 1991 ) . His father was a police sergeant . Both parents originated from Scotland . He has an older sister , Mary , born in Scotland in 1939 and an older brother , Robert junior , born in 1951 . Allardyce was educated at Sycamore Green Primary School and later at Mons Hill School , failing his Eleven plus exam . He discovered in later life that he suffers from dyslexia . As a child , he supported Wolverhampton Wanderers and dreamed that one day he would play at and manage the club .

 = = = Bolton Wanderers = = = 
 Allardyce spent his youth with semi @-@ professional side Dudley Town , making his debut at the age of 14 he quickly learned how to play centre @-@ half in the highly physical West Midlands ( Regional ) League . He trained with local Football League clubs West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers , and had an unsuccessful trial with Aston Villa . He was spotted by Bolton Wanderers just before leaving school at the age of 15 , and signed an apprenticeship with the club . To supplement his income before officially starting his apprenticeship he worked in a factory producing record decks . The Bolton under @-@ 18s were very successful , winning the Lancashire Youth Cup and reaching the quarter @-@ finals of the FA Youth Cup , and Allardyce quickly rose through the B @-@ team into the A @-@ team . He signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday , receiving a £ 125 signing on fee and wages of £ 14 a week . 
 Manager Jimmy Armfield gave Allardyce his debut for the " Trotters " on 6 November 1973 , in a 2 – 1 defeat League Cup to Millwall at Burnden Park . He made his Second Division debut eleven days later , in a 2 – 1 defeat to Notts County . However he failed to establish himself in the first team under Armfield , and only got a run of games under new manager Ian Greaves , who played Allardyce in the last ten games of the 1974 – 75 season after he sold Don McAllister to Tottenham Hotspur . He impressed during this short run , winning himself the club 's Young Player of the Year award . 
 Bolton lost to Newcastle United after two replays in the FA Cup Fifth Round in the 1975 – 76 season , and went on to miss out on promotion out of the league by a single point . They suffered similar disappointment in the 1976 – 77 campaign , reaching the semi @-@ finals of the League Cup , and again finished just one point outside the promotion places . Promotion was finally achieved in the 1977 – 78 season , as Bolton returned to the First Division as champions of the Second Division . Bolton consolidated their top @-@ flight status with a 17th @-@ place finish in 1978 – 79 . However the 1979 – 80 season proved difficult , and manager Greaves was sacked as the club went seven months without a league victory , whilst his replacement Stan Anderson was unable to steer the club away from relegation and a last @-@ place finish . Allardyce decided to leave Bolton at the end of the season as he felt that he was underpaid at Bolton and did not get on with Anderson . 
 = = = Sunderland and Millwall = = = 
 Allardyce was offered a contract by Norwich City manager John Bond , but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County , and he verbally agreed a three @-@ year contract with Derby . However , before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £ 300 a week contract with a £ 20 @,@ 000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton . Knighton appointed him as club captain . However Allardyce soon wearied of the long @-@ distance travel from Sunderland to his home in Bolton , and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland . Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980 – 81 season , leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone . New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team at the start of the 1981 – 82 campaign , leaving Allardyce 's departure from Roker Park inevitable . 
 He was offered the chance to return to Bolton Wanderers , but manager George Mulhall was only able to offer 50 % of Allardyce 's wages at Sunderland . Instead he made a surprise £ 95 @,@ 000 move to Third Division side Millwall , who were able to match Sunderland 's wages and also pay out a £ 30 @,@ 000 signing on fee and a £ 10 @,@ 000 loyalty bonus . Millwall player @-@ manager Peter Anderson had seen Allardyce as the successor to long @-@ serving central defender Barry Kitchener , and as Anderson was also a property developer he allowed Allardyce to live rent free in a six @-@ bedroom mansion . The " Lions " ended the 1981 – 82 season in mid @-@ table , and Anderson was sacked in November 1982 . Chairman Alan Thorne offered Allardyce the vacant management position , but Allardyce rejected the offer as he felt that at aged 28 he was far too young to enter management . Instead it was George Graham who took up his first management position , and Graham immediately froze Allardyce out of the first team on both matchdays and training after Allardyce insisted that he would not report teammates who broke Graham 's rules . He came close to joining Charlton Athletic on a free transfer in March 1983 , but Charlton boss Lennie Lawrence did not complete the move before the end of the transfer deadline . Graham agreed to pay Allardyce £ 15 @,@ 000 to cancel his contract , acting under the assumption that Allardyce would struggle to find a club willing to offer him £ 300 a week . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Allardyce wrote to every club in the top two divisions to inform them he was available on a free transfer , and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons . Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies , a club that shared facilities with the NFL 's Tampa Bay Buccaneers . Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training , player management and tactics . He found playing difficult however , due to the heat and the all @-@ out attacking nature of his teammates , which led to him being frequently exposed at the back , though he found that the club 's <unk> managed to cure a long @-@ standing hamstring scar tissue problem . 
 Upon returning to the UK he joined Bobby Gould 's First Division Coventry City on a one @-@ year £ 300 a week contract . He was made captain , and though Coventry enjoyed a good first half to the 1983 – 84 season they faltered badly in the second half of the season and finished just one place and two points above the relegation zone after beating Norwich City on the final day of the season . Midway through the campaign Gould had promised him a new two @-@ year contract , but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce . 
 In July 1984 , he was signed by Mick Buxton at Second Division Huddersfield Town . The move reunited him with Paul Jones , his former centre @-@ half partner at Bolton . Huddersfield finished in 13th place in the 1984 – 85 season , and at the end of the campaign accepted an offer of £ 15 @,@ 000 from Bolton Wanderers , who offered Allardyce a three @-@ year contract . Bolton were then managed by Charlie Wright , who was the goalkeeper at Allardyce 's first spell with the club . However Wright was sacked in December 1985 , and his successor , Phil Neal , did not get along with Allardyce . Neal played himself at centre @-@ half and relegated Allardyce to the bench , despite Neal being a full @-@ back . Bolton reached the 1986 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium , which ended in a 3 – 0 defeat to Bristol City , with Allardyce as an unused substitute . 
 Allardyce was offered the chance to join Tranmere Rovers , but instead joined Preston North End after being persuaded by manager John McGrath , who promised to make Allardyce the backbone of his team . Preston won promotion out of the Fourth Division in second @-@ place in 1986 – 87 ( Allardyce was also named on the PFA Team of the Year ) , and consolidated their Third Division status with a 16th @-@ place finish in 1987 – 88 . By this time Allardyce began considering his retirement as a player , and applied to management positions at York City and Notts County , and had an unsuccessful interview with Doncaster Rovers . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Bolton fans gave him the nickname " Super Sam Bionic Man " due to his tough tackling approach and the way he quickly got up after heavy collisions whilst the opposition player would be left flat on the ground . Veteran manager Dave Bassett , a friend of Allardyce , once humorously remarked that " He was what I called a ball @-@ playing defender ... If he wasn 't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls . " He was uncomfortable in possession , and played simple balls to his nearest teammates when he found himself with the ball , whilst teammates would be reluctant to pass to him . He did however possess good awareness and heading skills , and his anticipation made up for his lack of pace .

 Allardyce was hired as a player @-@ coach by Brian Talbot at West Bromwich Albion in February 1989 . He spent most of the rest of the 1988 – 89 season at The Hawthorns managing and playing for the reserve team , before being promoted to first team coach in the summer , in a move that saw former first team coach Stuart Pearson demoted to reserve team coaching . Allardyce and Talbot were sacked in January 1991 following a defeat to Isthmian League side Woking in the FA Cup . He later worked as a part @-@ time coach at Bury , but manager Mike Walsh could not afford to keep him on the staff for the 1989 – 90 season . 
 Allardyce then took up the role of player @-@ manager of Limerick , and guided the team to promotion into the top @-@ flight of the League of Ireland by finishing top of the First Division in 1991 – 92 . They achieved promotion despite tremendous financial pressures , with Allardyce coaching and playing for the first team whilst the club board signed players as Allardyce had no knowledge of the Irish football scene . 
 After his season in Ireland , Allardyce returned to England for the start of the 1992 – 93 season to coach at Preston North End under Les Chapman . Ten games into the season , however , Chapman was sacked and Allardyce was appointed caretaker manager . Despite a promising spell in charge , Allardyce did not get the job on a permanent basis , and in December 1992 Preston appointed John Beck as manager . Allardyce worked as youth team coach for 18 months , but later said the extreme long ball tactics Beck enforced upon the club were " indefensible " . 
 = = = Blackpool = = = 
 In July 1994 , Blackpool , West Lancashire derby rivals to Preston North End , appointed Allardyce as their new manager following the departure of Billy Ayre , agreeing a salary of £ 18 @,@ 000 a year . He signed defender Darren Bradshaw , midfielder Micky Mellon and spent a club record £ 245 @,@ 000 on Andy Morrison , who Allardyce described as a " horrible in @-@ your @-@ face " centre @-@ back and a " complete nutter " . He also changed the club 's backroom staff , hiring Bobby Saxton as his assistant , promoting player Phil Brown to a coaching role , and appointing Mark Taylor as physio , who would follow Allardyce to Blackburn and Newcastle . Blackpool finished the 1994 – 95 season in 12th place after falling out of the promotion race with just one win in their final 11 games . 
 He spent £ 200 @,@ 000 on striker Andy Preece , and also brought in young defender Jason Lydiate and goalkeeper Steve Banks for the 1995 – 96 campaign . Blackpool finished third , missing out on automatic promotion on the last day of the season , and were beaten in the play @-@ off semi @-@ finals by Bradford City . They had won 2 – 0 away at Valley Parade , only to lose 3 – 0 in the return leg at Bloomfield Road . Chairman Owen Oyston , while he was in a prison cell , sacked Allardyce shortly after the play @-@ off defeat . Allardyce then had a brief spell on the coaching staff under Peter Reid at Sunderland , working as director of the academy . 
 " We had missed promotion to the First Division by a point . Yet it had all been done on next @-@ to @-@ nothing , and during the months leading towards the end of the season , I hardly ever saw Owen Oyston . But he always assured me that , no matter what , my job would be safe . I turned up for that meeting having been told it was to discuss new terms . Instead , I was told that I was being sacked . It was cold , calculated , pre @-@ planned , whatever . I walked out of there with ₤ 10 @,@ 000 , no job , and desperately worried that my reputation would be damaged forever . " 
 = = = Notts County = = = 
 In January 1997 , Allardyce made his return to football as manager of struggling Division Two club Notts County . He arrived too late to save them from relegation in 1996 – 97 , and in his autobiography described how the players " would not respond " to his coaching methods as they went 18 games without a win and pressure mounted on Allardyce . However he held on to his job , and led the club to promotion as champions of Division Three at the end of the 1997 – 98 season , built upon a three @-@ man defence and a mid @-@ season run of ten consecutive wins . County broke several club and national records , winning the title by a 19 @-@ point margin and becoming the first post @-@ war side to win promotion in March . 
 Despite the success , chairman Derek <unk> refused to spend money on transfers , and as a result fell out with Allardyce . Allardyce was eventually allowed to spend £ 50 @,@ 000 on striker Kevin Rapley , who helped the club to steer clear of relegation at the end of the 1998 – 99 campaign . In the summer he signed midfielder Craig Ramage and utility player Clayton Blackmore . Allardyce remained in charge at Meadow Lane until 14 October 1999 , when he resigned his post at Notts County to return to Bolton Wanderers .

 Allardyce was appointed manager of Bolton Wanderers following Colin Todd 's departure , who had resigned in protest at the sale of Per Frandsen as the club attempted to raise funds for the new Reebok Stadium . He inherited a talented squad , which included Eiður Guðjohnsen , Jussi Jääskeläinen , Mark Fish , Claus Jensen , Dean Holdsworth , Bo Hansen , Michael Johansen , and Ricardo Gardner . However he was forced to sell Andy Todd , son of Colin Todd , after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown 's jaw in a team bonding session . Despite being in the bottom half of the table when he took over , Bolton reached the 1999 – 2000 Division One play @-@ offs , losing to Ipswich Town , and had an eventful run to the League Cup and FA Cup semi @-@ finals , only missing out on the 2000 FA Cup Final after a penalty shoot @-@ out defeat to Aston Villa . He blamed referee Barry Knight for the play @-@ off defeat , who he accused of being biased against Bolton . Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten @-@ year contract , though the terms of the contract only entitled him to a one year 's compensation pay if he was sacked . 
 In summer 2000 , Guðjohnsen and Jensen were sold for £ 4 million each . Allardyce focused on spending money to improve the club 's facilities and backroom staff , believing that money spent in these areas would allow Bolton to compete with clubs who had bigger budgets and paid bigger wages than Bolton could afford . On the playing front he spent £ 400 @,@ 000 on striker Michael Ricketts and £ 1 @.@ 5 million to bring back <unk> from Blackburn , and also signed utility player Ian Marshall and Bradford City loanee Isaiah Rankin . Teenager Kevin Nolan was also promoted from the youth team , whilst 35 @-@ year @-@ old defender Colin Hendry arrived on loan . Bolton reached the play @-@ off final at the Millennium Stadium in 2000 – 01 , where they beat Preston North End 3 – 0 to achieve promotion to the Premier League after a three @-@ year absence . 
 = = = = Premier League survival = = = = 
 Building for the 2001 – 02 Premier League campaign , Allardyce signed France international defender Bruno N 'Gotty from Marseille in a loan deal which was eventual made into a permanent one after N 'Gotty established himself as a key first team player . He also brought in Henrik Pedersen from Silkeborg IF for £ 650 @,@ 000 , though otherwise remained loyal to the players that had won promotion the previous campaign . They recorded a 5 – 0 win at Leicester City on the opening day , then beat Middlesbrough and Liverpool to secure nine points from their first three games . After six games without a win , Bolton then recorded a shock 2 – 1 victory over Manchester United on 20 October . However their form dropped , and so in the January transfer window Allardyce brought in Danish midfielder Stig <unk> , German striker Fredi Bobic ( on loan ) , and World Cup @-@ winning attacker Youri Djorkaeff . Djorkaeff scored both goals in a 2 – 1 win over Charlton Athletic on 23 March and Bobic scored a hat @-@ trick in a 4 – 1 win over Ipswich Town on 6 April ; the victory over Ipswich proved to be essential as Bolton ended the season in 16th place on 40 points , ahead of Ipswich who were relegated with 36 points . 
 Allardyce manage to sign another big name on a free transfer for the 2002 – 03 season , bringing in 28 @-@ year @-@ old Nigeria captain Jay @-@ Jay Okocha , who four years previously had been purchased by Paris Saint @-@ Germain for £ 14 million . He also brought in Spanish central defender Iván Campo on loan from Real Madrid . He sold 2001 – 02 top @-@ scorer Michael Ricketts to Middlesbrough for £ 3 @.@ 5 million , bringing in Pierre @-@ Yves André on loan as his replacement . Bolton struggled all season , but managed to avoid relegation with a final day win over Middlesbrough . 
 Looking to avoid another relegation battle , Allardyce made a number of signings in preparation for the 2003 – 04 season , the most significant of which were Brazilian defender Emerson Thome , Greece international Stelios <unk> , and target @-@ man striker Kevin Davies . Allardyce 's side finished eighth in the league and reached the League Cup final , in what was his first major domestic final appearance as a player or manager . Bolton lost 2 – 1 to Middlesbrough in the final , though Allardyce blamed referee Mike Riley for not giving a late penalty for an alleged handball by Ugo Ehiogu . 
 = = = = Venture in Europe = = = = 
 Now an established Premier League club , Bolton signed veteran internationals Gary Speed and Fernando Hierro , aged 35 and 36 respectively . Speed and Hierro went into midfield , while Tunisia international Radhi <unk> was played at centre @-@ back after arriving on a free transfer from Espérance ; he was played alongside another new arrival , Israel defender Tal Ben Haim , who was recommended by Allardyce 's son Craig . He also brought in Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf on a season @-@ long loan from Liverpool , who he would eventually sign permanently for £ 3 million . After a good start to the season , Allardyce was offered the Newcastle United job , but turned it down and instead signed a new five @-@ year contract with Bolton as he felt the Bolton squad to be more talented . Bolton went on to finish in sixth place in 2004 – 05 to win qualification to the UEFA Cup for the first time in the club 's history . 
 Bolton reached the Round of 32 in the UEFA Cup in 2005 – 06 , beating Lokomotiv Plovdiv ( Bulgaria ) in the First Round and successfully negotiating through the Group stage after beating Zenit Saint Petersburg ( Russia ) , and drawing with Sevilla ( Spain ) , Beşiktaş ( Turkey ) and Vitória Guimarães ( Portugal ) , before losing to Marseille ( France ) in the knock @-@ out stages . Allardyce 's success with Bolton resulted in the FA putting him on a short @-@ list of four people to succeed Sven @-@ Göran Eriksson as England manager after the 2006 FIFA World Cup , alongside Alan Curbishley , Steve McClaren and Martin O 'Neill . He was interviewed for the position and was told by FA Chief Executive Brian Barwick that the final choice would be between him and McClaren , however the FA eventually decided to give the job to McClaren . Allardyce was also again offered the Newcastle job and was this time to keen to take it , but Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepard broke off contract negotiations after electing to appoint caretaker @-@ manager Glenn Roeder on a full @-@ time basis . Allardyce 's team seemed unaffected by speculation on his future or by their European exploits , and ended the season in eighth position . 
 Keen to strengthen Bolton for a European push in the 2006 – 07 season , Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £ 8 million . He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye <unk> from Marseille , and in an unusual sequence of events made a £ 400 @,@ 000 profit on Dietmar Hamann , who changed his mind about joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre @-@ contract agreement with Bolton ; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £ 400 @,@ 000 in compensation . However Allardyce 's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification . On 29 April 2007 , Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to play , and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement . 
 = = = Newcastle United = = = 
 Allardyce was offered the Manchester City job , but the offer was withdrawn after Thaksin Shinawatra 's purchase offer of the club was accepted . On 15 May 2007 , Newcastle United announced that Allardyce had signed a three @-@ year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager . Ironically Newcastle then also had a change of owners , as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club . The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised £ 13 million , allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka ( free transfer ) , utility man Alan Smith ( £ 6 million ) , midfielder Geremi <unk> , controversial midfielder Joey Barton ( £ 5 @.@ 5 million ) , left @-@ back José Enrique ( £ 6 @.@ 3 million ) , right @-@ back Habib <unk> ( £ 2 million ) , and defender Abdoulaye Faye . Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season , beating Allardyce 's former club Bolton 3 – 1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two draws from the opening nine league games . However they then had a series of disappointing results in the run @-@ up to Christmas , and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom @-@ of @-@ the @-@ table Wigan and Derby . Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008 . He had gone into the meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle had signed a new player , not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager . 
 = = = Blackburn Rovers = = = 
 On 17 December 2008 , Allardyce was appointed as manager of Blackburn Rovers on a three @-@ year contract , succeeding Paul Ince who left the club in 19th place with just three wins from 17 games . Allardyce 's first game in charge was a 3 – 0 victory over Stoke City at Ewood Park three days later . This was the first game of a nine @-@ game unbeaten run . He strengthened the team by spending £ 2 million on Sunderland winger El Hadji Diouf and brought in defender Gaël Givet on loan from Marseille . Allardyce finished his first season in charge with a 0 – 0 draw with West Bromwich Albion and a final league position of 15th . 
 Blackburn were forced to sell talismanic Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz to Manchester City and defender Stephen Warnock to Aston Villa for a combined £ 21 @.@ 5 million to balance the books . Allardyce was permitted to bring in defensive midfielder Steven N <unk> from Amiens for £ 500 @,@ 000 , Croatia international forward Nikola <unk> from Hajduk Split for £ 6 million , and Pascal <unk> from Tottenham Hotspur for £ 2 @.@ 5 million . In the 2009 – 10 season , Blackburn reached the League Cup semi @-@ final against Aston Villa , but lost over two legs . Blackburn remained mid @-@ table for the duration of the season , and finished tenth with a final day victory away at Aston Villa . 
 The club was put up for sale in summer 2010 , and Allardyce was offered the job of managing Al @-@ Ahli Dubai , but could not secure permission to leave Blackburn without paying compensation to the club and so remained in charge at Ewood Park . Ironically , Allardyce was sacked by new owners the <unk> 's on 13 December 2010 , with Rovers placed 13th in the league . He was replaced by one of his coaches , Steve Kean , whose agent Jerome Anderson was a highly influential figure with the <unk> family . 
 = = = West Ham United = = = 
 Allardyce was appointed as manager of then @-@ recently relegated West Ham United on 1 June 2011 , signing a two @-@ year contract . He vowed to play " attractive football " in getting West Ham back to the Premier League , according to the " traditions of the club , " and rejected the claims that he played dull , long @-@ ball football at previous clubs . He signed Abdoulaye Faye , Kevin Nolan , Joey O 'Brien and Matt Taylor . Faye , Nolan and O 'Brien had all played under Allardyce at his former club Bolton Wanderers while Taylor was a Bolton player who had joined after Allardyce left the club . He made striker John Carew West Ham 's fifth signing of the season , on a free transfer , followed by defender George McCartney from Sunderland on a season @-@ long loan , strikers Sam Baldock from Milton Keynes Dons and midfielder Papa Bouba Diop on a free transfer . He concluded his summer transfer window signings on deadline day by bringing in midfielders David Bentley from Tottenham Hotspur and Henri Lansbury from Arsenal , both on season @-@ long loans , as well as utility man Guy <unk> from Hamburg for an undisclosed fee . Nicky Maynard , Ricardo Vaz Tê and Ravel Morrison followed in the 2011 winter transfer window . Over the course of the 2011 – 12 season a total of 25 players left the club while 19 were signed . In March 2012 , despite standing in third place in the Championship , Allardyce 's style of football was again questioned . Fans called for more passing of the ball and football played on the pitch and not in the air . On 19 May 2012 , West Ham were promoted back to the Premier League after only one season in the Championship after beating Blackpool 2 – 1 the play @-@ off Final . Allardyce described this promotion as his best ever achievement . 
 A busy transfer window for the summer of 2012 saw Allardyce bring in eleven players , including his former Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen , defender Mohamed Diamé , Mali international striker Modibo <unk> , Wales international centre @-@ back James Collins , defensive midfielder Alou Diarra , winger Matt Jarvis , England striker Andy Carroll ( on loan from Liverpool ) and Israel international midfielder Yossi Benayoun . West Ham finished the 2012 – 13 season in tenth place , and Allardyce renewed his contract at West Ham by signing a new two @-@ year deal . 
 Allardyce 's main signing of summer 2013 was Andy Carroll , for a £ 15 million fee from Liverpool , whilst he also spent an undisclosed fee on winger Stewart Downing , again from Liverpool , to provide crosses for Carroll to convert into goals . He also signed goalkeeper Adrián on a free transfer from Real Betis . However Allardyce 's plans were disrupted when Carroll picked up a long @-@ term injury , which left Allardyce regretting the transfer , especially as he had chosen Carroll instead of signing Swansea City 's Wilfried Bony , who went on to score 16 league goals in the 2013 – 14 campaign . Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for February 2014 following a run of four wins and one draw in their five Premier League games . In April 2014 , during an away game against West Bromwich Albion , a section of West Ham fans expressed their distaste at the style of football played under Allardyce by displaying a banner which read " Fat Sam Out , killing <unk> " . The following month some supporters hung a banner bearing the legend " Fat Sam Out " outside the mansion owned by club chairman , David Sullivan , in Theydon Bois , Essex . Despite protests , on 20 May 2014 , the club announced that Allardyce would be staying as manager and would be supported by new attacking coach Teddy Sheringham for the 2014 – 15 season to " ensure the team provides more entertainment " and to " improve the club 's goal tally " . 
 In summer 2014 Allardyce signed powerful midfielder <unk> <unk> , left @-@ back Aaron Cresswell , attacker <unk> Valencia , right @-@ back ( on loan from Arsenal ) Carl Jenkinson , striker <unk> Sakho , defensive midfielder Alex Song ( on loan from Barcelona ) , midfielder Morgan <unk> , and forward Mauro Zárate . In October 2014 , pundits like BBC 's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team 's " more attractive and attacking playing style " or " the statistics [ that ] show the progress that West Ham have made in the last few months . " Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month . Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015 , the final day of the season , after his contract was not renewed . Allardyce stated that " I didn 't want to stay . I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn 't want me to stay either " . His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014 – 15 season , one place higher than in the 2013 – 14 season . 
 = = = Sunderland = = = 
 On 9 October 2015 , Allardyce was named the new Sunderland manager , replacing Dick Advocaat . When Allardyce was appointed , Sunderland sat 19th in the Premier League table with three points from their first eight games of the season . Signing a two @-@ year contract , he became the first manager to have managed both Newcastle United and Sunderland . On 25 October , in his second game as manager , he guided Sunderland to a 3 – 0 win against rivals and his former club Newcastle United . However , after a run of 5 defeats in a row in December , Sunderland headed into the second half of the season in the relegation zone with only 12 points from 19 games . 
 In the January transfer window he signed centre @-@ backs Lamine <unk> and Jan Kirchhoff and attacking midfielder <unk> <unk> . On 6 February 2016 , Sunderland scored two late goals to draw 2 @-@ 2 with Liverpool at Anfield , having trailed 2 @-@ 0 with ten minutes remaining . Later that week winger Adam Johnson was sacked by the club after pleading guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming . Sunderland remained in the relegation zone for much of the remainder of the 2015 – 16 season , before they boosted their survival chances by beating Norwich City 3 – 0 at Carrow Road on 16 April , closing the gap on 17th @-@ place Norwich to just one point . Allardyce successfully led Sunderland to safety from relegation after beating Everton 3 – 0 on 11 May , a result which also ensured the relegation of rivals ( and one of his former clubs ) Newcastle United . Allardyce earned praise for his management of Sunderland from some pundits , particularly for his organized approach and emphasis on a strong defence .

 = = Managerial style = = 
 Allardyce is a keen proponent of sports science and using technology and innovative techniques in coaching his teams , such as <unk> and yoga . Martin Hardy of The Independent described him as " one of the pioneers of sports science in English football " . Former players and pundits have cited his preparation as his main strength , which allows his teams to have better organisation and defensive stability . Former Bolton player Kevin Davies also highlighted Allardyce 's man @-@ management skills as a strength . 
 Allardyce also has a reputation for using long ball tactics , though has said that this reputation is a perception that is " totally and utterly wrong " . Former Newcastle player Lee Clark stated that " I 've heard all the stuff that gets thrown at Sam . The long ball merchant thing and what have you . But all I can say is , from working with him , never once did I hear him talk about long balls . He 's massive on set @-@ plays and massive on the organisation of the team but that 's only right , that 's football and that 's what happens . " 
 Criticism of his perceived long @-@ ball tactics became more intense as he managed West Ham United in the Premier League , including discontent from West Ham 's own supporters . In January 2014 , following a 0 – 0 draw at Stamford Bridge , Chelsea manager , José Mourinho criticised West Ham 's football , likening it to " football from the 19th century " . In October 2014 , Allardyce claimed his reputation for playing long ball football was " not founded in fact " and had been used as an excuse by opposing managers such as Arsène Wenger , David O 'Leary , Graeme Souness and Rafael Benítez following defeats by sides managed by Allardyce . Allardyce wrote in his autobiography that " when they hit a 50 @-@ yard ball it was a cultural pass ; when we did it , it was a hopeful hoof " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 He met his future wife Lynne while still a youth team player at Bolton Wanderers , and the pair married on 1 June 1974 . They had a son , Craig ( 9 June 1975 ) , and daughter , Rachael ( 21 April 1979 ) . He was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Bolton in July 2010 . In addition to his football career , Allardyce has also run a number of businesses , including a motor spares firm , a fast @-@ food restaurant , a social club , a pub , a piano bar , and a pub restaurant . He published his autobiography , Big Sam , in October 2015 . 
 = = = Corruption allegations = = = 
 On 19 September 2006 , Allardyce , and his son , Craig , were implicated in a BBC Panorama documentary , Undercover : Football 's Dirty Secrets , which alleged that he had taken " bungs " ( bribes ) from agents for signing certain players . Two agents , <unk> <unk> and Peter Harrison , were secretly filmed , each separately claiming that they had paid Allardyce through his son . Allardyce denies ever taking , or asking for , a " bung " . Others implicated of wrongdoing were Harry Redknapp , Kevin Bond , and Frank Arnesen . As a result of the allegation , Allardyce refused to speak to the BBC . While he also stated he was going to sue the broadcaster to clear his name , Allardyce failed to issue libel proceedings as he was advised that suing for damage to reputation was a costly and time @-@ consuming process . The final report of the Stevens inquiry published in June 2007 expressed concerns regarding the involvement of Craig Allardyce in a number of transactions , stating that : " The inquiry remains concerned at the conflict of interest that it believes existed between Craig Allardyce , his father Sam Allardyce — the then manager at Bolton — and the club itself . " Allardyce stated that the inquiry was a public relations exercise and that the conclusion of a " conflict of interest " was " innuendo , without any facts " . 
 In January 2013 , Allardyce received " substantial " , but undisclosed , damages from former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean . In 2011 , Kean had been recorded in a bar in Hong Kong falsely alleging that Allardyce had been sacked from his post at Blackburn Rovers because he was a crook . 
 In February 2014 , Daniel Taylor , chief football writer for The Guardian and The Observer , wrote that West Ham player and England prospect Ravel Morrison felt he had come " under considerable pressure " from Allardyce to sign up with football agent Mark Curtis , who represents Allardyce himself and a number of other West Ham players , including Kevin Nolan , James Tomkins , Jack Collison , Matt Jarvis , Andy Carroll , and Jussi Jääskeläinen . Agent Curtis had been charged and eventually cleared by the Football Association during the 2008 investigation into Luton Town 's illegal transfer dealings . Curtis responded to the allegations by saying it is " nonsense " , while Allardyce talked of Morrison complaining about " a groin injury " while the club 's medical staff could find " no problem " , and made a reference to the player 's " disciplinary issues in the past . " Morrison was eventually loaned out to Championship side Queens Park Rangers for the remainder of the 2013 – 14 season .

 = Californium = 
 Californium is a radioactive metallic chemical element with symbol Cf and atomic number 98 . The element was first made in 1950 at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , by bombarding curium with alpha particles ( helium @-@ 4 ions ) . It is an actinide element , the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized , and has the second @-@ highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the unaided eye ( after einsteinium ) . The element was named after the university and the state of California . 
 Two crystalline forms exist for californium under normal pressure : one above and one below 900 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ° F ) . A third form exists at high pressure . Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature . Compounds of californium are dominated by a chemical form of the element , designated californium ( III ) , that can participate in three chemical bonds . The most stable of californium 's twenty known isotopes is californium @-@ 251 , which has a half @-@ life of 898 years . This short half @-@ life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth 's crust . Californium @-@ 252 , with a half @-@ life of about 2 @.@ 64 years , is the most common isotope used and is produced at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia . 
 Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications . Most of these applications exploit the property of certain isotopes of californium to emit neutrons . For example , californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors , and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials with neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy . Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements ; ununoctium ( element 118 ) was synthesized by bombarding californium @-@ 249 atoms with calcium @-@ 48 ions . Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element 's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 Californium is a silvery white actinide metal with a melting point of 900 ± 30 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ± 50 ° F ) and an estimated boiling point of 1 @,@ 745 K ( 1 @,@ 470 ° C ; 2 @,@ 680 ° F ) . The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade . Californium metal starts to vaporize above 300 ° C ( 570 ° F ) when exposed to a vacuum . Below 51 K ( − 220 ° C ) californium metal is either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic ( it acts like a magnet ) , between 48 and 66 K it is antiferromagnetic ( an intermediate state ) , and above 160 K ( − 113 ° C ; − 172 ° F ) it is paramagnetic ( external magnetic fields can make it magnetic ) . It forms alloys with lanthanide metals but little is known about them . 
 The element has two crystalline forms under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure : A double @-@ hexagonal close @-@ packed form dubbed alpha ( α ) and a face @-@ centered cubic form designated beta ( β ) . The α form exists below 900 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ° F ) with a density of 15 @.@ 10 g / cm3 and the β form exists above 900 ° C with a density of 8 @.@ 74 g / cm3 . At 48 GPa of pressure the β form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to delocalization of the atom 's 5f electrons , which frees them to bond . 
 The bulk modulus of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure . Californium 's bulk modulus is 50 ± 5 GPa , which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals , such as aluminium ( 70 GPa ) . 
 = = = Chemical properties and compounds = = = 
 Californium exhibits valences of 4 , 3 , or 2 ; indicating the number of chemical bonds one atom of this element can form . Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3 + valence actinide elements and the element dysprosium , which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table . The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature , with the rate increasing when moisture is added . Californium reacts when heated with hydrogen , nitrogen , or a chalcogen ( oxygen family element ) ; reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous mineral acids are rapid . 
 Californium is only water @-@ soluble as the californium ( III ) cation . Attempts to reduce or oxidize the + 3 ion in solution have failed . The element forms a water @-@ soluble chloride , nitrate , perchlorate , and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride , oxalate , or hydroxide . Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties , as is observed in the californium borate . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Twenty radioisotopes of californium have been characterized , the most stable being californium @-@ 251 with a half @-@ life of 898 years , californium @-@ 249 with a half @-@ life of 351 years , californium @-@ 250 with a half @-@ life of 13 @.@ 08 years , and californium @-@ 252 with a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 645 years . All the remaining isotopes have half @-@ lives shorter than a year , and the majority of these have half @-@ lives shorter than 20 minutes . The isotopes of californium range in mass number from 237 to 256 . 
 Californium @-@ 249 is formed from the beta decay of berkelium @-@ 249 , and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor . Although californium @-@ 251 has the longest half @-@ life , its production yield is only 10 % due to its tendency to collect neutrons ( high neutron capture ) and its tendency to interact with other particles ( high neutron cross @-@ section ) . 
 Californium @-@ 252 is a very strong neutron emitter , which makes it extremely radioactive and harmful . Californium @-@ 252 undergoes alpha decay ( the loss of two protons and two neutrons ) 96 @.@ 9 % of the time to form curium @-@ 248 while the remaining 3 @.@ 1 % of decays are spontaneous fission . One microgram ( µg ) of californium @-@ 252 emits 2 @.@ 3 million neutrons per second , an average of 3 @.@ 7 neutrons per spontaneous fission . Most of the other isotopes of californium decay to isotopes of curium ( atomic number 96 ) via alpha decay . 
 = = History = = 
 Californium was first synthesized at the University of California Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , by the physics researchers Stanley G. Thompson , Kenneth Street , Jr . , Albert Ghiorso , and Glenn T. Seaborg on or about February 9 , 1950 . It was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered ; the team announced its discovery on March 17 , 1950 . 
 To produce californium , a microgram @-@ sized target of curium @-@ 242 ( 242 
 96Cm ) was bombarded with 35 MeV @-@ alpha particles ( 4 
 2He ) in the 60 @-@ inch @-@ diameter ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) cyclotron at Berkeley , which produced californium @-@ 245 ( 245 
 98Cf ) plus one free neutron ( n ) . 
 242 
 96Cm + 4 
 2He → 245 
 98Cf + 1 
 0n 
 Only about 5 @,@ 000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment , and these atoms had a half @-@ life of 44 minutes . 
 The discoverers named the new element after the university and the state . This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97 , which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named . However , the element directly above element 98 in the periodic table , dysprosium , has a name that simply means " hard to get at " so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention . They added that " the best we can do is to point out [ that ] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California . " 
 <unk> quantities of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at the Materials Testing Reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station in eastern Idaho ; and these findings were reported in 1954 . The high spontaneous fission rate of californium @-@ 252 was observed in these samples . The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958 . The isotopes californium @-@ 249 to californium @-@ 252 were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium @-@ 239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years . Two years later , in 1960 , Burris Cunningham and James <unk> of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds — californium trichloride , californium oxychloride , and californium oxide — by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid . 
 The High Flux Isotope Reactor ( HFIR ) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) in Oak Ridge , Tennessee , started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s . By 1995 , the HFIR nominally produced 500 milligrams ( 0 @.@ 018 oz ) of californium annually . Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the 1958 US @-@ UK Mutual Defence Agreement was used for californium production . 
 The Atomic Energy Commission sold californium @-@ 252 to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $ 10 per microgram and an average of 150 mg ( 0 @.@ 0053 oz ) of californium @-@ 252 were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990 . Californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by Haire and <unk> who reduced californium ( III ) oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub @-@ micrometer thick films . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 Traces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments . The element is fairly insoluble in water , but it adheres well to ordinary soil ; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles . 
 Fallout from atmospheric nuclear testing prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to the environment . Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249 , 252 , 253 , and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion . Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities . 
 Californium was once believed to be produced in supernovas , as their decay matches the 60 day half @-@ life of 254Cf . However , subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra , and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel @-@ 56 . 
 The transuranic elements from americium to fermium , including californium , occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo , but no longer do so . 
 = = Production = = 
 Californium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators . Californium @-@ 250 is made by bombarding berkelium @-@ 249 ( 249 
 97Bk ) with neutrons , forming berkelium @-@ 250 ( 250 
 97Bk ) via neutron capture ( n , γ ) which , in turn , quickly beta decays ( β − ) to californium @-@ 250 ( 250 
 98Cf ) in the following reaction : 
 249 
 97Bk ( n , γ ) 250 
 97Bk → 250 
 98Cf + β − 
 Bombardment of californium @-@ 250 with neutrons produces californium @-@ 251 and californium @-@ 252 . 
 Prolonged irradiation of americium , curium , and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium @-@ 252 and microgram amounts of californium @-@ 249 . As of 2006 , curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium @-@ 252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255 . 
 <unk> quantities of californium @-@ 252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission . Only two sites produce californium @-@ 252 – the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States , and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad , Russia . As of 2003 , the two sites produce 0 @.@ 25 grams and 0 @.@ 025 grams of californium @-@ 252 per year , respectively . 
 Three californium isotopes with significant half @-@ lives are produced , requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by uranium @-@ 238 without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during the process . Californium @-@ 253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium @-@ 238 , includes several isotopes of plutonium , americium , curium , berkelium , and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 ( see diagram ) . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Californium @-@ 252 has a number of specialized applications as a strong neutron emitter , and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute . This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable ( non @-@ reactor based ) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples . Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective . It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119 µg of californium @-@ 252 from the Savannah River Plant . It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries . 
 Neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners ; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion , bad welds , cracks and trapped moisture ; and in portable metal detectors . Neutron moisture gauges use californium @-@ 252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells , as a portable neutron source for gold and silver prospecting for on @-@ the @-@ spot analysis , and to detect ground water movement . The major uses of californium @-@ 252 in 1982 were , in order of use , reactor start @-@ up ( 48 @.@ 3 % ) , fuel rod scanning ( 25 @.@ 3 % ) , and activation analysis ( 19 @.@ 4 % ) . By 1994 most californium @-@ 252 was used in neutron radiography ( 77 @.@ 4 % ) , with fuel rod scanning ( 12 @.@ 1 % ) and reactor start @-@ up ( 6 @.@ 9 % ) as important but distant secondary uses . 
 Californium @-@ 251 has a very small calculated critical mass of about 5 kg ( 11 lb ) , high lethality , and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation . The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element . 
 In October 2006 , researchers announced that three atoms of ununoctium ( element 118 ) had been identified at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna , Russia , as the product of bombardment of californium @-@ 249 with calcium @-@ 48 , making it the heaviest element ever synthesized . The target for this experiment contained about 10 mg of californium @-@ 249 deposited on a titanium foil of 32 cm2 area . Californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements ; for example , element 103 ( later named lawrencium ) was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with boron nuclei . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Californium that bioaccumulates in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body 's ability to form red blood cells . The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment . 
 Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element . Once in the body , only 0 @.@ 05 % of the californium will reach the bloodstream . About 65 % of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton , 25 % in the liver , and the rest in other organs , or excreted , mainly in urine . Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years , respectively . Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone . 
 The element is most dangerous if taken into the body . In addition , californium @-@ 249 and californium @-@ 251 can cause tissue damage externally , through gamma ray emission . Ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer . 
 = Transandinomys talamancae = 
 Transandinomys talamancae is a rodent in the genus Transandinomys that occurs from Costa Rica to southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela . Its habitat consists of lowland forests up to 1 @,@ 525 m ( 5 @,@ 003 ft ) above sea level . With a body mass of 38 to 74 g ( 1 @.@ 3 to 2 @.@ 6 oz ) , it is a medium @-@ sized rice rat . The fur is soft and is reddish to brownish on the upperparts and white to buff on the underparts . The tail is dark brown above and lighter below and the ears and feet are long . The vibrissae ( whiskers ) are very long . In the skull , the rostrum ( front part ) is long and the braincase is low . The number of chromosomes varies from 34 to 54 . 
 The species was first described in 1891 by Joel Asaph Allen and thereafter a variety of names , now considered synonyms , were applied to local populations . It was lumped into a widespread species " Oryzomys capito " ( now Hylaeamys megacephalus ) from the 1960s till the 1980s and the current allocation of synonyms dates only from 1998 . It was placed in the genus Oryzomys until 2006 , as Oryzomys talamancae , but is not closely related to the type species of that genus and was therefore moved to a separate genus Transandinomys in 2006 . It shares this genus with Transandinomys bolivaris , which has even longer vibrissae ; the two overlap broadly in distribution and are morphologically similar . 
 Active during the night , Transandinomys talamancae lives on the ground and eats plants and insects . Males move more and have larger home ranges than females . It breeds throughout the year , but few individuals survive for more than a year . After a gestation period of about 28 days , two to five young are born , which reach sexual maturity within two months . A variety of parasites occur on this species . Widespread and common , it is of no conservation concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In 1891 , Joel Asaph Allen was the first to scientifically describe Transandinomys talamancae , when he named Oryzomys talamancae from a specimen from Talamanca , Costa Rica . He placed it in the genus Oryzomys , then more broadly defined than it is now , and compared it to both the marsh rice rat ( O. palustris ) and to O. laticeps . Several other names that are now recognized as synonyms of Transandinomys talamancae were introduced in the following years . In 1899 , Allen described Oryzomys mollipilosus , O. magdalenae , and O. villosus from Magdalena Department , Colombia . Oldfield Thomas added O. sylvaticus from Santa Rosa , Ecuador in 1900 and O. panamensis from Panama City , Panama , in 1901 . In the same year , Wirt Robinson and Markus Lyon named Oryzomys medius from near La Guaira , Venezuela . Allen added O. carrikeri from Talamanca , Costa Rica , in 1908 . 
 Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 . He placed both panamensis and carrikeri as synonyms of Oryzomys talamancae and mentioned O. mollipilosus and O. medius as closely related species . O. talamancae was the only member of its own species group , which Goldman regarded as closest to Oryzomys bombycinus ( = Transandinomys bolivaris ) . In 1960 , Philip Hershkovitz listed talamancae , medius , magdalenae , sylvaticus , and mollipilosus among the many synonyms of " Oryzomys laticeps " , a name later replaced by " Oryzomys capito " . The species remained lumped under Oryzomys capito until 1983 , when Alfred Gardner again listed it as a valid species , an action more fully documented by Guy Musser and Marina Williams in 1985 . Musser and Williams also found that the holotype of Oryzomys villosus , the affinities of which had been disputed , in fact consisted of a skin of O. talamancae and a skull of the Oryzomys <unk> group ( equivalent to the current genus Nephelomys ) . They restricted the name to the skin , making villosus a synonym of O. talamancae . They also examined the holotypes of panamensis , carrikeri , mollipilosus , medius , and magdalenae and identified them as examples of Oryzomys talamancae . Additionally , they included sylvaticus and Oryzomys castaneus J.A. Allen , 1901 , from Ecuador as synonyms , but without examining the holotypes . Musser and colleagues reviewed the group again in 1998 and confirmed that sylvaticus represents Oryzomys talamancae ; however , they found that castaneus was in fact an example of Oryzomys bolivaris ( the current Transandinomys bolivaris ) . 
 In 2006 , Marcelo Weksler published a phylogenetic analysis of Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , the tribe to which Oryzomys is allocated , using morphological data and DNA sequences from the IRBP gene . His results showed species of Oryzomys dispersed across Oryzomyini and suggested that most species in the genus should be allocated to new genera . Oryzomys talamancae was also included ; it appeared within " clade B " , together with other species formerly associated with Oryzomys capito . Some analyses placed it closest to species now placed in Euryoryzomys or Nephelomys , but with low support . Later in the same year , he , together with Alexandre Percequillo and Robert Voss , named ten new genera for species previously placed in Oryzomys , including Transandinomys , which has Oryzomys talamancae ( now Transandinomys talamancae ) as its type species . They also included Oryzomys bolivaris , which was not included in Weksler 's phylogenetic study , in this new genus . The two species are morphologically similar , but Weksler and colleagues could identify only one synapomorphy ( shared @-@ derived trait ) for them : very long superciliary vibrissae ( vibrissae , or whiskers , above the eyes ) . Transandinomys is one of about 30 genera in Oryzomyini , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents . 
 Several common names have been proposed for Transandinomys talamancae , including " Talamanca Rice Rat " , " <unk> Oryzomys " , and " <unk> Rice Rat " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Transandinomys talamancae is a medium @-@ sized , brightly colored rice rat . It is similar to T. bolivaris and the two are often confused . They are about as large , but in T. talamancae the tail is longer and the hindfeet shorter . Both species share uniquely long vibrissae , with both the mystacial ( above the mouth ) and superciliary vibrissae extending to or beyond the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head , but those in T. bolivaris are substantially longer . H. alfaroi , a widespread species ranging from Mexico to Ecuador , is also similar . It is smaller and darker , but young adult T. talamancae are similar in color to adult H. alfaroi and often misidentified . Hylaeamys megacephalus , with which T. talamancae was synonymized for some decades , is similar in body size , but is not known to overlap with T. talamancae in range . 
 The fur is short , dense and soft in Transandinomys talamancae ; in T. bolivaris , it is longer and even more soft and dense . The color of the upperparts varies from reddish to brownish , becoming lighter towards the sides and the cheeks . The underparts are white to buff , with the bases of the hairs plumbeous ( lead @-@ colored ) . The fur of T. bolivaris is darker : dark brown above and dark gray below . H. megacephalus also has darker fur . Juveniles have thin , gray fur , which is molted into the dark brown subadult fur when the animal is about 35 to 40 days old . This fur is replaced by the bright adult fur at age 49 to 56 days . Juveniles are never blackish as in T. bolivaris . The ears are dark brown , large , and densely covered with very small hairs . 
 The sparsely haired tail is about as long as the head and body . It is dark brown above and lighter below . In contrast , the tail of H. megacephalus has little to no difference in color between the upper and lower surface . In 2006 , Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys ( <unk> in T. talamancae and unicolored in T. bolivaris ) , but in their 1998 study , Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species . 
 The hindfeet are long and have the three central digits longer than the two outer ones . They are white to pale yellow above , where the foot is covered with hairs , which are longer than in T. bolivaris . The digits of the hindfeet are surrounded by ungual tufts of silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves . The claws are short and sharp . Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales ( squamae ) , which are usually entirely absent in T. bolivaris . The pads are moderately large . 
 The length of the head and body is 105 to 151 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) , tail length 105 to 152 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 to 6 @.@ 0 in ) , hindfoot length 26 to 32 mm ( 1 @.@ 0 to 1 @.@ 3 in ) , ear length 17 to 24 mm ( 0 @.@ 67 to 0 @.@ 94 in ) , and body mass 38 to 74 g ( 1 @.@ 3 to 2 @.@ 6 oz ) . As in most oryzomyines , females have eight mammae . There are 12 thoracic vertebra with associated ribs , 7 <unk> , and 29 caudals ; a pair of supernumerary ( additional ) ribs is occasionally present . 
 = = = Skull and teeth = = = 
 The skull has a long rostrum ( front part ) , broad interorbital region ( between the eyes ) , and low braincase . It differs from that of T. bolivaris in various proportions , which are more apparent in adults than in juveniles . The skull of H. megacephalus is distinctly larger . The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well @-@ developed zygomatic notch at its front . Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar . The zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) is heavy . The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward . The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins ; T. bolivaris is similar , but has stronger beading and H. megacephalus entirely lacks the beading . The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side , as it does in most T. bolivaris . The interparietal bone , part of the roof of the braincase , is large . 
 The incisive foramina ( openings in the front part of the palate ) are short and do not reach between the first molars ; they are longer in H. alfaroi . The bony palate is long and extends beyond the end of the molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones . The posterolateral palatal pits , which perforate the palate near the third molars , are small , and may or may not be recessed into a fossa . The sphenopalatine vacuities ( openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa , behind the palate ) are also small , as are the auditory bullae . As in most oryzomyines , the subsquamosal fenestra , an opening at the back of the skull , is present . The pattern of grooves and foramina ( openings ) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T. talamancae follows the primitive pattern , as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys . 
 The mandible ( lower jaw ) is less robust than in T. bolivaris . The coronoid process ( a process in the back part of the bone ) is small and the capsular process , which houses the root of the lower incisor , are small . The mental foramen , located in the diastema between the lower incisor and the first molar , opens towards the side , as usual in oryzomyines . The upper and lower masseteric ridges , which anchor some of the chewing muscles , do not join into a single crest and extend forward to below the first molar . 
 The upper incisor is opisthodont , with the cutting edge oriented backward . As usual in oryzomyines , the molars are brachydont ( low @-@ crowned ) and bunodont ( with the cusps higher than the connecting crests ) . The first upper molar is narrower than in T. bolivaris . As in this species , but unlike in many other rice rats , including H. alfaroi and E. nitidus , the mesoflexus on the second upper molar , which separates the paracone ( one of the main cusps ) from the mesoloph ( an accessory crest ) , is not divided in two by an enamel bridge . The hypoflexid on the second lower molar , the main valley between the cusps , is very long , extending more than halfway across the tooth ; in this trait , the species is again similar to T. bolivaris but unlike H. alfaroi . Each of the upper molars has three roots ( two at the labial , or outer , side and one at the lingual , or inner , side ) and each of the lowers has two ( one at the front and one at the back ) ; T. talamancae lacks the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines , including species of Euryoryzomys , Nephelomys , and Handleyomys . 
 = = = Male reproductive anatomy = = = 
 As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae , Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis , with the distal ( far ) end of the baculum ( penis bone ) ending in a structure consisting of three digits . As in most oryzomyines , the central digit is larger than the two at the sides . The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines , but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue . 
 Some features of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines . In Transandinomys talamancae , a single pair of preputial glands is present at the penis . As is usual for sigmodontines , there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands . Part of the end of the vesicular gland is irregularly folded , not smooth as in most oryzomyines . 
 = = = Karyotype = = = 
 The karyotype in T. talamancae is variable . Samples from two different localities in Venezuela have 34 chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms ( 2n 
 = 34 , FN = 
 64 ) . Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype , with the number of chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67 . The autosomes ( non @-@ sex chromosomes ) of the 2n 
 = 34 karyotype all have two major arms , but the 2n = 
 40 – 42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes , which only have one major arm . The 2n 
 = 34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs , which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other , and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes , with a long and a much shorter arm , but the 2n = 
 40 – 42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of <unk> . Both Robertsonian translocations ( fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other ) and <unk> inversions ( reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere ) are needed to explain the difference between the two groups . Musser and colleagues , in discussing these karyotypes , assumed that the 2n 
 = 40 – 42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two <unk> morphs . 
 The karyotype of an Ecuadorean sample from north of the Gulf of Guayaquil is similar to that of Venezuelan animals at 2n = 
 36 , FN 
 = 60 ; it includes four acrocentric and two subtelocentric pairs and no submetacentrics . In contrast , a sample from south of the Gulf had 2n = 
 54 , FN 
 = 60 , including 23 pairs of acrocentrics and four pairs of metacentrics ( with two equally long arms ) . Musser and colleagues termed the difference between the two Ecuadorian forms " impressive " and noted that further research was needed to understand the <unk> differentiation within the species more fully . Both T. bolivaris and H. alfaroi have more chromosomes and arms , at 2n = 
 58 , FN 
 = 80 and 2n = 
 60 – 62 , FN 
 = 100 – 104 respectively . Hylaeamys megacephalus has 2n = 
 54 , FN 
 = 58 – 62 and the similar Hylaeamys perenensis has 2n = 
 52 , FN = 62 ; these karyotypes resemble that of southern Ecuadorean T. talamancae . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The distribution of Transandinomys talamancae extends from northwestern Costa Rica south and east to northern Venezuela and southwestern Ecuador , up to 1 @,@ 525 m ( 5 @,@ 003 ft ) above sea level . It is a forest species and occurs in both evergreen and deciduous forest . Although its distribution broadly overlaps that of T. bolivaris , it is more widely distributed in South America because of its greater tolerance of dry forest habitats . 
 Transandinomys talamancae reaches the northern limit of its range in Costa Rica , but except for one record from the far northwest ( in Guanacaste Province near the southern margin of Lake Nicaragua ) , it is known only from the southeastern third of the country . In contrast , T. bolivaris and H. alfaroi occur further north , into Honduras and Mexico respectively . It occurs throughout Panama at low elevations . Along the Pacific coast in Colombia and Ecuador , it is found on the coastal plain and the adjacent foothills of the Andes . The southernmost known record is in far southwestern Ecuador , but the species may well range into nearby Peru . 
 It also occurs throughout northern Colombia at low elevations and into western Venezuela west of Lake Maracaibo and at the foot of the western part of the Venezuelan Coastal Range east to <unk> National Park . Hylaeamys megacephalus occurs further to the east in the eastern portion of the coastal range , separated by the coastal Eastern Caribbean Dry Zone . There is a record from the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela , well within the range of Hylaeamys megacephalus , but Musser and colleagues suggest that this is based on mislabeled specimens . The species has also been found on the narrow strip between the Llanos and the Andes ( Cordillera Oriental and Cordillera de Mérida ) in eastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela . The unforested Llanos separate these areas from Hylaeamys populations . Hylaeamys perenensis does , however , occur further south along the eastern foothills of the Cordillera Oriental in Colombia and it is possible that the two overlap in this area . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 Transandinomys talamancae is a common , even abundant species . Its ecology was studied by Theodore Fleming in the Panama Canal Zone . It lives on the ground and is active during the night . The animal uses nests that are located above the ground and occasionally enters burrows also used by the pocket mouse <unk> <unk> . Its diet is omnivorous , including both plant material such as seeds and fruits and adult and larval insects . 
 Males tend to move over longer distances than females . The average home range size in Fleming 's study was 1 @.@ 33 hectares ( 3 @.@ 3 acres ) ; males had larger home ranges on average . Specimens that were once captured tended to be captured more frequently than those that had never been captured . Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4 @.@ 3 per ha ( 1 @.@ 7 per acre ) late in the rainy season ( October – November ) , but dropped to near zero around June ; however , these figures may well be underestimates . In central Venezuela , population densities vary from 5 @.@ 5 to 9 @.@ 6 per ha ( 2 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 8 per acre ) . 
 In Panama , it breeds year @-@ round without apparent seasonal variability . According to Omar Linares 's <unk> de Venezuela ( Mammals of Venezuela ) , reproductive activity is highest in June – July and December . In the laboratory , the gestation period is 28 days ; Linares reports that it is 20 to 30 days in the wild . Females produce an average of six litters per year and there are two to five ( average 3 @.@ 92 ) young per litter , so that a single female may produce about 24 young per year ; this is likely an overestimate because most females would not live for a full year . Larger females may have larger litters . Animals become sexually mature when less than two months old ; in Fleming 's study , some females in juvenile fur , probably less than 50 days old , were already pregnant . The oldest specimen Fleming observed was nine months old ; he estimated that animals were unlikely to live for more than a year in the wild and that the mean age at death was 2 @.@ 9 months . 
 Ten species of mites ( Gigantolaelaps <unk> , Gigantolaelaps gilmorei , Gigantolaelaps <unk> , Gigantolaelaps wolffsohni , <unk> <unk> , Laelaps <unk> , Laelaps <unk> , Laelaps <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ) , thirteen chiggers ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Eutrombicula <unk> , Eutrombicula <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> panamensis , <unk> <unk> , Pseudoschoengastia <unk> , Pseudoschoengastia bulbifera , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ) , and four fleas ( <unk> sp . , Polygenis roberti , Polygenis <unk> , and Polygenis <unk> ) have been found on T. talamancae in Panama . G. <unk> has also been found on this species in Colombia . In addition , the sucking lice Hoplopleura <unk> and Hoplopleura oryzomydis occur on T. talamancae . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 A widespread and common species , Transandinomys talamancae is listed as " Least Concern " by the IUCN Red List . It occurs in numerous protected areas and tolerates disturbed habitats well , and no important threats are known . 
 = Flight ( Grey 's Anatomy ) = 
 " Flight " is the twenty @-@ fourth and final episode of the eighth season of the American television medical drama Grey 's Anatomy , and the show 's 172nd episode overall . It was written by series creator Shonda Rhimes , and directed by Rob Corn . The episode was originally broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) in the United States on May 17 , 2012 . In the episode , six doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital who are victims of an aviation accident fight to stay alive , but Dr. Lexie Grey ( Chyler Leigh ) ultimately dies . Other storylines occur in Seattle where Dr. Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr . ) plans his annual dinner for the departing residents , Dr. Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) fires Dr. Teddy Altman ( Kim Raver ) , and Dr. Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) gets engaged . 
 The episode marked Leigh 's and Raver 's final appearance to the series . Exterior filming of the accident took place at Big Bear Lake , California . Jason George reprised his role as a guest star , whereas James LeGros made his first appearance . The episode opened to mixed reviews from television critics , with some criticizing the death of Lexie , but praising Leigh 's performance , in addition to Ellen Pompeo ( Dr. Meredith Grey ) ' s and Eric Dane ( Dr. Mark Sloan ) ' s . " Flight " earned Rhimes an NAACP Image Award nomination and it was also nominated under several categories of Entertainment Weekly 's finale awards . Upon its initial airing , the episode was viewed by 11 @.@ 44 million Americans , garnered a 4 @.@ 1 / 11 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic , ranking fourth for the night in terms of viewership , and registering as Thursday 's highest @-@ rated drama . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After their plane crashes in the woods , Dr. Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) , Dr. Lexie Grey ( Chyler Leigh ) , Dr. Cristina Yang ( Sandra Oh ) , Dr. Arizona Robbins ( Jessica Capshaw ) , Dr. Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) , and Dr. Mark Sloan ( Eric Dane ) desperately fight to stay alive . Meredith is relatively unscathed , while the rest have serious injuries : the pilot , Jerry ( James LeGros ) , has a major spine injury , and Yang dislocates her arm . Robbins ' femur is broken and sticking through the skin , Sloan has serious internal injuries ; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet . Shepherd is sucked out the side of the plane and awakens alone in the wood ; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane . However , none are in as bad shape as Lexie , who is crushed under a piece of the plane . While Meredith searches for Shepherd , Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie . Eventually , the two realize that they cannot save her , so Sloan holds her hand while she dies , telling her that he loves her . As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together , Lexie dies with a smile on her face just as Meredith and Yang are approaching . 
 Lexie 's death devastates Meredith , who is still desperately trying to find her husband . Eventually , she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can . Meanwhile , back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , no one is aware of what has happened to the other doctors . Dr. Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr . ) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents , which Dr. Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) , Dr. Jackson Avery ( Jesse Williams ) , and Dr. April Kepner ( Sarah Drew ) are dreading . Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center , and he and Kepner share a moment . Dr. Ben Warren ( Jason George ) and Dr. Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) decide to get married , even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles . After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman ( Kim Raver ) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command ( MEDCOM ) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty , Dr. Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) , the chief of surgery , fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died . As the episode ends , Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise . The residents , finally excited to celebrate at Webber 's dinner , are left waiting for their stranded friends . The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out . In the closing monologue , Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written by Shonda Rhimes , and directed by Rob Corn . Featured music included The Paper Kites ' " Featherstone " and Feist 's ' Graveyard " . Filming took place in Big Bear Lake , California , a location previously used in the seventh season for Yang and Shepherd 's fishing trip . Commenting on the filming conditions , Leigh said : " It would rain and be sunny and hot . I never died before [ on camera ] . That sounds funny saying that . I think everyone has an emotional wellspring and that happened to be a moment where I was sprung . Everybody was very accommodating — the crew , cast . And I opted to stay underneath [ the wreckage ] for the most part over two days rather than trying to get in and out . " 
 In regard to the episode , Rhimes commented before it originally aired that it was difficult to write , largely because of the death of a main character . She compared it to writing the season six finale , by explaining that the former was " more painful " to write . After the episode aired , Rhimes repeated in a tweet that it was hard for her to write the finale , adding : " I did not enjoy it . It made me sick and it made me sad . " Rhimes also explained the departure of Leigh , whose character died after the plane crash , by saying that the two came to an agreement on the decision to kill Lexie , after extensive discussion . Speaking of Raver 's departure whose character left Seattle Grace for MEDCOM , Rhimes elaborated that Raver was offered a contract renewal , but declined .

In terms of Grey 's Anatomy 's other season finales , the episode was the show 's second least @-@ viewed finale , just behind the seventh season 's , which garnered 9 @.@ 89 million viewers . The episode did not rank in the top three for viewership , but its 4 @.@ 1 / 11 Nielsen rating ranked first in its 9 : 00 Eastern time @-@ slot and second for the night , registering the show as Thursday 's No. 1 drama , for both the rating and share percentages of the key 18 – 49 demographic . Its rating lost to American Idol , but beat out CBS 's The Big Bang Theory , Person of Interest , and The Mentalist . In addition to its rating being in the top rankings for the night , it was an increase from the previous episode , which netted a 3 @.@ 5 / 10 rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . The episode also showed an increase in ratings in comparison to the previous year 's finale , which attained a 3 @.@ 6 / 9 rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . 
 <unk> 's Tanya Lane wrote , " Wow … just wow . Grey 's Anatomy has once again managed to shock with its season finale . " While she appreciated the " realism and authenticity that Grey 's is known for " , she found the episode was " almost too much " as it was " extremely gory and difficult to watch , initially because of the grisly wounds " but later because of the " heavy and emotional things that transpired " . She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead . Digital Spy 's Ben Lee found Leigh 's and Dane 's performances " phenomenal " and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane . He described the moment the two actors shared as " truly poignant " . To him , Lexie 's death felt like a finale , which was thus too early . As for what was happening in Seattle Grace , he thought it was " a bit pointless " and " uninteresting " except Altman 's departure , which he deemed " the most significant moment at the hospital " . Entertainment Weekly 's Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie 's death : " It was an intense death . I mean , how awful was it to watch one of Grey ’ s longest @-@ running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously ? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don 't love that Lexie was the one to die . Could it have been someone less important somehow ? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner . And you probably just don 't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan , right ? " Stransky also complained about Robbins ' screams at the beginning of the episode , but enjoyed Bailey 's story . 
 In an Entertainment Weekly poll that judged all the television season finales of the year , Lexie 's death was voted the " Top Tissue Moment " , while Robbins ' injured leg and Shepherd 's mangled hand were voted the " Most Disturbing Image " . The ending of the episode was also considered as the " Best Ending to an Otherwise So @-@ So Season " . Lexie 's death was also nominated under the " Best ( Presumed ) Death " category , while the plane crash 's aftermath was nominated as the " Best Non @-@ romantic Cliffhanger " , and the episode in entirety was nominated for the special award for " Biggest Regret That I Didn 't See It , I Just Heard or Read About It " . Entertainment Weekly later named the scene where Meredith is crying one of the best crying scenes of 2012 . In TVLine 's review of 2012 , Lexie 's death was runner @-@ up for " Biggest Tearjerker " . The episode is nominated at the NAACP Image Awards under the Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series category for Rhimes .

 Final Fantasy XI ( <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī <unk> ) , also known as Final Fantasy XI Online , is a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game ( MMORPG ) , developed and published by Square ( later Square Enix ) as part of the Final Fantasy series . Designed and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka , it was released in Japan on May 16 , 2002 , for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows @-@ based personal computers in November of that year . The game was the first MMORPG to offer cross @-@ platform play , connecting PlayStation 2 and personal computer , and the Xbox 360 's first MMORPG . All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play . 
 The story is set in the fantasy world of Vana 'diel , where player @-@ created avatars can both compete and cooperate in a variety of objectives to develop an assortment of jobs , skills , and earn in @-@ game item rewards . Players can undertake an array of quests and progress through the in @-@ game hierarchy and through the major plot of the game . Since its debut in 2002 , five expansion packs have been released along with six add @-@ on scenarios . Each expansion pack and add @-@ on brings a new major storyline to the Final Fantasy XI world , along with numerous areas , quests , events and item rewards . 
 In March 2015 , Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XI would receive one more final main scenario ( spread out over three parts in 2015 ) . Final Fantasy XI became the final active server on the PlayStation 2 online service . The servers for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions were ultimately shut down on March 31 , 2016 . A mobile client for the game is under development by Square Enix in collaboration with Korean developer Nexon . A spinoff mobile game , Final Fantasy Grandmasters was released on September 30 , 2015 .

 Final Fantasy XI is a massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game ( MMORPG ) , and differs from previous titles in the series in several ways . Unlike the predefined main characters of previous Final Fantasy titles , players are able to customize their characters in limited ways , including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender , facial style , hair color , body size , job , and nation allegiance . Also diverging from previous games in the series , the game takes place in a fully three @-@ dimensional landscape with enemies freely roaming in it , allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the random encounters used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered Final Fantasy title since . 
 There are currently 16 public game worlds available for play , down from 32 at the game 's height , with approximately 15 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 players in each . A private Test Server was opened to eligible players to aid in feedback of updates in development for the game in mid @-@ 2011 . The servers are named after summoned monsters from previous Final Fantasy titles , such as Ifrit and <unk> . Players have the ability to move between servers , though Square @-@ Enix charges a " world transfer " fee to do so . There are no region @-@ specific or system @-@ specific servers , and unlike most online games , players of different languages play in the same world and can interact through automatic language translation from a library of translated phrases . The game servers are run by Square @-@ Enix as part of their PlayOnline network .

 Story related gameplay in Final Fantasy XI consists of two major components : missions , through which the main storyline of the game is told , and quests , which do not advance the main storyline , but fill out the game 's fantasy world . Completing missions allows a player to advance in rank , which grants access to new areas , several privileges , and various other storylines . At first , a player may only complete missions for his home nation , though they are able to change allegiances later on , allowing access to other nations ' storylines . Quests may be undertaken for their various rewards , or to acquire " fame , " which allows a character to become well @-@ known and respected by NPCs ; a higher fame rating will open up new interactions and quests with NPCs . At release , over one hundred quests were available to play and each expansion pack has added its own set of missions and quests . Players obtain in @-@ game money known as gil by completing missions , quests and defeating Beastmen , though unlike previous Final Fantasy games , these monsters drop only small amounts . Gil can then be exchanged amongst players for goods through the Auction House , or be used to purchase items and rewards from NPCs . 
 Unlike some MMORPGs , there is very little focus on player versus player ( PvP ) combat , instead the game revolves around player versus environment ( PvE ) . There are numerous PvE activities and events for players to partake in , including instanced activities and shared spaces activities . Some instanced events include Dynamis , Salvage , Assault and <unk> Isle , which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players . These battle grounds give players a series of objectives to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat , generally within a certain time frame . Popular shared spaces activities include hunting Notorious Monsters , fiends that rarely appear and drop precious loot . 
 The only way to attack other players in PvP is to enter one of two competition activities known as " Conflict " . The first form of competition , called <unk> , involves players competing to score points by throwing <unk> into a castle @-@ like structure known as a Rook . The second form is known as " Brenner " , and features a capture the flag type system . 
 From time to time special seasonal festivals and events are held . They last only for a set period of time and offer a variety of fun or useful rewards . Many events have changed over time , adding new features and eliminating old ones . These events are geared towards any level , often restricting players to level 1 , so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together . Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents , for example : <unk> 's Day in place of Valentine 's Day , the Egg Hunt Egg @-@ <unk> in place of Easter , and the Starlight Celebration in place of Christmas . 
 = = = Battle and party system = = = 
 Battles in Final Fantasy XI take place in the world in which players move around , a first in the series , where battle had previously taken place in a separate screen via random encounters . The surprise of the random encounter system is achieved via aggressive monsters , who will attack players based on different factors such as sight and sound . This format would continue in future Final Fantasy games . Monsters within the game operate under a system of " claim " and " enmity " . A monster is claimed the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it , whether physical , magical or ability related . With some exceptions , once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it . A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity . Players have several means at their disposal , including spells , abilities and items , to build up enmity or shed it to their advantage in battle - a factor that features heavily in group , or " party " play . 
 To defeat more powerful monsters and gain experience points efficiently , players can join a party . A regular party has room for six members . Like in many other games , a well @-@ balanced party will consist of several <unk> namely a healer , a tank ( the party member with high defense that will be the main target of the monster ) , and the damage dealer . The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties , as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks . A well @-@ balanced team working together is the only way to defeat many of the game 's enemies . 
 A party can expand into an alliance , with up to three parties combined , with a total of 18 players . Alliances are necessary to complete more difficult challenges : including missions , quests , nation or territory driven events , and defeating notorious monsters . Much of end @-@ game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players ( e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item ) . 
 Final Fantasy XI 's incarnation of Limit Breaks are " Weapon Skills " . Physical damage given and received fills a Tactical Points ( TP ) bar , to a maximum of 3000 . Any amount above 1000 is able to be used up by being channelled into a weapon skill . These skills vary in effect depending on job class , what weapon is equipped , how full the TP bar is , and how proficient the player is with the weapon . If partying with other players , one may use these weapon skills in succession in order to create a " <unk> " . A <unk> creates additional damage after a series of weapon skills are used . Building on this even further , magic used on a <unk> at the right time will receive a boost to its damage ; this is called a " Magic Burst " . In order to create the best possible <unk> and magic bursts , players must work together , focusing on each other 's actions and timing . 
 = = = Job system = = = 
 Final Fantasy XI uses the concept of changing Jobs in a similar fashion to Final Fantasy III , and currently has twenty @-@ two Jobs as of the latest expansion pack in 2013 . There are six " standard Jobs " available to choose from at the start of the game . After one standard Job has reached Level 30 , the " extra Jobs " are accessible upon completing certain quests . Players are able to change their jobs any time from inside their house or by speaking with a Nomad Moogle . In June 2010 , the long @-@ standing level limit of 75 was incrementally increased to the higher level cap of 99 , finishing in the December 2011 version update . 
 Jobs have a combination of unique " job traits " , " job abilities " , and magic spells , giving them a specific role within group play due to their area of expertise . Job traits are passive abilities that are always in effect , while job abilities must be activated by the player in order to come into effect . They last a limited time and have a " cooldown " period before they can be used again . Magic spells are available to certain jobs , and in addition to a cooldown period , they often consume MP or some form of item in order to be cast , while at the same time requiring the user to stand still . Additionally , each job has a special one @-@ hour ability that performs an extraordinary function . 
 The unique system of Final Fantasy XI 's job system is the " Support Job " . This system allows a player to augment their character with abilities , traits , and spells from another chosen job , at half the level of their current job . For instance , a Level 20 Warrior setting Ninja as their support job would allow them to use all Ninja abilities , traits , and spells up to that of a level 10 Ninja , while still primarily being a Level 20 Warrior . The support job system allows for job @-@ merges never before seen in the Final Fantasy series . However , there are some exceptions to the system . One @-@ hour abilities and other abilities deemed signature to a particular job ( such as Call Wyvern for Dragoons ) are restricted to being used only on the main job . 
 = = = Crafting and hobbies = = = 
 In addition to completing quests and missions , players can participate in several side @-@ minigames and other activities . One such minigame is fishing , where players can measure their strength against the fish they attempt to catch . Another is clamming , where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over their bucket 's size limit . Gardening allows players to raise plants in their residence , or " Mog House " as it is known in the game . The raising and breeding of Chocobos was a long @-@ requested activity enabled in the summer 2006 update . Chocobo racing began in March 2007 , which allowed for the racing of player @-@ raised Chocobos against non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) . Winning racers can earn " <unk> " , which can be used to buy , for example , items that assist Chocobo breeding . 
 An important part of the game is the accumulation of items , especially rare ones , which allow players to create powerful weapons , armour and food . There are many ways to obtain items , such as harvesting , excavating , logging , mining , defeating monsters , and digging by using Chocobos . Square Enix attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of " gil selling " , or exchanging real money for in @-@ game items . The item auction system was shut down temporarily once due to some players exploiting the system . Items can be created by consuming elemental crystals ( obtained by fighting monsters ) with other ingredients in a process called " synthesis " . Recipe results can vary widely based on the player 's skill , the quality of the player 's equipment worn , and the ingredients used . There is large speculation ( though nothing evidently documented yet ) about the moon phase , direction the player is facing , in @-@ game day ( every day of the week is assigned an element ) , and even time of day the synthesis is performed to either increase or reduce the results of the recipe . 
 = = = Game economy = = = 
 Final Fantasy XI has a largely player @-@ based economy , with a heavy reliance on auction houses in each of the major cities of Vana 'diel . There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction . Transportation , auction house , item storage , and fees do not go to players ; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation . The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city , but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update . 
 Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the Terms of Service for Final Fantasy XI . In early 2006 , Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency , which , in turn , drove up prices for all items across the game . In response , 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion gil was removed from circulation . In July 2006 , Square Enix banned or suspended over 8 @,@ 000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce . Since 2006 , Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms , some of them using third @-@ party tools , effectively removing billions of gil from the in @-@ game economy . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 The setting of Final Fantasy XI is the world of Vana 'diel , a rich world with diverse climates , ranging from northern glaciers and southern deserts , to ethereal realms and sky landmasses . Vana 'diel is divided into a number of regions , which are subdivided into areas known as " zones " . These zones are available for exploration and consist of outdoor areas , dungeons , cities , and towns . Players are able to explore a portion of Vana 'diel , including the Middle Lands , Near East , and with the release of Seekers of Adoulin , the near west . Six city states exist in the available lands , The Republic of Bastok , The Kingdom of San d 'Oria , The Federation of Windurst , The Grand Duchy of Jeuno , The Empire of Aht Urhgan and the Sacred City of Adoulin . While most areas are accessible by walking , various modes of transportation , ranging from the classic Final Fantasy Chocobo and airships to special spells , facilitate movement across the game world . 
 Ancient lore states that Vana 'diel was created as a playground for the Gods and their children , who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal . Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods , the children constructed a pathway to paradise . They were smote down for their insolence , however , and their cities cast to the bottom of the sea . After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness , the Goddess <unk> wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana 'diel . The God of Twilight , Promathia , condemned her weakness , however , and the life that arose from it . Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes : the apathy of the Humes , the arrogance of the Elvaan , the rage of the Galka , the cowardice of the Tarutaru , and the envy of the Mithra . He created the Beastmen , commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana 'diel and occupy their minds , so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them . The creation lore 's sentient Crystal , Gods , Children , and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs , while the Beastmen are some of the game 's main antagonists . 
 The events of the game are set 20 years after the Crystal War , a devastating war where the Middle Land nations of Bastok , San d 'Oria and Windurst fought and defeated the Shadow Lord and his army of Beastmen . Players deal with the aftermath of this conflict in the original story , and may travel back in time to aid in the war effort with the expansion pack Wings of the Goddess . Several parallel worlds are available , such as Dynamis and <unk> , in which the <unk> won the Crystal War and conquered the land . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Final Fantasy XI features five playable races known as the " Enlightened Races " : 
 Elvaan 
 A race of proud warriors , the Elvaan 's home city is the Kingdom of San d 'Oria . Elvaan have an unshakable pride and faith in their beliefs , and many eschew the business world , preferring an austere lifestyle as skilled sword fighters . The Elvaan race possess high strength and mind , but low MP and intelligence . Elvaan are said to be cursed with the sin of arrogance . 
 Hume 
 Originating from the city of Bastok , Humes are the most common race in Vana 'diel and are known for their intelligence and high level of skill in numerous areas . Humes have equally balanced abilities , and are said to be cursed with the sin of apathy . They serve as the game 's human race . 
 Galka 
 A hulking race of powerful warriors , the Galka 's capital city was destroyed by war 600 years ago . Many of the surviving Galka settled in Bastok , and are currently used by the city as cheap underclass labour . The Galka do not have a female counterpart , but reproduce through reincarnation . They possess the highest HP and vitality in the game , but also the lowest MP . The Galka are cursed with rage . 
 Mithra 
 The Mithra are a race of hunters who live alongside the Tarutaru in Windurst . They are known for their energy , curiosity , and their penchant for causing playful mischief . Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity , and so only female <unk> leave the home , making females the only playable gender . Mithra possess high dexterity and agility , but lower HP and charisma . Mithra are cursed with envy . 
 Tarutaru 
 A race of skilled magic from the Federation of Windurst , the Tarutaru physically resemble children , however their size does not reflect their age . Tarutaru are playful yet cunning . They possess the highest MP and intelligence of all the races , but the lowest HP and strength . Tarutaru are said to be cursed with cowardice 
 In addition to the playable races , there are two other non @-@ playable Enlightened Races , known as the Zilart and the <unk> . These ancient races were thought extinct , and are the focus of the first two @-@ game expansions . There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests , missions and the game 's storylines . The game features several typical Final Fantasy fiends , including Goblins , <unk> and <unk> . Several of these races are known as Beastmen , a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence , exhibiting self @-@ awareness , emotions , culture , and religion . The complex relationship , bigoted views , and reasons of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game . 
 Final Fantasy XI is represented in the Dissidia game series by Shantotto , a female Tarutaru Black Mage from the Windurst storyline , voiced by famed voice actress Megumi Hayashibara in the Japanese version and Candi Milo in English version . The games prequel adds Prishe , a female Elvaan from <unk> , who is the main character in the Chains of Promathia expansion pack . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The storyline is primarily followed with missions through the governing nations that exist in the base game as well as each expansion that the player is affiliated with . Nation or governing body affiliation is relatively simple , sometimes requiring prerequisite quests being completed and have several stages of progression to achieve higher recognition and reward throughout each story . Some missions are even required to be completed to further progress into the start of the additional storylines of each expansion or specific areas . 
 Players begin the game as residents of one of the three main countries : San d 'Oria , Bastok , and Windurst , and must help band the nations together against the resurrected Shadow Lord . 
 The expansion Rise of the Zilart reveals that the Crystal War and the resurrection of the Shadow Lord had been masterminded by the Zilart princes <unk> <unk> and Kam <unk> , who survived the extinction of their race . The two <unk> plan to become Gods by opening the path to paradise , and the player is charged with thwarting their plans . 
 Chains of Promathia revolves around an Elvaan girl named Prishe and the dead Twilight God Promathia , who had originally cursed the Zilart race , and the attempts of various factions to either complete or stop his resurrection . The <unk> Bahamut is involved in these events , and intends to destroy Vana 'diel to prevent Promathia from absorbing the life of the world . 
 Treasures of Aht Urhgan concerns the Empire of Aht Urhgan which opens up to the nations of midlands after years of self @-@ imposed isolation . As a new and powerful nation , it is of concern to the nation of the player , who is sent as a representative . The player then becomes embroiled in the intrigues of the Empress 's court and the growing fears of war and darkness coming to Aht Urhgan . 
 Wings of the Goddess primarily occurs in the era of the Crystal War , 20 years in the past from the main Final Fantasy XI setting . The player discovers and crosses mysterious time portals alongside the Hume / Elvaan mix Lilisette , and are led to help the Regal Feline Cait Sith reduce the suffering of the era . However , Lilisette and her partner encounter Lilith , an alternate timeline version of herself who wishes to keep the war going to maintain her time while negating Lilisette 's . 
 Seekers of Adoulin concerns the western continent archipelago of Adoulin , and the Sacred City of Adoulin . The city was a focal point for colonization 200 years before the present game , but when colonization efforts failed in the main continent of <unk> , the nation fell in population and shifted to trade as a focus . Now colonization has begun once again , and players are free to explore the region . 
 = = Development = = 
 The idea to develop Final Fantasy XI as an online game was conceived by Hironobu Sakaguchi when establishing Square Pictures headquarters in Hawaii . Impressed by western MMORPGs that he discovered there , such as EverQuest , Sakaguchi convinced Square to begin the development of their own MMORPG and suggested that it be based on the Final Fantasy series . The team responsible for Chrono Cross was assigned to the development of Final Fantasy XI after the English localization of the former title . Development began in November 1999 . The game was the first developed under Square 's new philosophy to develop for " all platforms and media " . Hiromichi Tanaka , the producer of the game , has stated Final Fantasy XI is heavily influenced by Final Fantasy III , especially in its battle and magic systems . According to Tanaka , Square put in Final Fantasy XI what they could not put in the first Final Fantasy titles due to technical limitations , thus making Final Fantasy XI the " most [ representative ] Final Fantasy of all the episodes " . The game was developed and ran on the Nvidia GeForce 4 Ti GPU , which the President of Square Yoichi Wada described as the most powerful graphics processor available at the time . The game cost two to three billion yen ( ~ $ 17 – 25 million ) to create along with the PlayOnline Network Service and was assumed to become profitable over a five @-@ year timespan . By creating a unified game world instead of different ones <unk> by language , development costs were cut 66 % . Since recurring monsters of the series are known by different names in the Japanese and English versions of the other installments , it was decided for Final Fantasy XI to use both Japanese and English names for different varieties of the same monsters . 
 It was originally announced that there would be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows as well as concurrent Japanese and American release , but this was later changed . There was also discussion of an Xbox release , but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive . Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference , there was a great deal of negative press . There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series , since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story , which it ended up having , and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested . Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan , a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001 . 
 Following its PC release , Final Fantasy XI was listed as one of IGN 's most anticipated PlayStation 2 games of 2004 . Sony launched a multimillion @-@ dollar ad campaign to promote Final Fantasy XI along with the PlayStation 2 hard drive add @-@ on which the game required . Having been released on the PlayStation 2 as well as the personal computer , it became the first cross @-@ platform MMORPG ever created . On June 14 , 2002 , the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers , bug fixes on the text interface , and a new patch for the game client . This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game . Other early issues included complaints by American players that experienced Japanese players had already completed all the quests . Square Enix responded by adding new servers in order to have game worlds with fewer expert players . 
 Final Fantasy XI is one of the first cross @-@ console video games , and has continued to update its software to allow the game to run on new consoles . Square Enix noted that Nintendo 's use of " friend codes " was the primary reason Final Fantasy XI was not brought to the Wii . In December 2006 , the PlayStation 2 versions of PlayOnline and Final Fantasy XI were able to install and run on the PlayStation 3 . The Vana 'diel Collection 2008 discs for the PlayStation 2 had installation issues on the PlayStation 3 , causing them to be unusable at first since they weren 't on Sony 's list of HDD compatible titles in the firmware the PlayStation 3 had at the time . This problem was fixed on December 18 , 2007 when Sony released firmware update 2 @.@ 10 for the PlayStation 3 . This allowed all backwards compatible models — <unk> model # <unk> , <unk> model # <unk> and <unk> model # <unk> — to play <unk> . After working with Microsoft to resolve Final Fantasy XI 's incompatibility issues with Windows Vista , Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the operating system , although small bugs have appeared . 
 On September 1 , 2010 , Akihiko Matsui became the director of Final Fantasy XI . Only three months later , on December 10 , 2010 , Matsui left the Final Fantasy XI team to work as " Lead Combat System Designer " on Square Enix 's new MMO , Final Fantasy XIV . His replacement as director of Final Fantasy XI is Mizuki Ito . On July 13 , 2011 , information from a Famitsu interview with former Final Fantasy XI producer Hiromichi Tanaka revealed that Square Enix is looking into the possibility of porting Final Fantasy XI to Sony PlayStation Vita . On June 24 , 2012 , at the end of <unk> 2012 , a festival in Yokohama , Japan to celebrate 2012 's tenth anniversary of the Japanese launch of Final Fantasy XI , Hiromichi Tanaka announced that , due to health reasons , he was stepping down as producer of the game and leaving Square @-@ Enix . Akihiko Matsui has been selected to replace him . 
 In 2006 , between 200 @,@ 000 and 300 @,@ 000 active players logged in per day , with 500 @,@ 000 total active players and around 150 @,@ 000 online at any one time . In April 2009 , Square Enix announced that the total number of active characters exceeded 2 million for the first time . In June 2012 , Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that Final Fantasy XI had become the most profitable title in the Final Fantasy series . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music of Final Fantasy XI was scored by Naoshi Mizuta , Kumi Tanioka , and Nobuo Uematsu . Composer Yasunori Mitsuda was also asked to contribute , but at the time he was unable to do so , as he was scoring the music for Xenosaga . The game 's five expansion packs since were scored by Mizuta alone , after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix . The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in Esperanto . According to Uematsu , the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers ' hope that their online game could contribute to cross @-@ cultural communication and cooperation . He also noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline , a major change from the previous Final Fantasy games . It was the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square Enix employee . New music has been employed for special events , such as a holiday score titled " Jeuno <unk> <unk> " which can be heard in the city of Jeuno each mid @-@ to @-@ late December since 2004 . 
 The game 's music has been released in CD form several times and has been featured in Final Fantasy concerts . Some of the game 's music has been released on iTunes , such as the vocal " Distant Worlds " , which was released on the Japanese iTunes store on September 13 , 2005 , having been put in the game in a July 2005 patch . A compilation CD box was released on March 28 , 2007 , titled Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box , which included the four original soundtracks from Final Fantasy XI and its three expansion sets , as well as the previously unreleased tracks from the game and the unreleased Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections . Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy- , a 2004 – 2005 concert series , featured " Ronfaure " from Final Fantasy XI . A ten @-@ track album of music inspired by Final Fantasy XI entitled Music from the Other Side of Vana 'diel was released by The Star Onions on August 24 , 2005 .

Famitsu rated the game 38 out of 40 . Computer and Video Games Magazine noted that it was one of the most welcoming MMORPGs despite the cumbersome initial registration and setup . IGN called it a well done but unoriginal game and also noted that North American players were forced to play with already much more experienced Japanese players who had already completed the game 's various quests . GameSpot criticized it at release for having an unconventional control system , a lengthy installation , and having no player versus player ( PvP ) aspects . Other elements receiving criticism include the EXP grind , which involves constant battles to access different parts of the game , and overcrowded camp sites . The expansions have been mostly positively received , with praise for the amount of content added , but increasing signs that the graphics of the game are becoming outdated . IGN review of the Xbox 360 release was similar , noting that it was a large amount of game content , but had a protracted setup process and elements of the game design that require a large time investment . It has also been noted that this game is the first to move in a wildly different direction while remaining in the main numbering line , as opposed to the Tactics and Crystal Chronicles games which became their own side series . 
 = = = Sales and subscriptions = = = 
 The user base for the PlayStation 2 version was truncated initially because of limited sales of the PlayStation 2 's hard drive and network adapters that were needed for the game .

 Final Fantasy XI was awarded the grand prize from the Japan 's Consumer Entertainment Software Association ( CESA ) for 2002 – 2003 along with Taiko no Tatsujin . It has also received GameSpy 's 2003 PC MMORPG Game of the Year Award and IGN 's Game of the Month for March 2004 , citing the game 's huge customization and its successful cross @-@ platform and cross @-@ language game world . Final Fantasy XI was referenced in the online game Minna no Golf Online in the form of a Final Fantasy XI @-@ themed lobby . At 2009 's Electronic Entertainment Expo , Square Enix revealed Final Fantasy XIV Online , which was Square Enix 's next MMORPG . 
 The game has spawned several written adaptations and related merchandise . Starting in 2003 , a series of Final Fantasy XI novels was written by Miyabi Hasegawa and released in Japanese , German , and French . Additionally , in 2004 , Adventure Log , a webcomic by Scott <unk> , was commissioned by Square Enix starting in 2007 .

 = What Is Life = 
 " What Is Life " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . In many countries , it was issued as the second single from the album , in February 1971 , becoming a top @-@ ten hit in the United States , Canada and elsewhere , and topping singles charts in Australia and Switzerland . In the United Kingdom , " What Is Life " appeared as the B @-@ side to " My Sweet Lord " , which was the best @-@ selling single there of 1971 . Harrison 's backing musicians on the song include Eric Clapton and the entire Delaney & Bonnie Friends band , with whom he had toured during the final months of the Beatles . Harrison co @-@ produced the recording with Phil Spector , whose Wall of Sound production also employed a prominent string arrangement by John Barham and multiple acoustic rhythm guitars , played by Harrison 's fellow Apple Records signings Badfinger . 
 An uptempo composition in the soul genre , " What Is Life " is one of several Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at both a woman and a deity . Harrison wrote the song in 1969 and originally intended it as a track for his friend and Apple protégé Billy Preston to record . Built around a descending guitar riff , it is one of Harrison 's most popular compositions and was a regular inclusion in his live performances . Rolling Stone magazine has variously described it as a " classic " and an " exultant song of surrender " . 
 " What Is Life " has appeared in the soundtrack for feature films such as Goodfellas ( 1990 ) , Patch Adams ( 1998 ) , Big Daddy ( 1999 ) and This Is 40 ( 2012 ) . Harrison 's original recording was included on the compilations The Best of George Harrison and Let It Roll , and live versions appear on his album Live in Japan ( 1992 ) and in Martin Scorsese 's 2011 documentary George Harrison : Living in the Material World . In 1972 , Olivia Newton @-@ John had a UK hit with her version of the song . Ronnie Aldrich , the Ventures , the Four Freshmen and Shawn Mullins are among the other artists who have covered the track .

 Even before his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969 ( documented in the song " Wah @-@ Wah " ) , their Apple Records label was an " emancipating force " for Harrison from the creative restrictions imposed on him within the band , according to his musical biographer , Simon Leng . In his " definitive " article on All Things Must Pass for Mojo magazine , John Harris has written of Harrison 's " journey " as a solo artist beginning in November 1968 – when he spent time in Woodstock with Bob Dylan and the Band – and incorporating a series of other collaborations through the following eighteen months , including various Apple projects and a support role on Delaney & Bonnie and Friends ' brief European tour . One of these projects , carried out intermittently from April to July 1969 , was his production of That 's the Way God Planned It , an album by Billy Preston , whom Harrison had met during the Beatles ' Hamburg years and had recently recruited to guest on the band 's troubled Get Back sessions . It was while driving up to a Preston session in London from his home in Esher , Surrey , that Harrison came up with the song " What Is Life " . 
 In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , Harrison describes it as having been written " very quickly " and recalls that he thought it would be a perfect , " catchy pop song " for Preston to record . His lyrics , while simple , were similarly uplifting and universal : 
 What I feel , I can 't say 
 But my love is there for you any time of day 
 But if it 's not love that you need 
 Then I 'll try my best to make everything succeed . 
 Tell me , what is my life without your love ? 
 And tell me , who am I without you , by my side ? 
 These lyrics have caused some debate among biographers and music critics , as to whether " What Is Life " should be viewed as a straightforward love song – perhaps a " lovingly crafted <unk> " to Harrison 's wife Pattie , as Alan Clayson puts it – or a devotional song like many of Harrison 's compositions . Ian Inglis writes that the song title suggests a " philosophical debate about the meaning of life " , yet its rendering as " what is my life " in the choruses " reshapes [ the meaning ] completely " . Theologian Dale Allison finds no religious content in " What Is Life " but notes the " failure of words to express feelings " implied in the opening line ( " What I feel , I can 't say " ) , a recurring theme of Harrison 's spiritual songs such as " That Is All " , " Mystical One " and " Pisces Fish " . Joshua Greene , another religious academic , identifies the song as part of its parent album 's " intimately detailed account of a spiritual journey " : where " Awaiting on You All " shows Harrison " convinced of his union with God " , " What Is Life " reveals him to be " uncertain that he deserved such divine favor " . 
 The song 's second verse repeats what Inglis refers to as the " somewhat confusing promise " from Harrison ( in lines 3 and 4 ) should his love be " rejected " : 
 What I know , I can 't do 
 If I give my love out to everyone like you 
 But if it 's not love that you need 
 Then I 'll try my best to make everything succeed . 
 Musically , Simon Leng describes " What Is Life " as " Motown @-@ spiced " and a comparatively rare example of its composer 's willingness to embrace the role of " entertainer " in his songwriting . 
 In I Me Mine , Harrison recalls that he changed his mind about offering " What Is Life " to Preston once he 'd arrived at Olympic Studios and found the singer busy working on more typical material – or " playing his funky stuff " as Harrison puts it . Rather than attempt it with the Beatles during the band 's concurrent Abbey Road sessions , he stockpiled the track with his many other unused songs from the period – " All Things Must Pass " , " Let It Down " , " I 'd Have You Anytime " and " Run of the Mill " among them – and revisited it a year later , after completing work on Preston 's second Apple album , Encouraging Words .

 By May 1970 , having recently collaborated with " genuine R & B heavy @-@ weights " such as Doris Troy and Preston , as well as participating in the " blue @-@ eyed soul " Delaney & Bonnie European tour , along with Eric Clapton , the previous December , Harrison was well placed to record " What Is Life " , Leng observes . With Phil Spector as co @-@ producer and all the Friends team on hand , the song was among the first tracks taped for Harrison 's debut post @-@ Beatles solo album ; recording took place at Abbey Road Studios in London , during late May or early June . The same core of musicians – Bobby Whitlock , Carl Radle , Jim Gordon , Bobby Keys and Jim Price – would similarly elevate other All Things Must Pass tracks such as " Awaiting on You All " , " Art of Dying " and " Hear Me Lord " . 
 The recording is defined by Harrison 's descending , fuzztone guitar riff , which also serves as the motif for the chorus . The track opens with this riff , which is then joined by Radle 's bass and " churning " rhythm guitar from Clapton , before Gordon 's drums bring the full band in . During the verses , Gordon moves to a square , Motown @-@ style beat – or " rock @-@ steady Northern soul backbeat " in Leng 's words – before returning to the " galloping rhythm " of the more open , " knockout " choruses , and the song is driven equally by Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins ' powerful tambourine work . 
 On " What Is Life " , Spector provided what music critic David Fricke terms " echo @-@ drenched theater " , in the form of reverb @-@ heavy brass , soaring strings ( arranged by John Barham ) and " a choir of multitracked Harrisons " . The vocals and Barham 's contribution , along with a brief slide @-@ guitar commentary from Harrison over the final verse , were overdubbed at Trident Studios , most likely during late August through September . Dated 19 August , Spector 's written comments on Harrison 's early mix of the song had suggested a " proper background voice " was still needed ; like sound engineer Ken Scott , Spector would be impressed with the result , saying , " He was a great <unk> ... he could do all the [ vocal ] parts himself " and rating Harrison " one of the most commercial musicians and songwriters and quintessential players I 've ever known in my entire career " .

 " What Is Life " was released in late November 1970 as the first track on side two of All Things Must Pass , in its original , triple LP format . Along with " My Sweet Lord " and " Isn 't It a Pity " , the song had already been identified as a potential hit single by Allan Steckler , manager of Apple 's US operation . Backed by another album track , " Apple Scruffs " , " What Is Life " was issued as a single in America on 15 February 1971 ( as Apple 1828 ) , just as the " My Sweet Lord " / " Isn 't It a Pity " double A @-@ side was finally slipping out of the top ten . 
 The front of the single 's US picture sleeve consisted of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home , Friar Park , in Henley @-@ on @-@ Thames . The tower 's sole , octagonal @-@ shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space . This picture was taken by photographer Barry Feinstein , whose Camouflage Productions partner , Tom Wilkes , originally used it as part of an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package . The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond . Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes 's design – the Friar Park tower image filled the top half of the poster , floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster . The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close @-@ up of Feinstein 's All Things Must Pass front @-@ cover image , taken on the main lawn of Friar Park . In Denmark , the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison , again with guitar , taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour . 
 At the end of March , " What Is Life " peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 7 on Cash Box 's Top 100 chart , making Harrison the first ex @-@ Beatle to have two top @-@ ten hits in the United States . The single was a success internationally , climbing to number 1 in Switzerland and on Australia 's Go @-@ Set National Top 60 , and reaching the top three elsewhere in Europe and in Canada . In Britain , where Harrison had resisted issuing a single from All Things Must Pass until midway through January , " What Is Life " appeared on the B @-@ side to " My Sweet Lord " – a combination that became the top @-@ selling single of 1971 in that country . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " What Is Life " is one of Harrison 's most commercial and popular songs – a " spiritual guitar quest " that " became [ a ] classic " , according to Rolling Stone magazine . On release , Billboard magazine 's reviewer wrote of " What Is Life " and " Apple Scruffs " as " intriguing rhythm follows @-@ ups " to Harrison 's previous single , which were " sure to repeat that success " and " should prove big juke box items " . In their Solo Beatles Compendium , authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter refer to it as an " intensely catchy track " and view its pairing with " My Sweet Lord " in the UK as perhaps the strongest of all of Harrison 's singles . Writing in 1981 , NME critic Bob Woffinden grouped " What Is <unk> " with " My Sweet Lord " , " Isn 't It a Pity " and " Awaiting on You All " as " all excellent songs " . 
 Reviewing the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass , for Rolling Stone , James Hunter wrote of how the album 's music " exults in breezy rhythms " , among which " the colorful revolutions of ' What Is Life ' ... [ move ] like a Ferris wheel " . The following year , in Rolling Stone Press 's Harrison tribute book , David Fricke included " What Is Life " among his selection of " essential Harrison performances " ( just three of which date from the ex @-@ Beatle 's solo years ) and described the track as an " exultant song of surrender " , abetted by Harrison 's " pumping fuzz guitar " and the song 's " singalong magnetism " . AllMusic 's Richie Unterberger similarly praises " What Is Life " for its " anthemic " qualities , " particularly snazzy horn lines " , and a guitar riff that is " one more entry in the catalog of George Harrison 's book of arresting , low , descending guitar lines " . 
 Writing in the book 1 @,@ 000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die , author Tom Moon refers to " the upbeat single ' What Is Life ' " as an example of how Harrison " grabs what he needs from his old band – that insinuating hook sense – and uses it to frame an utterly comfortable metaphysical discourse " . Alan Clayson describes " What Is Life " as a seemingly " lovey @-@ dovey pop song " that " craftily renewed the simplistic tonic @-@ to @-@ dominant riff cliché " , while Simon Leng credits Harrison 's " innate ability to write very fine pop @-@ rock songs " and deems the result " as innovative an exercise in rock @-@ soul as The Temptations ' ' Cloud Nine ' " . Among Harrison biographers , only Ian Inglis is less than enthusiastic , acknowledging that Barham 's orchestration and the other musicians give the track " undoubted excitement and energy " , but lamenting that the song offers " little overall coherence between words and music " . 
 In a 2010 poll to find the " 10 Best George Harrison Songs " , AOL Radio listeners voted " What Is Life " third behind " My Sweet Lord " and " Blow Away " . A similar list by Michael Galluci of Ultimate Classic Rock placed it second ( behind " My Sweet Lord " ) , as Galluci wrote of the track having " a giant pop hook as its guide " as well as " the catchiest chorus Harrison ever penned " . In 2009 , Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound listed it sixth among his " Top Ten Songs by Ex @-@ Beatles " , writing : " it 's arguable that Harrison 's All Things Must Pass is the best solo album put out by a Beatle . ' What is Life ' … with its riff @-@ driven bounce , soaring harmonies on the choruses , and perfectly placed sax and trumpet , [ is ] probably Harrison 's catchiest pop song . " In the 2005 publication NME Originals : Beatles – The Solo Years 1970 – 1980 , Adrian Thrills rated it first among Harrison 's " ten solo gems " , adding : " One of Harrison 's greatest guitar riffs – brilliant pop . " The song is said to be a favourite of Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl . In a Rolling Stone readers ' poll , titled " 10 Greatest Solo Beatle Songs " , the song placed fourth , with the editor commenting : " The track is deceptively simple , and more layers become apparent the more often you play it . " " What Is Life " has featured in Bruce Pollock 's book The 7 @,@ 500 Most Important Songs of 1944 – 2000 , Treble website 's " The Top 200 Songs of the 1970s " ( ranked at number 101 ) and Dave Thompson 's 1000 Songs That Rock Your World ( at number 247 ) .

 " What Is Life " was included on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as well as 2009 's Let It Roll : Songs by George Harrison . The song has also been featured in a number of popular movies : Martin Scorsese 's Goodfellas ( 1990 ) , during the " May 11 , 1980 " sequence ; Tom Shadyac 's Patch Adams ( 1998 ) ; and , more recently , Sam Mendes ' Away We Go ( 2009 ) . In late 2012 , " What Is Life " was used in advance promotion for the film This Is 40 , directed by Judd Apatow , although it was omitted from the accompanying soundtrack album . According to Rolling Stone : " Today , many people know it merely as a song from all those soundtracks : it 's in This Is 40 , Patch Adams , Goodfellas and many more . It 's almost as ubiquitous as ' Let My Love Open the Door ' or ' Solsbury Hill . ' " In Scorsese 's 2011 documentary George Harrison : Living in the Material World , " What Is Life " plays over a sequence of 1969 photos of Harrison – with , variously , Preston , Jackie Lomax , the Plastic Ono Band , Clapton and Ravi Shankar – immediately before which , archive footage shows him discussing the restrictions he felt within the Beatles and how the band " had to implode " . 
 An alternative studio version of " What Is Life " – in fact , a rough mix of the original backing track with different orchestration ( in this case , piccolo trumpet and oboe ) – was issued as one of five bonus tracks on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass . In the accompanying booklet , Harrison writes that this orchestral arrangement was discarded because he " didn 't like the feel " . Speaking to Billboard editor @-@ in @-@ chief Timothy White in December 2000 , Harrison explained the reason for the lack of a guide vocal on this version : " I 'm playing the fuzz guitar part that goes all through the song . So all I could do on the [ initial ] take was to give the band the cue line – the first line of each verse – and then go back to playing that riff . So that rough mix without the vocal – I 'd forgot all about it … " The track also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968 – 75 reissue of All Things Must Pass .

 Part of a concert performance of " What Is Life " from Harrison 's 1974 North American tour with Shankar is included in Scorsese 's George Harrison : Living in the Material World . While challenging the commonly held view that this controversial 1974 tour was a " disaster " , Simon Leng writes of a Fort Worth performance of " What Is Life " that was " greeted with a reception that matched anything the New York audience at the Bangla Desh concerts expressed " .

 = Robert Dudley , 1st Earl of Leicester = 
 Robert Dudley , 1st Earl of Leicester KG ( 24 June 1532 or 1533 – 4 September 1588 ) was an English nobleman and the favourite and close friend of Elizabeth I 's , from her first year on the throne until his death . The Queen gave him reason to hope , and he was a suitor for her hand for many years . 
 Dudley 's youth was overshadowed by the downfall of his family in 1553 after his father , the Duke of Northumberland , had unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne . Robert Dudley was condemned to death but was released in 1554 and took part in the Battle of St. Quentin under Philip II of Spain , which led to his full rehabilitation . On Elizabeth I 's accession in November 1558 , Dudley was appointed Master of the Horse . In October 1562 , he became a Privy Councillor and , in 1587 , was appointed Lord Steward of the Royal Household . In 1564 , Dudley became Earl of Leicester and , from 1563 , one of the greatest landowners in North Wales and the English West Midlands by royal grants . 
 Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester , was one of Elizabeth 's leading statesmen , involved in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside William Cecil and Francis Walsingham . Although he refused to be married to Mary , Queen of Scots , Dudley was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until , from the mid @-@ 1580s , he strongly advocated for her execution . As patron of the Puritan movement , he supported non @-@ conforming preachers but tried to mediate between them and the Bishops of the Church of England . A champion also of the international Protestant cause , he led the English campaign in support of the Dutch Revolt ( 1585 – 87 ) . His acceptance of the post of Governor @-@ General of the United Provinces infuriated Queen Elizabeth . The expedition was a military and political failure , and it ruined the Earl financially . Leicester was engaged in many large @-@ scale business ventures and was a main backer of Francis Drake and other explorers and privateers . During the Spanish Armada , the Earl was in over @-@ all command of the English land forces . In this function , he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at Tilbury . This was the last of many events he had organised over the years , the most spectacular being the festival at his seat Kenilworth Castle in 1575 on occasion of a three @-@ week visit by the Queen . Dudley was a principal patron of the arts , literature , and the Elizabethan theatre . 
 Robert Dudley 's private life interfered with his court career and vice versa . When his first wife , Amy Robsart , fell down a flight of stairs and died in 1560 , he was free to marry the Queen . However , the resulting scandal very much reduced his chances in this respect . Popular rumours that he had arranged for his wife 's death continued throughout his life , despite the coroner 's jury 's verdict of accident . For 18 years he did not remarry for Queen Elizabeth 's sake and when he finally did , his new wife , Lettice Knollys , was permanently banished from court . This and the death of his only legitimate son and heir were heavy blows . Shortly after the child 's death in 1584 , a virulent libel known as Leicester 's Commonwealth was circulated in England . It laid the foundation of a literary and historiographical tradition that often depicted the Earl as the Machiavellian " master courtier " and as a deplorable figure around Elizabeth I. More recent research has led to a reassessment of his place in Elizabethan government and society .

 = = = Education and marriage = = = 
 Robert Dudley was the fifth son of John Dudley , Duke of Northumberland , and his wife Jane , daughter of Sir Edward Guildford . John and Jane Dudley had 13 children in all and were known for their happy family life . Among the siblings ' tutors figured John Dee , Thomas Wilson , and Roger Ascham . Roger Ascham believed that Robert Dudley possessed a rare talent for languages and writing , regretting that his pupil had done himself harm by preferring mathematics . The craft of the courtier Robert learnt at the courts of Henry VIII , and especially Edward VI , among whose companions he served . 
 In 1549 Robert Dudley participated in crushing Kett 's Rebellion and probably first met Amy Robsart , whom he was to wed on 4 June 1550 in the presence of the young King Edward . She was of the same age as the bridegroom and the daughter and heiress of Sir John Robsart , a gentleman @-@ farmer of Norfolk . It was a love @-@ match , the young couple depending heavily on both their fathers ' gifts , especially Robert 's . John Dudley , who since early 1550 effectively ruled England , was pleased to strengthen his influence in Norfolk by his son 's marriage . Lord Robert , as he was styled as a duke 's son , became an important local gentleman and a Member of Parliament . His court career went on in parallel .

 On 6 July 1553 King Edward VI died and the Duke of Northumberland attempted to transfer the English Crown to Lady Jane Grey , his daughter @-@ in @-@ law who was married to his second youngest son , Guildford Dudley . Robert Dudley led a force of 300 into Norfolk where Mary Tudor was assembling her followers . After some ten days in the county and securing several towns for Jane , he took King 's Lynn and proclaimed her on the market @-@ place . The next day , 19 July , Jane 's reign was over in London . Soon , the townsmen of King 's Lynn seized Robert Dudley and the rest of his small troop and sent him to Framlingham Castle before Mary I. 
 He was imprisoned in the Tower of London , attainted , and condemned to death , as were his father and four brothers . His father went to the scaffold . In the Tower , Dudley 's stay coincided with the imprisonment of his childhood friend , Mary 's half @-@ sister Elizabeth , who was sent there on suspicion of involvement in Wyatt 's Rebellion . Guildford Dudley was executed in February 1554 . The surviving brothers were released in the autumn ; working for their release , their mother ( who died in January 1555 ) and their brother @-@ in @-@ law , Henry Sidney , had befriended the incoming Spanish nobles around Philip of Spain , Mary 's husband . 
 In December 1554 , Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in a tournament held to celebrate Anglo @-@ Spanish friendship . Yet , the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there , otherwise they were even suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary 's regime . In January 1557 Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some of their former lands , and in March of the same year Dudley was at Calais where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip 's return to England . Ambrose , Robert , and Henry Dudley , the youngest brother , fought for Philip II at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557 . Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a cannonball — according to Robert , before his own eyes . All surviving Dudley children — Ambrose and Robert with their sisters Mary and Katherine — were restored in blood by Mary I 's next parliament in 1558 . 
 = = Royal favourite = = 
 Robert Dudley was counted among Elizabeth 's special friends by Philip II 's envoy to the English court a week before Queen Mary 's death . On 18 November 1558 , the morning after Elizabeth 's accession , he witnessed the surrender of the Great Seal to her at Hatfield . He became Master of the Horse on the same day . This was an important court position entailing close attendance on the sovereign . It suited him , as he was an excellent horseman and showed great professional interest in royal transport and accommodation , horse breeding , and the supply of horses for all occasions . Dudley was also entrusted with organising and overseeing a large part of the Queen 's coronation festivities . 
 In April 1559 Dudley was elected a Knight of the Garter . Shortly before , Philip II had been informed : 
 Lord Robert has come so much into favour that he does whatever he likes with affairs and it is even said that her majesty visits him in his chamber day and night . People talk of this so freely that they go so far as to say that his wife has a malady in one of her breasts and the Queen is only waiting for her to die to marry Lord Robert ... Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty 's behalf ... Your Majesty would do well to attract and confirm him in his friendship . 
 Within a month the Spanish ambassador , Count de Feria , counted Robert Dudley among three persons who ran the country . Visiting foreigners of princely rank were bidding for his goodwill . He acted as official host on state occasions and was himself a frequent guest at ambassadorial dinners . By the autumn of 1559 several foreign princes were vying for the Queen 's hand ; their impatient envoys came under the impression that Elizabeth was fooling them , " keeping Lord Robert 's enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated . " " Lord Robert " , the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra was convinced , was the man " in whom it is easy to recognise the king that is to be ... she will marry none but the favoured Robert . " Many of the nobility would not brook Dudley 's new prominence , as they could not " put up with his being King . " Plans to kill the favourite abounded , and Dudley took to wearing a light coat of mail under his clothes . Among all classes , in England and abroad , gossip got under way that the Queen had children by Dudley — such rumours never quite ended for the rest of her life . 
 = = = Amy Dudley 's death = = = 
 Already in April 1559 court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Dudley from her side ; but her favour did not extend to his wife . Lady Amy Dudley lived in different parts of the country since her ancestral manor house was uninhabitable . Her husband visited her for four days at Easter 1559 and she spent a month around London in the early summer of the same year . They never saw each other again ; Dudley was with the Queen at Windsor Castle and possibly planning a visit to her , when his wife was found dead at her residence Cumnor Place near Oxford on 8 September 1560 : 
 There came to me Bowes , by whom I do understand that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall from a pair of stairs . Little other understanding can I have of him . The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me , until I do hear from you how the matter standeth , or how this evil should light upon me , considering what the malicious world will bruit , as I can take no rest . 
 Retiring to his house at Kew , away from court as from the putative crime scene , he pressed for an impartial inquiry which had already begun in the form of an inquest . The jury found that it was an accident : Lady Dudley , staying alone " in a certain chamber " , had fallen down the adjoining stairs , sustaining two head injuries and breaking her neck . It was widely suspected that Dudley had arranged his wife 's death to be able to marry the Queen . The scandal played into the hands of nobles and politicians who desperately tried to prevent Elizabeth from marrying him . Some of these , like William Cecil and Nicholas Throckmorton , made use of it , but did not themselves believe Dudley to be involved in the tragedy which affected the rest of his life . 
 Most historians have considered murder to be unlikely . The coroner 's report came to light in The National Archives in 2008 and is compatible with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence . In the absence of the forensic findings of 1560 , it was often assumed that a simple accident could not be the explanation — on the basis of near @-@ contemporary tales that Amy Dudley was found at the bottom of a short flight of stairs with a broken neck , her headdress still standing undisturbed " upon her head " , a detail that first appeared as a satirical remark in the libel Leicester 's Commonwealth of 1584 and has ever since been repeated for a fact . To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill , it was suggested in 1956 by Ian Aird , a professor of medicine , that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer , which through metastatic cancerous deposits in the spine , could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain , such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs . This explanation has been widely accepted . Suicide has also often been considered an option , motives being Amy Dudley 's depression or mortal illness . 
 = = = Marriage hopes and proposals = = = 
 Elizabeth remained close with Dudley and he , with her blessing and on her prompting , pursued his suit for her hand in an atmosphere of diplomatic intrigue . His wife 's and his father 's shadows haunted his prospects . Pope Pius IV explained to one of his cardinals : 
 the greater part of the nobility of that island take ill the marriage which the said queen designs to enter with the Lord Robert Dudley ... they fear that if he becomes king , he will want to avenge the death of his father , and extirpate the nobility of that kingdom . 
 Elizabeth countered such notions , saying that Lord Robert " was of a very good disposition and nature , not given by any means to seek revenge of former matters past " . His efforts leading nowhere , in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad ; Elizabeth would have none of that and everything remained as it was . 
 In October 1562 the Queen fell ill with smallpox and , believing her life to be in danger , she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and to give him a suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year . There was universal relief when she recovered her health ; Dudley was made a privy councillor . He was already deeply involved in foreign politics , including Scotland . In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary , Queen of Scots , the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers . Elizabeth 's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court , so that she would not have to forgo her favourite 's company . Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious , wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown . Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley . Mary 's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince , and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester , a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary . In January 1565 Thomas Randolph , the English ambassador to Scotland , was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal . To his amazement , Dudley was not to be moved to comply : 
 But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any , to put him in possession of a kingdom , to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing <unk> the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly <unk> that I know not where to find him . 
 Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary 's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance . He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley , Mary 's eventual choice of husband . Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir , until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it . Still , she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate . 
 By 1564 Dudley had realised that his chances of becoming Elizabeth 's consort were small . At the same time he could not " consider ... without great repugnance " , as he said , that she chose another husband . Confronted with other marriage projects , Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very much like to marry him . Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid @-@ 1560s and later . To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors , between 1565 and 1578 , four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester , as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects . These he had and would continue to sabotage . In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry , recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old ; but he still was hopeful — she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind ( and married an Englishman ) . 
 = = = Life at court = = = 
 As " a male favourite to a virgin queen " , Robert Dudley found himself in an unprecedented situation . His apartments at court were next to hers , and — perceived as knowing " the Queen and her nature best of any man " — his influence was matched by few . Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth 's possessiveness and jealousy . His company was essential for her well @-@ being and for many years he was hardly allowed to leave . Sir Christopher Hatton reported a growing emergency when the Earl was away for a few weeks in 1578 : " This court <unk> your presence . Her majesty is unaccompanied and , I assure you , the chambers are almost empty . " 
 On ceremonial occasions Dudley often acted as an unofficial consort , sometimes in the Queen 's stead . In a personal letter to the Earl of Shrewsbury , an old friend of Leicester 's , Elizabeth said she considered Leicester as " another ourself " . He largely assumed charge of court ceremonial and organised hundreds of small and large festivities . From 1587 he was Lord Steward , being responsible for the royal household 's supply with food and other commodities . He displayed a strong sense for economising and reform in this function , which he had de facto occupied long before his official appointment . The sanitary situation in the palaces was a perennial problem , and a talk with Leicester about these issues inspired John Harington to construct a water closet . Leicester was a lifelong sportsman , hunting and jousting in the tiltyard , and an indefatigable tennis @-@ player . He was also the Queen 's regular dancing partner .

 After the Duke of Northumberland 's attainder the entire Dudley inheritance had disappeared . His sons had to start from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes , as they had renounced any rights to their father 's former possessions or titles when their own <unk> had been lifted in January 1558 . Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence , worth £ 6 @,@ 000 p.a. He also received some of his father 's lands , but since he was not the family heir it was a matter of some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage . In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor , Castle , and Park , together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales . Other grants were to follow . All in all , Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose , Earl of Warwick , came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales . 
 = = = Denbighshire = = = 
 At the time Robert Dudley entered his new Welsh possessions there had existed a <unk> chaos for more than half a century . Some leading local families benefited from this to the detriment of the Crown 's revenue . To remedy this situation , and to increase his own income , Dudley effected compositions with the tenants in what Simon Adams has called an " ambitious resolution of a long @-@ standing problem ... without parallel in Elizabeth 's reign " . All tenants that had so far only been <unk> were raised to the status of freeholders in exchange for newly agreed rents . Likewise , all tenants ' rights of common were secured as were the boundaries of the commons , thus striking a balance between property rights and protection against enclosure . 
 Though an absentee landlord , Leicester , who was also Baron of Denbigh , regarded the lordship as an integral part of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley . He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects ; the church he planned , though , was never finished , being too ambitious . It would not only have been the largest , but also the first post @-@ Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar , thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church . In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh . He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh . 
 = = = Warwick and Kenilworth = = = 
 Ambrose and Robert Dudley were very close , in matters of business and personally . Through their paternal grandmother they descended from the Hundred Years War heroes , John Talbot , 1st Earl of Shrewsbury , and Richard Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick . Robert Dudley was especially fascinated by the Beauchamp descent and , with his brother , adopted the ancient heraldic device of the earls of Warwick , the bear and ragged staff . Due to such genealogical aspects the West Midlands held a special significance for him . The town of Warwick felt this during a magnificent visit by the Earl in 1571 to celebrate the feast of the Order of Saint Michael , with which Leicester had been invested by the French king in 1566 . He shortly afterwards founded Lord Leycester 's Hospital , a charity for aged and injured soldiers still functioning today . 
 Kenilworth Castle was the centre of Leicester 's ambitions to " plant " himself in the region , and he substantially transformed the site 's appearance through comprehensive alterations . He added a 15th @-@ century style gatehouse to the castle 's medieval structures , as well as a formal garden and a residential wing which featured the " brittle , thin walls and grids of windows " that were to become the hallmark of Elizabethan architecture in later decades . His works completed , the Earl staged a spectacular 19 @-@ day @-@ festival in July 1575 as a final , allegorical bid for the Queen 's hand ; it was as much a request to give him leave to marry someone else . There were a Lady of the Lake , a swimming papier @-@ mâché dolphin with a little orchestra in its belly , fireworks , masques , hunts , and popular entertainments like bear baiting . The whole scenery of landscape , artificial lake , castle , and Renaissance garden was ingeniously used for the entertainment . 
 = = Love affairs and remarriage = = 
 Confronted by a Puritan friend with rumours about his " ungodly life " , Dudley defended himself in 1576 : 
 I stand on the top of the hill , where ... the smallest slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them . 
 With Douglas Sheffield , a young widow of the Howard family , he had a serious relationship from about 1569 . He explained to her that he could not marry , not even in order to beget a Dudley heir , without his " utter overthrow " : 
 You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that <unk> me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children , it <unk> so now in myself ; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [ the Queen 's ] favour " . 
 Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning , he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished . The affair continued and in 1574 Douglas gave birth to a son , also called Robert Dudley . 
 Lettice Knollys was the wife of Walter Devereux , 1st Earl of Essex , and first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth on her mother 's side . Leicester had flirted with her in the summer of 1565 , causing an outbreak of jealousy in the Queen . After Lord Essex went to Ireland in 1573 , they possibly became lovers . There was much talk , and on Essex ' homecoming in December 1575 , " great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Essex " was expected . In July 1576 Essex returned to Ireland , where he died of dysentery in September . Rumours of poison , administered by the Earl of Leicester 's means , were soon abroad . The Lord Deputy of Ireland , Sir Henry Sidney , conducted an official investigation which did not find any indications of foul play but " a disease appropriate to this country ... whereof ... died many " . The rumours continued . 
 The prospect of marriage to the Countess of Essex on the horizon , Leicester finally drew a line under his relationship with Douglas Sheffield . Contrary to what she later claimed , they came to an amicable agreement over their son 's custody . Young Robert grew up in Dudley 's and his friends ' houses , but had " leave to see " his mother until she left England in 1583 . Leicester was very fond of his son and gave him an excellent education . In his will he left him the bulk of his estate ( after his brother Ambrose 's death ) , including Kenilworth Castle . Douglas Sheffield remarried in 1579 . After the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 , the younger Robert Dudley tried unsuccessfully to prove that his parents had married 30 years earlier in a secret ceremony . In that case he would have been able to claim the earldoms of Leicester and Warwick . His mother supported him , but maintained that she had been strongly against raising the issue and was possibly pressured by her son . Leicester himself had throughout considered the boy as illegitimate . 
 On 21 September 1578 Leicester secretly married Lady Essex at his country house at Wanstead , with only a handful of relatives and friends present . He did not dare to tell the Queen of his marriage ; nine months later Leicester 's enemies at court acquainted her with the situation , causing a furious outburst . She already had been aware of his marriage plans a year earlier , though . Leicester 's hope of an heir was fulfilled in 1581 when another Robert Dudley , styled Lord Denbigh , was born . The child died aged three in 1584 , leaving behind disconsolate parents . Leicester found comfort in God since , as he wrote , " princes ... seldom do pity according to the rules of charity . " The Earl turned out to be a devoted husband : In 1583 the French ambassador , Michel de Castelnau , wrote of " the Earl of Leicester and his lady to whom he is much attached " , and " who has much influence over him " . Leicester was a concerned parent to his four stepchildren , and in every respect worked for the advancement of Robert Devereux , 2nd Earl of Essex , whom he regarded as his political heir . 
 The marriage of her favourite hurt the Queen deeply . She never accepted it , humiliating Leicester in public : " my open and great disgraces delivered from her Majesty 's mouth " . Then again , she would be as fond of him as ever . In 1583 she informed ambassadors that Lettice Dudley was " a she @-@ wolf " and her husband a " traitor " and " a cuckold " . Lady Leicester 's social life was much curtailed . Even her movements could pose a political problem , as Francis Walsingham explained : " I see not her Majesty disposed to use the services of my Lord of Leicester . There is great offence taken at the conveying down of his lady . " The Earl stood by his wife , asking his colleagues to intercede for her ; there was no hope : " She [ the Queen ] doth take every occasion by my marriage to withdraw any good from me " , Leicester wrote still after seven years of marriage . 
 = = Colleagues and politics = = 
 For the first 30 years of Elizabeth 's reign , until Leicester 's death , he and Lord Burghley were the most powerful and important political figures , working intimately with the Queen . Robert Dudley was a conscientious privy councillor , and one of the most frequently attending . 
 In 1560 the diplomat Nicholas Throckmorton advocated vehemently against Dudley marrying the Queen , but Dudley won him over in 1562 . Throckmorton henceforth became his political advisor and intimate . After Throckmorton 's death in 1571 there quickly evolved a political alliance between the Earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham , soon to be Secretary of State . Together they worked for a militant Protestant foreign policy . There also existed a family relationship between them after Walsingham 's daughter had married Philip Sidney , Leicester 's favourite nephew . Leicester , after some initial jealousy , also became a good friend of Sir Christopher Hatton , himself one of Elizabeth 's favourites . 
 Robert Dudley 's relationship with William Cecil , Lord Burghley , was complicated . Traditionally they have been seen as enemies , and Cecil behind the scenes sabotaged Dudley 's endeavours to obtain the Queen 's hand . On the other hand , they were on friendly terms and had an efficient working relationship which never broke down . In 1572 the vacant post of Lord High Treasurer was offered to Leicester , who declined and proposed Burghley , stating that the latter was the much more suitable candidate . In later years , being at odds , Dudley felt like reminding Cecil of their " thirty years friendship " . 
 On the whole , Cecil and Dudley were in concord about policies while disagreeing fundamentally about some issues , such as the Queen 's marriage and some areas of foreign policy . Cecil favoured the suit of Francois , Duke of Anjou , in 1578 – 1581 for Elizabeth 's hand , while Leicester was among its strongest opponents , even contemplating exile in letters to Burghley . The Anjou courtship , at the end of which Leicester and several dozen noblemen and gentlemen escorted the French prince to Antwerp , also touched the question of English intervention in the Netherlands to help the rebellious provinces . This debate stretched over a decade until 1585 , with the Earl of Leicester as the foremost interventionist . Burghley was more cautious of military engagement while in a dilemma over his Protestant predilections . 
 Until about 1571 / 1572 Dudley supported Mary Stuart 's succession rights to the English throne . He was also , from the early 1560s , on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland , thereby supporting the English or , as he saw it , the Protestant interest . After Mary Stuart 's flight into England ( 1568 ) Leicester was , unlike Cecil , in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control , preferably with a Protestant English husband , such as the Duke of Norfolk . In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints of captivity . By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester 's influence with James VI , her son , in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy . She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne , and when the Catholic anti @-@ Leicester libel , Leicester 's Commonwealth , was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception . 
 The Bond of Association , which the Privy Council gave out in October 1584 , may have originated in Dudley 's ideas . <unk> in the country , the document 's subscribers swore that , should Elizabeth be assassinated ( as William the Silent had been a few months earlier ) , not only the killer but also the royal person who would benefit from this should be executed . Leicester 's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained the confidence of the King 's favourite , Patrick , Master of Gray , in 1584 – 1585 . His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the Treaty of Berwick , a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers . In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the Babington Plot ; after the Ridolfi Plot ( 1571 ) and the Throckmorton Plot ( 1583 ) , this was a further scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved . Following her conviction , Leicester , then in the Netherlands , vehemently urged her execution in his letters ; he despaired of Elizabeth 's security after so many plots . 
 Leicester having returned to England , in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary 's death warrant with the proviso that it be not carried out until she gave green light . As there was no sign of her doing so , Burghley , Leicester , and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary 's execution in the interest of the state . The Queen 's wrath at the news of Mary 's death was terrifying . Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health , yet unlike the other culprits escaped Elizabeth 's personal wrath .

 Robert Dudley was a pioneer of new industries ; interested in many things from tapestries to mining , he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history . The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor . On a personal level , he gave to poor people , petitioners , and prisons on a daily basis . Due to his interests in trade and exploration , as well as his debts , his contacts with the London city fathers were intense . He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers . English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester . This he did in the manner of his private business affairs , underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal ( commercially , these relations were a losing business ) . He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on , and was a principal backer of Drake 's circumnavigation of the world . Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher 's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage . Later Leicester acquired his own ship , the Galleon Leicester , which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton , but also under Drake . As much as profit , English <unk> was on his mind , and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António , the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580 . 
 = = = Learning , theatre , the arts , and literature = = = 
 Apart from their legal function the Inns of Court were the Tudor equivalents of gentlemen 's clubs . In 1561 , grateful for favours he had done them , the Inner Temple admitted Dudley as their most privileged member , their " Lord and Governor " . He was allowed to build his own apartments on the premises and organised grand festivities and performances in the Temple . As Chancellor of Oxford University Dudley was highly committed . He enforced the Thirty @-@ nine Articles and the oath of royal supremacy at Oxford , and obtained from the Queen an incorporation by Act of Parliament for the university . Leicester was also instrumental in founding the official Oxford University Press , and installed the pioneer of international law , <unk> Gentili , and the exotic theologian , Antonio del Corro , at Oxford . Over del Corro 's controversial case he even sacked the university 's Vice @-@ Chancellor . 
 Around 100 books were dedicated to Robert Dudley during Elizabeth 's reign . In 1564 / 1567 Arthur Golding dedicated his popular translation of Ovid 's Metamorphoses to the Earl . Dudley took a special interest in translations , which were seen as a means to popularise learning among " all who could read . " He was also a history enthusiast , and in 1559 suggested to the tailor John Stow to become a chronicler ( as Stow recalled in 1604 ) . Robert Dudley 's interest in the theatre was manifold , from academic plays at Oxford to the protection of the Children of St. Paul 's and of the Royal Chapel , and their respective masters , against hostile bishops and landlords . From at least 1559 he had his own company of players , and in 1574 he obtained for them the first royal patent that was ever issued to actors so that they could tour the country unmolested by local authorities . The Earl also kept a separate company of musicians who in 1586 played before the King of Denmark ; with them travelled William Kempe , " the Lord Leicester 's jesting player " . 
 Leicester possessed one of the largest collections of paintings in Elizabethan England , being the first great private collector . He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard , as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture . The Earl 's circle of scholars and men of letters included , among others , his nephew Philip Sidney , the astrologer and <unk> John Dee , his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean <unk> , as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey . Through Harvey , Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand , the Earl 's palatial town house , where he wrote his first works of poetry . Many years after Leicester 's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his <unk> , and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with his poem The Ruins of Time . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 From infancy Robert Dudley grew up as a Protestant . Presumably conforming in public under Mary Tudor , he was counted among the " heretics " by Philip II 's agent before Elizabeth 's accession . He immediately became a major patron to former Edwardian clerics and returning exiles . Meanwhile , he also helped some of Mary 's former servants and maintained Catholic contacts . From 1561 he advocated and supported the Huguenot cause , and the French ambassador described him as " totally of the Calvinist religion " in 1568 . After the St. Bartholomew 's Day Massacre in 1572 this trait in him became the more pronounced , and he continued as the chief patron of English Puritans and a champion of international Calvinism . On the other hand , in his household , Leicester employed Catholics like Sir Christopher Blount , who held a position of trust and of whom he was personally fond . The Earl 's patronage of and reliance on individuals was as much a matter of old family loyalties or personal relationships as of religious allegiances . 
 Leicester was especially interested in the furtherance of preaching , which was the main concern of moderate Puritanism . He went to great lengths to support non @-@ conforming preachers , while warning them against too radical positions which , he argued , would only endanger what reforms had been hitherto achieved . He would not condone the overthrow of the existing church model because of " trifles " , he said . " I am not , I thank God , fantastically persuaded in religion but ... do find it soundly and godly set forth in this universal Church of England . " Accordingly , he tried to smooth things out and , among other moves , initiated several disputations between the more radical elements of the Church and the episcopal side so that they " might make <unk> " . His influence in ecclesiastical matters was considerable until it declined in the 1580s under Archbishop John Whitgift .

 During the 1570s Leicester built a special relationship with Prince William of Orange , who held him in high esteem . The Earl became generally popular in the Netherlands . Since 1577 he pressed for an English military expedition , led by himself ( as the Dutch strongly wished ) to succour the rebels . In 1584 the Prince of Orange was murdered , political chaos ensued , and in August 1585 Antwerp fell to the Duke of Parma . An English intervention became inevitable ; it was decided that Leicester would go to the Netherlands and " be their chief as heretofore was treated of " , as he phrased it in August 1585 . He was alluding to the recently signed Treaty of Nonsuch in which his position and authority as " governor @-@ general " of the Netherlands had only been vaguely defined . The Earl prepared himself for " God 's cause and her Majesty 's " by recruiting the expedition 's cavalry from his retainers and friends , and by mortgaging his estate to the sum of £ 25 @,@ 000 . 
 At the end of December 1585 Leicester was received in the Netherlands , according to one correspondent , in the manner of a second Charles V ; a Dutch town official already noted in his minute @-@ book that the Earl was going to have " absolute power and authority " . After a progress through several cities and so many festivals he arrived in The Hague , where on 1 January 1586 he was urged to accept the title governor @-@ general by the States General of the United Provinces . Leicester wrote to Burghley and Walsingham , explaining why he believed the Dutch importunities should be answered favourably . He accepted his elevation on 25 January , having not yet received any communications from England due to constant adverse winds . 
 The Earl had now " the rule and government general " with a Council of State to support him ( the members of which he nominated himself ) . He remained a subject of Elizabeth , making it possible to contend that she was now sovereign over the Netherlands . According to Leicester , this was what the Dutch desired . From the start such a position for him had been implied in the Dutch propositions to the English , and in their instructions to Leicester ; and it was consistent with the Dutch understanding of the Treaty of Nonsuch . The English queen , however , in her instructions to Leicester , had expressly declined to accept offers of sovereignty from the United Provinces while still demanding of the States to follow the " advice " of her lieutenant @-@ general in matters of government . Her ministers on both sides of the Channel hoped she would accept the situation as a fait accompli and could even be persuaded to add the rebellious provinces to her possessions . Instead her fury knew no bounds and Elizabeth sent Sir Thomas Heneage to read out her letters of disapproval before the States General , Leicester having to stand nearby . Elizabeth 's " commandment " was that the Governor @-@ General immediately resign his post in a formal ceremony in the same place where he had taken it . After much pleading with her and protestations by the Dutch , it was postulated that the governor @-@ generalship had been bestowed not by any sovereign , but by the States General and thereby by the people . The damage was done , however : " My credit hath been cracked ever since her Majesty sent Sir Thomas Heneage hither " , Leicester recapitulated in October 1586 . 
 Elizabeth demanded of her Lieutenant @-@ General to refrain at all cost from any decisive action with Parma , which was the opposite of what Leicester wished and what the Dutch expected of him . After some initial successes , the unexpected surrender of the strategically important town of Grave was a serious blow to English morale . Leicester 's fury turned on the town 's governor , Baron <unk> , whom he had executed despite all pleadings . The Dutch nobility were astonished : even the Prince of Orange would not have dared such an outrage , Leicester was warned ; but , he wrote , he would not be intimidated by the fact that <unk> " was of a good house " . 
 Leicester 's forces , small and seriously underfinanced from the outset , faced the most formidable army in Europe . Unity among their ranks was at risk by Leicester 's and the other officers ' quarrels with Sir John Norris , who had commanded previous English contingents in the Netherlands and was now the Earl 's deputy . Elizabeth was angry that the war cost more than anticipated and for many months delayed sending money and troops . This not only forced Dudley to raise further funds on his own account , but much aggravated the soldiers ' lot . " They cannot get a penny ; their credit is spent ; they perish for want of victuals and clothing in great numbers ... I assure you it will fret me to death ere long to see my soldiers in this case and cannot help them " , Leicester wrote home . 
 Many Dutch statesmen were essentially politiques ; they soon became disenchanted with the Earl 's enthusiastic fostering of what he called " the religion " . His most loyal friends were the Calvinists at Utrecht and Friesland , provinces in constant opposition to Holland and Zeeland . Those rich provinces engaged in a lucrative trade with Spain which was very helpful to either side 's war effort . On Elizabeth 's orders Leicester enforced a ban on this trade with the enemy , thus alienating the wealthy Dutch merchants . He also effected a fiscal reform . In order to centralise finances and to replace the highly corrupt tax farming with direct taxation , a new Council of Finances was established which was not under supervision of the Council of State . The Dutch members of the Council of State were outraged at these bold steps . English peace talks with Spain behind Leicester 's back , which had started within days after he had left England , undermined his position further . 
 In September 1586 there was a skirmish at Zutphen , in which Philip Sidney was wounded . He died a few weeks later . His uncle 's grief was great . In December Leicester returned to England . In his absence , William Stanley and Rowland York , two Catholic officers whom Leicester had placed in command of Deventer and the fort of Zutphen , respectively , went over to Parma , along with their key fortresses — a disaster for the Anglo @-@ Dutch coalition in every respect . His Dutch friends , as his English critics , pressed for Leicester 's return to the Netherlands . Shortly after his arrival in June 1587 the English @-@ held port of Sluis was lost to Parma , Leicester being unable to assert his authority over the Dutch allies , who refused to cooperate in relieving the town . After this blow Elizabeth , who ascribed it to " the malice or other foul error of the States " , was happy to enter into peace negotiations with the Duke of Parma . By December 1587 the differences between Elizabeth and the Dutch politicians , with Leicester in between , had become insurmountable ; he asked to be recalled by the Queen and gave up his post . He was irredeemably in debt because of his personal financing of the war . 
 = = Armada and death = = 
 In July 1588 , as the Spanish Armada came nearer , the Earl of Leicester was appointed " Lieutenant and Captain @-@ General of the Queen 's Armies and Companies " . At Tilbury on the Thames he erected a camp for the defence of London , should the Spaniards land . Leicester vigorously counteracted the disorganisation he found everywhere , having few illusions about " all sudden <unk> @-@ <unk> " , as he wrote to Walsingham . When the Privy Council was already considering disbanding the camp to save money , Leicester held against it , setting about to plan with the Queen a visit to her troops . On the day she gave her famous speech he walked beside her horse , bare @-@ headed . 
 After the Armada the Earl was seen riding in splendour through London " as if he were a king " , and for the past few weeks he had usually dined with the Queen , a unique favour . On his way to Buxton in Derbyshire to take the baths , he died at Cornbury Park near Oxford , on 4 September 1588 . Leicester 's health had not been good for some time , and historians have considered both malaria and stomach cancer as death causes . His death came unexpectedly , and only a week earlier he had said farewell to his Queen . Elizabeth was deeply affected and locked herself in her apartment for a few days until Lord Burghley had the door broken . Her nickname for Dudley had been " Eyes " , which was symbolised by the sign of <unk> in their letters to each other . Elizabeth kept the letter he had sent her six days before his death in her bedside treasure box , endorsing it with " his last letter " on the outside . It was still there when she died 15 years later . 
 Leicester was buried , as he had requested , in the Beauchamp Chapel of the Collegiate Church of St Mary , Warwick — in the same chapel as Richard Beauchamp , his ancestor , and the " noble Impe " , his little son . Countess Lettice was also buried there when she died in 1634 , alongside the " best and dearest of husbands " , as the epitaph , which she commissioned , says .

 The book which later became known as Leicester 's Commonwealth was written by Catholic exiles in Paris and printed anonymously in 1584 . It was published shortly after the death of Leicester 's son , which is alluded to in a stop @-@ press marginal note : " The children of adulterers shall be consumed , and the seed of a wicked bed shall be rooted out . " <unk> into England , the libel became a best @-@ seller with underground booksellers and the next year was translated into French . Its underlying political agenda is the succession of Mary Queen of Scots to the English throne , but its most outstanding feature is an allround attack on the Earl of Leicester . He is presented as an atheistic , hypocritical coward , a " <unk> Dictator " , terrorising the Queen and ruining the whole country . He is engaged in a long @-@ term conspiracy to snatch the Crown from Elizabeth in order to settle it first on his brother @-@ in @-@ law , the Earl of Huntingdon , and ultimately on himself . Spicy details of his monstrous private life are revealed , and he appears as an expert poisoner of many high @-@ profile personalities . This influential classic is the origin of many aspects of Leicester 's historical reputation . 
 In the early 17th century , William Camden saw " some secret constellation " of the stars at work between Elizabeth and her favourite ; he firmly established the legend of the perfect courtier with the sinister influence . Some of the most often @-@ quoted characterisations of Leicester , such as that he " was wont to put up all his passions in his pocket " , his nickname of " the Gypsy " , and Elizabeth 's " I will have here but one mistress and no master " <unk> to him , were contributed by Sir Henry Wotton and Sir Robert <unk> almost half a century after the Earl 's death . The Victorian historian James Anthony Froude saw Robert Dudley as Elizabeth 's soft plaything , combining " in himself the worst qualities of both sexes . Without courage , without talent , without virtue " . The habit of comparing him unfavourably to William Cecil was continued by Conyers Read in 1925 : " Leicester was a selfish , unscrupulous courtier and Burghley a wise and patriotic statesman " . Geoffrey Elton , in his widely read England under the Tudors ( 1955 ) , saw Dudley as " a handsome , vigorous man with very little sense . " 
 Since the 1950s , academic assessment of the Earl of Leicester has undergone considerable changes . Leicester 's importance in literary patronage was established by Eleanor Rosenberg in 1955 . Elizabethan Puritanism has been thoroughly reassessed since the 1960s , and Patrick Collinson has outlined the Earl 's place in it . Dudley 's religion could thus be better understood , rather than simply to brand him as a hypocrite . His importance as a privy councillor and statesman has often been overlooked , one reason being that many of his letters are scattered among private collections and not easily accessible in print , as are those of his colleagues Walsingham and Cecil . Alan Haynes describes him as " one of the most strangely underrated of Elizabeth 's circle of close advisers " , while Simon Adams , who since the early 1970s has researched many aspects of Leicester 's life and career , concludes : " Leicester was as central a figure to the ' first reign ' [ of Elizabeth ] as Burghley .

Written by lead vocalist Jared Leto across the United States and South Africa , the track was produced by Flood , Steve Lillywhite and Thirty Seconds to Mars . According to Leto , the lyrics of " Kings and Queens " explore the triumphant feeling of human possibilities .

The song was released as the lead single from This Is War on October 13 , 2009 .

 " Kings and Queens " was written by Jared Leto and produced by Flood , Steve Lillywhite and Thirty Seconds to Mars . The song was recorded by Ryan Williams and Matt <unk> at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles , California . It premiered on Kevin and Bean 's radio show of KROQ in Los Angeles on October 6 , 2009 . Leto constructed the lyrics of " Kings and Queens " across two different continents ; the idea was conceived on a flight from the United States and realised upon touchdown in South Africa . He further elaborated on the writing process in an interview with MusicRadar : 
 In early 2009 , Leto told Billboard that he was excited by the song as soon as he wrote it . He said , " I had written a verse right as we were going to the airport — I literally almost missed the flight because I picked up the guitar and this song came out . You have that moment of discovery that 's exciting . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Kings and Queens " is an alternative rock song with influences and elements from progressive rock and arena rock . It opens with a wild hawk scream recorded live over the band 's work space , then transitioning into an ambient introduction . The song includes a heavy contribution from the band 's fans , captured singing a chorus created from layers of the band 's Summit recordings . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group , " Kings and Queens " is written in the time signature of common time , with a moderate metronome of 82 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of E ♭ major and the melody spans the tonal range of B ♭ 3 to B ♭ 5 . 
 Jared Leto explained that the title and theme of the track were inspired by a book found at the band 's South African work space , but that it " ended up being a good metaphor " for world events from the past year . He further said that the lyrics feature " a triumphant feeling of the possibilities that we all have . " Kelly <unk> of Billboard felt that " stately drums and dramatic strings " are paired with lyrics that take on a " stark , apocalyptic tone " , referring to the last verse of the song , which says " The age of man is over / A darkness comes and all / These lessons that we learned here / Have only just begun " . Ryan Jones of Alternative Addiction noticed the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and compared its melody to the sound of U2 . 
 Alex <unk> of The Husky Herald described the song saying , " ' Kings and Queens ' starts out with a soft piano melody and instantly picks up as the drum kicks in . The intensity of the song subsides as Jared Leto 's voice enters sings the verse and once the chorus hits , the entire band explodes into a beautiful assortment of instrumentation , <unk> background vocals , and Leto 's soaring voice . When the bridge begins , the storm of the song seems to subside and what is left is Leto 's voice ringing out " The age of man is over [ ... ] Have only just begun " and through the bridge , there is an intense build up which leads into the final chorus . "

 " Kings and Queens " was met with general acclaim from music critics . Kelly <unk> from Billboard commented , " Grounded by Leto 's convincing vocals , ' Kings and Queens ' is epic rock at its most affecting . " She praised the song saying , " a chorus chants behind singer Jared Leto 's smooth , powerful voice , evoking the collective thrill of a live show . " Victoria Durham from Rock Sound acknowledged the influences of U2 and called the song " epic and euphoric " . Andrew Ellis from Melodic magazine felt that the song features all the elements of the band 's previous single " From Yesterday " mixed with higher vocal patterns and a " great sing along chorus " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the track as one of the album 's highlights . Tim Grierson from About.com was impressed with the song and opined that Thirty Seconds to Mars wants to inspire the listener with " arena @-@ ready anthems " like " Kings and Queens " , which he called a " grand sing @-@ along song " that has a " populist feel " . 
 Jon Bye , writing for Gigwise , felt that the track is " full on epic space rock , almost certainly designed with stadium in mind " . He called it " highly affirming and uplifting " , while pointing out the influences of U2 . Alex Lai from Contactmusic gave the song a positive review , noticing that it opens up with a " tidal wave of ' woah ' vocals , galloping strings " and features a chorus to " shake the foundations of the arenas " . He also felt that Jared Leto is as " impassioned " in his vocal delivery as ever . At the end of 2009 , Rock Sound listed " Kings and Queens " as the best song of the year . AOL Radio placed the track at number one on the Top Alternative Songs of 2010 , with critic Sara Anderson saying , " if ever there were an arena @-@ ready song , this would be it . " Furthermore , Alternative Addiction ranked the song at number 30 on its list of the 50 Best Songs of 2009 .

 The music video for " Kings and Queens " was directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins . It was shot the weekend of October 11 – 13 , 2009 in Los Angeles over the course of several nights , filming some of the city 's most iconic landmarks . Leto explained , " I think this city is a beautiful place at night , and we have these empty streets , and it 's kind of a haunting , forgotten landscape ... very serene . " The crew recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers to appear in the video . On October 11 , 2009 , Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists . Leto got the inspiration behind the video after some of his friends did Critical Mass and Crank Mob , " groups of riders that get together and kind of reclaim public spaces and take over the streets in several cities around America , " and he thought that it would be the perfect backdrop for the music video of " Kings and Queens " . 
 During the shooting , the crew had some problems in filming some scenes . Leto told MTV News , " It 's been an incredible adventure , but it 's also been really difficult , because there are so many people , and we 're shutting down streets of Los Angeles . " He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street : " We only had three takes that we had time to do . The first take it went sideways , second take it went the other way . Third take ? Perfect . " Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying , " It 's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels , from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier . We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure . [ ... ] This is what we were supposed to do . And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute , but the process has been phenomenal . " The music video premiered on November 9 , 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles .

 The music video features a critical mass crank mob movement , founded with forward @-@ thinking and eco @-@ conscious intentions , on a night time journey from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier . A different theme of the video simply features the band playing on a cliff edge in Griffith Park overlooking the city . These two themes alternate between each other during the course of the video . " Kings and Queens " begins with a framed silhouette shot of dozens of cyclists moving in slow motion , backed by a sunset . From the scenic view of the city 's skyline , the cast , crew and other members wrapped up and headed to downtown Los Angeles for scenes involving a horse and a fire thrower , among others . 
 " Kings and Queens " is filled with references to other art forms . Some of the cyclists are dressed as the Baseball Furies gang from the 1979 film The Warriors , and at one point a frame meticulously recreates underground artist Banksy 's Flower Chucker graffiti . In the video also appears a horse running down a deserted city street in slow motion , which was described as a surreal and fantastic vision of downtown Los Angeles . As " Kings and Queens " comes to a close , the group of cyclists make their way onto Santa Monica Pier as the sun rises . The band 's song " Stranger in a Strange Land " is played during the credits for the full music video .

 Upon its release , the video received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics . James Montgomery from MTV felt that the video " is most definitely a massive thing , but it 's a spiritual endeavor , too : a celebration of a band , their fans and an unyielding sense of purpose " . He further commented , " the message , it seems , is clear : There is might in masses , a freedom in unity and strength in conviction . And all it takes to harness any of it is will . " Montgomery also noticed that although the band 's previous videos were more elaborate , " Kings and Queens " was " no less of an epic undertaking " . Joe Bosso of MusicRadar was impressed by the video and felt that " the beautifully shot clip " is a " reverent nod " to directors Akira Kurosawa and Walter Hill . He noted that its production values " haven 't been seen in music videos for quite some time " . August Brown from the Los Angeles Times opined that with " raging wildfires and white stallion " that joins them , Thirty Seconds to Mars " hasn 't lost its taste for the epic " . Tim Grierson from About.com felt that Los Angeles is featured in all its glory in the music video for " Kings and Queens " . Kyle Anderson from MTV believed that although the premise and approach of the music video is " relatively simple " and does not feature special effects , it is " actually an incredibly cinematic , wholly satisfying experience " . In 2013 , Kerrang ! magazine included " Kings and Queens " among the best music videos by Thirty Seconds to Mars , noting that " the band never shy away from a challenge , making full use of frontman Jared Leto 's Hollywood experience and delivering huge , concept @-@ based short films .

 = Recopa Sudamericana = 
 The Recopa Santander Sudamericana ( Portuguese : Recopa Santander Sul @-@ Americana ) , known also as the Recopa Sudamericana and simply as the Recopa ( Spanish : [ <unk> ] , Portuguese : [ <unk> ] ; " Winner 's Cup " ) , is an annual international club football competition organized by CONMEBOL since 1988 . It is a match @-@ up between the champions of the previous year 's Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana , South America 's premier club competitions . 
 The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime . Initially , the champions of the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Libertadores contested it . In 1998 , the Supercopa Libertadores was discontinued and the Recopa went into a hiatus . The competition has been disputed with either a presently @-@ used two @-@ legged series or a single match @-@ up at a neutral venue . Together with the aforementioned tournaments , a club has the chance to win the CONMEBOL Treble all in one year or season . ( Brazilian teams , however , play either Libertadores or Sudamericana each year , with an exception only when a Brazilian team wins Sudamericana and qualifies for both competitions in the next year . ) 
 The most recent champion of the competition is Argentine club River Plate , after beating San Lorenzo 2 – 0 on aggregate in the 2015 edition . Argentine club Boca Juniors is the most successful club in the cup history , having won the tournament four times . Brazilian clubs have accumulated the most victories with nine wins while Brazil has the most different winning teams , with seven clubs having won the title . The cup has been won by 16 different clubs and won consecutively by three clubs : Brazil 's São Paulo , Boca Juniors , and Ecuador 's LDU Quito successfully defended the title in 1994 , 2006 , and 2010 , respectively . 
 = = History = = 
 When the Supercopa Sudamericana was created in 1988 , a new continental Super Cup competition in South America became viable . CONMEBOL named the new competition Recopa Sudamericana after the defunct Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes played in 1970 and 1971 . The Recopa Sudamericana , disputed between the winners of South America 's two premier club competitions , is not related chronologically to the Recopa Sudamericana , created in 1968 which was contested between former South American winners of the Intercontinental Cup , Recopa Sudamericana de Clubes , disputed among Cup winners of South America . The first edition was played in 1989 and pitted Uruguayan club Nacional and Argentinian side Racing . Played on two legs , Nacional managed to win the trophy after winning 4 – 1 on points . Due to schedule dilemmas and political issues , the 1990 edition was played in Miami between Atlético Nacional and Boca Juniors with the latter winning 0 – 1 . Olimpia of Paraguay would win the Recopa Sudamericana without the need to dispute a match as the <unk> won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana . CONMEBOL declared Olimpia the automatic winners of the 1991 competition . 
 In 1992 , and from 1994 to 1997 , the competition was played in Japan . Colo @-@ Colo of Chile defeated Cruzeiro 5 – 4 on penalties after a 0 – 0 tie in the 1992 final . Staying true to the winning ways of the Paulista 's golden generation , São Paulo won the 1993 and 1994 finals to become the first team to retain the title . Due to schedule congestion , the 1993 finals were played as part of the Campeonato Brasileiro and it also became the first Recopa to feature two teams from the same nation . In a second , consecutive all @-@ Brazilian final , São Paulo successfully defended the trophy against Botafogo . Since São Paulo won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana , CONMEBOL had Copa CONMEBOL winners Botafogo dispute the Recopa Sudamericana only to lose 3 – 1 to the defending champions . 
 Argentina managed to emulate their northern neighbors with the 1995 edition being an all @-@ Argentinian affair . Independiente , led by Jorge <unk> , managed to consecrate themselves winners after defeating Carlos Bianchi 's legendary Vélez Sársfield 1 – 0 in Tokyo . Independiente participated in a second , consecutive final only to lose the title to Grêmio after being defeated 4 – 1 . The 1997 edition was won by a Vélez Sársfield team that bowed out from the international limelight with their last title . Having failed to win the trophy in 1992 and 1993 , Cruzeiro comfortably won the 1998 edition that was played as part of the Copa Mercosur . This final series was played two years after the participating teams won their corresponding qualifying tournaments . 
 At the end of the 1998 season , CONMEBOL discontinued the Supercopa Sudamericana . As a result of not having an important , secondary tournament , the Recopa Sudamericana went into a hiatus from 1999 until 2002 . However , the introduction of the new Copa Sudamericana revitalized the competition with Olimpia winning the 2003 final in Los Angeles . Played on a neutral venue for the second year in a row , <unk> defeated Boca Juniors on penalties to win their second international title . From 2005 onwards , the Recopa Sudamericana would be played on a home @-@ and @-@ away basis . 
 In a rematch of the Copa Libertadores final of 2004 , Boca Juniors avenged that defeat as they beat Once Caldas 4 – 3 on aggregate . A year later , Boca Juniors faced São Paulo , both two @-@ time winners of the competition , in order to determine who would become the first <unk> . The Xeneizes won 4 – 1 on points and successfully defended the title , becoming the first side since Telê Santana 's São Paulo to win consecutive <unk> . Internacional became the first Brazilian side to lift the trophy in nine years . The 2008 competition saw Boca Juniors win their fourth title to become joint leaders for most international titles won by a club in a last hurrah on the international scene . LDU Quito won their second international title as they thumped Internacional 6 – 0 on points and 4 – 0 on goal aggregate to win their first ever title . LDU Quito then successfully defended their title in 2010 against Estudiantes . They became the third team to successfully defend the title .

 Unlike most other competitions around the world , the Recopa Sudamericana do not use extra time , an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw , or away goals , a method of breaking ties in football and other sports when teams play each other twice , once at each team 's home ground , to decide a tie that was level on aggregate . 
 From 1988 to 1995 , teams would be awarded 2 points for a win , 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss ) . From 1995 onwards , the " Three points for a win " standard , a system adopted by FIFA in 1995 that places additional value on wins , was adopted in CONMEBOL , with teams now earning 3 points for a win , 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss . If both teams are level on points after two legs , goal difference would come into play . An immediate winner a penalty shootout , a method used in football to decide which team progresses to the next stage of a tournament ( or wins the tournament ) following a tied game via kicking penalty kicks , was used to determine a winner if the match was tied on goal difference . 
 Since the competition takes place in the mid @-@ winter , it 's disputed between the champions of the previous year 's forementioned competitions . Because of this , some count the year of the championship by the qualification year rather than that of the competition itself . Thus , CONMEBOL states that Nacional from Uruguay won the first Recopa of 1989 , whereas the RSSSF refers to that championship as Recopa 1988 .

 The Recopa Sudamericana trophy is retained by CONMEBOL at all times . A full @-@ size replica trophy is awarded to the winning club . Thirty gold medals are presented to the winning club and thirty silver medals to the runners @-@ up . 
 The Recopa Sudamericana trophy has not undergone many changes in its history . The trophy consists of a gold @-@ coated body with a pedestal . The body consists of an Adidas Tango ball , a successful family and brand of association footballs . It was first introduced as the Tango <unk> in 1978 for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina . The ball is hoisted by a golden , cylindrical body with four quadrilateral edges sticking out of the body at 45 degrees from each other . The pedestal is separated into two parts ; the top part of the pedestal consists of the CONMEBOL emblem . The bottom part of the pedestal contains a gold badge underneath the CONMEBOL emblem with the phrase , " <unk> " , imprinted into it . To the left and right , badges of previous winners are placed . 
 A team which wins 3 times in a row , receives an original copy of the trophy and a special mark of recognition .

 The current match ball for the Recopa Sudamericana , manufactured by Nike , is named the Total 90 Omni CSF . It is one of the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL , replacing the Mercurial <unk> Hi @-@ Vis in 2009 . The ball , approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g , has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster , farther , and more accurately . According to Nike , the ball 's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball . The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch , and the 6 @-@ wing carbon @-@ latex air chamber improves acceleration . Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer ; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup . Its support material of cross @-@ linked nitrogen @-@ expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape . Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability . The asymmetrical high @-@ contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal , allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball . 
 = = Sponsorship = = 
 Like the FIFA World Cup , the Recopa Sudamericana is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations . Unlike the premier football tournament forementioned , the competition uses a single , main sponsor ; it is currently primarily sponsored by Banco Santander , one of the largest banks in the world . The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition . As the main sponsor of the tournament , the competition will carry the name of the bank . Thus , the competition is known officially as the ' " Copa Santander Libertadores ' " . The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica , a Latin American cable television network focusing on sports @-@ related programming including live and pre @-@ recorded event telecasts , sports talk shows , and other original programmings . The sponsorship was only for the 2005 edition of the competition , being known officially as ' " Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana " ' . The second primary sponsor was Visa , an American multinational financial services corporation . The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition . As the main sponsor of the tournament , the competition carried the name of the corporation . Thus , the competition was known officially as ' " Recopa Visa Sudamericana " ' . 
 However , the competition has had many secondary sponsors that invest in the tournament as well . Many of these sponsors are nationally based but have expanded to other nations . Nike supplies the official match ball , as they do for all other CONMEBOL competitions . Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising , even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Recopa Sudamericana . 
 The tournament 's current secondary sponsors and brands advertised ( in italic ) are : 
 = = Records and statistics = =

The overall top goalscorer in Recopa Sudamericana history is Rodrigo Palacio , scorer of five goals . Leandro Damião is second with 3 goals . Rodrigo Palacio and Leandro Damião hold the record for the most goals scored in a single Recopa Sudamericana . Each of their three goals was scored in the 2006 and 2010 finals , respectively . Claudio Morel Rodríguez is the player with most appearances in the competition , 5 editions ( winning three finals ) , all of them in Boca Juniors with the exception of 2003 ( played for San Lorenzo ) .

" She talked about the choosing of Connect @-@ R as the guest vocalist for " Vanilla Chocolat " : 
 " I chose Connect @-@ R because it seems that he can " deal " with every music genre , because he is flexible and he can continue even with every unexpected change or sound combination .

 = St Mary 's Church , Tal @-@ y @-@ llyn = 
 St Mary 's Church , Tal @-@ y @-@ llyn is a medieval church near Aberffraw in Anglesey , north Wales . It was originally a chapel of ease for the parish church of St Peulan 's , Llanbeulan , but the township that it once served , Tal @-@ y @-@ llyn , no longer exists . It was declared a redundant church in the early 1990s , and has been in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches since 1999 . Services are held once per month during part of the year . 
 The date of the church is unknown , but the oldest parts could be from the 12th century . The chancel was rebuilt in the 16th century , and a side chapel added in the 17th century . The church furnishings , such as pews , pulpit and communion rails , were added in the 18th century , although some of the pews are modern replacements after vandalism . It is a Grade I listed building , a national designation given to buildings of " exceptional , usually national , interest " , because it is " a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple , rustic character . " 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Mary 's Church is in a rural and thinly populated part of Anglesey , about 4 @.@ 25 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 6 mi ) northeast of Aberffraw and about 3 @.@ 75 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) southwest of Gwalchmai . It stands on a low mound with a circumference of approximately 120 yards ( 110 m ) ; the wall around the churchyard , which contains no gravestones , follows the shape of the mound to some extent . Its original purpose was to serve as one of five chapels of ease for the local parish church , St Peulan 's , Llanbeulan , about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the north ; St Peulan 's itself has now closed . The township that St Mary 's served , Tal @-@ y @-@ llyn , has now disappeared , although before the time of the Black Death there were 22 houses here . 
 The date of foundation of the church is unknown . The nave is the oldest part of the church , possibly built in the 12th century . Later changes saw the rebuilding of the chancel ( in the late 16th century ) and the addition of a chapel on the south side of the building ( in the 17th century ) . It was used for services until the early 1990s , and was then made a redundant church in about 1992 . It was placed in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1999 , who hold a 999 year lease effective from 19 November 1999 . Services are held in the church on one Sunday afternoon per month between May and October . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The church was constructed using rubble masonry with boulder quoins . The floor is laid with flagstones throughout , and the roof has modern slates . The nave measures 25 by 13 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 by 4 @.@ 0 m ) , the chancel measures 16 feet 6 inches by 11 feet ( 5 @.@ 03 by 3 @.@ 47 m ) , and the chapel adjoining the chancel on the south side is 9 by 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 by 2 @.@ 4 m ) . Between the nave and chancel is a pointed arch , with some 13th @-@ century elements but probably reconstructed in the 16th century . The side chapel has rectangular windows in the east and west walls from the 17th century ; a narrow stone bench runs along the west and south walls of the chapel . The roof trusses , which date from the 15th and 17th centuries , are visible inside the building and the undersides are chamfered . There are two rectangular windows in the north wall of the nave ( 20th century additions ) , matching the window in the north wall of the chancel . The east window , in the chancel , has three rounded lights set in a square frame ; it dates from the latter part of the 16th century . The windows still have their clear leaded glass but are now boarded up . There are no windows on the south side , which is the most exposed side . There is an empty bellcote on the roof at the west end of the nave . The entrance is also at the west end , where there is a rounded arch doorway set deep into the thick wall , possibly dating from the 14th century . 
 The 12th @-@ century font was removed when the church was made redundant ; it is now in the nearby church of St <unk> , Llanfaelog . The church now houses a 15th @-@ century octagonal font made of gritstone , positioned on an octagonal stem . The communion rails are dated 1764 and is of a simple design ; the pulpit , also 18th @-@ century , has recessed panels . 
 There are stone benches along the north and south walls of the nave . Many of the pews , which dated from the 18th century , were vandalised or stolen after the church was made redundant . Replacements were made by a local craftsman as part of the restoration project carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the Friends of Friendless Churches .

 St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade I listed building – the highest grade of listing , designating buildings of " exceptional , usually national , interest " . Fewer than 2 % of the listed buildings in Wales are in this category . It was given this status on 5 April 1971 , because it is " a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple , rustic character . " Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also note as a reason for listing " the retention of a complete set of 18th century fittings , including simple benches " , although this comment predates the 1990s vandalism . One modern guide to the buildings of the region comments that it has " the vernacular character of Anglesey 's country buildings , which survives scarcely at all in the churches . " The 19th @-@ century writer Samuel Lewis , however , took a different view of the building , calling it " a small edifice of no interest " . 
 = 2008 – 11 Icelandic financial crisis = 
 The Icelandic financial crisis was a major economic and political event in Iceland that involved the default of all three of the country 's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008 , following their difficulties in refinancing their short @-@ term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom . Relative to the size of its economy , Iceland 's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history . The crisis led to a severe economic depression in 2008 – 2010 and significant political unrest . 
 In the years preceding the crisis , three Icelandic banks , Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir , multiplied in size . This expansion was driven by ready access to credit in international financial markets , in particular short @-@ term financing . As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007 – 2008 , investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky . Trust in the banks gradually faded , leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short @-@ term debt . At the end of the second quarter of 2008 , Iceland 's external debt was 9 @.@ 553 trillion Icelandic krónur ( € 50 billion ) , more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007 . The assets of the three banks totaled 14 @.@ 437 trillion krónur at the end of the second quarter 2008 , equal to more than 11 times the national GDP . Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy , the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis , further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system . 
 On 29 September 2008 , it was announced that Glitnir would be nationalised . However , subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed . On 6 October , the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial Supervisory Authority ( FME ) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims . In the following days , new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir . The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation , resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors . Outside Iceland , more than half a million depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks . This led to the 2008 – 2013 Icesave dispute , that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees . 
 In an effort to stabilize the situation , the Icelandic government stated that all domestic deposits in Icelandic banks would be guaranteed , imposed strict capital controls to stabilize the value of the Icelandic króna , and secured a US $ <unk> sovereign debt package from the IMF and the Nordic countries in order to finance a budget deficit and the restoration of the banking system . The international bailout support programme led by IMF officially ended on 31 August 2011 , while the capital controls which were imposed in November 2008 are still in place . 
 The financial crisis had a serious negative impact on the Icelandic economy . The national currency fell sharply in value , foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks , and the market capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90 % . As a result of the crisis , Iceland underwent a severe economic depression ; the country 's gross domestic product dropped by 10 % in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010 . A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011 , and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate . The government budget deficit has declined from 9 @.@ 7 % of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0 @.@ 2 % of GDP in 2014 ; the central government gross debt @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60 % in 2018 from a maximum of 85 % in 2011 . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Currency = = = 
 The Icelandic króna had declined more than 35 % against the euro from January to September 2008 . Inflation of consumer prices was running at 14 % , and Iceland 's interest rates had been raised to 15 @.@ 5 % to deal with the high inflation . 
 On the night of Wednesday , 8 October 2008 , the Central Bank of Iceland abandoned its attempt to peg the Icelandic króna at 131 krónur to the euro after trying to set this peg on 6 October . By 9 October , the Icelandic króna was trading at 340 to the euro when trading in the currency collapsed due to the FME 's takeover of the last major Icelandic bank , and thus the loss of all króna trade ' clearing houses ' . The next day , the central bank introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland . From 9 October to 5 November , the European Central Bank quoted a reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro . 
 The Central Bank of Iceland set up a temporary system of daily currency auctions on 15 October to facilitate international trade . The value of the króna is determined by supply and demand in these auctions . The first auction sold € 25 million at a rate of 150 krónur to the euro . Commercial króna trading outside Iceland restarted on 28 October , at an exchange rate of 240 krónur to the euro , after Icelandic interest rates had been raised to 18 % . The foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland fell by US $ 289 million during October 2008 . 
 During November , the real exchange rate ( discounting inflation ) of the Icelandic króna , as quoted by the Central Bank of Iceland , was roughly one @-@ third lower than the average rate from 1980 – 2008 , and 20 % lower than the historical lows during the same period . The external rate as quoted by the European Central Bank was lower still . On the last trading day of the month , 28 November , the Central Bank of Iceland was quoting 182 @.@ 5 krónur to the euro , while the European Central Bank was quoting 280 krónur to the euro . 
 On 28 November , the Central Bank of Iceland and the Minister for Business Affairs agreed on a new set of currency regulations , replacing the central bank 's restrictions imposed early on in the crisis . Movements of capital to and from Iceland were banned without a license from central bank . It is estimated that foreign investors hold some € 2 @.@ 9 billion in króna @-@ denominated securities , popularly known as " glacier bonds " . 
 The foreign exchange rules also oblige Icelandic residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank . There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore foreign exchange market , trading pounds and euros for krónur outside the control of any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency . Hence the Central Bank had to sell € 124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 to make up the difference , compared with an estimated trade surplus of € 13 @.@ 9 million . 
 The last currency auction was held on 3 December . The domestic interbank foreign exchange market reopened the following day with three market makers , all of them government @-@ owned . On the first two days of domestic trading , the króna climbed to 153 @.@ 3 to the euro , up 22 % against the last currency auction rate . 
 In January 2009 , the exchange rate of Icelandic króna against Euro seemed to be more stabilized compared with the situation in October 2008 , with the lowest rate at 177 @.@ 5 krónur per EUR on 1 , 3 and 4 January 2009 , and the highest at 146 @.@ 8 on 30 January 2009 . In the meantime , however , Iceland 's 12 @-@ month inflation in January 2009 climbed to a record high of 18 @.@ 6 % .

 In September 2008 , internal documents from Kaupthing , the largest bank in Iceland , were leaked to WikiLeaks . On 29 September 2008 , a plan was announced for the bank Glitnir to be nationalised by the Icelandic government with the purchase of a 75 % stake for € 600 million . The government stated that it did not intend to hold ownership of the bank for a long period , and that the bank was expected to carry on operating as normal . According to the government , the bank " would have ceased to exist " within a few weeks if there had not been intervention . It later turned out that Glitnir had US $ 750 million of debt due to mature on 15 October . However , the nationalization of Glitnir never went through , as it was placed in receivership by the FME before the initial plan of the Icelandic government to purchase a 75 % stake had been approved by shareholders . 
 The announced nationalisation of Glitnir came just as the United Kingdom government was forced to nationalise Bradford & Bingley and to sell its retail operations and branch network to Grupo Santander . Over the weekend of 4 – 5 October , British newspapers carried many articles detailing the nationalisation of Glitnir and the high leverage of Iceland 's other banks . Influential BBC business editor Robert <unk> published an opinion piece on the banks , stating that debt insurance for Kaupthing required a premium of £ 625 @,@ 000 to guarantee the return of £ 1 million : " the worst case of financial BO I 've encountered in some time " was his graphic description . The Guardian said " Iceland is on the brink of collapse . Inflation and interest rates are raging upwards . The krona , Iceland 's currency , is in freefall . " These articles spooked investors discussing Icesave ( the brand name of Landsbanki in the UK and the Netherlands ) in online forums and many started moving their savings out of the Internet bank . Problems with access to the site hinted at a run on savings . 
 On 6 October , a number of private interbank credit facilities to Icelandic banks were shut down . Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation , and announced a package of new regulatory measures which were to be put to the Althing , Iceland 's parliament , immediately , with the cooperation of the opposition parties . These included the power of the FME to take over the running of Icelandic banks without nationalising them , and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated . In a separate measure , retail deposits in Icelandic branches of Icelandic banks were guaranteed in full . The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the Icelandic government less than 24 hours earlier . 
 That evening , the Guernsey subsidiary of Landsbanki went into voluntary administration with the approval of the Guernsey Financial Services Commission . The administrators would later say that " The main reason for the Bank 's difficulties has been the placing of funds with its UK fellow subsidiary , Heritable Bank . " Guernsey 's Chief Minister stated " the directors of Landsbanki Guernsey took appropriate steps by putting the bank into administration . " 
 The FME placed Landsbanki in receivership early on 7 October . A press release from the FME stated that all of Landsbanki 's domestic branches , call centres , ATMs and internet operations will be open for business as usual , and that all " domestic deposits " were fully guaranteed . The UK government used the Banking ( Special Provisions ) Act 2008 first to transfer retail deposits from Heritable Bank to a Treasury holding company , then to sell them to Dutch bank ING Direct for £ 1 million . The same day , the FME placed also Glitnir into receivership . 
 That afternoon , there was a telephone conversation between Icelandic Finance Minister Árni Mathiesen and UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling . That evening , one of the governors of the Central Bank of Iceland , Davíð Oddsson , was interviewed on Icelandic public service broadcaster RÚV and stated that " we [ the Icelandic State ] do not intend to pay the debts of the banks that have been a little heedless " . He compared the government 's measures to the U.S. intervention at Washington Mutual , and suggested that foreign creditors would " unfortunately only get 5 – 10 – 15 % of their claims " . 
 Darling announced that he was taking steps to freeze the assets of Landsbanki in the UK . The Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008 was passed at 10 am on 8 October 2008 and came into force ten minutes later . Under the order the UK Treasury froze the assets of Landsbanki within the UK , and introduced provisions to prevent the sale or movement of Landsbanki assets within the UK , even if held by the Central Bank of Iceland or the Government of Iceland . The freezing order took advantage of provisions in sections 4 and 14 and Schedule 3 of the Anti @-@ terrorism , Crime and Security Act 2001 , and was made " because the Treasury believed that action to the detriment of the UK 's economy ( or part of it ) had been or was likely to be taken by certain persons who are the government of or resident of a country or territory outside the UK . " 
 The UK Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , announced that the UK government would launch legal action against Iceland over concerns with compensation for the estimated 300 @,@ 000 UK savers . Geir Haarde said at a press conference on the following day that the Icelandic government was outraged that the UK government applied provisions of anti @-@ terrorism legislation to it in a move they dubbed an " unfriendly act " . The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said that the UK government would foot the entire bill to compensate UK retail depositors , estimated at £ 4 billion . It is reported that more than £ 4 billion in Icelandic assets in the UK have been frozen by the UK government . The UK Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) also declared Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander , the UK subsidiary of Kaupthing Bank , in default on its obligations , sold Kaupthing Edge , its Internet bank , to ING Direct , and put Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander into administration . Over £ 2 @.@ 5 billion of deposits for 160 @,@ 000 customers were sold to ING Direct . The scale of the run on Kaupthing Edge deposits had been such that many transactions were not completed until 17 October . Although Geir Haarde has described the UK government 's actions over Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander as an " abuse of power " and " unprecedented " , they were the third such actions taken under the Banking ( Special Provisions ) Act 2008 in less than ten days , after interventions in Bradford & Bingley and Heritable Bank . 
 On the same day , the Sveriges <unk> , Sweden 's central bank , made a credit facility of 5 billion Swedish krona ( € 520 million ) available to Kaupthing Bank Sverige AB , the Swedish subsidiary of Kaupthing . The loan was to pay " depositors and other creditors " . 
 On 9 October , Kaupthing was placed into receivership by the FME , following the resignation of the entire board of directors . The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration . Kaupthing 's Luxembourg subsidiary asked for , and obtained , a suspension of payments ( similar to chapter 11 protection ) in the Luxembourg District Court . Kaupthing 's Geneva office , which was a branch of its Luxembourg subsidiary , was prevented from making any payments of more than 5000 Swiss francs by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission . The directors of Kaupthing 's subsidiary on the Isle of Man decided to wind up the company after consultation with the Manx authorities . The Finnish Financial Supervision Authority , <unk> , announced having taken control of Kaupthing 's Helsinki branch already on 6th , to prevent money from being sent back to Iceland . 
 On the same day , the UK Treasury issued a licence under the Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008 to allow the London branch of Landsbanki to continue some business . A second licence was issued on 13 October , when the Bank of England provided a £ 100 million secured loan to Landsbanki " to help maximise the returns to UK creditors . " 
 On 12 October the Norwegian government took control of Kaupthing 's Norwegian operations , including " all of the bank 's assets and liabilities in Norway . " 
 On 21 October , the Central Bank of Iceland asked the remaining independent financial institutions for new collateral against their loans . This was to replace the shares in Glitnir , Landsbanki and Kaupthing which had been pledged as collateral previously and which were now of much lower value , if not worthless . The value of the collateral was estimated at 300 billion krónur ( € 2 billion ) . One of the banks , <unk> ( SPB , also known as <unk> ) , stated the next day that it could not provide new collateral for its 68 billion krónur ( € 451 million ) loan , and would have to turn to the government for help . " This problem won 't be solved in any other way , " said CEO Agnar Hansson . 
 On 24 October , it emerged that a Norwegian export credit company ( Eksportfinans ) had made a complaint to Norwegian police concerning the alleged embezzlement of 415 million Norwegian kroner ( € 47 million ) by Glitnir since 2006 . The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans , administering loans to several companies : however Eksportfinans alleges that , when the loans were paid off early by borrowers , Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans , effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself .

 Trading in shares of six financial companies on the OMX Nordic Iceland Exchange was suspended on 6 October by order of the FME . On Thursday 9 October , all trading on the exchange was frozen for two days by the government " in an attempt to prevent further panic spreading throughout the country 's financial markets " . The decision was made to do so due to " unusual market conditions " , with share prices having fallen 30 % since the start of the month . The closure was extended through Monday 13 October due to continuing " unusual market conditions " . 
 The market reopened on 14 October with the main index , the OMX Iceland 15 , at 678 @.@ 4 , which corresponds to a plunge of about 77 % compared with 3 @,@ 004 @.@ 6 before the closure . This reflects the fact that the value of the three big banks , which form 73 @.@ 2 % of the value of the OMX Iceland 15 , had been set to zero . The values of other equities varied from + 8 % to − 15 % . Trading in shares of Exista , <unk> and Straumur @-@ <unk> ( 13 @.@ 66 % of the OMX Iceland 15 ) remains suspended . After a week of very thin trading , the OMX Iceland 15 closed on 17 October at 643 @.@ 1 , down 93 % in króna terms and 96 % in euro terms from its historic high of <unk> ( 18 July 2007 ) . 
 Trading in the shares of two financial services companies , Straumur – <unk> and Exista , resumed on 9 December : together the companies account for 12 @.@ 04 % of the OMX Iceland 15 .

Trading in shares in <unk> and Kaupthing remains suspended , at prices of 1 @.@ 90 krónur and 694 @.@ 00 krónur respectively .

 The four credit rating agencies which monitor Iceland 's sovereign debt all lowered their ratings during the crisis , and their outlook for future ratings changes became negative . The Icelandic government had a relatively healthy balance , with sovereign debt of 28 % of GDP and a budget surplus of 6 % of GDP ( 2007 ) . More recently , the estimated 2011 debt was 130 % of GDP with a budget deficit of 6 % of GDP . 
 In addition , the value of foreign currency bonds which matured in the remainder of 2008 was only $ 600 million , and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $ 215 million , well within the government 's ability to pay . However the agencies believed that the government would have to issue more foreign currency bonds , both to cover losses as the banks ' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the domestic economy as Iceland goes into recession . 
 A team of experts from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) arrived in Iceland at the start of October 2008 for talks with the government . Industry Minister Össur <unk> was said to be " favourable " to help from the IMF to stabilise the króna and to allow interest rates to be lowered . 
 On 7 October , the central bank of Iceland announced that they had been in talks with the Russian ambassador to Iceland , Victor I. <unk> , over a € 4 billion loan from Russia . The loan would be given across three or four years , with an interest rate of 30 to 50 basis points ( 0 @.@ 3 % to 0 @.@ 5 % ) above LIBOR . Central Bank of Iceland governor Davíð Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated . According to RÚV , prime minister Geir Haarde had been investigating the possibility of a Russian loan since the mid @-@ summer . When questioned on the matter in a press conference , Geir Haarde said : " We have not received the kind of support that we were requesting from our friends . So in a situation like that one has to look for new friends . " 
 A team of Icelandic negotiators arrived in Moscow on 14 October to discuss the possible loan . Russian deputy finance minister Dmitri <unk> said that " The meeting took place in a friendly atmosphere .... We are working thoroughly on the issue to take a final decision " . On the same day , the Central Bank of Iceland drew on its swap facilities with the central banks of Denmark and Norway for € 200 million each . Iceland has swap facilities with the other Nordic countries for a total of € 1 @.@ 5 billion . Iceland is also seeking assistance from the European Central Bank ( ECB ) : there is some precedent for the move , as the ECB already has currency swap arrangements with Switzerland , another non @-@ member of the European Union . 
 On 24 October , the IMF tentatively agreed to lend € 1 @.@ 58 billion . However the loan had still not been approved by the Executive Board of the IMF on 13 November . Due to the delay Iceland found itself caught in a classic catch @-@ 22 situation , loans from other countries could not be secured until the IMF program had been approved . The Icelandic government spoke of a $ 500M ( € <unk> ) gap in the funding plans . Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos stated that the Netherlands would oppose the loan unless agreement was reached over deposit insurance for Landsbanki customers in the Netherlands . 
 The IMF @-@ led package of $ <unk> was finally agreed on 19 November , with the IMF loaning $ <unk> and another $ <unk> of loans and currency swaps from Norway , Sweden , Finland and Denmark . In addition , Poland has offered to lend $ 200M and the Faroe Islands have offered $ 50M , about 3 % of Faroese GDP . The Icelandic government reported that Russia offered to lend $ 500M , and Poland , $ 200M . The next day , Germany , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom announced a joint loan of $ <unk> ( € 5bn ) , related to the deposit insurance dispute .

 In 2001 , banks were deregulated in Iceland . This set the stage for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated . The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts . It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of € 50 billion , or about € 160 @,@ 000 per Icelandic resident , compared with Iceland 's gross domestic product of € 8 @.@ 5 billion . As early as March 2008 , the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher ( 6 – 8 ½ % of the sum deposited ) than for other European banks . The króna , which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world ( based on the Big Mac Index ) , has further suffered from the effects of carry trading . 
 Coming from a small domestic market , Iceland 's banks have financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and , more recently , by deposits from outside Iceland ( which are also a form of external debt ) . Households also took on a large amount of debt , equivalent to 213 % of disposable income , which led to inflation . This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued , uncovered bonds – effectively , printing money on demand . 
 In response to the rise in prices – 14 % in the twelve months to September 2008 , compared with a target of 2 @.@ 5 % – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high ( 15 @.@ 5 % ) . Such high interest rates , compared with 5 @.@ 5 % in the United Kingdom or 4 % in the eurozone for example , encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur , leading to monetary inflation : the Icelandic money supply ( M3 ) grew 56 @.@ 5 % in the twelve months to September 2008 , compared with 5 @.@ 0 % GDP growth . The situation was effectively an economic bubble , with investors overestimating the true value of the króna . 
 As with many banks around the world , the Icelandic banks found it increasingly difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market , their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans . In such a situation , a bank would normally have to ask for a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort . However , in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks ' debts , leading to the collapse of the banks . The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374 @.@ 8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008 , compared with 350 @.@ 3 billion krónur of short @-@ term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector , and at least £ 6 @.@ 5 billion ( 1 @,@ 250 billion krónur ) of retail deposits in the UK . 
 The situation was made worse by the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki , rather than as a legally independent subsidiary . As such , it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity , and could not turn to the Bank of England for help . The UK Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) was aware of the risk , and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit @-@ taking banks in the weeks before the crisis . However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits , and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent . The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ( " parental <unk> " ) . Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary . 
 The existence of a bank run on Landsbanki accounts in the UK in the period up to 7 October seems confirmed by a statement from the bank on 10 October , which said " Landsbanki <unk> <unk> transferred substantial funds to its UK branch during this time to fulfil its Icesave commitments . " The transfer of funds from Landsbanki Guernsey to Heritable Bank , a Landsbanki subsidiary in the UK , also suggests a bank run in the UK . A transfer of " substantial funds " from Iceland to the UK would have been a significant downward push on the value of the króna , even before the effects of any speculation . 
 = = Bank restructuring = = 
 Wholesale funding disappeared in September 2008 leading to the collapse of Glitnir , Kaupthing and Landsbanki . Due to the size of the combined balance sheet of those banks the government of Iceland did not have the means to save those banks . They were put into receivership instead with their boards replaced . Nevertheless , the failed banks were restructured by dividing them into a new and an old bank in order to avoid a credit crunch . 
 The new state @-@ owned banks took over the domestic activities and have been recapitalised by government with a capital ratio of 16 % of all assets . The Financial Supervisory Authority ( FME ) has acted to " ring @-@ fence " the Icelandic operations of Landsbanki and Glitnir , stating its aim of " continued banking operations for Icelandic families and businesses . " NBI ( originally known as Nýi Landsbanki ) was set up on 9 October with 200 billion krónur in equity and 2 @,@ 300 billion krónur of assets . Nýi Glitnir was set up on 15 October with 110 billion krónur in equity and 1 @,@ 200 billion krónur of assets . Nýja <unk> was set up on 22 October with 75 billion krónur in equity and 700 billion krónur of assets . The equity in all three new banks was supplied by the Icelandic government , and amounted to 30 % of Iceland 's GDP . The new banks will also have to reimburse their predecessors for the net value of the transferred assets , as determined by " recognised appraisers " . As of 14 November 2008 , these net values were estimated as : NBI <unk> ( € <unk> ) , Nýi Glitnir <unk> ( € <unk> ) ; Nýja <unk> <unk> ( € <unk> ) . The total debt of 1173 billion krónur is more than 90 % of Iceland 's 2007 gross domestic product . 
 The international businesses remained with the old banks for winding up . Glitnir and Kaupthing , shorn of their Icelandic operations , obtained <unk> on payments to creditors ( similar to Chapter 11 protection ) from the District Court of Reykjavík on 24 November . 
 The rescue operations of the central bank along with the restructuring and recapitalization of the banks increased the public debt ratio by about 20 percentage points of GDP .

 The current economic climate in the country has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens . With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki , the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki , around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank 's international operations . Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can be compared with the 2 @,@ 136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008 . 
 Other companies have also been affected . For example , the private Sterling Airlines declared bankruptcy on 29 October 2008 . The national airline Icelandair has noticed a significant slump in domestic demand for flights . However , the airline states that year @-@ on @-@ year international demand is up from last year . <unk> <unk> , a spokesman for the airline , said " we 're getting decent traffic from other markets ... we are trying to let the weak [ króna ] help us . " He has also stated that it is impossible to predict whether the company will be profitable this year . <unk> , an Icelandic newspaper , is cutting some jobs and merging parts of its operations with the media corporation 365 . The newspaper 24 <unk> has ceased publication due to the crisis , resulting in the loss of 20 jobs . 
 Importers are particularly hard hit , with the government restricting foreign currency to essential products such as food , medicines and oil . The € 400 million loan from the central banks of Denmark and Norway is sufficient to pay for a month 's imports , although on 15 October there was still a " temporary delay " which affected " all payments to and from the country " . 
 The assets of Icelandic pension funds are , according to one expert , expected to shrink by 15 – 25 % . The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have to be cut in 2009 . Iceland 's GDP is expected by economists to shrink by as much as 10 % as a result of the crisis , putting Iceland by some measures in an economic depression . Inflation may climb as high as 75 % by the end of the year . 
 Unemployment had more than tripled by late November 2008 , with over 7000 registered <unk> ( about 4 % of the workforce ) compared to just <unk> at the end of August 2008 . As 80 % of household debt is indexed and another 13 % denominated in foreign currencies , debt payment is going to be more costly . Since October 2008 , 14 % of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay , and around 7 % have had their working hours reduced . According to the president of the Icelandic Federation of Labour ( <unk> ) , Gylfi <unk> , these figures are lower than expected . 85 % of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October , after the economic collapse . 
 On 17 July 2009 , lawmakers voted 33 – 28 ( with two abstentions ) to approve a government plan for Iceland to apply for full European Union membership . Although Iceland ( as a member of EFTA ) already had a free trade arrangement with the EU , it had always rejected full membership due to concerns that its independence could be compromised . However , Prime Minister <unk> Sigurðardóttir , who was elected in April , had promised to bring Iceland into the EU to help stabilize its economy . EU enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed support for Iceland 's membership , stating that as " a country with deep democratic traditions " , Iceland will be welcome in the EU 's expansion plans . ( However , on 13 September 2013 the Government of Iceland dissolved its accession team and suspended its application to join the EU . On 12 March 2015 , Foreign Minister of Iceland Gunnar Bragi <unk> stated that he had sent a letter to the EU withdrawing the application for membership , without the approval of the Althing , though the European Union stated that Iceland had not formally withdrawn the application . )

 Over £ 840 million in cash from more than 100 UK local authorities was invested in Icelandic banks . Representatives from each council met to try to persuade the Treasury to secure the money in the same way that customers ' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed . Of all the local authorities , Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks , currently £ 50 million . Transport for London , the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London , also has a large investment at £ 40 million . Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk . Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities , and even the Audit Commission . It is hoped that about one @-@ third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly , corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries : liquidation of other assets , such as loans and offices , will take longer . 
 In an emergency sitting of Tynwald on 9 October , the Isle of Man government raised compensation from 75 % of the first £ 15 @,@ 000 per depositor to 100 % of £ 50 @,@ 000 per depositor . The Chief Minister of the Isle of Man , Tony Brown , confirmed that Kaupthing had guaranteed the operations and liabilities of its Manx subsidiary in September 2007 , and that the Manx government was pressing Iceland to honour this guarantee . Depositors with Landsbanki on Guernsey found themselves without any depositor protection . 
 On 11 October , an agreement was reached between the Icelandic and Dutch governments on the savings of about 120 @,@ 000 Dutch citizens . The Icelandic government will cover the first € 20 @,@ 887 on savings accounts of Dutch citizens held by Landsbanki subsidiary Icesave , using money lent by the Dutch government . The total value of Icesave deposits in the Netherlands is € 1 @.@ 7 billion . At the same time , Iceland and Britain reached an agreement on the general contours of a solution : Icesave deposits in the UK total £ 4 billion ( € 5 billion ) in 300 @,@ 000 accounts . The figure of € 20 @,@ 887 is the amount covered by the Icelandic Depositors ' and Investors ' Guarantee Fund ( DIGF ; <unk> in Icelandic ) : however , the DIGF had equity of only 8 @.@ 3 billion krónur at the end of 2007 , € 90 million at the exchange rates of the time and far from sufficient to cover the Dutch and British claims . 
 The cost of deposit insurance in the UK is not completely clear as of November 2008 . The Financial Services Compensation Scheme ( FSCS ) paid around £ 3 billion to transfer deposits from Heritable Bank and Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander to ING Direct , while the UK Treasury paid an additional £ 600 million to guarantee retail deposits that were higher than the FSCS limit . The Treasury also paid out £ 800 million to guarantee Icesave deposits that were higher than the limit . A loan of £ 2 @.@ 2 billion to the Icelandic government is expected to cover the claims against the Icelandic DIGF relating to Icesave , while the exposure of the UK FSCS is expected to be £ 1 – 2 billion . 
 The crisis also prompted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reduce its foreign aid to developing nations , from 0 @.@ 31 % to 0 @.@ 27 % of GNP . The effect of the aid cut was greatly amplified by the falling value of the króna : the budget of the Icelandic International Development Agency ( <unk> ) was reduced from US $ 22 million to $ 13 million . Since Iceland 's foreign aid is targeted in sectors for which the country has particular expertise ( e.g. , fisheries , geothermal power ) , the cutbacks will have a substantial impact in countries which receive Icelandic aid – most noticeably in Sri Lanka , where <unk> is pulling out altogether . 
 On 27 February 2009 , the Wall Street Journal reported that Iceland 's new government was trying to raise $ 25 million by selling its ambassadorial residences in Washington , New York , London and Oslo . 
 On 28 August 2009 , Iceland 's parliament voted 34 – 15 ( with 14 abstentions ) to approve a bill ( commonly referred to as the Icesave bill ) to pay the United Kingdom and the Netherlands more than $ 5 billion lost in Icelandic deposit accounts . Initially opposed in June , the bill was passed after amendments were added which set a ceiling on the payment based on the country 's gross domestic product . Opponents of the bill argued that Icelanders , already reeling from the crisis , should not have to pay for mistakes made by private banks under the watch of other governments . However , the government argued that if the bill failed to pass , the UK and the Netherlands might retaliate by blocking a planned aid package for Iceland from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Under the deal , up to 4 % of Iceland 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) will be paid to the UK , in sterling terms , from 2017 – 2023 while the Netherlands will receive up to 2 % of Iceland 's GDP , in euro terms , for the same period . Talks between Icelandic , Dutch and UK ministers in January 2010 dubbed as " Icesave " did not result in any specific actions being agreed upon .

 On 12 December 2008 , the Icelandic parliament established a Special Investigation Commission ( SIC ) , which came to consist of Supreme Court Justice Páll <unk> who served as chairman , Parliamentary Ombudsman <unk> Gunnarsson and <unk> <unk> associate chair at Yale University , to investigate the causes and lessons of the crisis . The commission released its report on 12 April 2010 . 
 = = = Icelandic criminal investigations = = = 
 The Office of the Special Prosecutor was founded with the passage of a bill in the Icelandic parliament 10 December 2008 . The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to , in connection with or in the wake of the banking crisis , whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings , other legal entities or individuals , and , as appropriate , to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned . 
 In April 2009 , Iceland 's state prosecutor hired Eva Joly , the Norwegian @-@ French investigator who led Europe 's biggest ever fraud investigations into bribery and corruption at oil group Elf Aquitaine , as special consultant to a 20 @-@ member " economic crime team " to " investigate suspicions of criminal actions in the period preceding the collapse of the Icelandic banks " which may involve several Iceland 's business and banking leaders . Joly stated that the investigation will require a minimum of 2 – 3 years to build up enough evidence to secure prosecutions . 
 In February 2009 , Ólafur <unk> ( b . Reykjavík 1964 ) was appointed ; it was the Icelandic government 's second attempt to appoint to the role , and Ólafur was one of only two applicants . He had previously been the police chief in <unk> . At the time the unit had four staff members ; by September 2013 it had 109 , with 140 cases under investigation . By that time , the top managers of all three Icelandic banks which collapsed during the financial crisis had been charged , though the cases progressed slowly . 
 The investigation has been focusing on a number of questionable financial practices engaged in by Icelandic banks : 
 Almost half of all the loans made by Icelandic banks were to holdings companies , many of which are connected to those same Icelandic banks . 
 Money was allegedly lent by the banks to their employees and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans . Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan until the end of the period , when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due . These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed . 
 Kaupthing allowed a Qatari investor to purchase 5 % of its shares . It was later revealed that the Qatari investor " bought " the stake using a loan from Kaupthing itself and a holding company associated with one of its employees ( i.e. , the bank was , in effect , buying its own shares ) .
