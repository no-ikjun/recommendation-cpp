 Some of the militia men boarded the docked Unity , removed the remaining supplies , and also removed her sails . Others went around by land near the place where the Margaretta was anchored , and demanded her surrender . Moore refused , threatening to fire on the town . This threat was more bluster than real , as Margaretta sported only a few mounted guns capable of firing one @-@ pound shot . More of the militia men rowed out to the Polly , which was anchored downstream from the Margaretta , and attempted to tow her into the harbor . This attempt failed when she ran aground , possibly due to low tide . Moore raised anchor and came alongside Polly , intending to recover her . After a brief and inconsequential exchange of gunfire with the militia men on the shore , however , he again raised anchor and went further downstream to a safe anchorage . 
 The next day , the men of Machias regrouped . Foster took about 20 men to East Machias , where they commandeered the Falmouth Packet , a local schooner . The remaining men commandeered the Unity . They rerigged her , installed some planks as a makeshift breastwork to serve as protection , armed themselves with muskets , pitchforks and axes and then set out after the Margaretta , which by that time had reached the waters of Machias Bay . Moore had brought aboard as pilot one Captain Toby , near whose sloop he had anchored overnight , and was looking to depart the scene . In <unk> into brisk winds , however , the Margaretta 's main boom and gaff broke away , crippling its navigability . As a result , once in Holmes Bay , Moore captured a sloop , took its spar and gaff to replace the Margaretta 's and also took captive its pilot , Robert Avery , of Norwich , Connecticut . 
 = = Conflict = = 
 The Unity crew , about 30 Machias men , elected Jeremiah O 'Brien as their captain , and then sailed out to chase down the Margaretta . As the Unity was a much faster sailing vessel , O 'Brien 's crew quickly overtook the crippled Margaretta , while the Falmouth Packet lagged behind . Maine historian Roger Duncan , among others , indicates that both the Unity and the Falmouth Packet engaged the Margaretta , but other sources disagree . Early 20th @-@ century Machias historian George <unk> claims that the Falmouth Packet either ran aground or never caught up to the Margaretta , and that the men aboard the Unity alone battled the Margaretta directly . 
 Seeing the Unity approaching , Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats in an attempt to escape . As the Unity pulled closer , he opened fire , but the Machias crew managed to avoid that fire and pull alongside the Margaretta . It took two tries , but they tied alongside and stormed on board the Margaretta , led by O 'Brien 's brother John and Joseph <unk> . Both sides also exchanged musket shots , and Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity until Samuel Watts took him down with a musket shot to the chest . As Duncan reports , the Falmouth Packet then managed to pull along the other side of the Margaretta , and the combined crews overwhelmed the Margaretta . 
 As Midshipman Moore was grievously wounded , his second , Midshipman Stillingfleet , surrendered the crew and vessel . Moore was taken into care in Machias at the home of Stephen Jones , the nephew of Ichabod Jones , but died the next day . At least three other members of Moore 's crew were also killed , as was Robert Avery , the colonist taken by the British . The remaining crew members of the British schooner were held at Machias for about a month , and were eventually handed over to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress . There were also reports circulated , likely exaggerated , that as many as 100 British men died in this and other skirmishes in the Machias area . Machias lost two men , John <unk> and James <unk> . <unk> died after the skirmish of his wounds . Three others were badly wounded but survived . They were John Berry , who had a musket ball enter his mouth and exit behind his ear , Isaac Taft , and James Cole . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Machias community , expecting the full wrath of the British Empire in revenge , immediately petitioned the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for guidance , supplies and assistance . They organized for the defense of Machias and maintained vigilance in the event of British retaliation . Jeremiah O 'Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels ( sources disagree on which vessel ; Polly and Unity are both mentioned , and historian James Volo suggests that recent scholarship favors Polly ) with breastwork , armed her with the guns and swivels taken from the Margaretta and changed her name to Machias Liberty . In July 1775 , Jeremiah O 'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners , the Diligent and the <unk> , whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbor . In August 1775 , the Provincial Congress formally recognized their efforts , commissioning both the Machias Liberty and the Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy , with Jeremiah O 'Brien as their commander . British retaliation occurred as the burning of Falmouth in October . 
 Following rumours that an assault on Nova Scotia was being planned , with stores stockpiled at Machias , a small British fleet carrying 1 @,@ 000 men attempted to take Machias in August 1777 ; the locals successfully fought off the landing . The rumors were only partly true ; the idea had been proposed , but no significant military planning had taken place . 
 During the war , Machias men refitted and armed a variety of ships — including the Margaretta — and sailed off looking for battle with the British . Jeremiah O 'Brien and John Lambert were both commissioned into the Continental Navy . The Machias Liberty and the Diligent were used to intercept merchant ships supplying the British in the siege of Boston . John and Jerry O 'Brien built a twenty @-@ gun ship and began privateering under an American letter of marque . Jerry was captured off New York late in 1777 ; he escaped from prison in Britain , and continued privateering throughout the war . 
 The British naval command was continually frustrated by the actions of the Machias seamen during the war , and by the use of Machias as a staging point for militia actions ( such as the Eddy Rebellion ) in Nova Scotia . Graves more than once attempted to subdue Machias ; he gave commands in 1776 to " proceed and reduce Machias " , and ordered Sir George Collier to " Go , — destroy Machias " in 1777 . One British officer , presumed to be Collier , said " The damned rebels at Machias were a harder set than those at Bunker Hill . " 
 = = Liberty pole story = = 
 There is a widely told story concerning this affair that Machias men erected a Liberty pole after meeting in the Burnham Tavern to discuss the battles of Lexington and Concord . This story , which persists in modern history books and travel guides , has been shown to be an 1831 fabrication by Machias resident John O 'Brien . There is no mention of the Liberty pole in any earlier accounts , including the official report sent by the residents of Machias in 1775 , and the letters of other participants in the events . 
 = 1911 Giro d 'Italia = 
 The 1911 Giro d 'Italia was the 3rd edition of the Giro d 'Italia , a cycling race set up and sponsored by the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport . The race began on 18 May in Rome with a stage that stretched 394 @.@ 1 km ( 245 mi ) to Florence . It was composed of twelve stages that covered a total distance of 3 @,@ 530 @.@ 3 km ( 2 @,@ 194 mi ) . The race came to a close back in Rome on 6 June after a 266 @.@ 9 km ( 166 mi ) stage . The race was won by the Italian rider Carlo Galetti of the Bianchi team . Second and third respectively were the Italian riders Giovanni Rossignoli and Giovanni Gerbi . 
 Returning champion Carlo Galetti won the race 's opening stage into Florence and was the first to lead the race . He lost the lead to Giovanni Rossignoli after Galetti finished poorly on the race 's second stage . Rossignoli held the lead for four days after Galetti took back the lead after the sixth stage . Frenchman Lucien Petit @-@ Breton became the first non @-@ Italian to lead the Giro d 'Italia after the race 's ninth stage . Petit @-@ Breton lost the lead the next day to Galetti , who then held it all the way to the race 's conclusion in Rome .

 In both 1909 and 1910 Milan had served as both the start and finish of the Giro d 'Italia . The organizers chose to honor the 50th anniversary of the unification of Italy by holding the start and finish of the Giro in the Italian capital of Rome . 
 The organizers chose to expand the Giro d 'Italia from ten to twelve stages after its great success . The race also saw an increase of close to 500 kilometers in length . The organizers also included the first climb above 2000 meters in the race , the Sestriere . This was also the first edition of the Giro to go deep down into the southern part of Italy , specifically the Bari . 
 = = Participants = = 
 Of the 86 riders that began the Giro d 'Italia on 15 May , 24 of them made it to the finish in Rome on 6 June . Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team . There were five teams that competed in the race : Atala @-@ Dunlop , Bianchi @-@ Pirelli , Fiat @-@ Pirelli , Legnano @-@ Dunlop , and Senior @-@ <unk> . 
 The peloton was composed of primarily Italians . The field featured two former Giro d 'Italia champions in the 1909 winner Luigi Ganna and returning champion Carlo Galetti . Other notable Italian riders included Giovanni Rossignoli , Eberardo Pavesi , and Giovanni Gerbi . Two @-@ time Tour de France winner Lucien Petit @-@ Breton also competed in the race . 
 = = Race overview = = 
 The first stage began on 15 May and stretched from Rome to Florence . The racing that day was marred by heavy rain , which led to ten withdrawals . Carlo Galetti won the stage ahead of Giovanni Rossignoli and Dario Beni . The next leg was also dogged by rain and very poor conditions on the road and saw the climbing of the Colle de Bacco . Giovanni Gerbi was the first rider to summit the Colle de Bacco . The climb wore Gerbi out and he was caught and passed by three riders and ultimately finished fourth on the stage . Vincenzo <unk> was the first rider to cross the finish line in Genoa and won the stage , where a large crowd waited for the riders to finish . Rossignoli took the race lead after finishing two positions in front of Galetti . The race 's third day of racing was the first to have clear weather . Race leader Rossignoli bested the likes of Giovanni Gerbi and Carlo <unk> to win the stage and consolidate his lead in the general classification . The next stage was hotly contested , with the peloton staying together for the whole stage as Carlo Galetti took the stage win . 
 The race 's fifth stage is considered to be the first real mountain stage in Giro d 'Italia history . The stage contained the climb of the Sestriere which rises over 2 @,@ 000 meters . As the race entered the Val <unk> leading up the Sestriere , the peloton ran into muddy roads , which forced many to walk their bikes . Frenchman Lucien Petit @-@ Breton led the riders up the slopes before cracking near the snowy summit . He was passed first by Ezio Corlaita , who was the first to summit the Sestriere , and then by many other riders . Petit @-@ Breton caught up with the leading riders on the long descent and rode into the finish in Turin with Corlaita , Rossignoli , and Galetti . Petit @-@ Breton edged out Galetti for the stage win as Galetti tied Rossignoli for the overall lead . 
 The riders started the sixth stage in Turin with large amount of people in attendance for the sendoff . Giuseppe <unk> took the stage as the riders rolled over the packed finish line in Milan . Dario Beni soloed to victory in the seventh leg , finishing over a minute ahead of the second @-@ place finisher <unk> . The next stage was won by Lauro Bordin as Galetti extended his overall lead by a single point over Rossignoli . Ezio Corlaita won the Giro 's ninth stage , while Lucien Petit @-@ Breton took the race lead and doing so , became the first non @-@ Italian to lead the Giro d 'Italia . In the following stage , the leading breakaway contained six riders – race leader Petit @-@ Breton and five Bianchi riders – and rode into the finish in Bari together . Carlo Galetti took the stage win and the race lead , while Petit @-@ Breton finished in sixth place on the day and was pushed down to second overall . 
 The race 's penultimate day of racing was scheduled to go from Bari to Naples . During the stage , Lucien Petit @-@ Breton crashed and was forced to abandon the race . The route had the riders go through rough roads that were heavy with dust and occasional passed over streams , thus flooding the roads . The riders were also chase by enraged buffalo . All of those factors caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples , in Pompeii with Alfredo <unk> winning the day . The last stage ended back in Rome , where the race began . Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day . Bianchi 's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d 'Italia .

 = Libby ( Lost ) = 
 Libby is a fictional character on the ABC drama television series Lost , which chronicles the lives of over forty people after their plane crashes on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific . She is played by American actress Cynthia Watros . The character is first introduced as a member of the tail section survivors in the second season episode " Everybody Hates Hugo " , together with Bernard , and she ends her role as a " living character " in the episode " ? " . Reception towards the character is generally positive , especially after her death , although controversy exists due to a traffic violation by the actress that plays her . While no surname was given for the character in the show , a clip reel of deceased characters at Comic @-@ Con 2009 presented her full name as " Elizabeth Smith " . 
 Libby appeared in twenty @-@ four episodes , twenty @-@ one of them in the second season , one in the fourth , and twice in season six in " Everybody Loves Hugo " and the finale . As of the end of the third season , she is the only main character not to have a centric episode that details her past , though a brief flashback at the end of the episode " Dave " is shown from her point of view . She was supposed to return during the third season , but did not make an appearance . Her first appearance after the second season was in the fourth season episode , " Meet Kevin Johnson " . 
 = = Prior to the crash = = 
 Little is known about Libby 's life prior to the island . She states in " The Other 48 Days " that she visited Vermont , where she broke her leg in a skiing accident , and she attended medical school for a year before dropping out to become a clinical psychologist . 
 It was shown in " Live Together , Die Alone " before she ends up on the island , she meets Desmond ( played by Henry Ian Cusick ) at a café . There , she tells him that she is from Newport Beach , California , and when she learns about his intention to join a sailing race , she decides to donate her sailboat Elizabeth , a gift given to her and named after her by her late husband David . She also stayed in the Santa Rosa Mental Institution , a place whose patients include Hurley ( Jorge Garcia ) , as well as Emily Locke , John Locke 's ( Terry O 'Quinn ) mother . Prior to boarding the Oceanic flight , she intervenes during an argument between Mr. Eko ( Adewale Akinnuoye @-@ Agbaje ) and Charlotte Malkin ( Brooke Mikey Anderson ) in " ? " . 
 = = After the crash = = 
 Libby ends up in the tail @-@ section with another twenty @-@ one survivors . She immediately tries to help the injured , such as Donald ( Glenn Lehmann ) , due to her background with medicine . Some , however , including Donald , die a few days later . Within days after the crash , the Others invade their camp and kidnap all the remaining survivors except her and six others : Ana Lucia ( Michelle Rodriguez ) , Mr. Eko , Bernard ( Sam Anderson ) , Cindy ( Kimberley Joseph ) , Nathan ( Josh Randall ) , and Goodwin ( Brett Cullen ) . Paranoia soon afflicts Libby and the remaining tail @-@ section survivors causing them to speculate Nathan is not part of the flight and is an Other , which leads to his death . Eventually , she and the remaining survivors make their way to The Arrow , where they find a radio allowing them to make a brief contact with Boone ( Ian Somerhalder ) . Goodwin , the real Other , tries to steal this radio , but Ana Lucia stops and murders him . Her group stays in The Arrow until Jin ( Daniel Dae Kim ) , Michael ( Harold Perrineau ) , and Sawyer ( Josh Holloway ) arrive there in " Everybody Hates Hugo " , when her group learns about other survivors . 
 Libby 's group soon decides to leave and join the main group of survivors . But before their journey , Ana Lucia orders her and Michael to get some fruit ( " ... And Found " ) . Soon , Michael finds out , through her , where the Others are and decides to leave her in search for his son , Walt ( Malcolm David Kelley ) . Mr. Eko and Jin find Michael , leading him back to Libby and the group and allowing them to start their journey . During their trek in " Abandoned " , numerous tragedies occur , including the mysterious disappearance of Cindy and the death of Shannon ( Maggie Grace ) . Once she joins the main camp , she and Hurley start to become romantically involved , especially when she tells him that she remembers when he stepped on her foot in the plane . Aside from Hurley , Libby also becomes friends with Claire ( Emilie de Ravin ) , whom she helps in unlocking the memories of Claire 's kidnapping in " Maternity Leave " . She also tries to help out with Bernard 's S.O.S. but loses interest . In " Dave " , Libby helps Hurley solve his food addiction , but this fails when a food pallet coincidentally " falls from the sky " during a supply drop . Sensing something is wrong , she confronts him and eventually ends up on a cliff , where Hurley is about to jump . She tries to stop him , which leads to her professing her feelings for him . 
 As their relationship grows , Hurley decides to plan dates . In " Two for the Road " , he secretly plans a picnic for her but eventually confesses when he is caught with food . Once they arrive at the beach , he tells her that he forgot drinks and blankets , so she tells him to get Rose ( L. Scott Caldwell ) and Bernard 's bottle of wine while she gets the blankets . This turns out to be a fatal mistake for her , because she is accidentally shot by Michael while getting them . Hours later , Libby is found unconscious alongside a dead Ana Lucia and an injured Michael , while " Henry Gale " ( Michael Emerson ) is found to have fled . Jack ( Matthew Fox ) tries to save her but fails , so he decides to ease her pain with heroin . Once Jack has injected the drug , she stirs and says " Michael " but says nothing more . Jack assumes it is out of concern and tells her Michael is okay , but then she makes one last gasp and passes , dying with Hurley at her bedside . She is buried beside Ana Lucia , coincidentally during the reappearance of Desmond aboard the Elizabeth . Two weeks later , Hurley visits Libby 's grave and expresses how much he misses her before leaving a flower . 
 Off the island , Libby 's presence continues to haunt Michael after her death . In one scene in " Meet Kevin Johnson " , she appears to Michael in the hospital as a nurse with blankets on her stomach , representing the position she was in when she was shot . This turns out to be a dream . She even follows him in the freighter Kahana , where she tries to trick Michael into not pushing a button , which he pushes anyway . In an extended version of the Oceanic Six press conference , they say Libby was one of the eight initial survivors , but died during the first week .

 Libby is still in the mental institution in the alternate timeline . One day she sees a Mr. Cluck 's commercial with Hurley in it , and memories of her past life on the Island come flooding back to her . Later at a Mexican restaurant , Libby sees Hurley , and tells him she thinks they may be connected and be soul mates . Hurley later tracks her down , and she tells him of her visions and the fact in those visions Hurley was also in the mental institution . Hurley then invites her on a date . On the date they kiss and Hurley 's memories of the Island come flooding back to him , and he assures Libby she isn 't crazy . When the alternate time line is revealed to be a meeting place before the afterlife Libby reunites with many of the other characters in a church . She sits beside Hurley as they move on together into the afterlife . 
 = = Personality = = 
 Libby is a mysterious character , seated at the tail @-@ section of the plane . Her character was written to be in her late forties to early fifties , easy on the eyes , amicably maladjusted , and a compulsive liar so good at what she does , most people will not know she is not what she seems . Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character " is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn 't exist right now . She 's not as intense as some of the other characters . She 's that person you want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade . " 
 Libby is seen by some as a beautiful blonde " <unk> " and Hurley 's true love . She is often described as mysterious , especially since much of her backstory is yet to be revealed . IGN <unk> described her as a " loose end " in the storyline due to the contradictions between what she tells other characters and the flashbacks viewers see about her , such as her profession as a clinical psychologist and her stay at a mental institution . 
 On the show , she is often seen as helpful to other people , such as Donald , Jin , Claire , Bernard , and Desmond . One example of her exhibiting this virtue is when she assists Hurley in resolving his mental problems . Characters have often described her as a " shrink " or as a " mega cute blonde chick " due to her profession and appearance . Sawyer , meanwhile , has used the nickname " <unk> " on her due to her upbeat hippie @-@ like personality . 
 = = Development = = 
 American actress Cynthia Watros portrays Libby in around twenty @-@ one episodes of the series . Veteran actress Jennifer Jason Leigh was originally approached to play the character , but Watros ended up playing the role instead . During her audition , Watros did not think she would be cast . When she learned she had been , she was excited since she was a fan of the show and moved with her twin daughters from Los Angeles to Hawaii where Lost is filmed . 
 Libby was not originally going to be killed off , but since Ana Lucia Cortez was considered an unpopular character , the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans . They decided Libby , who was well liked , should also be killed for emotional impact . Additionally the producers and writers ran out of ideas for a compelling storyline for the character . According to Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof , the writers did try to develop her story through her romance with Hurley but they ran out of possible avenues for the character . The writers also thought her story was not as dramatic when juxtaposed with the other characters . 
 A few weeks before Libby was written out of the show , Watros and Michelle Rodriguez were arrested for driving under the influence in Kailua , Hawaii , in two separate incidents . This led fans to speculate that this was the cause of the two characters ' deaths in the episode " Two for the Road " . The producers denied this claim , and Rodriguez confirmed the producers ' comments and denied the relation between their arrests and their characters ' deaths . Watros took the news of the death of her character badly and was sad about the decision . The producers felt sorry for her and tried to help her get a new job . She was cast in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex @-@ Life , although it was not picked up by the network . 
 Libby is one of the few main characters not to have a centric episode detailing her life before the crash . The writers said a reason for killing the character was so they could explore her backstory in a mysterious and posthumous way . The producers intended to explore Libby 's backstory through flashbacks in the show 's third season , and later in the fourth season , although her character did not appear . Although she appeared in " Meet Kevin Johnson " , her backstory was not explored . In September 2008 , the writers stated her backstory would probably be explored in the fifth season ; however , Lindelof revealed in May 2009 her story would not be explored any further , saying , " I have learned that if you kill someone off the show , they are less likely to cooperate with you " . The producers said Watros was busy with other commitments , and they could not reveal Libby 's story without her . 
 It is revealed in a deleted scene Libby had been married three times prior to the plane crash and she specializes in marriage counseling . Theories about unknown aspects of her life exist , including assumptions she was once a DHARMA Initiative employee , an Other , a person planted by Desmond 's flashback characters Mrs. Hawking and Brother Campbell . Her surname was not given during the show 's run , but was later revealed as Smith during Comic @-@ Con 2009 in an in memoriam clip show of Lost 's major death scenes . 
 The producers brought the character back to the show in the second half of the final season . About the return of Libby , Cuse stated , " Finally , all of your questions [ about Libby ] will be answered " , however , Lindelof jokingly responded , " No , they will not " . Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six : " [ It was ] so sweet and honest . And I think , hopefully , when people see our scenes that they ’ ll get that feeling , too . [ Libby and Hurley ] are so incredibly real with each other . I was really grateful that I got to play those scenes and Libby got to sort of express herself in ways that she hasn ’ t been able to . "

 Libby is a well liked character . After her death , her popularity increased due to the added mystery to her character . In a poll conducted by BuddyTV about five characters seldom seen on the show , she received the highest votes . Meanwhile , her romantic fling with Hurley was described by Entertainment Weekly as " well @-@ played " and " charming " .

 = Irfan Pathan = 
 Irfan Khan Pathan ( pronunciation ; born 27 October 1984 ) is an Indian cricketer who made his debut for India in the 2003 / 04 Border @-@ Gavaskar Trophy , and was a core member of the national team until a decline in form set in during 2006 , forcing him out of the team . Since then , he has been in and out of the limited @-@ overs teams ( ODIs and T20Is ) , and has only sporadic appearances in Test cricket . Pathan played his last Test in April , 2008 at the age of 24 . 
 Beginning his career as a fast @-@ medium swing and seam bowler , Pathan broke into the national team soon after turning 19 , and evoked comparisons with Pakistan 's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing . He cemented his position in the team and was named by the International Cricket Council as the 2004 Emerging Player of the Year . Pathan was instrumental in India 's One @-@ day international and Test series wins in Pakistan in 2004 . He was described by the media as the " blue @-@ eyed boy " of the Indian cricket . In late @-@ 2004 he took 18 wickets in two Tests against Bangladesh , but the start of 2005 he performed poorly and conceded runs at a high rate , leading to a brief exile from the one @-@ day international ( ODI ) team . 
 Immediately thereafter , Australian Greg Chappell , one of the leading batsmen of his time , became India 's coach ( 2005 ) and identified Pathan 's batting potential . Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all @-@ rounder , and he opened the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match ( 10 Dec 2005 , versus Sri Lanka in Delhi ) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag . He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan . For the first nine months of Chappell 's stint at the helm , Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball , scoring runs regularly and frequently taking top @-@ order wickets . He rose to No. 2 in the ICC 's ODI rankings for all @-@ rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings . This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev . 
 In early 2006 , Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat @-@ trick in the first over of the match ( vs Pakistan at Karachi ) . However , the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006 , Pathan began to steadily lose pace and swing , and his wicket @-@ taking dwindled . Although Pathan 's batting continued to be productive , he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006 , and by 2007 was no longer in the squad . 
 He returned to international cricket in September 2007 for the inaugural World Twenty20 , where he took three wickets and was man of the match as India beat Pakistan in the final . This earned him a recall into the ODI team , where he was a regular for most of the next 12 months before being dropped as his economy rate continued to trend upwards and subsequently struggled with a loss of form and injuries . In late @-@ 2007 Pathan was also recalled into the Test team after 19 months and hit his maiden Test century , but could not maintain his place in the team as his bowling was not effective enough with only two pacemen needed . Pathan played his last Test for India in April 2008 against South Africa . He continued to perform with both bat and ball at the domestic level , although his sedate pace is frequently criticized as being irrelevant at the international level . However , he impressed during the 2011 – 12 Ranji Trophy , where he was the leading wicket @-@ taker , and his performances earned him a recall to the national side again . 
 Irfan Pathan , along with players such as Vinod Kambli and Laxman Sivaramakrishnan , was included in the list of " India 's lost boys " by Shashi Tharoor . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Pathan was born 27 October 1984 in Baroda , Gujarat , India and is of Pashtun ( Pathan ) ancestry , belonging to the Pathan community in Gujarat . He grew up with his elder brother Yusuf in a mosque in Vadodara , in an impoverished family . His father served as the muezzin . Although their parents wished them to become Islamic scholars , Pathan and his brother took an interest in cricket . Their games on the grounds off and inside the mosque often necessitated apologies from their father to Muslim worshippers who visited it . In the beginning his deliveries did not reach the other end of the cricket pitch , but rigorous six @-@ hour training sessions in blazing heat and his family 's sense of discipline saw him progress steadily . Under the guidance of former Indian captain Datta Gaekwad , Pathan rose to get selected in the Under @-@ 14 Baroda cricket team , and when he was selected at Under @-@ 15 level to represent Baroda in a national tournament , he was finally presented with a full set of cricket equipment , having before been restricted to second @-@ hand gear due to his family 's limited economic means . 
 In December 1997 , Pathan broke into the Baroda Under @-@ 16 team , less than two months after turning 13 . He took a total of 1 / 35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped immediately afterwards . He did not play again for the Under @-@ 16s for two years , and in November 1999 , less than a month after turning 15 , he made his next appearance , this time for Baroda Under @-@ 19s against Maharashtra . He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3 / 41 in a victory , but was immediately dropped back to the Under @-@ 16s for the next match , and spent the rest of the 1999 – 2000 season there . He bowled short spells in the younger division , taking four wickets at 38 @.@ 00 in six matches , averaging less than seven overs an innings . He had more success with the bat , scoring 253 runs at 31 @.@ 62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai . 
 Pathan was then selected for the India Under @-@ 15 team in mid @-@ 2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries . He took 15 wickets at 12 @.@ 66 in ten matches , including a best of 3 / 2 against Thailand , and scored 15 runs at 7 @.@ 50 . India won all but one of the matches , most by enormous margins . 
 At the start of the 2000 – 01 season , Pathan was immediately back in the Under @-@ 19s , this time bowling more , often delivering more than 20 overs per innings . In four matches , he scored 102 runs at 102 @.@ 00 including a best of 63 not out , and took 10 wickets at 32 @.@ 50 . He was then promoted to the Under @-@ 22s , where he scored 44 and took 4 / 71 in his first match against Saurashtra , prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team . 
 = = Senior beginnings = = 
 He started against Bengal in March 2001 , after fellow left @-@ arm paceman Zaheer Khan was selected for the national team . He scored 13 not out and 2 , and took 3 / 40 and 2 / 68 in a 222 @-@ run win . However , he was unable to repeat this form in the three remaining matches , taking only two more wickets in total , but Baroda nevertheless managed to win the Ranji Trophy . He ended his maiden season with seven wickets at 43 @.@ 28 and 75 runs at 12 @.@ 50 with a best score of 40 not out against Orissa . 
 The Ranji win saw Baroda qualify for the following season 's Irani Trophy where they took on the Rest of India . Pathan scored 32 in the second innings and took 3 / 95 and 1 / 34 in a defeat , but his performance reminded Test batsman V. V. S. Laxman of Zaheer . However , he was omitted from the senior team and sent back to the Under @-@ 19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months , playing eight double @-@ innings matches for Baroda . He took 20 wickets at 20 @.@ 40 , including a best of 6 / 41 against Gujarat , and scoring 190 runs at 31 @.@ 66 with a best of 63 not out . Pathan was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai , taking 1 / 69 from nine overs . Pathan further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai , after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More . 
 In early @-@ 2002 , he was selected for the Under @-@ 19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand , where he took six wickets at 27 @.@ 50 and scored 30 runs at 15 @.@ 00 , taking 2 / 18 in a win over South Africa . 
 Upon returning to India , Pathan was selected in a senior zonal team for the first time . He was selected for West Zone for the Duleep Trophy , even though he had not played a single match for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy season . He immediately repaid the selectors ' faith by taking 4 / 74 and 6 / 72 , his first ten @-@ wicket match haul , in the first fixture against Central Zone , setting up a 161 @-@ run win . In the next match , he took 4 / 72 and 3 / 85 as West defeated North by 178 runs . He only took 1 / 55 in the next match against South but West were through to the final , where he took 4 / 43 to help cut down East Zone for 162 in the first innings , sealing the title . In all Pathan , had taken 22 wickets at 18 @.@ 22 for the tournament , and scored 46 runs at 11 @.@ 50 . 
 These performances propelled Pathan into the India A team at the age of 17 and a half , for a tour of Sri Lanka , where he took six wickets at 35 @.@ 00 in three first @-@ class matches . Pathan then went on an India Under @-@ 19 tour of England in mid @-@ 2002 . He took 15 wickets at 25 @.@ 93 in the three youth Tests , which India lost 1 – 0 , with a best of 4 / 83 in the Second Test . He then took four wickets at 42 @.@ 00 , conceding more than six runs an over , and scored 66 runs at 33 @.@ 00 in the three youth ODIs , which India won 2 – 1 . 
 Pathan was rewarded with selection in the Rest of India team that played against Railways in the Irani Trophy at the start of the 2002 – 03 season . He took a total of 2 / 84 and scored 29 as the Ranji champions prevailed . He struggled in the Ranji Trophy , taking 18 wickets at 39 @.@ 33 in seven matches . Half of his wickets came in one match against Orissa in which he claimed 6 / 31 and 3 / 46 in an innings victory . He scored 161 runs at 23 @.@ 00 , with a 54 against Tamil Nadu being his maiden first @-@ class fifty , as well as two other forties . Despite a lack of wickets for Baroda , Pathan was selected for the Duleep Trophy , playing for Elite Group A. He took 5 / 88 and 4 / 106 against Plate Group A and 4 / 101 against Elite Group C , before taking 3 / 53 and 2 / 42 as Elite Group A defeated Elite Group B in the final by seven wickets . Pathan ended the tournament with 19 wickets at 27 @.@ 00 and scored 72 runs at 24 @.@ 00 . In the one @-@ dayers , Pathan also struggled for Baroda , taking three wickets at 64 @.@ 66 in four matches at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 85 , but he was nevertheless selected for the zonal team , where he took four wickets at 34 @.@ 25 in four matches at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 91 . 
 In 2003 he was selected for the India A team which travelled to England . Playing in five first @-@ class matches , Pathan took nine wickets at 43 @.@ 77 , including 4 / 60 against Yorkshire and 3 / 83 against South Africa . He managed only 8 runs at 4 @.@ 00 with the bat . He had more success in the limited @-@ overs matches , taking eight wickets at 11 @.@ 12 in three matches , including a 4 / 19 against Lancashire , and scoring 27 runs at 27 @.@ 00 . 
 At the start of the 2003 – 04 season , Pathan played in the domestic Challenger Trophy for the first time . Representing India A , he had little success , taking two wickets at 79 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 85 , and he did not force his way into India 's limited @-@ overs team . He was then selected for India Emerging Players for a series of limited @-@ overs matches against counterparts from Pakistan and Sri Lanka . Pathan took seven wickets at 11 @.@ 00 in three matches , including 4 / 22 and 3 / 35 in two matches against Pakistan . 
 In late 2003 , he was selected for the India Under @-@ 19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan , where he was the leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7 @.@ 38 , with an economy rate of 3 @.@ 54 . This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket @-@ taker . He was named as the player of the tournament , which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final . Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9 / 16 against Bangladesh , helping to bowl them out for 34 , and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final , taking 3 / 33 . Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31 @.@ 33 with the bat , compiling scores of 32 , 28 and 34 . Pathan returned to India and took 3 / 51 and 1 / 33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season , against Andhra Pradesh . This resulted in him being selected for the Indian national squad for the 2003 – 04 Border @-@ Gavaskar Trophy Test series in Australia . 
 = = Early international career ( 2003 – 2005 ) = = 
 Pathan made his Test debut in the Second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in December 2003 . At the age of 19 , he opened the bowling following an injury to the Baroda left @-@ armer Zaheer Khan in the First Test . In a high scoring match , he took the wicket of Matthew Hayden while giving away 160 runs at almost five runs an over . He scored one in his only innings as India took a four @-@ wicket victory . He was dropped for the following Test upon the return of Zaheer , but was recalled for the Fourth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Zaheer broke down in his only spell in the Third Test . On another flat pitch , Pathan took the wickets of Steve Waugh , Adam Gilchrist in the first innings in a spell of reverse swing bowling . He had Waugh caught behind from an outswinger and then bowled Gilchrist with an <unk> yorker . He ended with 2 / 80 in the first innings and dismissed Ricky Ponting in the second innings to end with match figures of 3 / 106 . 
 In the ODI tri @-@ nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed , Pathan was the leading wicket @-@ taker with 16 wickets at an average of 31 in his maiden ODI series . After ending with 0 / 61 from ten overs on debut against Australia , he bounced back to take 3 / 64 and 3 / 51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders . He earned his first international man of the match award in the tournament , after taking 4 / 24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI . However , his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final . In that match , he took 2 / 75 as Australia amassed 5 / 359 and crushed India by 208 runs . Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151 . His batting improved towards the end of the tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings , and he ended with 86 runs at 17 @.@ 20 for the tournament . 
 Pathan subsequently led the pace attack again on the 2004 Test tour to Pakistan , taking 12 wickets and bowling a higher proportion of maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India 's first series victory over Pakistan in two decades . In the first innings , he bowled 28 overs and took 4 / 100 to help India restrict their arch @-@ rivals to 407 and take a 268 @-@ run lead . After stand @-@ in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on , Pathan tied the Pakistanis down , bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2 / 26 as India secured an innings win . Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order , helping India to recover to 287 . However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3 / 107 , and the hosts went on to complete a nine @-@ wicket win . In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi , Pathan took 2 / 49 and 1 / 35 in an innings win . He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28 @.@ 50 and 64 runs at 21 @.@ 33 . 
 He also continued his prolific wicket @-@ taking in the ODIs , taking eight wickets at 17 @.@ 87 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 76 in three matches , including three top @-@ order wickets in the deciding fifth ODI in Lahore . He also scored 36 runs at 36 @.@ 00 in the ODIs . His ability to swing the ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation that he could become an all rounder . In recognition of his performances at the start of his international career , Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004 . 
 Pathan continued his productive form in ODIs at the 2004 Asian Cup in Sri Lanka , where he was the leading wicket @-@ taker with 14 wickets at 16 @.@ 28 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 37 in six matches , with three three @-@ wicket hauls against the United Arab Emirates , Bangladesh and Pakistan respectively . He also scored 64 runs at 32 @.@ 00 including a 38 in a defeat against Pakistan . 
 He then struggled during an ODI tour in Europe , taking three wickets at 78 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 48 from five matches . India won only one of these games and lost four . Pathan returned to form during India 's brief campaign at the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in England , where he claimed 5 wickets at an average of 9 @.@ 00 and economy rate of 3 @.@ 00 . He took 2 / 11 against Kenya and 3 / 34 against Pakistan , but defeat at the hands of the latter ended India 's campaign . 
 Returning to India , Pathan then represented his country at the highest level for the first time on home soil . Pathan continued to improve his batting with a defiant 31 and 55 against Australia in October 2004 in the First Test in Bangalore . This was his first half @-@ century in Tests , and was scored after the specialist batsmen had failed . Nevertheless , he managed a total of only 2 / 100 and India fell to a 217 @-@ run loss . Pathan 's career was put on hold after he suffered a side strain in the following Test in Chennai , in which he totalled 0 / 68 , causing him to miss the Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai . Australia went on to take the series 2 – 1 and Pathan ended with two wickets at 84 @.@ 00 and 100 runs at 33 @.@ 33 . After being overlooked for the First Test with selectors opting for three spinners , he returned in the Second Test against South Africa in Kolkata , aggregating 3 / 89 and scoring 24 in an eight @-@ wicket win that sealed a 1 – 0 series win . 
 Pathan made his name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh . Swinging the ball both ways , Pathan took 5 / 45 and 6 / 51 including several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten @-@ wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory . He followed this with a match haul of 7 / 118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11 @.@ 88 to be named as man of the series . India swept the series , winning both matches by an innings . Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily , Pathan managed only five and four . He played in only one of the three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players , taking 1 / 45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11 @-@ run win . 
 In late 2004 , the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced central contracts for international players for the first time , and Pathan was given a B @-@ grade contract . 2005 began rather poorly for Pathan . He took only six wickets at 68 @.@ 33 in the home Test series against Pakistan after losing pace and accuracy . In the last two matches , he managed totals of 2 / 122 and 1 / 160 , conceding more than four runs an over as the Pakistani batsmen scored heavily . He scored 64 runs at 16 @.@ 00 and made a duck in the second innings of the Third Test as the hosts collapsed on the last day to squander the series 1 – 1 . 
 He was subsequently dropped for the ODI series , playing in only one match in which he conceded 67 runs without picking up a wicket in 8 overs . However , he did manage to post his first ODI half @-@ century , scoring 64 , defiantly holding up his end as India were bowled out for 213 , sealing a 106 @-@ run loss . Greg Chappell became the coach of the Indian team following the Pakistan series and identified Pathan as a potential all @-@ rounder . He started to hone Pathan 's batting skills , which had up to this point yielded 275 Test runs at 19 @.@ 64 . Pathan was subsequently signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season , where he attempted to regain his form after his bad start to the year . Pathan arrived in late @-@ May and stayed for six weeks . He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series , taking six wickets at 24 @.@ 66 and an economy rate of 5 @.@ 41 in four one @-@ dayers , including 3 / 42 against Essex . In the new Twenty20 format , Pathan took 12 wickets at 12 @.@ 75 and an economy rate of 6 @.@ 37 in seven matches , including a best of 4 / 27 against Essex . He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31 @-@ run win . However , his difficulties in first @-@ class matches continued . He took 4 / 81 and 1 / 68 , and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex , and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out . However , he failed to take another wicket and ended with five wickets at 64 @.@ 80 and 126 runs at 63 @.@ 00 , scoring 68 against Surrey . 
 = = Chappell era ( 2005 – 2007 ) = = 
 Pathan was recalled to the ODI team for the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August . This was Chappell 's first series as a coach , in which Pathan played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33 @.@ 83 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 41 , but conceded 0 / 59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final . He scored 58 runs at 29 @.@ 00 including an unbeaten 36 after India 's batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match . 
 He showed further signs of returning to peak form in the Videocon Triangular Series in Zimbabwe , taking 10 wickets at 16 @.@ 10 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 03 and scored 60 runs at 30 @.@ 00 in four matches . This included a haul of 3 / 34 and then a score of 50 as India collapsed to 164 all out and a 51 @-@ run loss to New Zealand . In another match , he took his ODI career best of 5 / 27 against Zimbabwe in Harare as the hosts fell for 65 . Despite his overall good form , Pathan was punished by the New Zealanders in the final , conceding 40 runs in five wicketless overs as India lost their second successive final . He was subsequently the leading wicket @-@ taker as India took a 2 – 0 clean sweep of an away Test series against Zimbabwe . In the First Test in Bulawayo , Pathan took 5 / 58 and 4 / 53 as well as scoring 52 in a man of the match performance to help India to an innings victory . He followed this with a 7 / 59 haul , his Test career best innings haul , and 5 / 67 in the final Test in Harare , his second ten @-@ wicket match haul to set up a ten wicket victory , having also scored 32 in the first innings . He was again named man of the match , and his 21 wickets at 11 @.@ 29 runs saw him named man of the series . This made him only the third bowler after Anil Kumble and Johnny Briggs to take 21 wickets in a two @-@ match series . 
 Upon the team 's return to India , Chappell experimented with Pathan by using him as an opening batsman in the Challenger Trophy prior to the late 2005 series against Sri Lankan cricket team . This yielded only moderate success with scores of 28 and 11 not out . Pathan took six wickets at 29 @.@ 16 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 17 . Pathan was subsequently used at No. 3 in the batting line @-@ up in the First ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur , where he scored 83 runs from 70 balls to help India post a total of 6 / 350 . Pathan also took 4 / 37 and 3 / 38 in the second and seventh matches at Mohali and Baroda respectively to win two @-@ man of the match awards , taking ten wickets at 25 @.@ 60 at ane economy rate of 5 @.@ 22 for the whole series . He added a 35 in the final match and ended the series with 118 runs at 39 @.@ 33 , playing <unk> role in India 's 6 – 1 triumph . Pathan continued his strong ODI form with another man of the match performance of 3 / 23 and a knock of 37 runs against South Africa in the second ODI in Bangalore , having scored 46 in the middle @-@ order in the first match after a top @-@ order collapse . He ended the series with six wickets at 20 @.@ 33 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 69 and 83 runs at 27 @.@ 66 . 
 After scoring two consecutive ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka , Pathan was elevated to opening in the second innings of the Second Test in Delhi , after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness . Having taken 3 / 34 from 22 overs in the first innings , Pathan scored 93 runs , building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436 . In the following match in Ahmedabad , he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall during the first half of the opening day . He also took seven wickets at an average of 26 @.@ 00 runs in the series , which India won 2 – 0 . Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century . Following his strong performances in 2005 , Pathan was promoted in December to an A @-@ grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India . 
 Pathan had another difficult start to the new year in 2006 on the Test tour to Pakistan . In the first two Test matches played on flat surfaces in Lahore and Faisalabad , he had little success against the Pakistani batsmen , taking a total of two wickets while conceding 319 runs at more than four runs an over . After not getting an opportunity in the First Test — India lost only one wicket — Pathan made use of the good batting conditions himself and scored 90 in a double century partnership with wicket @-@ keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Faisalabad . Pathan found success with the ball in the Third Test in Karachi , when on 29 January , he became the first person to claim a hat @-@ trick in the first over of a Test match — the first five minutes of a match scheduled for 30 hours — and the first Indian to take a hat @-@ trick in an away Test . It was also the highest in terms of total averages of the batsmen dismissed ( 130 @.@ 18 : Salman Butt 34 @.@ 27 , Younis Khan 46 @.@ 04 , Mohammad Yousuf 49 @.@ 86 ) and came after 1783 Tests in the history of cricket . He had Butt caught by Dravid in the slips from an outswinger , before trapping Younis leg before wicket and bowling Yousuf , both with inswingers . He finished with a haul of 5 / 61 after the hosts staged a lower @-@ order counter @-@ attack but was punished in the second innings , taking 1 wicket while conceding 106 runs as Pakistan set a target which was beyond India 's reach . Pathan ended the series with 134 runs at 44 @.@ 66 and took eight wickets at 60 @.@ 75 . Despite his Test travails , Pathan continued to perform strongly in the ODI arena , scoring 65 in the top order in the first ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar before making three consecutive three wicket hauls in the following matches . This included a man of the match performance that included a haul of 3 wickets for 43 runs at Rawalpindi as he claimed nine wickets at 18 @.@ 88 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 49 for the series . Having taken an unassailable 3 – 1 lead , India rested Pathan for the final match . 
 Pathan had a quiet series against England following his return to India , taking 8 wickets at an average of 39 @.@ 37 runs and scoring 121 runs at an average of 24 @.@ 20 runs in three Tests . Pathan scored 52 in the first innings of the Second Test in Mohali , helping India to a first @-@ innings lead and eventually a nine @-@ wicket win . In the Third Test , Pathan managed only 1 / 84 in total and scored 26 and 6 as they collapsed on the final day and ceded their series lead . Again his ODI form was unaffected , taking eleven wickets at 15 @.@ 63 in five matches , and scoring 123 runs at 41 @.@ 00 with the bat as India easily claimed the series 5 – 1 . Pathan scored 28 and then took 3 / 21 in a low @-@ scoring 29 @-@ win in the first match , before scoring 36 and taking 4 / 51 in the third match in Goa . India then took an unassailable 4 – 0 lead by winning the fourth match , in which Pathan took 1 / 27 before scoring 46 in the run @-@ chase . 
 = = International omission = = 
 Pathan began to suffer a loss of form during the tour of the West Indies in May 2006 , when he managed only 24 runs at 6 @.@ 00 and took 6 wickets at 29 @.@ 83 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 59 while bowling in the ODI arena as India lost the series 4 – 1 . After a poor display in a tour match , in which he was hit for 70 runs in 12 overs and appeared jaded , he was dropped from the Test team as V. R. V. Singh became the third place bowler and captain Rahul Dravid scrapped the five bowler strategy . Pathan only played once in the Second Test , after Sreesanth was sidelined due to injury . He scored 19 and took 1 / 43 and 1 / 50 as India enforced the follow on but the hosts hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand . India then selected two spinners in the last two Tests , and Pathan could not gain one of the two pace positions . Chappell stated that Pathan was fatigued and had been overworked but was confident that Pathan " would recover from his slump and rise to further heights " , asserting that he was still young and learning . Former India paceman Javagal Srinath expressed concern about Pathan 's dwindling pace , but expressed that swing was the first priority in backing Pathan 's return to international cricket . 
 These concerns were further magnified in late 2006 , when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs in the first two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia . Despite scoring 64 in the top @-@ order in the first of these matches against the West Indies , Pathan was dropped for the rest of the tournament . He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15 @.@ 80 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 64 and scored 95 runs at 31 @.@ 66 in three matches . 
 Pathan was then demoted from the position of an opening bowler in ODIs during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy ; he took four wickets at 24 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 80 , and scored only 29 runs at 9 @.@ 66 , as India were knocked out in the first round . Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late @-@ 2006 tour to South Africa . Playing in three of the five matches , he took a solitary wicket at 136 @.@ 00 , conceding 7 @.@ 15 runs per over , the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match ; they were whitewashed by the hosts . 
 Since the West Indies tour in May 2006 , Pathan had only been taking wickets at 41 @.@ 33 . He subsequently fell out of the Top 10 of the ICC bowling rankings and the Top 5 of the All rounder rankings after having spent the previous year on the list . Despite this , Indian captain Rahul Dravid remained optimistic about Pathan 's prospects , stating " The number of Man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Matches that Irfan has won is a testimony to the fact that he 's a proven matchwinner for us . He takes wickets early , contributes with the bat , is good in the field . " Despite top scoring in both innings of a first @-@ class warm @-@ up match in Potchefstroom , scoring 111 not out and 40 not out whilst many specialist batsmen failed to cope with the bouncy conditions , he totalled only 1 / 49 from eight overs with the ball and was overlooked by the selectors for the First Test in Johannesburg . This indicated that although he had scored 560 runs at 35 @.@ 00 under Chappell 's coaching , they saw bowling , which had been steadily declining , as his primary responsibility . After a poor bowling display in the subsequent tour match in which he conceded 74 runs in only 11 overs , Pathan became the first player to be sent home by the BCCI during a tour for poor performance rather than indiscipline . It was later revealed by Kiran More that it was a mutual agreement so that Pathan could play for Baroda in the final two rounds of Ranji Trophy in an attempt to regain form via match practice instead of watching the final two Tests from the sidelines . He subsequently led Baroda to the semi @-@ finals after scoring 82 * to help defeat Uttar Pradesh by five wickets , but his bowling remained ineffective , returning figures of 2 / 108 and 1 / 59 , conceding 4 @.@ 77 runs per over . Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar attributed Pathan 's situation to mismanagement , asserting that Pathan has been " messed about " as well as insinuating foul play . Pathan 's fortunes improved in the next two matches , totalling 5 / 92 and 7 / 96 against Tamil Nadu and Mumbai respectively . 
 Pathan was initially dropped for the ODI series hosted by India against the West Indies , but was recalled for the final match in his home town after claiming seven wickets against Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi @-@ final . His performance was regarded as lacklustre , taking 1 / 43 from seven overs . The selectors persisted and named him in the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , but injury stopped him from playing in the ODI series against Sri Lanka , denying him an opportunity to regain form . Pathan on his return took two wickets of the overs which he <unk> had an impressive start as he took the wicket of <unk> Simons as a Leg Before Wicket . 
 After taking 1 / 12 and 3 / 25 in warm @-@ up matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in the Caribbean , Pathan did not play a match at the World Cup , and was among a group of players to be dropped from the squad following India 's exit from the first round . He played no part in the tours of Bangladesh and England . Instead , he was sent on an India A tour of Africa . Two years after devastating the Zimbabwean batsmen , he played against a Zimbabwe Select XI , he took only six wickets at 30 @.@ 16 in two matches , and then took eight wickets at 18 @.@ 12 in two matches against Kenya . India won all four matches , and Pathan scored 87 runs at 21 @.@ 75 . Pathan then took six wickets at 23 @.@ 83 and scored 93 runs at 31 @.@ 00 in four one @-@ dayers . 
 = = International comeback = = 
 With India 's older players opting out of the inaugural World Twenty20 , Pathan was one of several younger players to regain national selection . India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides . In the first match , he scored 20 and took 2 / 20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round , before winning in a bowl @-@ out . He then took 0 / 16 from two <unk> as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3 / 37 in a defeat of England . India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi @-@ final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs , helping to restrict the hosts to 9 / 116 in pursuit of 154 . Pathan then took 2 / 44 , removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15 @-@ run win to reach the finals . India faced arch @-@ rivals Pakistan in the final . Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3 / 16 , including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big @-@ hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls , before later bowling Yasir Arafat . 
 As a result of his performances in South Africa , Pathan was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007 . He played in all 12 matches , seven against Australia and five against Pakistan . Pathan scored 131 runs at 18 @.@ 71 in the lower @-@ order and took 12 wickets at 46 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 02 , averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics . It was a steady performance ; Pathan never took more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4 @.@ 60 and 6 @.@ 66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan . 
 With India opting to field two spinners and two pacemen on turning tracks in the home Test series against Pakistan in late 2007 , Pathan missed the first two Tests as Zaheer and Rudra Pratap Singh were the fast bowlers chosen . In the meantime , he took 11 wickets at 23 @.@ 81 and scored 90 runs at 30 @.@ 00 in two Ranji Trophy matches . Injury to both Zaheer and Singh in his colleagues resulted in his recall for the Third Test at Bangalore . Pathan scored his maiden Test century , reaching the mark with a six from leg spinner Danish <unk> to move from 96 to 102 with only last man , paceman Ishant Sharma left to accompany him , before holing out in the same over . He made 21 not out in the second innings but was unpenetrative with the ball , taking a total of 1 / 110 as the tourists hung on for a draw . 
 Pathan gained selection for the 2007 – 08 tour of Australia , but did not play in the first two Tests with only two pacemen chosen . Zaheer and Singh were the first @-@ choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant , who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test . With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth , Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh . He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively . His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day . After entering at the fall of the first wicket , he batted for more than two hours and was the sixth man to fall . Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball , taking 2 / 63 and 3 / 54 , including both Australian openers in each innings , having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored . He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw . India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award . 
 After his batting displays in Perth , Pathan was promoted to open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide , replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five @-@ bowler attack . In a high @-@ scoring match , Pathan took 3 / 112 , but he struggled with the responsibility of opening , scoring nine and a duck . In a high @-@ scoring match , he took 3 / 112 in Australia 's <unk> the Test series , he top @-@ scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one @-@ off T20 international . Pathan held his place in the ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy , scoring 118 runs at 19 @.@ 66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34 @.@ 27 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 49 . His best performance was a 4 / 41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50 @-@ run loss . His top @-@ score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run @-@ chase against Sri Lanka . Pathan struggled in the two finals against Australia , taking three wickets at 39 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 7 @.@ 46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2 – 0 win . An extra bowler backfired as the batsmen struggled . Pathan top @-@ scored with 21 * in India 's first innings of 76 on the first morning and was again unbeaten in the second innings with 43 . However , he failed to take a wicket and conceded 85 runs in only 21 @.@ 2 overs in an innings defeat , and was omitted from the next Test . After the South Africa series , Pathan participated in the 2008 Indian Premier League , having been purchased by the Kings XI Punjab . 
 He took 15 wickets at 23 @.@ 33 at the economy rate of 6 @.@ 60 runs per over . His most effective performance came when he added an unbeaten 24 and took 2 / 18 from his four overs to help Punjab to a nine @-@ run win over the Kolkata Knight Riders . He scored 131 runs at 21 @.@ 83 and added 40 in a failed run @-@ chase against Chennai Super Kings .

 Following the IPL , Pathan resumed international duties in the <unk> Cup and the 2008 Asia Cup . He had an unproductive time with the ball ; although he scored a total of 86 runs at 28 @.@ 66 , he took seven wickets at 51 @.@ 42 at an economy rate of 6 @.@ 56 . Pathan was overlooked for the Tests in Sri Lanka but was called into the team for the one @-@ dayers , but played in only three of the five fixtures . He took three wickets at 34 @.@ 66 , conceding 5 @.@ 20 runs an over , and struggled with the bat , scoring 19 runs at 6 @.@ 33 as the Indian batting collapsed in each match . He was then included in an India A team for a series of matches against touring counterparts from New Zealand and Australia . He had average results , taking four wickets at 43 @.@ 75 and an economy rate of 4 @.@ 86 , and scored 56 runs at 18 @.@ 66 in four games . He did better the Challenger Trophy , taking six wickets at 14 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 42 , and scored 71 runs at 35 @.@ 50 as India Blue won all three matches . 
 At the start of the first @-@ class season , Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1 / 91 for the Board President 's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series , and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen . He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy . He played in four matches and performed strongly , taking 26 wickets at 16 @.@ 03 and scored 166 runs at 33 @.@ 20 . He started the season with 6 / 85 and 1 / 34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh , and then took 4 / 42 and 1 / 46 against Railways . He then put on an all @-@ round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra . Pathan took 5 / 64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77 @-@ run lead . After taking 1 / 61 in the second innings , he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand . In his final Ranji fixture for the season , he took 7 / 35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77 , setting up an innings win . However , with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy , Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England . Pathan 's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty . Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs , he was not given a game in the seven @-@ match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4 – 0 series lead . He took 0 / 57 from ten overs in the fifth match , as India recorded another victory , but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled . Pathan was then selected for the early @-@ 2009 five @-@ match ODI tour of Sri Lanka , but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3 – 0 lead . He took four wickets at 28 @.@ 25 in two matches , but was again expensive , conceding 7 @.@ 06 runs an over . However , he ended the tour on a high note when he combined with half @-@ brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth @-@ wicket stand that saw India to a three @-@ wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry ; Irfan ended on 33 not out . Pathan returned to India and took 3 / 50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one @-@ dayer for Baroda during the season , which ended in a win , before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand . 
 Pathan had a poor time in New Zealand . In the two T20 internationals preceding the ODIs , he took 0 / 38 and 2 / 41 , conceding his runs at an alarming economy rate of 11 @.@ 28 . He was left out of all five ODIs during the tour before heading home . He then played in all 14 of Punjab 's round @-@ robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa , taking 17 wickets at 22 @.@ 94 with an economy rate of 7 @.@ 74 , and scored 196 runs at 19 @.@ 60 . He started strongly , taking nine wickets in four matches in the early stages of the tournament , before taking only two in the next five matches , and ending with six in the last three fixtures . Punjab failed to make the semi @-@ finals . 
 Pathan 's performances in the IPL were enough for him to retain his position in the national T20 team after his performances in New Zealand , and he then proceeded to the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England in June , where India were seeking to defend their title . He struggled in the warm @-@ up matches , totalling 1 / 49 in five overs , and again in the first round of matches , bowling five overs and conceding 42 runs without success . Nevertheless , India defeated both Bangladesh and Ireland to move into the next round . He took 1 / 9 from two overs in the loss to the West Indies in the Super 8 round , and was left out for the remaining two matches , which India lost to be eliminated . 
 Since then , Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team and was then injured for an extended period , until he made his return to cricket in the Ranji Trophy in November . He played in six matches for Baroda as captain and was successful with both bat and ball , scoring 397 runs at 49 @.@ 62 and taking 22 wickets at 18 @.@ 54 . In his most productive first @-@ class season with the bat , Pathan made starts in eight of his nine innings , only failing to reach 24 once , and scoring four fifties , although he was unable to convert any to triple figures . In his fourth match of the season , Pathan top @-@ scored in both innings with 68 and 81 as Baroda lost to Karnataka by an innings after making 153 and 223 . He then took a total of 7 / 76 and scored 65 not out to secure a seven @-@ wicket win over Saurashtra , and then totalled 7 / 96 in a seven @-@ wicket triumph over Maharashtra . However , these performances were not enough to earn Pathan a Test recall . Furthermore , on 25 February 2010 the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) announced its list of 30 probables for the T20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies , the most notable omission being Irfan Pathan . 
 Pathan took 5 / 100 in the first innings of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone . His fifth wicket brought up his 300th scalp at first @-@ class level . After cricket was engulfed in a series of corruption scandals in September 2010 , Pathan told the media that he had received " three expensive gifts in his room " and , later , two further gifts that he could not afford . Pathan reported this to the team management as he thought the gifts might be from a bookmaker .

 GHV2 ( an abbreviation of Greatest Hits Volume 2 ) is the second greatest hits album by American recording artist Madonna . Maverick and Warner Bros. Records released it on November 12 , 2001 , coinciding with the video album , Drowned World Tour 2001 . A follow @-@ up to The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) , GHV2 contains a collection of singles during the second decade of Madonna 's career . Madonna mentioned that she only included " songs that I could listen to five times in a row " on it . The album did not contain any new songs , but a promotional single , " GHV2 Megamix " , was released to promote it , with remixes by Thunderpuss , John Rocks & Mac Quayle and Tracy Young . Another promotional remix album was released alongside , titled GHV2 Remixed : The Best of 1991 – 2001 . 
 GHV2 received generally positive reviews from music critics , who deemed it as an essential compilation , although some criticized the absence of new material . Commercially , the compilation was successful , peaking at number seven on the US Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Elsewhere , GHV2 also attained success , reaching the top five in Australia , Germany , the United Kingdom and several other European countries . It was the 14th best @-@ selling album of the year and has sold more than seven million units worldwide . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In early September 2001 , media reported that Madonna had recorded two songs , " Sex Makes the World Go Round " and " Veronica Electronica " , to be included on the forthcoming greatest hits album . The last title was from an unreleased remix album in collaboration with William Orbit . It was also reported that the album would be titled The Immaculate Collection 2 . However , both the title and new songs rumors were proven false . After the final show of Madonna 's Drowned World Tour on September 15 , 2001 , MTV News confirmed that the singer had planned to release a greatest hits album in November 2001 . On October 4 , 2001 , Maverick Records eventually announced the track list of GHV2 as well as its official release date . The album coincided with the release of the DVD / VHS video album of the tour . 
 A sequel to her first greatest hits album , The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) , GHV2 included fifteen singles released during Madonna 's second decade in the recording industry , starting from " Erotica " ( 1992 ) to " What It Feels Like for a Girl " ( 2001 ) . Unlike the former release , GHV2 did not feature any new material . In an interview with BBC 's Jo Whiley , Madonna spoke about the selection of the tracks , " I only wanted songs that I could listen to five times in a row . " She also added that " If you listen to the record , you can really see my evolution as a singer , songwriter , and , more important , a human being . " Madonna felt that because it was a " greatest hits " , it should only contain previously released hit songs . In an interview with MSN she clarified , " Because [ GHV2 is ] my greatest hits . New songs would be false advertising because if it 's a new song , it wouldn 't be considered a greatest hit . That 's a little presumptuous isn 't it ? " Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album . Despite being a worldwide number @-@ one hit in 2000 , " American Pie " was also excluded because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album , Music ( 2000 ) . " It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing , but it didn 't belong on the album so now it 's being punished ... My gut told me not to [ put the song on Music ] , but I did it and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn 't deserve a place on GHV2 . " she said . Other notable exclusion were " This Used to Be My Playground " , " Rain " , " I 'll Remember " and " You 'll See " — all of which had been included on her ballads compilation Something to Remember ( 1995 ) . 
 The album was originally titled Greatest Hits : The Second Coming , but Madonna decided to name it change the name to GHV2 just before it was released as " it 's a title you will remember " and also because of " laziness " , due to the fact that she had just finished the Drowned World Tour and was about to begin filming Swept Away ( 2002 ) . The cover picture is from a 2001 photo shoot for InStyle magazine , by Regan Cameron . It was revealed through Madonna 's official website , on October 18 , 2001 . Cameron recalled that they had been given the assignment of shooting Madonna for InStyle and he was nervous . It was shot at <unk> Studios in Los Angeles and he tried out first with a polaroid . Madonna approved of it and continued shooting , took direction from him and was present throughout the day for trying out different pictures . Two of the pictures from the session were used by Madonna , first one showing her with finger on her lips as a promotional photo for the HBO debut of her Drowned World Tour video , and another one showing her with hair in front of her right eye for GHV2 . Cameron also contributed artwork to the inner sleeve , which features 600 photographs of Madonna . " GHV2 " can also be seen on the cover picture on Madonna 's eye . The sleeves also contains Japanese lettering ( <unk> ) , which is the result of typing the letters ' M @-@ A @-@ D @-@ O @-@ N @-@ N @-@ A ' on an English keyboard but with the keys re @-@ mapped to their positions on a Japanese kana keyboard . It is pronounced as " Mo @-@ <unk> @-@ Ji @-@ Ra @-@ Mi @-@ Mi @-@ <unk> " . 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 In order to promote the album , Madonna 's recording company Warner Bros. spent £ 1 million ( £ 1 @.@ 49 million in 2016 dollars ) on its promotion , to generate excitement in the album without the support of media interviews or TV performances , as Madonna was in Malta filming Swept Away . A company executive said , " There will be no Top of the Pops appearance or interview on Radio One or in Q magazine this time so we want the unusual name to get people thinking about the association between Madonna and GHV2 " and to generate extra media interest to compensate for the artist 's unavailability to promote the release at the time . <unk> , in December , Madonna made an appearance at the 2001 Turner Prize award ceremony and mentioned that she " had a new record in stores called GHV2 " . 
 Madonna 's company Maverick Records sent a promotional megamix titled " GHV2 Megamix " to radio stations in order to promote the compilation , on October 29 , 2001 . However , it was limited to airplay , and was never released commercially nor included on GHV2 . The songs featured , in chronological order , were " Don 't Tell Me " , " Erotica " , " Secret " , " Frozen " , " What It Feels Like for a Girl " , " Take a Bow " , " Deeper and Deeper " , " Music " and " Ray of Light " . Remixes were produced by Thunderpuss , Johnny Rocks & Mac Quayle and Tracy Young . Chris Cox from Thunderpuss explained , " Basically , they were dong the greatest @-@ hits album ... and so they approached actually a couple of different remix entities to take a stab at doing a megamix , and it was kind of a cattle call , actually . They basically liked ours the best and so they put it out . " The remix peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001 . The " GHV2 Megamix " ' s accompanying music video , directed by <unk> Gonzalez of Veneno Inc . , was compiled of images of Madonna 's live performances and previous music videos and premiered on November 2 , 2001 , through Total Request Live ( TRL ) and MTV 's website . Chuck Taylor from Billboard complimented the remix , saying that " its quite a trip down 80s memory lane from an artist whose continually evolving body of work stands strong — even when summarized in this novel context . " 
 In December 20 , 2001 , Maverick Records also released a promotional album GHV2 Remixed : The Best of 1991 – 2001 , featuring remixed versions of tracks from GHV2 , except " Take a Bow " , " Don 't Cry for Me Argentina " , and " The Power of Good @-@ Bye " . Like the promotional megamix single release , it was not made commercially available . Remixes were done by Victor Calderone , Junior Vasquez , BT , Sasha , Timo Maas , and Hex Hector . MTV France listed the remixes on their website for streaming . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The compilation received generally positive reviews from music critics . Music journalist Robert Christgau gave a positive review , stating that Madonna " gleans goodies from the overrated Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light , mixes in the glorious soundtrack @-@ only ' Beautiful Stranger ' and the dismal soundtrack @-@ only ' Don 't Cry for Me Argentina ' , and hands it all over to Mirwais for sonic tweaking I 'm not interested enough to pin down " , while calling it as " an essential package " . A writer from the South Wales Echo gave a positive review , saying that GHV2 is " an essential pop album " and " truly immaculate " . MusicOMH 's Michael Hubbard complimented the inclusion of " Don 't Cry For Me Argentina " from Evita and " Beautiful Stranger " from the Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me , saying that they " are worthy inclusions ... compiling this collection didn 't require much imagination , the end result does the job — the CD is exactly what it says on the tin . " 
 John Aizlewood from The Guardian gave the compilation four out of five stars , stating : " GHV2 is sufficiently confident to avoid remixes or new tracks . Desperate times , however , call for desperate measures " . Ian Wade from Dotmusic positively reviewed the compilation saying , " Had ' GHV2 ' been released before 1998 , it would 've been a not much fun bunch of ballads and <unk> . Thankfully , for the sake of herself , her fans and mankind in general , Madge had a bit of re @-@ think . [ ... ] GHV2 contains some of the best pop music made by anybody " , although he criticized the omission of some singles like " Nothing Really Matters " or " Rain " . Cristine Leach from Raidió Teilifís Éireann gave the compilation 4 out of 5 stars , saying that " [ Madonna ] is still the queen of pop and GHV2 is essential listening . One for the multiple personality in you this Christmas . " Dugald Baird from Music Week noted : " the set is something of an anti @-@ climax , although it is an essential purchase for her army of fans " . 
 Giving the album 8 on 10 , Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation 's lack of new tracks , and said " while far from immaculate , this is still quite a collection " . About GHV2 , New Strait Times ' Christie Leo commented that " this second volume of greatest hits isn 't as immediately accessible as the first . But that 's not what this collection is all about . This 14 @-@ track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut , Madonna " . AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it " slightly disappointing " , justifying that it was because during the 1990s , Madonna was an album artist . He finished his review saying that " the end result is less than the sum of its parts , even if this is a good way to get all of Madge 's 90s hits at once . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that " GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer 's boundary @-@ bridging career " , but criticized the lack of new material , and its " choppy edits , random sequences and missing links " , saying : " the collection doesn 't seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future " . Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing , stating , " Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna 's musical evolution . But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album ? Probably not . As it stands , it 's the best summary of Madonna 's second decade as a performer we 're going to get . "

 After graduating from high school , he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , where he became an assistant forestry clerk and assistant educational advisor for his company . He left after one year and he went to Detroit , Michigan where he worked at a company that made engine gaskets . 
 = = Military service = = 
 On August 25 , 1941 , he enlisted in the Marine Corps . Following United States Marine Corps Recruit Training at <unk> Parris Island , South Carolina , he was appointed to the Field Music School for training as a Marine Corps Field Musician ( a bugler ) . He was unhappy with being a field musician because he had joined the Marine Corps to fight . He applied for a change in rating to be a machine @-@ gunner , but was refused due to the shortage of buglers . After completing field music school , he was transferred to the 1st Marine Regiment , 1st Marine Division . 
 After completing his first overseas tour , he returned to the United States in February 1943 and was assigned to the First Battalion , 23rd Marines , 4th Marine Division at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune , North Carolina . When his unit moved to California he again asked for relief as a field musician ; and for permission to perform line duties . Again , due to the shortage of buglers in the Marine Corps , his request was denied . Throughout the course of World War II , until his death on Iwo Jima , Cole participated in several battles and campaigns as a machine @-@ gunner and was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1944 . 
 = = = Battle of Guadalcanal = = = 
 The Battle of Guadalcanal , was fought between August 7 , 1942 , and February 7 , 1943 , in the Pacific theatre of World War II and was the first major offensive launched by allied forces against the Empire of Japan . Cole arrived on Guadalcanal on August 7 , 1942 for the first American offensive of World War II ; and his first opportunity to fill in as a machine @-@ gunner in the absence of the regular gunner . 
 = = = Battles of Kwajalein , Saipan and Tinian = = = 
 After Guadalcanal , Cole served in several more battles throughout the Pacific theatre , including the battles of Kwajalein , Sapian and Tinian . The United States launched an assault on the main islands of Kwajalein in the south and Roi @-@ Namur in the north from January 31 , 1944 , to February 3 , 1944 . The Japanese defenders put up a stiff resistance though outnumbered and under @-@ prepared . Although the United States won the battle the determined defenses of Roi @-@ Namur left only 51 Japanese survivors of an original garrison of 3 @,@ 500 . During this engagement of the 4th Division Cole , again forsaking his bugle , stepped in as a machine @-@ gunner . 
 When Cole was sent to fight with his unit in Saipan , he was assigned to a machine gun unit ; and was designated as a machine gun section leader . During the battle his squad leader was killed and Cole , although wounded , assumed command of the entire squad . He was awarded the Bronze Star for " … his resolute leadership , indomitable fighting spirit and tenacious determination in the face of terrific opposition . " and was awarded the Purple Heart for the wounds he received . 
 When fighting began on the island of Tinian in the Mariana Islands from July 24 to August 1 , 1944 , Cole 's unit was sent in a few days after the battle began . Cole again led his squad ashore in the invasion and defeat of the neighboring islands of Tinian ; and continued to build his reputation as " The Fighting Field Musician . " 
 = = = Mariana and Palau Islands campaign = = = 
 The Mariana and Palau Islands campaign was an offensive launched by United States forces against Imperial Japanese forces in the Mariana Islands and Palau in the Pacific Ocean , between June and November , 1944 during the Pacific War . It was after the Marianas campaign , that he submitted a request for a change of rating for the third time . Pointing out his experience and combat record , he stated that he felt he would be of more benefit to the Marine Corps performing line duties than those of field music . This time his request was approved and he was redesignated Corporal and subsequently promoted to Sergeant in November 1944 . 
 = = = Battle of Iwo Jima = = = 
 The Battle of Iwo Jima was fought between the United States and the Japanese Empire , in February and March 1945 during the Pacific Campaign of World War II . Ground fighting on the island took place over approximately 35 days ; lasting from the landings of February 19 to a final Japanese charge the morning of March 26 , 1945 . The U.S. invasion , known as Operation Detachment , was charged with the mission of capturing the islands airfields . The Japanese positions on the island were heavily fortified , with vast bunkers , hidden artillery , and 18 kilometers ( 11 mi ) of tunnels . 
 On February 19 , Sergeant Cole led his machine gun section ashore in the D @-@ Day assault of Iwo Jima . Moving forward with the initial assault wave , a hail of fire from two enemy emplacements halted his section 's advance . Sergeant Cole personally destroyed them with hand grenades . His unit continued to advance until pinned down for a second time by enemy fire from three Japanese gun emplacements . One of these emplacements was destroyed by a machine @-@ gunner in Cole 's squad . When his machine guns jammed , armed only with a pistol and one hand grenade , Sergeant Cole made a one @-@ man attack against the two remaining gun emplacements . Twice he returned to his own lines for additional grenades and continued the attack under fierce enemy fire until he had succeeded in destroying the enemy strong points . 
 Upon returning to his own squad , he was killed by an enemy grenade . As a result of his one @-@ man attack , Sergeant Cole 's company could move forward against the fortifications and attain their ultimate objective . Sergeant Cole was initially buried in the 4th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima , but at the request of his father , his remains were returned to the United States to be buried in Parkview Cemetery , Farmington , Missouri .

 = = = = Medal of Honor = = = = 
 Cole was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor , which was presented to his widow on April 17 , 1947 . The citation reads as follows . 
 For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as Leader of a Machine @-@ gun Section of Company B , First Battalion , Twenty @-@ Third Marines , Fourth Marine Division , in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands , 19 February 1945 . Assailed by a tremendous volume of small @-@ arms , mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave , Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and , personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit , continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance . Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action , he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy , reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades , pinned down his unit for the second time . <unk> gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack , Sergeant Cole , armed solely with a pistol and one grenade , coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes . Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden , swift attack , he quickly withdrew , returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced , attacked , and withdrew . With enemy guns still active , he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault . Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad , Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position , thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications , continue the advance and seize the objective . By his dauntless initiative , unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action , Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades , and his <unk> leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service . He gallantly gave his life for his country .

 The second USS Cole ( DDG @-@ 67 ) , an Arleigh Burke @-@ class Aegis @-@ equipped guided missile destroyer was named for Sergeant Cole . The Cole is homeported in NS Norfolk , Virginia . The ship was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding and delivered to the Navy on March 11 , 1996 . On October 12 , 2000 , the Cole was damaged by a suicide attack while harbored in the Yemeni port of Aden . The first USS Cole ( DD @-@ 155 ) , launched in 1919 , was named for a Marine who was killed in World War I. 
 The Marine Corps Reserve training center in Camp Las Flores aboard Marine Corps base Camp Pendleton , California is also named in his honor . 
 The Sgt Darrell S. Cole Band Hall aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico is also named in his honor . 
 = Voyager ( video game ) = 
 Voyager was a graphic adventure computer game developed by Looking Glass Technologies from 1995 until its cancellation in 1997 . It was published by Viacom New Media . Based on the Star Trek : Voyager license , the game followed Kathryn Janeway and the crew of the USS Voyager in their attempts to rescue members of their team from the Kazon . Voyager was the first game in a multi @-@ title agreement between Viacom and Looking Glass , and Viacom took a minority equity investment in the company as part of the deal . However , Viacom decided to leave the video game industry in 1997 , and Voyager was cancelled in spring of that year . In response to Voyager 's cancellation , team members Ken Levine , Jonathan Chey and Rob Fermier left Looking Glass to found Irrational Games . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Voyager was an adventure game based on the Star Trek : Voyager license . The player guided Kathryn Janeway and other characters aboard the USS Voyager through three " episodes " . The game began as the USS Voyager resupplied at an agricultural planet , only to have certain members of its crew kidnapped by the Kazon . As Janeway and the surviving team tracked the Kazon , they encountered such things as other alien races and " an abandoned planet occupied only by a single computer system " . Unlike in other Star Trek video games of the time , the player manipulated the crew at a high and general level . The player selected the crew 's course of action from a list of options during " decision point " scenes , after which the crew would carry out their orders automatically . Certain decisions continued the plot , while others led to dead ends or to a game over . Producer Alan Dickens said , " We want to make it a lot like you 're watching the TV and yelling at the characters . You 're giving them , as a team , guidance and direction on where they should go and how they should address the various problems that come before them . " 
 Between decision points , the player used and combined items , solved puzzles and engaged in combat . The game 's item system involved scanning objects with <unk> and storing them in a " virtual inventory " . This was an attempt to avoid <unk> and the protagonists " stealing everything they find " , two issues that Dickens said were common in the adventure game genre . " Tech sim " puzzles in the style of The Incredible Machine — a video game series in which players create Rube Goldberg machines — were a main feature in Voyager : the player would receive collections of mechanical parts , which would have to be combined into complex mechanisms . Combat took place on the ground and in space , and like other scenes was controlled at a general level . The player could order the crew to provide suppressive fire , to maneuver or to beam out , for example , and would then watch the scene play out . 
 = = Development and aftermath = = 
 Voyager began development in 1995 , and it was announced in August of that year as the first game in a multi @-@ title deal between Viacom New Media and Looking Glass Technologies . According to Next Generation , the announcement was " greeted with joy " by gamers and fans of Star Trek . Viacom was interested in Looking Glass 's engine technology , and took a minority equity investment in the company . Voyager was conceptualized by Dickens and by Viacom producer Rachel Leventhal . It was initially planned for release in 1996 , but a later report gave it an expected release date of early 1997 . The team at Looking Glass visited and researched the set of Star Trek : Voyager in order to reproduce it accurately , and they created 3D laser scans of the cast 's heads . Voice over from the cast was also recorded . The game 's characters and pre @-@ rendered backgrounds were created with 3D Studio and Alias , and the characters were animated with the skeletal animation system that had been developed for Terra Nova : Strike Force Centauri . Designer Jonathan Chey worked on the game 's physics and artificial intelligence code , which he later said were " really weird " features for an adventure game and evidence of unfocused development . 
 Voyager was cancelled in the spring of 1997 , after 18 months in production . According to Looking Glass 's Paul Neurath , the cancellation was due to Viacom 's wider decision to abandon the video game industry . He believed that the Viacom deal and Voyager were ultimately a " giant distraction " and a " boondoggle " that hurt the company . These events started a financial downward spiral at Looking Glass , which , compounded by a string of troubled and commercially unsuccessful projects such as Terra Nova and British Open Championship Golf , culminated in the company 's closure in May 2000 . Three members of the Voyager team — Chey , writer Ken Levine and designer Rob Fermier — became close friends during the game 's development . The game 's cancellation inspired them to start the spin @-@ off developer Irrational Games in April 1997 , which went on to develop System Shock 2 in collaboration with Looking Glass . Levine later recalled that , while writing Voyager 's opening cutscene , he learned that technological limitations made it difficult for characters to express emotion ; and this experience influenced his future writing for games such as BioShock Infinite .

 The 2010 Auto Club 500 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held on February 21 , 2010 at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana , California . Contested over 250 laps , it was the second race of the 2010 Sprint Cup Series season . The race was won by Jimmie Johnson for Hendrick Motorsports . Kevin Harvick finished second and Jeff Burton clinched third . 
 <unk> driver Jamie McMurray maintained his lead into the first corner , but outsider Juan Pablo Montoya took the lead before the first lap was over . Afterward , Johnson became the leader , and would eventually lead to the race high of 101 laps . During the final pit stops , Johnson was on pit lane as the caution flag came out . Burton , who led the race during Johnson 's pit stop , did not pass Johnson to put him a lap down . Therefore , Johnson retained the first position upon the completion of pit stops . On the final lap , Harvick was gaining on Johnson , but Johnson maintained his position to win his first race of the season . 
 There were six caution flags and 28 lead changes among 14 different drivers throughout the course of the race .

 Jimmie Johnson appeared in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his first win of the season , his fifth at Auto Club Speedway , and his 48th overall in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series . Following his win , he added , " No way around it , we got lucky . We were able to just beat the 31 car [ leader Jeff Burton ] to the scoring line by about half a car length or we would have been a lap down . " 
 Although Burton was leading near the end of the race , the caution was issued as Johnson was exiting pit lane . It gave Burton a chance to put Johnson a lap down , but Johnson entered the track ahead of Burton . In the subsequent press conference , Johnson said , " Fortunate came our way . I ’ m not going to lie . The fact that we were on pit row gave us track position , and I drove my butt off . " Johnson expressed his enjoyment of winning the race , stating : 
 " Today was a great race for NASCAR and a great race for this track . I know it got spread out some , but there [ was ] some really good racing from what I saw . Yes , today we got a huge gift . But I was running fourth or fifth at the time [ of the last caution ] , so it 's not like we totally backed into this thing . And I still had to hold Kevin off . " 
 Burton , who finished third , stated , " We weren 't slowing each other down . I ran the low line and Kevin ran the high line . But I got looser and Kevin got better at the end . The 29 by far had the best car . " Harvick , who finished second , said , " When he moved up I got tight and caught the wall a little bit . If he doesn 't move up , he gets passed pretty easily . He did what he 's supposed to do to take the line away . He did exactly what he had to do . " The race result left Harvick leading the Driver 's Championship with a total of 331 points .

 = Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park = 
 The Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park is located in Window Rock , Arizona , the capital of the Navajo Nation . It is the only tribally owned zoological park in the United States and is notable among zoological facilities in that it labels its exhibits in a Native American Indian language . Having been operated by the Navajo Nation Parks & Recreation Department since its inception in the early 1960s , it became part of the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife in September 2006 . 
 While its facilities have the unique mission of preserving and caring for the fauna and flora significant to Navajo culture , its existence has also sparked controversy among the more traditionalist elements in Navajo society . 
 = = History = = 
 The zoo 's first specimen was a bear that had been left behind after the 1963 Navajo Nation Fair by a state organization , and the animal was named " Yogi the Bear , " after the then @-@ popular cartoon character . Since then , the exhibit has grown to about 50 different species on display , almost all of them native to the area . In 1976 , the zoo , then named " Navajo Tribal Zoo , " relocated to its current home and became part of the Navajo Tribal Parks & Recreation system . In September 2006 , it was reorganized to be administered by the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife . 
 = = Staff and budget = = 
 The facility 's current director and curator is Matthew <unk> , a biologist from the University of New Hampshire with prior work experience as an animal research specialist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and with the U.S. Forest Service in California . 
 The zoo currently employs five full @-@ time and one part @-@ time staff members and has an annual budget of US $ 336 @,@ 000 . It is primarily funded by the Navajo Nation Government , but also solicits for donations from project sponsorship , animal adoption , and donations ; admission is free . 
 = = Exhibits and mission = = 
 The zoo operates on an area spanning 7 acres ( 2 @.@ 8 ha ) and is located in the vicinity of the Navajo Nation Museum in Window Rock ( <unk> ) . It is home to about 150 animals , representing over 50 species and sees an estimated 33 @,@ 000 visitors each year . 
 The zoo dubs itself " A Sanctuary for Nature and the Spirit " , and according to its mission statement , it aims to conserve " native plants and animals , including rare , sensitive and endangered species " with an emphasis on fauna and flora that is important and significant to Navajo culture and traditions . In this spirit , it houses primarily animals native to <unk> and implements cultural and educational programs in cooperation with schools and similar facilities in the area ; furthermore , it provides care for injured and orphaned animals found in the wild . The zoo also fosters the use of plants and animals for ceremonial purposes in accordance with Navajo tradition , and regularly accepts appointments for offerings being made and ceremonies held within its facilities . 
 Its wild creatures include black bear , bobcat , Mexican wolves , elk , Gila monsters , coyotes , rattlesnakes , cougars , skunks , and red foxes , as well as cranes , golden eagle , red @-@ tailed hawk , and great horned owls . In keeping with Navajo tradition , none of the zoo 's birds were captured for the purpose of being exhibited , but were rather rescued after sustaining injuries from vehicles or electrical lines and are thus unable to fly ; the majority of the other specimens are also non @-@ releasable and unable to survive in the wild due to being orphaned or having been confiscated as illegal pets from their former owners . 
 Starting in 2008 , the zoo 's then 30 @-@ year @-@ old Discovery Center was renovated and redesigned to bring it in line with modern zoo standards ; apart from displaying the majority of the park 's invertebrates , it also incorporates a display with traditional Navajo stories relating to the animals . 
 = = = Adopt an Animal @-@ Program = = = 
 Any animal in the zoo can be " adopted " for a price of US $ 100 annually to cover the cost of food and care ; the adopting party will receive a certificate and has his or her name engraved on the plaque next to the exhibit in question . If the animal has never been adopted before , the sponsor will have the opportunity of giving the animal a name ; in this process , various animals have been given names such as " Napoleon " for the park 's mountain lion and " Señor <unk> " for the golden eagle . 
 = = = Eagle sanctuary = = = 
 Since 2008 , the zoo has been lobbying for a permit to build an eagle sanctuary in order to be able to distribute the animals ' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law . Since the species are listed as endangered , any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado ; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts , such as feathers , in a lengthy process with wait @-@ times that can exceed several years . Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process , it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty ; currently , only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose . 
 = = Controversies = = 
 In January 1999 , outgoing Navajo Nation president Milton Bluehouse ordered the zoo closed after two women from Rock Ridge claimed to have been visited by the <unk> <unk> , traditional Navajo deities , who had given them a warning , saying that the Navajo people were not living according to tradition by keeping caged animals , specifically bears , snakes , and eagles , which are considered sacred . 
 Subsequently , during his first days in office , Bluehouse 's successor , Kelsey A. Begaye , received more complaints and letters protesting the zoo 's closure than concerning any other political issue . After temporarily reversing Bluehouse 's decision , Begaye then summoned a meeting with the Navajo Nation 's <unk> Advisory Council to discuss the situation ; the group , however , refused to consider the matter while the animals were in hibernation and postponed any advice or decision until April of the following year . Options under consideration were releasing the animals into the wild , not accepting new animals and closing the zoo after the last one had died , or renaming the zoo to a term that would be considered more respectful to the animals . 
 Opponents to the shut @-@ down maintained that most of the animals were unable to survive in the wild and would perish , and that the zoo 's facilities had become one of the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred creatures and thereby relate to traditional stories , due to the fact that most younger Navajos are more accustomed to dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals . 
 On March 12 , Begaye announced his decision to keep the zoo open without expanding it and letting the remaining animals live out their lives on the zoo @-@ grounds . According to Harry Walters , an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for <unk> Studies at <unk> College in <unk> ( <unk> ́ ) , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled : " Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that 's what a Westerner would do – we look at it as a message : ' Are we going the way we should ? ' " Walters said . 
 = Peak District = 
 The Peak District is an upland area in England at the southernmost end of the Pennines . It falls mostly in northern Derbyshire but also includes parts of Cheshire , Greater Manchester , Staffordshire and Yorkshire . 
 An area of great diversity , it is split into the northern Dark Peak , where most of the moorland is found and whose geology is gritstone , and the southern White Peak , where most of the population lives and whose geology is mainly limestone . 
 The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951 . With its proximity to the cities of Manchester and Sheffield and easy access by road and rail , it attracts millions of visitors every year . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Peak District forms the southern end of the Pennines and much of the area is uplands above 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) , with a high point on Kinder Scout of 2 @,@ 087 feet ( 636 m ) . Despite its name , the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks , being characterised by rounded hills and gritstone escarpments ( the " edges " ) . The area is surrounded by major conurbations , including Huddersfield , Manchester , Sheffield , Derby and Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent . 
 The National Park covers 555 square miles ( 1 @,@ 440 km2 ) of Derbyshire , Staffordshire , Cheshire , Greater Manchester and South and West Yorkshire , including the majority of the area commonly referred to as the Peak . Its northern limits lie along the A62 road between Marsden and <unk> , north east of Oldham , while its southernmost point is on the A52 road on the outskirts of Ashbourne in Derbyshire . The Park boundaries were drawn to exclude large built @-@ up areas and industrial sites from the park ; in particular , the town of Buxton and the adjacent quarries are located at the end of the Peak Dale corridor , surrounded on three sides by the Park . 
 The town of Bakewell and numerous villages are included within the boundaries , as is much of the ( non @-@ industrial ) west of Sheffield . As of 2010 , it is the fifth largest National Park in England and Wales . In the UK , the designation " National Park " means that there are planning restrictions to protect the area from inappropriate development and a Park Authority to look after it , but does not imply that the land is owned by the government , or that it is uninhabited . 
 12 % of the Peak District National Park is owned by the National Trust , a charity which aims to conserve historic and natural landscapes . It does not receive government funding . The three Trust estates ( High Peak , South Peak and <unk> ) include the ecologically or geologically significant areas of Bleaklow , Derwent Edge , Hope Woodlands , Kinder Scout , Leek and Manifold , Mam Tor , Dovedale , Milldale and Winnats Pass . The Peak District National Park Authority directly owns around 5 % , and other major landowners include several water companies . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Peak District is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period . They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone , the overlying <unk> and finally the Coal Measures , though the latter occur only on the extreme margins of the area . In addition there are infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas , tuffs and volcanic vent <unk> . 
 The general geological structure of the Peak District is that of a broad dome ( see image below ) , whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded . Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the top off the dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins , Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of Millstone Grit outcropping between these two . The southern edge of the dome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age though these barely impinge upon the National Park . 
 The central and southern section of the Peak District , where the Carboniferous Limestone is found at or near the surface , is known as the White Peak in contrast to the Dark Peak , which is characterised by Millstone Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland . 
 Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up @-@ <unk> of the area and , particularly in the west , the folding of the rock strata along north – south axes . The region was raised in a north – south line which resulted in this dome @-@ like shape and the shale and sandstone were worn away until limestone was exposed . At the end of this period , the Earth 's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea , depositing a variety of new rocks . 
 Some time after its deposition , mineral veins were formed in the limestone . These veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times . 
 The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years ( probably the Anglian glaciation of around 450 @,@ 000 years ago ) as evidenced by the patches of glacial till or boulder clay that can be found across the area . It was not covered by ice during the last glacial period , which peaked around 20 @,@ 000 – 22 @,@ 000 years ago . A mix of Irish Sea and Lake District ice abutted against its western margins . Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along this margin of the Peak District during this period . 
 Glacial meltwaters also contributed to the formation and development of many of the caves in the limestone area . Wild animal herds roamed the area , and their remains have been found in several of the local caves . 
 The different types of rock that lie beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape ; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow , and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area . Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water , therefore rivers have been able to carve deep , narrow valleys . These rivers then often find a route underground , creating cave systems . Millstone Grit on the other hand is insoluble but porous , so it absorbs water which often seeps through the grits , until it meets the less porous shales beneath , creating springs when it reaches the surface again . The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost , so they form areas that are vulnerable to landslides , as on Mam Tor . 
 = = Rivers = = 
 The high moorland plateau of the Dark Peak and the high ridges of the White Peak are the sources of many rivers . In a report for the Manchester Corporation , the engineer John Frederick Bateman wrote in 1846 : 
 Within ten or twelve miles of Manchester , and six or seven miles from the existing reservoirs at Gorton , there is this tract of mountain land abounding with springs of the purest quality . Its physical and geological features offer such peculiar features for the collection , storage and supply of water for the use of the towns in the plains below that I am surprised that they have been overlooked . 
 He was referring to Longdendale , and the upper valley of the River Etherow . The western side of the Peak District is drained by the rivers Etherow , Goyt , and Tame , which are tributaries of the River Mersey . The north east is drained by tributaries of the River Don , itself a tributary of the Yorkshire Ouse . Of the tributaries of the River Trent , that drain the south and east , the River Derwent is the most prominent . It rises in the Peak District on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley with its three reservoirs , the Howden Reservoir , Derwent Reservoir and Ladybower Reservoir . The River Noe and the River Wye are tributaries . The River Manifold and River Dove , rivers of the south west whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor , also flow into the Trent , while the River Dane flows into the River Weaver . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The gritstone and shale of the Dark Peak supports heather moorland and blanket bog environments , with rough sheep pasture and grouse shooting being the main land uses . The limestone plateaux of the White Peak are more intensively farmed , with mainly dairy usage of improved pastures . Some sources also recognise the South West Peak ( near Macclesfield ) as a third type of area , with intermediate characteristics . 
 Woodland forms around 8 % of the Peak National Park . Natural broad @-@ leaved woodland is found in the steep @-@ sided , narrow dales of the White Peak and the deep <unk> of the Dark Peak , while reservoir margins often have coniferous plantations . 
 Lead rakes , the spoil heaps of ancient mines , form another distinctive habitat in the White Peak , supporting a range of rare <unk> plants , including Spring <unk> ( <unk> verna ; also known as <unk> ) , Alpine <unk> ( <unk> caerulescens ) and Mountain Pansy ( Viola lutea ) . 
 = = Climate = = 
 With the majority of the area being in excess of 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) above sea level , and being situated to the west of the country with a latitude of 53 degrees , the Peak District experiences a relatively high amount of rainfall each year compared to the rest of England and Wales , averaging 40 @.@ 35 inches ( 1 @,@ 025 mm ) in 1999 . The Dark Peak tends to receive more rainfall each year in comparison to the White Peak as it is higher in altitude . This higher rainfall does not seem to affect the area 's temperature , as it averages the same as England and Wales at 10 @.@ 3 ° C ( 50 @.@ 5 ° F ) . 
 During the 1970s , the Dark Peak regularly recorded over 70 days of snowfall each year . Since then this number has decreased markedly . Frost cover is seen for 20 – 30 % of the winter on the moors of the Dark Peak and for 10 % on the White Peak , and the hills of the National Park still see periods of long continuous snow cover in some winters . For example , a snowfall in mid @-@ December 2009 on the summits of some of the hills created snow patches that lasted in some cases until May 2010 . In that same winter , some of the area 's passes , such as the A635 ( Saddleworth Moor ) and A57 ( Snake Pass ) , were closed because of lying snow for almost a month . 
 The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative was set up in 2008 to collect data on climate change in the area . Students investigated the interaction between people and the moorlands , and their overall effect on climate change , to discover whether the moorlands are a net carbon sink or source , based on the fact that upland areas of Britain are a significant global carbon store in the form of peat . Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire as well as the effects of global warming are the major variables that they considered . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Tourism is the major local employment for Park residents ( 24 % ) , with manufacturing industries ( 19 % ) and quarrying ( 12 % ) also being important . 12 % are employed in agriculture . The cement works at Hope is the largest single employer within the Park . Tourism is estimated to provide 500 full @-@ time jobs , 350 part @-@ time jobs and 100 seasonal jobs . 
 Limestone is the most important mineral quarried , mainly for roads and cement ; shale is extracted for cement at Hope , and several gritstone quarries are worked for housing . Lead mining is no longer economic , but fluorite , baryte and calcite are extracted from lead veins , and small @-@ scale Blue John mining occurs at Castleton . 
 The springs at Buxton and Ashbourne are exploited to produce bottled mineral water , and many of the plantations are managed for timber . Other manufacturing industries of the area are varied ; they include David Mellor 's cutlery factory in Hathersage , <unk> brake linings in Chapel @-@ en @-@ le @-@ Frith and electronic equipment in Castleton . There are approximately 2 @,@ 700 farms in the National Park , most of them under 40 hectares ( 99 acres ) in area . 60 % of farms are believed to be run on a part @-@ time basis where the farmer has a second job . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The Peak District has been inhabited from the earliest periods of human activity , as is evidenced by occasional finds of Mesolithic flint artefacts and by <unk> evidence from caves in Dovedale and elsewhere . There is also evidence of Neolithic activity , including some monumental earthworks or barrows ( burial mounds ) such as that at Margery Hill . In the Bronze Age the area was well populated and farmed , and evidence of these people survives in <unk> such as Arbor Low near <unk> , or the Nine Ladies Stone Circle at Stanton Moor . 
 In the same period , and on into the Iron Age , a number of significant hillforts such as that at Mam Tor were created . Roman occupation was sparse but the Romans certainly exploited the rich mineral veins of the area , exporting lead from the Buxton area along well @-@ used routes . There were Roman settlements , including one at Buxton which was known to them as " Aquae Arnemetiae " in recognition of its spring , dedicated to the local goddess . 
 Theories as to the derivation of the Peak District name include the idea that it came from the <unk> or <unk> , an Anglo @-@ Saxon tribe who inhabited the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century AD when it fell within the large Anglian kingdom of Mercia . 
 = = = Mining and quarrying = = = 
 In medieval and early modern times the land was mainly agricultural , as it still is today , with sheep farming , rather than arable , the main activity in these upland holdings . However , from the 16th century onwards the mineral and geological wealth of the Peak became increasingly significant . Not only lead , but also coal , fluorite , copper ( at <unk> ) , zinc , iron , manganese and silver have all been mined here . Celia Fiennes , describing her journey through the Peak in 1697 , wrote of 
 ... those craggy hills whose <unk> are full of mines of all kinds off black and white and veined marbles , and some have mines of copper , others <unk> and leaden mines , in w [ hi ] ch is a great <unk> of silver . 
 Coal measures occur on the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District , and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches , and from Stocksbridge to Baslow . Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries , in some cases continuing into the early 20th century . The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides . At Goyt 's Moss and Axe Edge , deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines . Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting , and coal from the western mines for lime burning . 
 Lead mining peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries ; high concentrations of lead have been found in the area dating back from this period , as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred . Lead mining began to decline from the mid @-@ 19th century , with the last major mine closing in 1939 , though lead remains a by @-@ product of fluorite , baryte and calcite mining . Not all mines were deep underground ; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land . A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction . The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out , then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one . 
 Fluorite or fluorspar is called Blue John in the Peak District , the name allegedly coming from the French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the <unk> . Blue John is now scarce , and only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use . The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave ; mining still takes place in the nearby Treak Cliff Cavern . 
 Industrial limestone quarrying for the manufacture of soda ash started in the Buxton area as early as 1874 . In 1926 this operation became part of ICI . Large @-@ scale limestone and gritstone quarries flourished as lead mining declined , and remain an important if contentious industry in the Peak . Twelve large limestone quarries operate in the Peak ; Tunstead near Buxton is one of the largest quarries in Europe . Total limestone output was substantial : at the 1990 peak , 8 @.@ 5 million tonnes was quarried . 
 = = = Introduction of textiles = = = 
 Textiles have been exported from the Peak for hundreds of years . Even as early as the 14th century , the area traded in unprocessed wool . There was a number of skilled hand spinners and weavers in the area . By the 1780s , inventors such as Richard Arkwright developed machinery to produce textiles more quickly and to a higher standard . The early mills were narrow and low in height , of light construction , powered by water wheels and containing small machines . Interior lighting was by daylight , and ceiling height was only 6 – 8 ft . These Arkwright type mills are about 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) wide . The Peak District was the ideal location , with its rivers and humid atmosphere . The local pool of labour was quickly exhausted and the new mills such as Litton Mill and <unk> Mill in Millers Dale brought in children as young as four from the workhouses of London as apprentices . 
 With the advance of technology , the narrow Derbyshire valleys became unsuited to the larger steam driven mill , but the Derbyshire mills remained , and continued to trade in finishing and niche products . The market town of Glossop benefitted from the textile industry . The town 's economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition which had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . Until the First World War , Glossop had the headquarters of the largest textile printworks in the world . In the 1920s , the firm was refloated on the easily available share capital ; thus it was victim of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 . Their product lines becoming vulnerable to the new economic conditions , and resulted in the industry 's decline . 
 = = = Waterways = = = 
 The streams of the Peak District have been dammed to provide headwater for numerous water driven mills ; weirs have been built across the rivers for the same purpose . 
 There are no canals within the National Park boundary ( though the Standedge Tunnels on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal run underneath the extreme north of the park ) . Waters from the Dark Peak fed the Ashton Canal , and Huddersfield Narrow Canal , and waters from the White Peak fed the Macclesfield Canal . Outside the National Park , but within the general area , the Peak Forest Canal was built to bring lime from the quarries at Dove Holes for the construction industry . 
 The canal terminated at <unk> and the journey was completed using the Peak Forest Tramway . Southeast of the National Park , the disused Cromford Canal ran from Cromford to the Erewash Canal and formerly served the lead mines at Wirksworth and cotton mills of Sir Richard Arkwright . 
 The large reservoirs along the Longdendale valley known as the Longdendale Chain were designed in the 1840s and completed in February 1877 . They provided compensation water to ensure a continuous flow along the River Etherow which was essential for local industry , and provided pure water for Manchester . The Upper Derwent Valley reservoirs were built from the mid 20th century onward to supply drinking water to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire . 
 = = = Development of tourism = = = 
 The area has been a tourist destination for centuries , with an early tourist description of the area , De <unk> Pecci or The Seven Wonders of the Peak by Thomas Hobbes , being published in 1636 . Much scorn was poured on these seven wonders by subsequent visitors , including the journalist Daniel Defoe who described the moors by Chatsworth as " a waste and <unk> wilderness " and was particularly contemptuous of the cavern near Castleton known as the ' Devil 's Arse ' or Peak Cavern . Visitor numbers did not increase significantly until the Victorian era , with railway construction providing ease of access and a growing cultural appreciation of the Picturesque and Romantic . Guides such as John <unk> 's Mineralogy of Derbyshire ( 1802 ) and William Adam 's Gem of the Peak ( 1843 ) generated interest in the area 's unique geology . 
 Buxton has a long history as a spa town due to its geothermal spring which rises at a constant temperature of 28 ° C. It was initially developed by the Romans around AD 78 , when the settlement was known as Aquae Arnemetiae , or the spa of the goddess of the grove . It is known that Bess of Hardwick and her husband the Earl of Shrewsbury , " took the waters " at Buxton in 1569 , and brought Mary , Queen of Scots , there in 1573 . The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the 5th Duke of Devonshire in style of the spa of Bath . 
 A second resurgence a century later attracted the eminent Victorians such as Dr. Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood , who were drawn by the reputed healing properties of the waters . The railway reached Buxton in 1863 . Buxton has many notable buildings such as ' The Crescent ' ( 1780 – 1784 ) , modelled on Bath 's Royal Crescent , by John Carr , ' The Devonshire ' ( 1780 – 1789 ) , ' The Natural Baths ' , and ' The Pump Room ' by Henry Currey . The Pavilion Gardens were opened in 1871 . Buxton Opera House was designed by Frank Matcham in 1903 and is the highest opera house in the country . Matcham was the theatrical architect who designed the London Palladium , the London Coliseum , and the Hackney Empire . 
 There is a great tradition of public access and outdoor recreation in the area . The Peak District formed a natural hinterland and rural escape for the populations of industrial Manchester and Sheffield , and remains a valuable leisure resource in a largely post @-@ industrial economy . 
 In a 2005 survey of visitors to the Peak District , 85 % of respondents mentioned " scenery and landscape " as a reason for visiting . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 The Kinder Trespass in 1932 was a landmark in the campaign for national parks and open access to moorland in Britain . At the time , such open moors were closed to all ; they were strongly identified with the game @-@ keeping interests of landed gentry who used them only 12 days a year . The Peak District National Park became the United Kingdom 's first national park on 17 April 1951 . The first long @-@ distance footpath in the United Kingdom was the Pennine Way , which opened in 1965 and starts at the Nags Head Inn , in <unk> Booth , part of Edale village . 
 The northern moors of Saddleworth and <unk> , above <unk> , gained notoriety in the 1960s as the burial site of several children murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley . 
 = = Transport = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 The first roads in the Peak were constructed by the Romans , although they may have followed existing tracks . The Roman network is thought to have linked the settlements and forts of Aquae Arnemetiae ( Buxton ) , Chesterfield , Ardotalia ( Glossop ) and Navio ( Brough and <unk> ) , and extended outwards to <unk> ( Doncaster ) , Mamucium ( Manchester ) and <unk> ( Little Chester , near Derby ) . Parts of the modern <unk> and A53 roads south of Buxton are believed to run along Roman roads . 
 Packhorse routes criss @-@ crossed the Peak in the Medieval era , and some paved causeways are believed to date from this period , such as the Long Causeway along Stanage Edge . However , no highways were marked on Christopher Saxton 's map of Derbyshire , published in 1579 . Bridge @-@ building improved the transport network . A surviving early example is the three @-@ arched gritstone bridge over the River Derwent at Baslow , which dates from 1608 and has an adjacent toll @-@ shelter . 
 Although the introduction of turnpike roads ( toll roads ) from 1731 reduced journey times , the journey from Sheffield to Manchester in 1800 still took 16 hours , prompting Samuel Taylor Coleridge to remark that " a tortoise could <unk> us ! " From around 1815 onwards , turnpike roads both increased in length and improved in quality . An example is the Snake Pass , which now forms part of the A57 , built under the direction of Thomas Telford in 1819 – 21 ; the name refers to the crest of the Duke of Devonshire . The Cromford Canal opened in 1794 , carrying coal , lead and iron ore to the Erewash Canal . 
 Within several years , the improved roads and the Cromford Canal both saw competition from new railways , with work on the first railway in the Peak commencing in 1825 . Although the Cromford and High Peak Railway ( from the Cromford Canal at High Peak Junction to Whaley Bridge ) was an industrial railway , passenger services soon followed , including the Woodhead Line ( Sheffield to Manchester via Longdendale ) and the Manchester , Buxton , Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway . Not everyone regarded the railways as an improvement : 
 You <unk> a railroad through the valley , you blasted its rocks away , heaped thousands of tons of shale into its lovely stream . The valley is gone , and the gods with it ; and now , every fool in Buxton can be at Bakewell in half @-@ an @-@ hour , and every fool in Bakewell at Buxton . 
 By the second half of the 20th century , the pendulum had swung back towards road transport . The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944 , and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe . The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone . Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail , the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail . 
 The Manchester , Buxton , Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway is now closed between <unk> and Buxton where the trackbed forms part of the <unk> Trail . The Cromford and High Peak Railway is now completely shut , with part of the trackbed open to the public as the High Peak Trail . Another disused rail line between Buxton and Ashbourne now forms the <unk> Trail . 
 = = = Road network = = = 
 The main roads through the Peak District are the A57 ( Snake Pass ) between Sheffield and Manchester , the A628 ( Woodhead Pass ) between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale , the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton , the Cat and Fiddle road from Macclesfield to Buxton , and in the extreme north of the Park the A635 ( Saddleworth Moor ) running from Manchester to Barnsley and the A62 from Manchester to Leeds , which forms the northernmost border of the National Park at Standedge . These major roads , together with other minor roads and lanes in the area , are attractive to drivers , but the Peak 's popularity makes road congestion and the availability of parking spaces a significant problem , especially during summer . This led to the proposal of a congestion charge in 2005 , but this was later rejected . 
 = = = Public transport = = = 
 The Peak District is readily accessible by public transport , which reaches even central areas . Train services into the area are along the Hope Valley Line from Sheffield and Manchester , the Derwent Valley Line from Derby to Matlock , the Huddersfield Line from Manchester to Huddersfield , the Buxton Line and Glossop Line , linking those towns to Manchester . Coach ( long @-@ distance bus ) services provide access to Matlock , Bakewell and Buxton from Derby , Nottingham and Manchester through <unk> and National Express , and there are regular buses from the nearby towns of Sheffield , Glossop , Stoke , Leek and Chesterfield . The nearest airport is Manchester . 
 For such a rural area , the smaller villages of the Peak are relatively well served by internal transport links . There are many minibuses operating from the main towns ( Bakewell , Matlock , Hathersage , Castleton , Tideswell and Ashbourne ) out to the small villages . The Hope Valley and Buxton Line trains also serve many local stations ( including Hathersage , Hope and Edale ) . 
 The National Park Authority announced , in October 2009 , that Cycle England will be investing £ 1 @.@ 25 million , to be spent by 2011 , to build and improve cycle routes within the National Park for use by leisure and commuting cyclists . It is hoped that this investment will help reduce traffic congestion and environmental pollution , as well as giving commuters and visitors a viable alternative to travelling around the National Park by car . 
 = = Activities = = 
 The Peak District provides opportunities for many types of outdoor activity . An extensive network of public footpaths and numerous long @-@ distance trails , over 1 @,@ 800 miles ( 2 @,@ 900 km ) in total , as well as large open @-@ access areas , are available for hillwalking and hiking . The Pennine Way traverses the Dark Peak from Edale to the Park 's northern boundary just south of Standedge . <unk> are commonly used by mountain bikers , as well as horse riders . Some of the long @-@ distance trails in the White Peak , such as the <unk> Trail and High Peak Trail , re @-@ use former railway lines ; they are well used by walkers , horse riders and cyclists . 
 The local authorities run cycle hire centres at Ashbourne , Parsley Hay , Middleton Top and the Upper Derwent Valley . Wheelchair access is possible at several places on the former railway trails , and cycle hire centres offer vehicles adapted to wheelchair users . There is a programme to make footpaths more accessible to less @-@ agile walkers by replacing climbing stiles with walkers ' gates . 
 The many gritstone outcrops , such as Stanage Edge and The Roaches , are recognised as some of the finest rock climbing sites in the world ( see rock climbing in the Peak District ) ; they were the first to be climbed . The Peak District 's limestone was then ' discovered ' by climbers . It is more unstable but provides many testing climbs . For example , Thor 's Cave was explored in the early 1950s by Joe Brown and others . Eleven limestone routes there are listed by the BMC , ranging in grade from Very Severe to E7 , and several more have been claimed since the guidebook 's publication ; a few routes are bolted . 
 Beneath the ground , the <unk> enjoys natural caves , the potholes and old mine workings found in the limestone of the Peak . Peak Cavern is the largest and most important cave system which is even linked to the Speedwell system at Winnats . The only significant potholes are Eldon Hole and Nettle Pot . There are many old mine workings , which often were extensions of natural cave systems . Systems can be found at Castleton , Winnats , Matlock , Stoney Middleton , Eyam , <unk> and Buxton . 
 Some of the area 's large reservoirs , for example <unk> Water , have become centres for water sports , including sailing , fishing and canoeing , in this most landlocked part of the UK . Other activities include air sports such as hang gliding and paragliding , birdwatching , fell running , off @-@ roading , and orienteering .

 Buxton , Matlock and Matlock Bath , Bakewell , Leek and the small towns of Ashbourne and Wirksworth , on the fringes of the Park , all offer a range of tourist amenities . To the north the village of Hayfield sits at the foot of Kinder Scout , the highest summit in the area . 
 Bakewell is the largest settlement within the National Park ; its five @-@ arched bridge over the River Wye dates from the 13th century . 
 The spa town of Buxton was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire as a genteel health resort in the 18th century . Although just outside the national park boundary , it is a popular attraction in the area . It has an opera house with a theatre , museum and art gallery . Another spa town is Matlock Bath , popularised in the Victorian era . 
 The picturesque village of Castleton , overshadowed by Peveril Castle , has four show caves , the Peak , Blue John , Treak Cliff , and Speedwell , and is the centre of production of the unique semi @-@ precious mineral , Blue John . Other show caves and mines include the Heights of Abraham , reached by cable car , at Matlock Bath , and Poole 's Cavern in Buxton .

 The proximity of the Peak to major conurbations ( an estimated 20 million people live within an hour 's drive ) poses unique challenges to managing the area . The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust , with other landowners , attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation , whilst protecting it from intensive farming , erosion and pressure from visitors themselves . An inevitable tension exists between the needs of the 38 @,@ 000 residents of the Peak District National Park , the many millions of people who visit it annually , and the conservation requirements of the area . 
 The uneven distribution of visitors creates further stresses . Dovedale alone receives an estimated two million visitors annually ; other highly visited areas include Bakewell , Castleton and the Hope Valley , Chatsworth , Hartington and the reservoirs of the Upper Derwent Valley . Over 60 % of visits are concentrated in the period May – September , with Sunday being the busiest day . 
 = = = Footpath erosion = = = 
 The number of footpath users on the more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems , particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak . The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem . Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale , which now goes up Jacob 's Ladder rather than following the <unk> , and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving . 
 = = = Quarrying = = = 
 Large @-@ scale limestone quarrying has been a particular area of contention . Most of the mineral extraction licences were issued by national government for 90 years in the 1950s , and remain legally binding . The Peak District National Park Authority has a policy of considering all new quarrying and licence renewal applications within the area of the National Park in terms of the local and national need for the mineral and the uniqueness of the source , in conjunction with the effects on traffic , local residents and the environment . 
 Some licences have not been renewed ; for example , the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill was forced to close in 1999 , and landscaping is ongoing . The proposals dating from 1999 from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to re @-@ open dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor have been seen as a test case . They are hotly contested by ecological protesters and local residents on grounds that the development would threaten nearby Bronze Age remains , in particular the Nine Ladies Stone Circle , as well as the natural landscape locally . As of 2007 , negotiations are ongoing to shift the development to the nearby Dale View quarry , a less sensitive area . 
 = = Peak District in literature and arts = = 
 The landscapes of the Peak have formed an inspiration to writers for centuries . Various places in the Peak District have been identified by Ralph Elliott and others as locations in the 14th @-@ century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight ; Lud 's Church for example , is thought to be the Green Chapel . 
 Key scenes in Jane Austen 's 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice are set in the Derbyshire Peak District . Peveril of the Peak ( 1823 ) by Sir Walter Scott is a historical novel set at Peveril Castle , Castleton during the reign of Charles II . William Wordsworth was a frequent visitor to Matlock ; the Peak inspired several of his poems , including an 1830 sonnet to Chatsworth House . The village of Morton in Charlotte Brontë 's 1847 novel Jane Eyre is based on Hathersage , where Brontë stayed in 1845 , and Thornfield Hall might have been inspired by nearby North Lees Hall . Snowfield in George Eliot 's first novel Adam Bede ( 1859 ) is believed to be based on Wirksworth , where her uncle managed a mill ; <unk> ( as <unk> ) and Ashbourne ( as <unk> ) are also featured .

 = Seth Neddermeyer = 
 Seth Henry Neddermeyer ( September 16 , 1907 – January 29 , 1988 ) was an American physicist who co @-@ discovered the muon , and later championed the Implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon while working on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Seth Henry Neddermeyer was born in Richmond , Michigan , on September 16 , 1907 . He attended Olivet College , a small college that his mother , older sister , and uncle had also attended , for two years before his family moved to California . He transferred to Stanford University , from which received his Bachelor of Arts ( A.B. ) degree in 1929 . His interest in physics was inspired by the work of Robert A. Millikan , and he enrolled in graduate school at California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , where he wrote his 1935 Ph.D. thesis on " The absorption of high energy electrons " , under the supervision of Carl D. Anderson . He confirmed the theory espoused by Niels Bohr for this process . He also noted large radiative energy losses of electrons in lead , in agreement with the theory propounded by Hans Bethe and Walter Heitler . 
 Neddermeyer contributed to the research which led to the 1932 discovery of the positron , for which Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 . That year , Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered the muon , using cloud chamber measurements of cosmic rays . Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa 's 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as mediating the nuclear force . Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of cosmic rays , which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer 's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons . They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons . 
 = = Manhattan Project work = = 
 In early 1941 , with World War II raging in Europe but the United States not yet a belligerent , Neddermeyer joined a team led by Charles C. Lauritsen and William A. Fowler at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , and then at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington , D.C. , that worked on the photoelectric proximity fuze . After this work was successfully completed , Neddermeyer was recruited by Oppenheimer to work at the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory . Neddermeyer was an early advocate for the development of an implosion technique for assembling a critical mass In an atomic bomb . Although implosion was suggested by Richard Tolman as early as 1942 , and discussed in the introductory lectures given to Los Alamos scientists by Robert Serber , Neddermeyer was one of the first to urge its full development . Unable to find much initial enthusiasm for the concept among his fellow Los Alamos scientists , Neddermeyer presented the first substantial technical analysis of implosion in late April 1943 . Oppenheimer considered this to be the beginning of implosion research at Los Alamos . 
 Though many remained unimpressed , Oppenheimer appointed Neddermeyer the head of a new group to test implosion . His group became the E @-@ 5 ( Implosion ) Group , which was part of Captain William S. Parsons ' E Division . A gun @-@ type nuclear weapon was the preferred method , but implosion research constituted a backup . Neddermeyer embarked on an intensive series of experiments testing cylindrical implosions . The result was a series of distorted shapes . Progress was made ; Neddermeyer and a member of his team , Hugh Bradner , along with James L. Tuck from the British Mission , conceived the idea of explosive lenses , in which shaped charges are used to focus the force of an explosion . Nevertheless , seemingly unsolvable problems with shock wave uniformity brought progress on implosion to a crawl . 
 By September 1943 , Neddermeyer 's team had grown from five people to fifty . That month , John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer 's request . Von Neumann was impressed by the implosion concept and , working with Edward Teller , an old friend , made a series of suggestions . Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion , enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program . Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky , who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives , be brought in to help the program . In February 1944 , Kistiakowsky became Parsons ' deputy for implosion . 
 In April 1944 , tests on the first sample of plutonium that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor @-@ bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium @-@ 240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons . This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly . It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs ; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft , and plutonium @-@ 240 was even more difficult to separate from plutonium @-@ 239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving the rest of the Manhattan Project such difficulties . Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked , but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs . Thus , the implosion technique now suddenly stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons . 
 In mid @-@ June 1944 , a report from Kistiakowsky to Oppenheimer detailing dysfunctionality within the implosion team led to the ousting of Neddermeyer . He was replaced as the head of the E @-@ 5 Group by Kistiakowsky on June 15 , 1944 , but remained a technical adviser to the implosion program , with group leader status . Neddermeyer was said to have been much embittered by this episode . In Oppenheimer 's August 1944 reorganization of the Los Alamos Laboratory , Neddermeyer 's group was renamed X @-@ 1 , with Norris Bradbury as group leader . The implosion method championed by Neddermeyer was used in the first atom bomb exploded ( in the Trinity test ) , the Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki , and almost all modern nuclear weapons . Kistiakowsky later insisted that " the real invention should be given full credit to [ Seth ] Neddermeyer . " 
 = = Later years = = 
 In 1946 , after World War II ended , Neddermeyer left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the University of Washington , where he would spend the rest of his career . In due course he became a full professor . He resumed his studies of cosmic rays using a cloud chamber and a new device that he invented to measure the speed of charged particles known as a " <unk> " . He was particularly interested in the properties of the muon , and conducted experiments with muons at SLAC . He participated in the DUMAND Project , for which he helped design large @-@ scale underwater neutrino detectors . Neddermeyer became interested in parapsychology , insisting , in spite of the skepticism of many colleagues , that it warranted proper scientific investigation . He retired in 1973 , becoming a professor emeritus , but he continued his research activities for as long as his health permitted . He was afflicted with Parkinson 's disease . 
 In 1982 , he was presented with the Department of Energy 's Enrico Fermi award . His citation read : 
 For participating in the discovery of the positron , for his share in the discovery of the muon , the first of the subatomic particles ; for his invention of the implosion technique for assembling nuclear explosives ; and for his ingenuity , foresight , and perseverance in finding solutions for what at first seemed to be unsolvable engineering difficulties . 
 In later life , Neddermeyer was sometimes troubled by the nuclear weapons he had helped to invent . He told an interviewer in 1983 : 
 I get so overwhelmed by a feeling of terrible guilt when I think about the history of the bomb . I 'm terribly worried now about the current world situation . What the hell can we do about it ? 
 Neddermeyer died in Seattle on January 29 , 1988 , from complications of Parkinson 's disease .

 Nashville International Airport ( IATA : BNA , ICAO : <unk> , FAA LID : BNA ) is a public and military use airport in the southeastern section of Nashville in the U.S. state of Tennessee . It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011 – 2015 , which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport ( more than 10 @,@ 000 daily arriving and departing flights per year ) . Established in 1937 , its original name was Berry Field , from which its ICAO and IATA identifiers are derived . The current terminal was constructed in 1987 , and the airport took its current name in 1988 . Nashville International Airport has four runways , the longest of which is 11 @,@ 030 feet ( 3 @,@ 360 m ) long , a size adequate to handle all aircraft in service in 2014 . 
 Nashville International Airport ( BNA ) as of 2014 ranks as the 32nd @-@ busiest airport in the United States in terms of passengers . A total of 12 @,@ 293 @,@ 924 passengers traveled into and out of BNA during 2015 , a 9 @.@ 8 percent increase over calendar year 2014 , setting a new all @-@ time passenger record . The month of June 2015 set a new record for passenger traffic at Nashville International , including a monthly record 1 @,@ 071 @,@ 025 total passengers . Nashville International classifies as a medium @-@ sized airport in terms of 2015 passengers , and is the second largest of this category ( behind only St. Louis ) . The airport is currently served by 10 airlines and offers 390 daily arriving and departing flights with nonstop flights to more than 55 markets in the US , Canada , Mexico , Bahamas , Jamaica , Dominican Republic and Cuba . 
 The airport terminal complex includes an over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 93 @,@ 000 m2 ) passenger terminal with 47 air carrier gates and up to 78 commuter parking positions . BNA serves a trade area of 79 counties in Middle Tennessee , southern Kentucky , and northern Alabama . The airport is a focus city for Southwest Airlines and was previously a hub for American Airlines . Berry Field Air National Guard Base is located at Nashville International Airport . The base is home to the 118th Airlift Wing and is the headquarters of the Tennessee Air National Guard .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 Nashville 's first airport was Hampton Field , which operated until 1921 . It was replaced by Blackwood Field in the Hermitage community , which operated between 1921 and 1928 . The first airlines to serve Nashville , American Airlines and Eastern Air Lines , flew out of Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Rutherford County . 
 By 1935 the need for an airport larger and closer to the city than Sky Harbor Airport was realized and a citizens ' committee was organized by mayor Hillary Howse to choose a location . A 340 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 4 km2 ) plot along Dixie Parkway ( now Murfreesboro Road ) composed of four farms was selected , and construction began in 1936 as one of the first major Works Progress Administration projects in the area . The airport was dedicated on November 1 , 1936 , as Berry Field , named after Col. Harry S. Berry , the Tennessee administrator for the Works Progress Administration . It officially opened in June 1937 with much fanfare , including parades , an air show , and an aerial bombardment display by the 105th Aero Squadron , which was based at the field . Passenger service began in mid @-@ July through American Airlines and Eastern Airlines , both of which operated Douglas DC @-@ 3 aircraft . The new airport had three asphalt runways , a three @-@ story passenger terminal , a control tower , two hangars and a beacon , and was constructed at a cost of 1 @.@ 2 million dollars . In its first year , Berry Field served 189 @,@ 000 passengers . 
 During World War II , the airfield was requisitioned by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command as the headquarters for the 4th Ferrying Command for movement of new aircraft overseas . During this time , the Federal government expanded the airport to 1 @,@ 500 acres ( 6 @.@ 1 km2 ) . At the end of the war , the airport was returned to the control of the city , with a number of facilities remaining for support of the tenant unit of the Tennessee National Guard . 
 = = = Early jet service = = = 
 The airport had been enlarged by the military during World War II , but in 1958 the City Aviation Department , started planning to expand and modernize the airport . Nashville gained its first scheduled jet service in 1961 , the same year a new 145 @,@ 000 square feet ( 13 @,@ 500 m2 ) terminal opened off of Briley Parkway , west of runway 2L . For the first time more than half a million people passed through the airport when the six airlines that served Nashville carried 532 @,@ 790 passengers . These renovations also included expansion of an existing runway , with 2L / 20R being extended by 600 feet ( 180 m ) , and the construction of a new crosswind runway , 13 / 31 . In 1962 Nashville became the first municipal airport in the United States with a public reading room when the Nashville Public Library opened a branch inside the terminal . 
 = = = Modern terminal and hub status = = = 
 By the 1970s the airport was again in need of expansion and modernization . In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority ( MNAA ) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long @-@ term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity . This plan included the building of a new terminal and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive takeoffs and landings . 
 In the early 1980s the MNAA commissioned Robert Lamb Hart , in association with the firm of Gresham , Smith and Partners , to design a modern terminal ; construction began in 1984 and was completed in 1987 . It had three main concourses and a smaller commuter concourse radiating from a distinctive three @-@ story atrium . An international wing was built in Concourse A and flights to Toronto started in 1988 ; the airport was renamed Nashville International Airport / Berry Field . It is now rare to see the " Berry Field " portion used , but the airport 's IATA code ( BNA ) is short for Berry Field Nashville , and the military facilities at the airport are still commonly known by this name . In 1989 a new parallel runway ( 2R / <unk> ) was opened for use . 
 American Airlines announced in 1985 that it would establish a hub at Nashville , investing $ 115 million to develop a new 15 @-@ gate concourse and applying for $ 50 million in federal funds to build a new 10 @,@ 000 @-@ foot runway . The hub was intended to compete with Delta Air Lines , Eastern Airlines and Piedmont Airlines for north @-@ south traffic in the eastern United States . American and its regional affiliate American Eagle officially opened their hub in Nashville in April 1986 . Besides flying domestic service non @-@ stop to many U.S. cities , American also operated international nonstop flights from Nashville to London , England and Toronto , Canada . The American hub was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area . 
 American 's service peaked in 1992 , after which flights were gradually scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995 . American cited the aftermath of the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure . As American scaled down its operations , it subleased its gates to other carriers , largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities , which American had guaranteed . Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54 % of the Nashville market and making it a focus city , with American remaining as the second @-@ largest carrier at Nashville , followed by Delta Air Lines . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 In 2002 , Embraer Aircraft Maintenance Services ( <unk> ) selected Nashville as the location for its Regional Airline Support Facility , which was built on the site of the demolished 1961 terminal building . 
 In October 2006 , the Nashville Metropolitan Airport Authority started an extensive renovation of the terminal building , designed by Architectural Alliance of Minneapolis and Thomas , Miller & Partners , PLLC of Nashville , the first since the terminal opened 19 years prior . Phase one of the project involved updating and expanding food and vending services , improving flight information systems , and construction of a new consolidated security checkpoint for all terminals . Phase one was completed in 2009 . Phase two of the project involved the expansion of the ticketing and check @-@ in areas , the construction and renovation of bathrooms , and the renovation of the baggage claim areas . Completion of the second phase of the renovation project was completed in 2011 . These renovations bring the total size of the terminal building to over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 93 @,@ 000 m2 ) . In addition to the terminal renovation and expansion , the renovations included expanding parking and a new rental car facility . The renovated terminal was named the Robert C. H. Mathews Jr . Terminal in honor of a MNAA board chair in 2011 . 
 In addition to passenger amenities in the terminal and parking areas , the renovations included improvements to the airport 's infrastructure . The largest project was the complete demolition and rebuilding of Runway 2L / 20R , which was completed in August 2010 . In addition to the rebuilding of Runway 2L / 20R , Runway 2C / 20C was closed from September through December 2010 for pavement and concrete rehabilitation . BNA 's 91 acres ( 0 @.@ 37 km2 ) of tarmac were also rehabilitated during this project after being funded entirely by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allotments . 
 Even with Nashville no longer a connecting hub for a major airline , according to the Federal Aviation Administration , the number of passengers using BNA is expected to double within the next 20 years . With the additional renovations and expansions , the MNAA leadership has a stated goal of adding the number of nonstop destinations , increasing cargo service , and adding more international flights . According to a chief executive officer Rob Wigington , the MNAA is actively seeking increased nonstop domestic flights and more international service . Restoring nonstop service to London remains the top priority for international flights . 
 Nashville recently gained nonstop daily service to the San Francisco Bay Area with daily nonstop service to both San Francisco International Airport ( SFO ) on United Airlines ; and to Oakland International Airport ( OAK ) on Southwest Airlines , as well as a new daily nonstop flight to Seattle / Tacoma International Airport ( SEA ) on Alaska Airlines . JetBlue has announced its return to the Nashville market , with twice daily nonstop service to Boston ( BOS ) and daily nonstop service to Fort Lauderdale ( <unk> ) beginning on May 5 , 2016 . Numerous other added flights by Frontier Airlines to destinations such as Chicago , Philadelphia , Orlando and Las Vegas , along with the addition of WestJet to the Nashville market have continued the trend of airport growth . Southwest Airlines has also expressed desire to expand at the airport , and international service to Europe or Asia is quickly being considered as the city grows .

 The Robert C. H. Mathews Jr . Terminal is the airport 's main commercial terminal . It consists of three <unk> ground transportation on the first , baggage claim services on the second ; and ticketing , passenger drop off , and concourse access on the third . There are 47 gates in the three concourses in use . These concourses are connected by a large hub that contains a unified security checkpoint located in the main section of the terminal . 
 The terminal is served by Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority bus route 18 , which provides express and local service between the airport 's passenger facilities and the Music City Central bus terminal in Nashville 's central business district . 
 Concourse A was originally constructed to service American Airlines international flights between Nashville and London . Concourse A has 8 gates , of which 6 are occupied . It is now utilized by Air Canada , Frontier Airlines , and United Airlines and its respective express subsidiaries and is the smallest concourse in use . United uses gates A3 , A4 , A7 , A8 . Air Canada uses gate A1 , and Frontier uses A2 . 
 Concourse B is the second largest concourse in BNA with 13 gates , eleven of which are occupied . It is utilized by Alaska Airlines , Boutique Air , Contour Airlines , JetBlue , WestJet , Delta Air Lines , and its respective subsidiaries for domestic flights . Delta uses gates B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , B5 , B7 . Alaska uses gate B8 , JetBlue uses gate B6 , Contour uses gate B10 , Boutique Air uses B11 , and WestJet uses <unk> . 
 Concourse C is the largest concourse at BNA , featuring a large shopping and dining area and the highest number of gates of any concourse . Concourse C has 24 gates , all of which are occupied , although 3 of these gates are inactive . It was originally constructed to be the main concourse for American Airlines during BNA 's tenure as a hub , which continues to maintain a large presence in the concourse . It is now mainly utilized by Southwest Airlines for their focus city operations in Nashville . Additional occupants of Concourse C include American Airlines and American Eagle . American uses gates C3 , C5 , C6 , C10 , C11 , C12 , C13 , and C14 . Southwest uses gates C2 , C4 , C7 , C9 , C15 , C16 , C17 , C18 , C19 , <unk> , C21 , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Concourse D was constructed as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities . All American Eagle flights operated out of Concourse D until , as a cost @-@ cutting measure after September 11 , 2001 ( 9 / 11 ) , all American Eagle flights were moved to Concourse C to share gates with American Airlines . For a short period of time , Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became an regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection , at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA . The MNAA has no plans to reopen Concourse D , and it is occupied by the Transportation Security Administration .

 = The Sword of Kahless = 
 " The Sword of Kahless " is the 81st episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , the ninth of the fourth season . It originally aired on November 20 , 1995 in broadcast syndication . The story was created by Richard Danus and was turned into a teleplay by Hans Beimler . The episode was directed by Star Trek : The Next Generation alumnus LeVar Burton , and featured the return of John Colicos as Kor . Colicos had first appeared as Kor in the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Errand of Mercy " , and had previously appeared in this series in the episode " Blood Oath " . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine , a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy . In this episode , Kor returns to the station to recruit Lt. Cmdr. Worf ( Michael Dorn ) and Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax ( Terry Farrell ) to help to find the ancient Sword of Kahless . After they find the sword , they are forced to evade the forces of Toral ( Rick Pasqualone ) , Son of Duras , and Worf and Kor come to blows over the future use of the weapon . 
 The episode was the first in the series to feature the character of Worf in a central storyline , who had previously been a character on The Next Generation . Due to time restraints in filming , there were edits made to the scripts and the production team were forced to make best use of the cave sets which had been seen on the show previously . The sword itself was created specifically for the episode , and was made to seem more elaborate than the bat 'leths previously seen in Star Trek , including hand etchings to make it appear similar to Damascus steel . Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score , including the use of Wagner tubas . Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction , critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Kor ( John Colicos ) , a revered Klingon warrior , is in Quark 's Bar telling stories of past battles to his friend Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax ( Terry Farrell ) . She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf ( Michael Dorn ) nearby and invites him to meet Kor , who greets Worf happily , saying that anyone who is so strongly disliked by the Klingon government is a friend of his . He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless . The sword is the original bat 'leth , used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor . Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team , which he believes once held the Sword . He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud 's authenticity . As he returns to his quarters , Kor is attacked by a <unk> who reads his thoughts in order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack . Jadzia finds him the following morning , and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol . She has verified the authenticity of the shroud . Captain Benjamin Sisko ( Avery Brooks ) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found the shroud . 
 They arrive at the planet and travel to an underground vault which had been ransacked . As they are about to leave , Worf discovers a secret chamber containing the sword . They are attacked by Toral ( Rick Pasqualone ) , son of Duras who had hired the <unk> and wants the sword for the prestige of finding it . Kor , Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit , they head into the adjoining cave system in order to try to get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter . As they travel through the caves , the Klingons begin to be affected by the prestige of the sword . Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people . Suddenly , Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses to let go of the sword . Worf grabs the other end of the sword , and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up . 
 Dax helps Worf save Kor , and afterwards takes possession of the sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it . The three make camp and sleep through the night , but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf . The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive . After Toral is subdued , Kor and Worf again attack each other . Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout . After they depart the planet , Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they , it would do the same to the Klingon Empire , so they beam it into space , leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it .

 " The Sword of Kahless " was the first Deep Space Nine ( DS9 ) episode to predominately focus on Worf . Michael Dorn had joined the cast at the beginning of season four , but his character was not featured prominently in the first eight episodes of the season because they had been scripted prior to confirmation that Dorn would be joining the show . " The Sword of Kahless " was the first episode to be written after his arrival , so it was the first time his character was featured centrally . This meant that in each of those episodes , Worf was inserted into the episode , whereas " The Sword of Kahless " was the first episode to be written after his arrival and the production team wanted him to feature centrally for the first time . The story was created by Richard Danus , who had been the executive story editor during the third season of TNG , when Ira Steven Behr joined the production team . Danus had written TNG episodes such as " Déjà Q " and co @-@ wrote the teleplay for " Booby Trap " . It was Behr who gave Danus the opportunity to write for DS9 , after they became friends following Behr 's arrival on TNG . 
 The episode was directed by another former TNG actor , LeVar Burton , who described the story as something akin to the search for the Holy Grail in Klingon mythology . Hans Beimler , who converted Danus ' story into a teleplay , was aware of the mythology of the Grail as he wrote the script and wanted to avoid giving the sword any mystical or magical powers . He said that " It 's the concept of the sword that has the power . We could have said that some technology or magic gave the Klingons the feeling of power , but that would have been a cheap way to go . " The writing staff was disappointed in the reaction of many fans , who wanted a technological explanation for the effects of the sword . 
 = = = Filming , casting and music = = = 
 Because of limited time to film , several edits were made to the script by Beimler . Some of the scenes set in the cave sets were dropped as they would have taken too long to set up . Kor , Worf and Dax were in almost every scene of the episode and so time could not be saved by filming more than one scene at a time . The cave sequences were filmed on the cave standing sets on stage 18 of Paramount Studios . The sets were limited , so Burton said that in order to make it look like the characters were moving through a complex labyrinth of caves , he and director of photography Jonathan West used the sets ' depth to make them look like different parts of the caves . 
 The precipice that Kor nearly falls down was created by filming the actors on the second level of the cave sets and then matting the footage onto a 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) long miniature version of the cave that Gary Hutzel created out of aluminium foil . The production staff also spread sand onto the floor of the cave sets in order to make it look different from other episodes in which the sets had been used . Burton advised Farrell on the aggressiveness Dax should show in her interactions with Kor and Worf in the episode , a type of performance which both Burton and Farrell later nicknamed " Action Barbie " . 
 John Colicos had appeared as Kor once before on DS9 , in the second season episode " Blood Oath " . Colicos had played the first main character Klingon to appear on Star Trek , in his appearance in The Original Series first season episode " Errand of Mercy " . Rick Pasqualone had appeared as Toral , son of Duras in " The Sword of Kahless " . The character , played by JD Cullum , had appeared in the TNG two @-@ part episode " Redemption " , when he sought the leadership of the Klingon High Council alongside his aunts <unk> and B <unk> . Worf has history with the House of Duras , dating back to the rivalry between Worf 's father , Mogh , and Toral 's grandfather , Ja <unk> . 
 Composer David Bell created music for the episode that had echoes of the operas of 19th @-@ century German composer Richard Wagner . He explained that he used " Wagner opera vocabulary in the orchestrations , and ... actually used Wagner tubas in the score " . He used religious tones to accompany appearances of the sword itself , specifically when it is first found by Worf , and said , " If the audience isn 't made to understand the spiritual importance of that weapon , then we have no episode " .

 Dan Curry created the Klingon weapon , the bat 'leth , while working on TNG . Its first appearance was in the episode " Reunion " and has appeared in all live action series of Star Trek with the exception of The Original Series . The sword in " The Sword of Kahless " was intended to be the first bat 'leth made by , according to Klingon mythology , Kahless himself , which he used to defeat the tyrant Molor and unite the Klingon people for the first time in their history . 
 It was decided that the sword needed to be different from other bat 'leths seen on the show , and so a new hardened aluminium prop was ordered after numerous designs by John Eaves were considered on paper . As with the original bat 'leth , Dan Curry created the prop . Sculptor Dragon Dronet then etched designs into the blade by hand using dental tools . The producers requested designs on the blade similar to the effects seen in Damascus steel , which was combined with Dronet 's idea of forming these into a topographic map , with an effect described as being " as if you 're staring down at mountains " . Klingon names were then added to the side of the weapon . Dronet also created the stand for the sword out of plexiglas which was spray @-@ painted to look metallic . The legs of the stand were carved to look like the feet of the Klingon animal , the <unk> . " The Sword of Kahless " also featured new prop designs for Starfleet @-@ issued over @-@ the @-@ shoulder bags and the camping equipment used in the cave sequences . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " The Sword of Kahless " was first broadcast on November 20 , 1995 in broadcast syndication . It received Nielsen ratings of 6 @.@ 9 percent , placing it in tenth place in its timeslot and lower than the episode that aired the previous week , " Little Green Men " , which gained a rating of 7 @.@ 1 percent . " The Sword of Kahless " received a higher rating than the following episode , " Our Man Bashir " , seen by 6 @.@ 8 percent of viewers . 
 Several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series . Michelle Erica Green , who watched the episode in April 2013 for TrekNation , thought that it was not a typical Deep Space Nine episode and that it required knowledge of Worf 's history from The Next Generation . She said that the episode was " admirable for a drama that takes place mostly walking through uninteresting cave sets " . She thought that towards the end , it became a little " mumbo @-@ jumbo @-@ mystical " but that it was in " perfect keeping with the Klingons " . However , she felt that the episode again relied on Jadzia 's past as Curzon Dax and that the ending would have been better with Toral stealing the sword at the last minute so that it could be followed up with in a later episode . 
 Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " compared the episode to an Indiana Jones story and said that it was a " enjoyable fable for a simpler time " . He praised the musical score by David Bell and thought that the episode was the perfect vehicle for Worf , saying that Michael Dorn gave a strong performance . He gave the episode a rating of three and a half out of four . Zack Handlen , writing for the A.V. Club in January 2013 , said that the plot was similar to the plots of stories such as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre ( 1927 ) . He felt that the episode showed a side of Worf that had not been seen before , and that Worf had exhibited a " willingness to go to absolute lengths to do what he believes needs to be done " . He compared it to the anger bubbling under the surface of Bruce Banner in the 2012 film The Avengers . 
 The first home media release of " The Sword of Kahless " was as a two @-@ episode VHS cassette alongside " Our Man Bashir " in the United Kingdom on June 13 , 1996 , followed in the United States and Canada by a single @-@ episode release on October 3 , 2000 . It was later released on DVD as part of the season four box set on August 5 , 2003 . 
 = Umbriel ( moon ) = 
 Umbriel is a moon of Uranus discovered on October 24 , 1851 , by William Lassell . It was discovered at the same time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope 's poem The Rape of the Lock . Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock , and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle . The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons , and appears to have been shaped primarily by impacts . However , the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes , and the moon may have undergone an early <unk> driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface . 
 Covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km ( 130 mi ) in diameter , Umbriel is the second most heavily cratered satellite of Uranus after Oberon . The most prominent surface feature is a ring of bright material on the floor of Wunda crater . This moon , like all moons of Uranus , probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet just after its formation . The Uranian system has been studied up close only once , by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in January 1986 . It took several images of Umbriel , which allowed mapping of about 40 % of the moon ’ s surface . 
 = = Discovery and name = = 
 Umbriel , along with another Uranian satellite , Ariel , was discovered by William Lassell on October 24 , 1851 . Although William Herschel , the discoverer of Titania and Oberon , claimed at the end of the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus , his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious . 
 All of Uranus 's moons are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope . The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell . Umbriel is the " dusky melancholy sprite " in Alexander Pope 's The Rape of the Lock , and the name suggests the Latin umbra , meaning shadow . The moon is also designated Uranus II . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Umbriel orbits Uranus at the distance of about 266 @,@ 000 km ( 165 @,@ 000 mi ) , being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons . Umbriel 's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus . Its orbital period is around 4 @.@ 1 Earth days , coincident with its rotational period . In other words , Umbriel is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite , with one face always pointing toward its parent planet . Umbriel 's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere . This is important , because the trailing hemispheres of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere ( like Umbriel ) are struck by magnetospheric plasma , which co @-@ rotates with the planet . This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres , which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon ( see below ) . Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles , which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon 's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986 . 
 Because Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side , and its moons orbit in the planet 's equatorial plane , they ( including Umbriel ) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle . Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in complete darkness , and another 42 years in continuous sunlight , with the Sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice . The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere 's 1986 summer solstice , when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was unilluminated . Once every 42 years , when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth , mutual occultations of Uranus 's moons become possible . In 2007 – 2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8 , 2007 as well as of Ariel by Umbriel on August 19 , 2007 . 
 Currently Umbriel is not involved in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites . Early in its history , however , it may have been in a 1 : 3 resonance with Miranda . This would have increased Miranda 's orbital eccentricity , contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon , while Umbriel 's orbit would have been less affected . Due to Uranus 's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites , its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn . After Miranda escaped from this resonance ( through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination ) , its eccentricity would have been damped , turning off the heat source . 
 = = Composition and internal structure = = 
 Umbriel is the third largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons . The moon 's density is 1 @.@ 39 g / cm3 , which indicates that it mainly consists of water ice , with a dense non @-@ ice component constituting around 40 % of its mass . The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins . The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations , which have revealed crystalline water ice on the surface of the moon . Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Umbriel 's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere . The cause of this asymmetry is not known , but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus , which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere ( due to the plasma 's co @-@ rotation ) . The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice , decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics , leaving a dark , carbon @-@ rich residue behind . 
 Except for water , the only other compound identified on the surface of Umbriel by the infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide , which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere . The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear . It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from the magnetosphere of Uranus or the solar ultraviolet radiation . This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution , as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere . Another possible source is the outgassing of the primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Umbriel 's interior . The escape of CO2 from the interior may be a result of past geological activity on this moon . 
 Umbriel may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle . If this is the case , the radius of the core ( 317 km ) is about 54 % of the radius of the moon , and its mass is around 40 % of the moon ’ s mass — the parameters are dictated by the moon 's composition . The pressure in the center of Umbriel is about 0 @.@ 24 GPa ( 2 @.@ 4 kbar ) . The current state of the icy mantle is unclear , although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely . 
 = = Surface features = = 
 Umbriel 's surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons , and reflects less than half as much light as Ariel , a sister satellite of similar size . Umbriel has a very low Bond albedo of only about 10 % as compared to 23 % for Ariel . The reflectivity of the moon 's surface decreases from 26 % at a phase angle of 0 ° ( geometric albedo ) to 19 % at an angle of about 1 ° . This phenomenon is called opposition surge . The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color , while fresh bright impact deposits ( in Wunda crater , for instance ) are even bluer . There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres ; the former appears to be redder than the latter . The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System . However , the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system , possibly , from irregular satellites , which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere . The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous — it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color . 
 Scientists have so far recognized only one class of geological feature on Umbriel — craters . The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and Titania . It shows the least geological activity . In fact , among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel . The observed crater diameters range from a few kilometers at the low end to 210 kilometers for the largest known crater , <unk> . All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks , but no crater has rays . 
 Near Umbriel 's equator lies the most prominent surface feature : Wunda crater , which has a diameter of about 131 km . Wunda has a large ring of bright material on its floor , which appears to be an impact deposit . Nearby , seen along the terminator , are the craters <unk> and <unk> , which lack bright rims but possess bright central peaks . Study of limb profiles of Umbriel revealed a possible very large impact feature having the diameter of about 400 km and depth of approximately 5 km . 
 Much like other moons of Uranus , the surface of Umbriel is cut by a system of canyons trending northeast – southwest . They are not , however , officially recognized due to the poor imaging resolution and generally bland appearance of this moon , which hinders geological mapping . 
 Umbriel 's heavily cratered surface has probably been stable since the Late Heavy Bombardment . The only signs of the ancient internal activity are canyons and dark polygons — dark patches with complex shapes measuring from tens to hundreds of kilometers across . The polygons were identified from precise photometry of Voyager 2 's images and are distributed more or less uniformly on the surface of Umbriel , trending northeast – southwest . Some polygons correspond to depressions of a few kilometers deep and may have been created during an early episode of tectonic activity . Currently there is no explanation for why Umbriel is so dark and uniform in appearance . Its surface may be covered by a relatively thin layer of dark material ( so called umbral material ) excavated by an impact or expelled in an explosive volcanic eruption . Alternatively , Umbriel 's crust may be entirely composed of the dark material , which prevented formation of bright features like crater rays . However , the presence of the bright feature within Wunda seems to contradict this hypothesis . 
 = = Origin and evolution = = 
 Umbriel is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula ; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity . The precise composition of the subnebula is not known ; however , the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water @-@ poor . Significant amounts of nitrogen and carbon may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide ( CO ) and molecular nitrogen ( N2 ) instead of ammonia and methane . The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice ( with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate ) and more rock , explaining the higher density . 
 Umbriel 's accretion probably lasted for several thousand years . The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon 's outer layer . The maximum temperature of around 180 K was reached at the depth of about 3 km . After the end of formation , the subsurface layer cooled , while the interior of Umbriel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks . The cooling near @-@ surface layer contracted , while the interior expanded . This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon 's crust , which may have led to cracking . This process probably lasted for about 200 million years , implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions of years ago . 
 The initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements may have led to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia ( in the form of ammonia hydrate ) or some salt was present . The melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle . A layer of liquid water ( ocean ) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core – mantle boundary . The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176 K. The ocean , however , is likely to have frozen long ago . Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes , although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event . 
 = = Exploration = = 
 So far the only close @-@ up images of Umbriel have been from the Voyager 2 probe , which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986 . Since the closest distance between Voyager 2 and Umbriel was 325 @,@ 000 km ( 202 @,@ 000 mi ) , the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 5 @.@ 2 km . The images cover about 40 % of the surface , but only 20 % was photographed with the quality required for geological mapping . At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Umbriel ( like those of the other moons ) was pointed towards the Sun , so the northern ( dark ) hemisphere could not be studied . No other spacecraft has ever visited Uranus ( and Umbriel ) , and no mission to Uranus and its moons are planned .

 = Oliver P. Morton = 
 Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton ( August 4 , 1823 – November 1 , 1877 ) , commonly known as Oliver P. Morton , was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana . He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War , and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln . During the war , Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic @-@ controlled Indiana General Assembly . He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval , and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans . He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers . As one of President Lincoln 's " war governors " , Morton made signification contributions to the war effort , more than any other man in the state , and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support . 
 During his second term as governor , and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke , he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate . He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era , and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy . In 1877 , during his second term in the Senate , Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health ; he died later that year . Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands . He is buried in Indianapolis 's Crown Hill Cemetery . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family and background = = = 
 Morton was an Indiana native born in Wayne County near the small settlement of Salisbury on August 4 , 1823 , to James Throck and Sarah Miller Morton . His grandfather had shortened the family 's surname , Throckmorton , to Morton , but the males in the family carried Throck as a middle name . He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry , the victorious Commodore in the Battle of Lake Erie . Morton disliked his name from an early age , and before beginning his political career he shortened it to Oliver Perry Morton , dropping the middle names of Hazard and Throck . His mother died when he was three , and he was raised by his maternal grandparents . He spent most of his young life living with them in Ohio . 
 Morton returned to eastern Indiana as a young man , and joined his family at Centerville . Leaving school at the age of fifteen , Morton briefly worked as an apothecary 's clerk , but left after a dispute with the proprietor and apprenticed as a hat maker . After four years in the hat @-@ making business he became dissatisfied and quit to enroll at Miami University in Oxford , Ohio , where he studied for two years , and briefly attended Cincinnati College to continue his law studies . In 1845 he returned to Centerville and was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1846 . Morton formed a law practice with Judge Newman and became a successful and moderately wealthy attorney . Morton married Lucinda Burbank in 1845 . The couple had five children , but only two survived infancy . 
 = = = Early political career = = = 
 In 1852 Morton campaigned and was elected to serve as a circuit court judge , but resigned after only a year ; he found that he preferred to practice law . By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics . Initially , Morton was an anti @-@ slavery Democrat , but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had little hope of furthering a political career without changing his party affiliation . Passage of the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act ( 1854 ) , which repealed the Missouri Compromise 's ban on slavery in the western territories , beyond Missouri , had a divisive effect on both parties . As the Democrats divided over the issue , Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act . Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright , the state 's Democrats expel its anti @-@ slavery members , including Morton , from the Indiana state convention in 1854 . That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People 's party , the forerunner to the state 's Republican party . 
 By February 1856 Morton had made his way to the newly formed Republican party at the national level as a member of the resolutions committee to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh . He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia . Thirty @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old Morton became the People 's / Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856 . His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard , a popular state senator . Despite a hard @-@ fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state , Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6 @,@ 000 votes , amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting . Radical Republican George W. Julian , who detested Morton , contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery , and , as conservative former Whigs claimed , he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern @-@ born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism . Despite these criticisms , Morton 's anti @-@ slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana . Noted for his " plain and convincing " manner of speaking , Morton 's contemporaries said he was not " eloquent or witty " , but rather " logical and reasonable " . 
 By 1858 , the People 's party had officially adopted the name of Republican , and in 1860 the Republicans nominated Morton for lieutenant governor of Indiana on a ticket with the more conservative former Whig , Henry S. Lane , as its gubernatorial candidate . Savvy Republican politicians thought that Morton would be seen as too radical and could not carry the former Know @-@ Nothing vote in the southern half of the state , while a man of Whig antecedents like Lane would . Because both men had strong support within the party , and neither had much desire to make open war on one another , a compromise was arranged , giving Lane the gubernatorial nomination and Morton the nomination for lieutenant governor . Both nominees understood that if they carried the state and a Republican majority was elected to the state legislature in the fall , the Indiana General Assembly would choose Lane for a seat in the U.S. Senate and Morton would become the successor to the Indiana governorship . The campaign focused primarily on the prevailing issues of the nation , including homesteading legislation , tariffs , and the looming possibility of civil war . Lane and Morton won in the state 's general election and the Republicans gained control of the state legislature . As it had been pre @-@ arranged with the candidates , on the day after Lane 's inauguration as governor , the General Assembly chose him to fill a U.S. Senate seat . Lane resigned immediately and Morton succeeded him to become the fourteenth governor of Indiana on January 18 , 1861 , and its first governor to be born in the state .

 Morton served as governor of Indiana for six years ( 1861 – 1867 ) and strongly supported the Union during the Civil War . While others urged compromise and conciliation , Morton demanded an end to concession discussions , with no further compromise , and , if necessary , the use of force to preserve the Union . In a speech he delivered on November 22 , 1860 , Morton declared : " If it is worth a bloody struggle to establish this nation , it is worth one to preserve it . " He was also a staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln 's conduct of the war . Morton , who was not in favor of conciliation , believed his role as Indiana 's governor was " to denounce treason and uphold the cause of the Union . " 
 Morton also believed that war was inevitable and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor . Morton appointed men to positions in state government who opposed any compromise with the southern states . He also established without legislative permission a state arsenal , where up to 700 men produced ammunition , and made many other preparations for the impending war . 
 Three days after the war began on April 12 , 1861 , at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina , Governor Morton telegraphed President Lincoln offering 10 @,@ 000 volunteers from Indiana under arms to help suppress the rebellion . By the end of April , about 12 @,@ 000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union , exceeding the state 's initial quota of six regiments ( 4 @,@ 683 men ) . In a special session of the Indiana General Assembly held on April 24 , 1861 , Morton called for Indiana 's politicians to set aside party considerations and unite in defense of the Union . He also received the state legislature 's authority to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana 's troops . 
 Among Lincoln 's " war governors " , who were critically important in the early prosecution of the war , " no governor played his role more valiantly or effectively than did Morton . " Although Morton 's efforts were not without controversy and garnered significant opposition from his political adversaries , his greatest strength during the war was his ability to raise volunteers and money for the Union army and to equip them for battle . Morton also successfully suppressed Indiana 's Confederate sympathizers . As the leader of the Republicans in the state , he confronted the Peace Democrats , especially the " Copperheads " . 
 Lincoln and Morton maintained a close alliance during the war , although Lincoln was wary at times of Morton 's ruthlessness . Lincoln also recognized the Indiana governor had significant fears , once remarking that Morton was " a good fellow , but at times he is the <unk> person I know . " Morton was especially afraid that Kentucky , across the Ohio River from Indiana 's southern border , would secede from the Union and pose a threat to Indiana 's security . 
 Morton went to great lengths to ensure that Indiana contributed as much as possible to the war effort . He was not afraid to criticize others if he felt Indiana 's interests were being overlooked . Morton frequently clashed with federal authorities and military leaders over recruitment policies , regimental assignments , appointment of military leaders , purchases of supplies , and the care given to sick and wounded soldiers , among other issues . Although he wanted Indiana to receive as much recognition as other states , Morton 's political opponents often challenged his efforts . Governor Morton once complained to Lincoln that " no other free state is so populated with southerners " , which he believed kept him from being as forceful as he wanted to be . 
 In 1862 Morton attended the Loyal War Governors ' Conference in Altoona , Pennsylvania , organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin , that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation . Emancipation and the conscription of men to fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans and Democrats during Morton 's tenure as governor . 
 = = = Conflict with the General Assembly = = = 
 Although Morton was able to keep the state united during the first phase of the war , once emancipation became an issue in 1862 , the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid @-@ term elections , and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature . Before the new legislature convened in 1863 , Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government , secede from the Union , and instigate riots . The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln , the conduct of the war , and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights , among others . Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations . 
 Morton had already made several unconstitutional moves by acting on his own authority without legislative approval , including the establishment of the state arsenal , and the Democrats drafted legislation that attempted to reduce his authority . When Democrats in the state legislature sought to remove the state militia from Morton 's command and transfer it to a state board of Democratic commissioners , the governor immediately disbanded the Indiana General Assembly . He feared that once in control of militia , the Democrats might attempt to force him from office and secede from the Union . Morton issued secret instructions to Republican legislators , asking them to stay away from Indianapolis , the state capital , to prevent the General Assembly from attaining the quorum needed to pass any legislation . All but four Republicans fled to Madison , Indiana , where they could quickly flee into Kentucky if the Democrats attempted to force their return to Indianapolis . 
 Without the enactment of an appropriations bill , the state government would not have funds to operate , and the Democrats assumed that Morton would be forced to call a special session and recall the Republicans . The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor , but Morton was aware of their plans . Going beyond his constitutional powers , Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans . Morton 's move to subvert the state legislature was successful ; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana . Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow , Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state 's debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts . 
 Morton 's moves caused considerable rage among the Democrats , who launched a vicious attack on the governor . He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason . Following the suppression of the General Assembly in 1862 , Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state 's levies for service . He also established an intelligence network under Carrington 's leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle , and , beginning in 1863 , the American Knights , which merged with the Sons of Liberty . Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states @-@ rights and opposed the Union cause during the war . Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure , but his operatives also carried out arbitrary arrests , suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of association , and generally maintained repressive control over the southern @-@ sympathetic minority . In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue 's Run , Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention , where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested , detained , or threatened . Morton also urged pro @-@ war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity for the duration of the war , and met with some success . Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among the Democrats who had been expelled from the party in 1854 , and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship , Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate . 
 In reaction to Morton 's actions against dissenters , the Indiana Democratic Party called Morton a " Dictator " and an " <unk> Mobster . " Republicans countered that the Democrats were using " treasonable and obstructionist tactics in the conduct of the war " . Morton illegally — without approval from the state legislature — called out the state militia in July 1863 to counter Morgan 's Raid , an incident where Confederate raiders under Confederate General John Hunt Morgan crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana . Large @-@ scale support for the Confederacy among Golden Circle members and southern Hoosiers in general declined after Morgan 's raiders ransacked many homes bearing the banners of the Golden Circle , despite their proclaimed support for the Confederate cause . After Hoosiers failed to support Morgan 's troops in significant numbers , Morton slowed his crackdown on Confederate sympathizers within the state , theorizing that because the Copperheads had failed to come to Morgan 's aid in large numbers , they would similarly fail to aid a larger invasion . 
 Despite his controversial actions , one notable thing historians record from this period during Morton 's first term as governor was the honesty with which the government was run . All of the borrowed money was accounted for with no political corruption and repaid in the years after the war . It was by these honest actions that Morton was able to avoid repercussions when the state legislature reconvened after Morton 's reelection , this time with a new Republican majority . 
 = = = Second term = = = 
 In 1864 the war was nearing its end , but many Hoosiers were war weary and saw no end in sight as they prepared for the state 's next gubernatorial election . Indiana 's constitution prohibited a governor to serve more than four years in any eight @-@ year period , but Morton was elected as Indiana 's lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane 's term , so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election . The Democrats were furious and launched a bitter campaign against Morton , who did not do a great deal of campaigning . Instead , he successfully returned about 9 @,@ 000 active @-@ duty soldiers home on leave to vote in the election , presumably for Morton , " the soldier 's friend " , and his fellow Republicans . 
 Morton was reelected to office , defeating Democrat and longtime friend Joseph McDonald by more than 20 @,@ 000 votes . Although the campaign was conducted in time of war , with both parties strongly opposing the other , both Morton and McDonald remained friends after the campaign and later served together in the U.S. Senate . Many Democrats claimed that Morton had rigged the election because Republicans retook the majority in both houses of the Assembly . 
 Morton was partially crippled by a paralytic stroke in October 1865 which incapacitated him for a time . For treatment , Morton traveled to Europe where he sought the assistance of several specialists , but none were able to help his paralysis . During his recovery , Lieutenant Governor Conrad Baker served as acting governor . With the war ending , Baker oversaw the demobilization of most of the state 's forces . Morton returned to the governorship in March 1866 , but he was never again able to walk without assistance .

 = = = First term = = = 
 In 1867 , Morton was elected by the Indiana General Assembly to serve as a U.S. Senator . He resigned from his post as governor that same year and turned over the leadership of the state government to Lieutenant Governor Baker . In the U.S. Senate , Morton became a member of the foreign affairs committee and quickly grew to become a Republican leader . He was also made chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections . Because of his stroke , Morton always sat while delivering his speeches , but he was noted by other senators for his effectiveness in speaking and debating . 
 Morton 's close observers saw a man of untiring activity , " of unfaltering determination , quick as well as far @-@ seeing ... " Restless and full of energy , one newspaper commentated , " He accommodated himself with a kind of cynical indifference to his crippled body , as to a house badly out of repair , and dragged it about with him as a snail does a shell . " As a U.S. Senator , " he excused himself from no duties ; acted as chairman and member of several committees ; was never absent from his seat , and was ready for debate at all times . " 
 <unk> sources described Morton in exceedingly negative terms . " With a superabundance of the quality called ' force , ' Senator Morton possesses one of the most terrible natures in public life , " and as news correspondent George Alfred Townsend described him : " A dark , determined , brooding and desperate mind is reflected in his <unk> complexion and introspective eyes . His powerful frame , prematurely wrecked , yet carrying alive the savage will , towers on his crutch , and in his very hobble is the tyrant 's pace .... He wants to be terrible for the sake of freedom . His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism . Like all bloody bigots , he thinks he feels God 's mercy moving in him . " 
 Morton , who served in the U.S. Senate during Reconstruction , supported much of the Radical Republican program for re @-@ making the former Confederate states . Early in his first term , Morton supported legislation to eliminate all civil government in the southern states and impose a military government . He also supported legislation to void the southern states ' constitutions — in nearly every case imposed in 1865 without being submitted to the voters — and to require elections for representatives to state constitutional conventions that would be charged with writing new ones . In addition , he voted in favor of provisions declaring that the new state constitutions would go into effect only if adopted by a majority of registered voters , not just those voting in the special elections that called for the constitutions ' adoption . At the same time , he favored stringent restrictions on former Confederates who were permitted to vote , in particular those who had taken an oath to support the United States Constitution , and had served the Confederate States of America in a political office or in its military . 
 During the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson , Morton voted in favor of conviction , as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans , and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson 's acquittal . Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote , and once worked to end Indiana 's so @-@ called " Black Laws " that restricted blacks ' basic civil rights , and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state , he reversed his position after the war . By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise . As he explained , " I confess , and I do it without shame , that I have been educated by the great events of War . " He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment , and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum , Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in the docket and allowed it to be passed . 
 U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar once judged Morton as a man with " little regard for Constitutional scruples . " Not that Morton would have willfully flouted his oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution , but Hoar added , " he believed that the Constitution should be interpreted in the light of the Declaration of Independence , so as to be the law of life to a great , powerful , and free people . To this principle of interpretation , all strict or narrow criticism , founded on its literal meaning , must yield . " If so , Hoar 's assessment put Morton in the same category as U.S. Senator Charles Sumner , who openly declared the Declaration 's decree that all men were created equal the defining words by which all constitutional duty should be judged . 
 After President @-@ elect Ulysses S. Grant 's inauguration in 1869 , Morton became one of the Grant administration 's most able and reliable floor leaders . Morton helped shepherd through the bill <unk> Virginia to representation in Congress and voted in favor of the treaty annexing Santo Domingo to the United States . Later , he countered Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in a bitter debate over the president 's motives and intentions towards the Caribbean nation and its people . In the Senate Morton argued in favor of the Enforcement Act ( 1871 ) , also known as the so @-@ called Ku @-@ Klux Act , that gave the president expanded power to oppose terrorism in the Deep South . Morton , known as a masterful waver of the " bloody shirt " , was unstinting in his efforts to connect the Democrats to wartime treason and peacetime violence , and generally could be relied on to provide a ready and strong defense of the federal government 's right to intervene and enforce the protection of the civil rights of black Americans . Morton championed the right of Louisiana 's black leader , Pinckney B. S. <unk> , to a seat in the U.S. Senate , although the effort was unsuccessful . Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1875 , and had his strongest support in 1876 among black Republicans in an increasingly " solid South " . 
 The Grant administration , who recognized Morton as a powerful friend , offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain , replacing John Lothrop Motley , but Morton declined . Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats , Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat . In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States . ( Later , Grant recalled that concerns over Morton 's ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice , but Grant may have mistaken . Well @-@ advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered a place on the Supreme Court , unofficially , and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown ) . 
 = = = Second term = = = 
 Morton was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1873 , and began his second term in 1874 . His stand on paper money added to his controversial reputation . During a time of serious economic hardship and deflation , Morton favored a bill that would have added more paper currency to the money supply . He began his second term by leading the Senate 's support for an inflation bill that President Grant vetoed . Morton 's action was politically astute . In Indiana the demands for easy money topped the Democrats ' list of priority issues , and in the fall of 1874 , they carried the state 's elections largely on that basis . However , within a year , Morton joined other Republicans in supporting the Specie Payment Resumption Act , which effectively suspended new currency issues and gave the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury the authority to withdraw currency from circulation . 
 In 1876 Morton was a contender for the Republican nomination for president at the party 's National Convention in Cincinnati , Ohio . Richard W. Thompson offered Morton 's name to the delegation at a nominee , but Morton 's position on issuing paper money to inflate the currency , combined with his failing health , hurt his bid for the nomination among the convention delegates . However , neither of these issues made as much difference as Morton 's association with the deeply discredited and scandal @-@ ridden Grant administration . Morton 's nomination would have made the Republicans vulnerable on both the Reconstruction and corruption issues . In addition , Grant 's supporters had an alternative choice in U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York . Between the two nominees , the " stalwart " Republican bloc was divided , with no prospect of coming together because Conkling and Morton detested one another . When the balloting began , Morton 's vote total placed him second to James G. Blaine , but Morton had slipped to fourth place by the sixth ballot . Blaine 's opponents could only stop Morton 's nomination by uniting behind a candidate acceptable to reform @-@ minded delegates and the stalwart bloc . On the seventh ballot nearly all the anti @-@ Blaine delegates , including Morton 's , united to give Rutherford B. Hayes the Republican nomination . 
 Morton ranked as one of the strongest members of the so @-@ called " stalwart " faction of the Republican party : those members most deeply committed to protecting and preserving Republican governments in the South . Not surprisingly , during the winter of 1876 @-@ 77 , Morton was among the most aggressive supporters of Hayes 's right to the presidency in a close election . When Morton was placed on the Electoral Commission , the group that determined the outcome of the election , there was never any doubt that his vote would be cast for Hayes . After Hayes 's supporters made overtures to southern Democrats , offering assurances that the president @-@ elect would take no active role in propping up Republican governors in Louisiana and South Carolina , there were fears that Morton might cause difficulties . In one speech Morton made it clear that the Democrats must make guarantees of fair play and equal rights for southern blacks , before he would support Hayes 's program . The guarantees were given , or at least promises were made . To the general surprise of many , Hayes 's policy withdrew military support from the Republican governments in those two states , and Morton proved to be one of the president 's strongest defenders , urging that his fellow Republicans show patience and give the so @-@ called " New Departure " time to prove itself . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 In 1877 Morton was named to lead a committee to investigate charges of bribery made against La Fayette Grover , a newly elected U.S. Senator from Oregon . The committee spent eighteen days in Oregon holding hearings and investigations . On the return trip , Morton detoured to San Francisco for a rest and visit . After dinner on the night of August 6 , Morton suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body . The next day he was taken by train to Cheyenne , Wyoming Territory , where he was met by his brother @-@ in @-@ law , John A. Burbank , the former governor of the Dakota Territory . Morton was accompanied by him to the home of his mother @-@ in @-@ law in Richmond , Indiana , where he stayed until October 15 , then he was moved to his own home in Indianapolis to recover . He remained at Indianapolis , surrounded by his family , until his death on November 1 , 1877 . 
 Morton 's remains were laid in state at the Indiana Statehouse , before their removal to Indianapolis 's Roberts Park Methodist Church , where his funeral service was held . The service was attended by many dignitaries from across the United States , and President Hayes ordered all flags to half @-@ staff . Because the church could not hold the large crowd , thousands of mourners waited outside and followed in a long procession to witness the burial at Indianapolis 's Crown Hill Cemetery .

 Morton remains " the most powerful , important , and controversial governor in Indiana history . " To his admirers and supporters , Morton was a decisive , effective , ambitious , and energetic leader as governor of Indiana during the Civil War ; his detractors would describe him as a wily and power @-@ hungry politician , who shifted his stance on issues to suit prevailing views for his own political gain . Although his tactics were controversial , and on occasion unconstitutional , he remained a dominant political figure from 1861 to 1877 . As one of Lincoln 's " war governors " , Morton was most successful in recruiting and equipping Union troops during the Civil War , and became known as " the soldier 's friend " , in tribute to his crucial efforts in supplying and supporting the Union soldiers in the field . Morton was also known for standing firm against his political opponents , whom he often antagonized by his ruthlessness , and they frequently responded with severe criticism of his actions . 
 = = = Policies and criticism = = = 
 Morton had many critics during his long tenure in government service . They derided the manner in which he ran Indiana 's state government during the Civil War and criticized his open suppression of the freedom of speech , arrests and detentions of his political opponents , and violations of the state and federal constitutions on more than one occasion . Morton justified his forceful actions as " a necessary wartime measure " to protect Indiana and defend the Union . In the U.S. Senate he became one of the foremost defenders of Republican governments in the southern states . Recent historiography of Reconstruction has found Morton among the most consistent supporters of the cause of equal justice under the law . 
 Morton was a formidable personality , detested by his enemies , and vilified in opposition newspapers . According to one account , Morton had no leavening wit , no humor , no breadth of intellect , no sparkle of conversation , to attract those who disagreed with him politically . Another Republican was said to have declared , " His presence is a deadly poison " and " He is a sphinx ; and I am repressed into dumbness when trying to hold a conversation with that man . " According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions , Morton was " a vice @-@ reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness , leprous ulcers and caustic bandages , who loads down with plagues and <unk> the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass . " Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully , highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing , even defaming his enemies , and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer , forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor 's mansion . One Democratic journalist wrote , " There is not , probably , in this country , a more <unk> , corrupt , and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton " and " He is rotten physically , morally and politically . " It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease , brought on by his habits . When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage , the Saint Paul Pioneer was not surprised . " Why shouldn 't Morton espouse the woman 's cause ? " it asked . " It is woman that has made him what he is -- so the gossips say . " 
 None of his critics could make charges of corruption stick . Senator Morton was among the earliest to refuse any share in the so @-@ called " back pay " that Congress awarded its members in 1873 , and returned his money to the U.S. Treasury as soon as it was given to him . Morton was untouched by the Crédit Mobilier scandal . A hostile Democratic House scoured the official files for some evidence of bribe @-@ taking or shakedowns in awarding Civil War contracts , and came up empty @-@ handed . For others , despite holding many positions that angered his opponents , Morton was highly regarded for remaining clean of graft during the war period when corruption was commonplace . For his honest conduct he was offered the thanks of the Indiana General Assembly and others on numerous occasions . After Morton learned that President Grant had nominated his son , John M. Morton , for Registrar of the Land Office in Dakota Territory , the Senator immediately wrote to ask that the selection be withdrawn , protest that he could not afford to have any relative appointed to any political office . 
 After the poor decision @-@ making of Senators Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch , Morton succeeded in raising Indiana to national prominence during his lifetime . The state and its citizens were once the common subject of jokes to the eastern states , but much of that ceased after the Civil War . 
 = = = Memorials = = = 
 Morton is memorialized in the United States Capitol as one of Indiana 's two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection . A statue of Governor Morton serves as the Indiana State Memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg , Mississippi , in honor of his role as a powerful wartime governor . 
 There are two statues of Morton in downtown Indianapolis . A statue on the east side of the Indiana Statehouse , facing Capitol Avenue , by sculptor Rudolf Schwarz was dedicated in 1907 . The other statue , created by sculptor Frank Simmons , was installed in 1864 on Monument Circle , when it served as a city park , and was moved to its new location to become part of the Circle 's Indiana Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument around 1899 . 
 A statue of Morton stands on the second floor of the Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond , Indiana , where a previous high school was named for him ; the central section of the current high school is named Morton Hall in his honor .

 Pugh started his career with First Division club Burnley where , at a young age , he started as a Centre of Excellence player , and gradually worked his way up through the ranks to become an apprentice in 2003 . As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record , which led to him being named on the bench for two first team matches in the League Cup , they decided to keep him on for a third year . As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club 's reserve and youth team . This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football . He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th minute substitute in a 3 – 1 defeat to Stevenage Borough . He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal , which helped Kidderminster to a 3 – 1 victory . Also , during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel , then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score ; this move was featured on Soccer AM 's showboating section . 
 He returned to Burnley on 13 December 2005 after picking up a groin injury , but returned to Kidderminster for a second loan spell on 7 January 2006 . This spell ended on 26 January 2006 so Pugh could concentrate on his career at Burnley , having made 10 appearances and scored 1 goal while at Kidderminster . He learned that he would not receive a professional contract at Burnley in February 2006 , which was partly because both Chris McCann and Kyle Lafferty had both already received professional contracts and they were only second year apprentices .

Casper revealed his disappointment at this and Pugh later said financial reasons were his motivation to reject a new contract . He was offered renewed contracts throughout the season but still took none of them , which Casper blamed on his agent .

He was loaned out to League One team Hereford United on 26 March 2009 , and made his debut two days later in a 1 – 0 home loss to Huddersfield Town .
