 At the party 's Ard Comhairle meeting in Dublin in June 2011 , the party 's leader , Gerry Adams TD , ruled himself out as a candidate . He had previously expressed a wish to be elected president in time for the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016 . 
 There had been reports in July that artist Robert <unk> was " seriously considering a run for the presidency " , and had been in talks with Sinn Féin , the Socialist Party and People Before Profit Alliance . A Sinn Féin source confirmed there had been " very informal discussions " , However , on 25 July <unk> ruled himself out . 
 In a keynote speech at the party 's Ard <unk> on 10 September Gerry Adams said that he felt that Sinn Féin should support the nomination of " a candidate who is capable of winning the support of progressive and nationalist opinion ... who will reflect the broad republican spirit of the Irish people at this time " . He went on to state that the party 's Ard Comhairle would consider the matter on 17 September . 
 On 16 September it was revealed that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness , deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland , nominated to contest the election . With 14 TDs and three Senators , Sinn Féin were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members to nominate a candidate for the presidency . Soon after the nomination was announced , four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness , securing his nomination : Michael Healy @-@ Rae and Tom Fleming ( both representing Kerry South ) , Luke ' Ming ' Flanagan ( Roscommon – South Leitrim ) and Finian McGrath ( Dublin North @-@ Central ) . Both ' Ming ' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris .

 In order to secure a nomination , a number of non @-@ party politicians sought the support of either 20 members of the Oireachtas or four city or county councils .

 David Norris , a Senator since 1987 and long time civil rights campaigner who campaigned unsuccessfully in 2004 declared that he would seek a nomination in early 2010 , and launched his campaign in January 2011 . It had initially been anticipated that he might be nominated by the Labour Party . A Red C poll commissioned by Paddy Power in January 2011 showed that Norris was by far the most popular choice for President with more than double the support of any of the other potential candidates . On 14 March 2011 Norris formally launched his campaign to secure a nomination , stating that he had written to the chairpersons of each of the 34 county and city councils and that he would also be individually contacting the independent TDs elected to the 31st Dail . On 21 July Norris revealed that he had secured the support of 13 Oireachtas members for his candidacy , and was confident of securing 20 . On 22 July two more senators announced they would back him . However , on 2 August , Norris publicly announced at a press conference that he was withdrawing from the presidential race . This followed the decision of three of his backers , the TDs John Halligan , Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle to withdraw their support following revelations that Norris had written a letter to a court asking clemency for his former partner Ezra Nawi , who was then on trial in Israel . This information was publicised on 24 July by John Connolly , a Zionist blogger in London , who claimed he had received a tip @-@ off from an associate he admitted may have been a supporter of Norris 's campaign rival and eventual election winner Michael D. Higgins . Norris withdrew his candidacy on 2 August due to the controversy . Nawi , a human rights campaigner and pacifist who has been jailed for several short spells for his activism , suggested at the time that his deeds were being " recycled " against him and those associated with him . However , by 15 September , media reports indicated Norris was seeking to re @-@ enter the election , and was meeting independent TDs looking for their support . By 25 September , 18 members of the Oireachtas had signed Norris 's nomination papers . Then Mattie McGrath TD indicated that he would not be signing Norris 's nomination papers following a meeting with his supporters . This effectively ended the attempt to gain nomination through the Oireachtas , although Michael Lowry TD stated he would give the final required nomination if Norris acquired 19 nominations . 
 Niall O 'Dowd , New York based journalist and publisher . Early in June 2011 , he indicated he had been approached by " a cross @-@ party group of Irish and Irish @-@ Americans " urging him to put his name forward for the contest . O 'Dowd travelled to Ireland later in the month to meet Fianna Fáil , Sinn Féin and independent TDs and senators in an attempt to gain a nomination . O 'Dowd withdrew from seeking a nomination on 30 June , due to the difficulty of organising a campaign and " because he stopped believing he could win " . 
 The members of the Technical Group of independents in Dáil Éireann considered nominating a candidate . Finian McGrath , the chair of the group , circulated a list of 10 possible candidates to the members during the summer of 2011 . Although meetings were held with Dana Rosemary Scallon , Mary Davis and <unk> chief executive Justin Kilcullen no agreement was reached . Kilcullen withdrew from seeking a nomination on 14 September . 
 = = = = Council nominations = = = = 
 A number of independent politicians sought support from local authorities , and four candidates were nominated by the resolutions of four or more councils : 
 Mary Davis announced on 26 May 2011 that she would be seeking a nomination . She had originally stated in August 2010 that she would consider standing for the presidency if approached by a political party . She subsequently decided to run as an independent , seeking nominations from four local authorities . 
 Seán Gallagher . In May 2011 , The Sunday Business Post reported that he was likely to seek a nomination . The Irish Times subsequently reported that in addition to seeking the support of independents , he was approaching Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members in order to run as an independent candidate , but with a " semi @-@ detached " relationship with the party . On 13 June 2011 , he began the process of looking for nominations from local authorities . 
 David Norris . Norris approached a number of councils in June and July 2011 . On 2 August Norris announced he was withdrawing from the election . In September he reversed the decision , and received his first local authority nomination on 20 September . 
 Dana Rosemary Scallon announced on 19 September that she would be seeking a presidential nomination . She initially attempted to gain the signatures of 20 Oireachtas members . However , by 21 September , she only secured the support of one TD . She instead began the process of seeking support from county and city councils . 
 A number of councils scheduled special meetings to consider presidential nominations prior to the deadline of midday on 28 September 2011 . 
 = = Candidates = = 
 There were seven candidates contesting the presidential election , having been selected by their parties or having received sufficient council nominations . This was the largest number of candidates to contest an Irish presidential election . 
 Mary Davis , social entrepreneur , disability rights campaigner and best known as organiser of the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Ireland , was nominated by local councils . 
 Seán Gallagher , entrepreneur , panellist on the Dragons ' Den television programme and former member of the Fianna Fáil National Executive , was nominated by local councils . 
 Michael D. Higgins , former Government Minister and TD was selected by the Labour Party . 
 Martin McGuinness , deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland was selected by Sinn Féin , and received enough support from independent TDs to be nominated . 
 Gay Mitchell , MEP and former TD was selected by Fine Gael . 
 David Norris , Senator , scholar and civil rights campaigner , was nominated by local councils . 
 Dana Rosemary Scallon , former MEP , was nominated by local councils .

 The " motley crew " of candidates ( The Washington Times ) led to much attention on the campaign and election outcome from the international media . The Guardian described it as " the most fractious presidential election campaign since the republic was founded " . 
 Phil Hogan of Fine Gael , Minister for the Environment , Community and Local Government , attacked Martin McGuinness claiming that US multinational companies would be " appalled " if Martin McGuinness were elected and foreign direct investment would drop . This was followed by a tweet made by Government Chief Whip Paul Kehoe which claimed that McGuinness profited from the Northern Bank robbery . This was in response to a pledge made by McGuinness to only take the average industrial wage , if elected President . McGuinness dismissed both charges as " black propaganda " . It was reported in The Irish Times that Fine Gael 's " strategy of levelling strongly worded accusations at Mr McGuinness was part of a drive to motivate party voters to come out in support of Mr Mitchell in the October 27th election " . 
 At her formal campaign launch on 4 October , Independent Mary Davis accused Fine Gael of using polling companies to research attacks on her . She also pledged she would ask the Government to bring the office of President under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act and that she would publish an annual expenditure report for the <unk> . David Norris also made a pledge to publish expenses . Mrs. Davis eventually accepted " collective responsibility " for mortgage lending decisions made after she was appointed to the board of the ICS building society . 
 During the campaign , several relatives of people killed during The Troubles objected to the prospect of a former IRA member , McGuinness , becoming President . On 10 October , McGuinness was confronted in Athlone by the son of a member of the Irish Army killed by the IRA after Don Tidey 's kidnap in <unk> in 1983 . In a RTÉ interview that aired on 20 October , Bryan Dobson noted a 1985 Hot Press interview in which McGuinness indicated that he considered the IRA volunteers at <unk> to be " defending themselves against armed Gardaí and soldiers . " When Dobson then asked if it was " fair to say that on this occasion you were standing over the killing of members of the Gardaí and Defence Forces ? " McGuinness insisted that he has " never done that . " The family of Garda Detective Frank Hand , killed in 1984 , accused McGuinness of misleading younger generations with a " glossy campaign " . The husband of a mother killed by the IRA in 1981 said he doubted McGuinness ' claims of ignorance about the identities of IRA killers , saying " If anybody knows who did it , he does . If he is full of apologies he has never apologised to me " . 
 In Northern Ireland , unionists took exception to the appearance of McGuinness election posters there given that Northern Ireland citizens were not eligible to vote in this Republic of Ireland election . Sinn Féin has regularly called for voting rights in the presidential election to be extended to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland . 
 Michael D. Higgins was confronted by former Tara mines workers while canvassing in Meath . The workers were upset about their pensions being cut . 
 = = = Debates = = = 
 The first broadcast debate of the campaign took place on 28 September 2011 , the day that nominations closed , on RTÉ Radio 1 's News at One programme . This was followed by a series of televised one @-@ on @-@ one interviews with the candidates on RTÉ One 's evening Prime Time programme on the same day . A second debate was held on The Late Late Show on 30 September ; David Norris was not interviewed alone as the other six candidates were as he had been interviewed the previous week on the programme , but was included in the later panel debate . 
 On 4 October , TV3 broadcast Vincent Browne 's Big Presidential Debate . Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the " fairytale " that he left the IRA in 1974 , asking him directly : " If you ( McGuinness ) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn ’ t ; if you say you are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand – how can people have confidence in your word ? " Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness ' claims that he left the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974 , producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise . McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they could find a way to implicate him . 
 During a debate on Today FM Gay Mitchell controversially spoke of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth , with some other candidates disagreeing with him . Mitchell suffered from poor voter recognition , and was criticised over remarks on suicide he made on live radio . 
 On 12 October , there was another TV debate on RTÉ , this time on the Prime Time programme , with the seven candidates and Miriam O 'Callaghan as moderator . The debate , lasting 90 minutes , took place on a Wednesday night , though Prime Time usually aired on a Tuesday and Thursday , and was announced a week in advance . Dana Rosemary Scallon read out a prepared statement towards the end of the debate , announcing that a " malicious " and " false " accusation has been made against her and her family in the United States and , while refusing to divulge any details , she said she would leave " no stone unturned " in her mission to track down the person or organisation responsible . Scallon was visibly upset and was comforted by other candidates . She met with her lawyers the next day . David Norris expressed sorrow for Scallon and comforted her , also expressing frustration at the general tone of the election campaign and saying the media had libelled him in some of its reports . Scallon told TV3 News on 14 October that a freelance journalist had told her the allegations would appear through the media . Miriam O 'Callaghan 's treatment of Martin McGuinness resulted in more than 100 complaints to RTÉ . O 'Callaghan 's RTÉ colleague Pat Kenny said he watched on " with shock and horror because I don 't think I 've ever seen a politician ever interviewed on radio before and more or less called a murderer . That was kind of shocking . " McGuinness himself also expressed disappointment with O 'Callaghan . 
 Gallagher 's campaign suffered a severe setback on 24 October when , in the last televised debate before the election , he admitted collecting a € 5 @,@ 000 cheque from someone he described as a " convicted criminal and fuel smuggler " , for a Fianna Fáil fundraiser event which gave access to the then Taoiseach , Brian Cowen after being questioned on the matter by Martin McGuinness . Gallagher had been the frontrunner in an opinion poll at this point . The donation was later revealed to be from businessman Hugh Morgan . Gallagher subsequently denied collecting a cheque from Morgan , but refused to answer questions on an illegal director 's loan of € 82 @,@ 829 , which had also been raised in the 24 October televised debate . After this performance Gallagher 's campaign was compared to Devon Loch 's fall at the winning post in the 1956 Grand National . He was reported to have been left " shell @-@ shocked " afterwards . Gallagher cancelled his planned meet @-@ the @-@ people visits the following day so that he could tour broadcasters and attempt to explain his behaviour . On 7 March 2012 , the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland ( BAI ) upheld a complaint against RTÉ relating to the broadcasting of the tweet that derailed Gallagher 's presidential campaign . 
 Eventual winner Michael D. Higgins was pursued by his past links to the Fianna Fáil party , and admitted on 13 October that he had been elected chairman of the UCG Fianna Fáil university <unk> in 1966 . While at university in the United States he had , he admitted , smoked marijuana . However , media reports said he was " spared the intense grilling Miriam O 'Callaghan meted out to some of the others " during the Prime Time debate .

 = Business routes of U.S. Route 23 in Michigan = 
 There have been five different business routes of US Highway 23 in the state of Michigan . These business routes were designated along former sections of US Highway 23 ( US 23 ) to provide signed access from the main highway to the downtowns of cities bypassed by new routings of US 23 . Two are still extant , connecting through downtown Ann Arbor and Rogers City . Three others have been decommissioned . The former Business US 23 ( Bus . US 23 ) in Fenton was split in half during the 1970s and later completely turned back to local control in 2006 . The former business loops through Saginaw and Bay City were renumbered as business loops of Interstate 75 in the 1960s . 
 = = Ann Arbor = = 
 Business US Highway 23 ( Bus . US 23 ) is a business loop of US 23 through downtown Ann Arbor . The southern end is at an interchange with US 23 on the city line with Pittsfield Township . This interchange also marks the western terminus of M @-@ 17 , and the eastern end of a concurrency with Business Loop Interstate 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) . From this interchange westward , BL I @-@ 94 / Bus . US 23 follows Washtenaw Avenue along a five @-@ lane street past commercial areas to County Farm Park and then continues as a four @-@ lane roadway through residential neighborhoods . Washtenaw Avenue turns more northwesterly at the intersection with Stadium Boulevard southeast of Burns Park . Near the Central Campus of the University of Michigan , Washtenaw Avenue turns due north to cross part of campus before BL I @-@ 94 / Bus . US 23 turn due west onto Huron Street near Palmer Field . Bus . US 23 follows BL I @-@ 94 and the four @-@ lane Huron Street into downtown Ann Arbor to the intersection with Main Street . There , Bus . US 23 turns northward onto Main Street and exits downtown . Main Street has four lanes as it runs northward into a residential area . It parallels part of the Huron River before ending at an interchange with the M @-@ 14 freeway about a mile and a third ( 2 @.@ 2 km ) north of downtown . At that interchange , Bus . US 23 merges onto the freeway and runs concurrently with M @-@ 14 , crossing the Huron River . There is one interchange for Barton Drive and Whitmore Lake Road on the northern bank of the river . The freeway runs through a wooded area and then after about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , it meets US 23 at an interchange in Ann Arbor Township that marks the northern terminus of the business loop . 
 In 1962 , the northern and eastern freeway bypass of Ann Arbor was completed . At that time , the former routing of US 23 through downtown and a section of freeway north of the Huron River was redesignated as Bus . US 23 . Two years later , M @-@ 14 was rerouted to follow the US 23 23 freeway around the north side of Ann Arbor . It overlapped the business loop from the northern end of its freeway segment to Main Street and along Main Street into downtown . The next year , in 1965 , this overlap was shortened when the rest of the M @-@ 14 freeway westward from Main Street to I @-@ 94 was completed .

 Business US Highway 23 ( Bus . US 23 ) was a business route through downtown Fenton . At the time it was turned over to local control , it was signed as business spur from downtown to the US 23 freeway , but the state maintained a southern section that previously completed the route as a loop . At the southern end , this unsigned highway started at US 23 at the Owen Road interchange ( exit 78 ) and continued eastward on Owen Road past Fenton High School and various businesses . At the intersection with Shiawassee Avenue , Bus . US 23 followed Shiawassee through a residential area toward the southern end of downtown . At the intersection with LeRoy Street , the unsigned business loop turned northward and across the Shiawassee River . At the intersection with River Street , state maintenance ended . On the northern end of downtown at the intersection of LeRoy Street and Silver Lake Road , it resumed . Bus . US 23 followed Silver Lake Road westward out of downtown through a residential area and northwesterly to an interchange with US 23 at exit 79 . 
 The US 23 bypass of Fenton opened as a freeway west of downtown in 1958 . The former route of US 23 along Shiawassee Avenue and LeRoy Street in Fenton was redesignated as a business loop at this time , and the state assumed control of Silver Lake Road to connect it back to the freeway northwest of town . Three years later , the US 23 freeway was extended southward from the Livingston – Genesee county line ; at that time , the freeway connections were reconfigured and Bus . US 23 was shifted to use Owen Road between a new freeway interchange and the rest of the business loop at Shiawassee Avenue . In the middle of the 1970s , city officials redeveloped downtown and closed two blocks of LeRoy Street in 1975 . After this closure , the business loop was split into two sections , and only the northern one was retained as a signed state highway . The southern segment was retained as an unsigned state highway until both segments were turned over to local control in 2006 .

 Business US Highway 23 ( Bus . US 23 ) was a business loop that ran through downtown Saginaw . It started at an intersection between US 10 and US 23 in Bridgeport southeast of Saginaw . From there , it ran concurrently along US 10 ( Dixie Highway ) northwesterly into Saginaw . Once in downtown , the business loop turned northward on Washington Street , running parallel to the eastern banks of the Saginaw River through downtown . At the intersection between Washington Avenue , Washington Road and Veterans Memorial Parkway , Bus . US 23 terminated . 
 In 1953 , the initial eastern bypass of Saginaw was built as a two @-@ lane highway , and the former routing through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 23 .

From this point , Bus . US 23 ran east on Lafayette Avenue for two blocks and then turned northward onto Garfield Avenue , running parallel to , but inland from , the Saginaw River into downtown Bay City . As it approached downtown , the business loop jogged off Garfield onto Washington Avenue . At the intersection with 7th Street , Bus . US 23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River . On the opposite side , the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one @-@ way pairing of streets . At the intersection with US 23 ( Euclid Avenue ) , the business loop terminated . 
 With the construction of a new bridge across the Saginaw River in 1941 to connect Lafayette and Salzburg avenues , US 23 was rerouted to use that new bridge . The former routing of the mainline highway through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 23 at that time . Twenty years later , with the opening of the new freeway for Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) near Bay City , US 23 was rerouted to follow I @-@ 75 . The route of Bus .

Farther north , the business loop passes the eastern end of the Rogers City Airport and turns northwesterly , parallel to , but inland from , the Lake Huron shoreline . Now following 3rd Street , Bus . US 23 runs through a residential area on the southern side of town before entering downtown . At the intersection with Erie Street , Bus .

 = Bardanes Tourkos = 
 Bardanes , nicknamed Tourkos , " the Turk " ( Greek : <unk> ὁ <unk> , fl . 795 – 803 ) , was a Byzantine general of Armenian origin who launched an unsuccessful rebellion against Emperor Nikephoros I ( r . 802 – 811 ) in 803 . Although a major supporter of Byzantine empress Irene of Athens ( r . 797 – 802 ) , soon after her overthrow he was appointed by Nikephoros as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Anatolian armies . From this position , he launched a revolt in July 803 , probably in opposition to Nikephoros 's economic and religious policies . His troops marched towards Constantinople , but failed to win popular support . At this point , some of his major supporters deserted him and , reluctant to engage the loyalist forces in battle , Bardanes gave up and chose to surrender himself . He retired as a monk to a monastery he had founded . There he was blinded , possibly on Nikephoros 's orders . 
 = = Origin and early career = = 
 Nothing is known of the early life of Bardanes . He is usually regarded by modern scholars as an Armenian on account of his first name ( a Hellenized form of Vardan ) , whilst his sobriquet " Tourkos " , which was bestowed upon him , probably disparagingly , only after his revolt , could suggest a Khazar origin . 
 Bardanes is probably identical with the patrikios <unk> who appears in the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor in the mid @-@ 790s . In 795 , he was Domestic of the Schools ( commander of the Scholai guards ) , and was dispatched to arrest the monk Plato of <unk> for his public opposition to the second marriage of Emperor Constantine VI ( r . 780 – 797 ) to Plato 's niece <unk> . In 797 , as strategos ( military governor ) of the Thracesian Theme , this same <unk> supported the Empress @-@ mother Irene of Athens when she usurped the throne from her son . On Easter Monday , 1 April 799 , he is recorded as one of the four <unk> ( along with Niketas Triphyllios , <unk> Triphyllios and Constantine Boilas ) who led the horses of the Empress 's carriage on a unique triumphal procession from the palace to the Church of the Holy Apostles . 
 Irene herself was overthrown and exiled by the logothetes tou <unk> ( finance minister ) Nikephoros on 31 October 802 . At the time , Bardanes was still patrikios and strategos of the <unk> , but was soon transferred to command the powerful Anatolic Theme . In the next year , probably in preparation for a campaign against the Arabs following Nikephoros 's refusal to continue the annual payment of tribute to the Abbasid Caliphate , the Emperor apparently appointed Bardanes to the post of monostrategos ( " single @-@ general " , in effect commander @-@ in @-@ chief ) of the Empire 's five Anatolian land themes , only conferred in exceptional cases . However , this appointment is by no means certain ; he is mentioned as monostrategos only by later sources , while near @-@ contemporary ones mention him only as strategos of the Anatolics . It is possible that later sources misinterpreted his title to mean " general of all the East ( Anatole ) " . 
 = = Revolt = = 
 In July 803 , an Abbasid army under al @-@ Qasim , a son of the Caliph Harun al @-@ Rashid ( r . 786 – 809 ) , began advancing towards the Byzantine frontier . As Nikephoros had broken his foot in early May , it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs . He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme . In mid @-@ July 803 ( the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16 , 18 or 19 July ) , Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic , Opsician , Thracesian and Bucellarian themes . Crucially , the Armeniac Theme , either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics , or because it had not yet joined up with the rest of the army , did not join the uprising . It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs ' revolt in 793 , leaving a memory of hostility towards him amongst its troops . Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes 's revolt , the 10th @-@ century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th @-@ century Synopsis <unk> indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns . Nikephoros had initiated a strict budgetary policy to shore up the Empire 's finances . The Emperor had revoked the exemption on inheritance tax for the soldiers , and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well . Bardanes , on the other hand , had a good reputation in this regard , fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers . 
 For the motives of Bardanes himself , the situation is less clear . According to the Byzantine chroniclers , he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly , after vainly entreating the soldiers to allow him to leave . According to another story however , before his revolt , Bardanes , accompanied by his three principal associates , Thomas the Slav , Leo the Armenian and Michael the Amorian visited a holy man at Philomelion to learn of the prospects for the uprising . The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail , that Thomas too would begin a revolt , and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors . Although possibly a later invention , this story may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand . Aside from any personal ambition , Bardanes was also a member of the landed aristocracy and a devoted iconophile who supported Empress Irene 's regime . He has therefore also been seen as the representative of the opposition by the traditional elites to Nikephoros 's policies , both in the confessional area , where the Emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles , and in the socio @-@ financial sphere , where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests . Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros 's usurpation and aimed , at least ostensibly , at the restoration of Irene . Her death , however , at Lesbos on 8 August deprived the rebels of any claim to legitimacy . 
 The revolt probably took place at Amorion , the capital of the Anatolic Theme . From there , the rebel army , comprising almost half of the Empire 's available military forces , marched north and west , following the military road to Nicomedia and then to Chrysopolis , the town that lay across the Bosporus from the imperial capital , Constantinople . There , Bardanes encamped for eight days , awaiting a possible uprising against Nikephoros inside the capital in response to his own rebellion . Since this did not materialize , and the populace proved not overtly enthusiastic , he withdrew to the great army base at Malagina . There , two of his associates , Michael the Amorian and Leo the Armenian , abandoned him , and were richly rewarded by Nikephoros for their defection : Michael became Count of the Tent to the Emperor , and Leo was appointed commander of the Foederati regiment . 
 This desertion further discouraged Bardanes , and , reluctant to face the loyalist army in battle , he opted for a negotiated surrender through the mediation of Joseph , the <unk> of the <unk> monastery who had officiated at Constantine VI 's second marriage . Bardanes received a letter signed by the Patriarch <unk> and several leading senators which guaranteed that neither he nor his subordinates would be punished if they surrendered . As a further guarantee of good faith , Nikephoros sent his own gold cross along with the letter . Satisfied by these assurances , on 8 September Bardanes left his army and , through Nicaea , sought refuge in the monastery of <unk> at Cius . From there , he embarked on a ship that took him to the island of Prote . Taking the monastic name <unk> , Bardanes then entered a monastery that he had founded there in the past . 
 = = Aftermath of the revolt = = 
 After Bardanes 's retirement , Nikephoros formally dismissed him and confiscated much of his property . The other thematic generals who took part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts , the metropolitan bishops of Sardis , Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support of the uprising by exile to the small island of Pantelleria off Sicily , while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left unpaid for a year . 
 In December 803 ( Treadgold puts it in 804 ) , however , a group of " <unk> " ( possibly Paulician ) soldiers disembarked at Prote and blinded Bardanes . This was a highly symbolic act : blinding was the usual punishment usually meted out to heretics and rebels , or to deposed emperors and other political rivals to prevent them from becoming a threat . It is very likely that this was done at the behest of the Emperor himself , although in a later public statement before the Senate , Nikephoros swore that he had nothing to do with it . Most scholars believe in Nikephoros 's direct involvement , but Treadgold holds it likelier that the soldiers acted on their own , since Bardanes was no longer a credible threat to the Emperor . In the event , despite pressure from the Patriarch and the Senate to punish the perpetrators , and his own pledge to do so , Nikephoros let them go . 
 Bardanes 's revolt temporarily weakened Byzantium , especially in its capability to deal with the Arab threat to the East , but Qasim 's invasion was of limited scope , and his father 's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations : Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum . Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia . Nevertheless , it is indicative of the soldiers ' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros , which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign . 
 = = Family = = 
 Bardanes was married to a woman named <unk> , with whom he had several children . Thekla , the wife of Michael the Amorian , is usually identified with one of them , as Theophanes Continuatus and <unk> record that Bardanes married two of his daughters to Michael the Amorian and another of his aides . Warren Treadgold identifies the second daughter with a woman named or nicknamed <unk> , whom he regards as the first wife of Leo the Armenian and whom Leo divorced shortly after his accession in 813 in order to marry Theodosia . She would then be the real mother of Leo 's firstborn son , Symbatios / Constantine . Theodosia , however , is the only clearly attested wife of Leo , and there is no evidence for a divorce and remarriage . Leo is also named the " cousin " of Bardanes , but it is unclear whether this is literal or in the meaning of " brother in law " . If the former is the case , the familial relationship alone would bar any such marriage . In addition , the tale is very likely simply a later invention , inspired by the marriage of Thekla to Michael the Amorian . A son by the name of Bryennios or <unk> is known , who held a high official post in 813 . An unnamed , unmarried daughter is recorded , as well as several other unnamed younger children , in 803 ; along with <unk> , they were left a part of Bardanes 's fortune , part of which was donated to the poor , and the rest used to found a small monastery in Constantinople , where they retired . 
 = Tanque Argentino Mediano = 
 The Tanque Argentino Mediano ( TAM ; English : Argentine Medium Tank ) is the main battle tank in service with the Argentine Army . Lacking the experience and resources to design a tank , the Argentine Ministry of Defense contracted German company Thyssen @-@ Henschel . The vehicle was developed by a German and Argentine team of engineers , and was based on the German Marder infantry fighting vehicle . 
 The TAM met the Argentine Army 's requirement for a modern , lightweight and fast tank with a low silhouette and sufficient firepower to defeat contemporary armored threats . Development began in 1974 and resulted in the construction of three prototypes by early 1977 and full @-@ scale production by 1979 . Assembly took place at the local 9 @,@ 600 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 103 @,@ 000 sq ft ) TAMSE plant , founded for the purpose by the Argentine government . Economic difficulties halted production in 1983 , but manufacturing began anew in 1994 until the army 's order of 200 tanks was fulfilled . 
 The TAM series includes seven different variants , such as a 155 mm ( 6 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ) self @-@ propelled howitzer and a self @-@ propelled mortar vehicle . In total , over 280 such vehicles were built , including armored personnel carriers , artillery and mortar pieces . The TAM and VCTP ( Infantry Fighting Vehicles based on the TAM chassis ) were manufactured for the Peruvian Army , only to be integrated into the Argentine Army when Peru canceled the contract . The TAM also competed for other export orders , but the TAM was ultimately not exported . 
 The TAM has never seen combat , although 17 VCTP were deployed to Croatia for the United Nations UNPROFOR peacekeeping mission . 
 = = Development = = 
 During the 1960s Argentina sought to replace its aging fleet of tanks , which included British Sherman V Firefly tanks and American M3A1 half @-@ tracks dating from shortly after the Second World War . In their attempts to procure equipment from the United States , Argentina could only secure 50 M41 Walker Bulldogs ( undelivered ) and 250 M113 armored personnel carriers . When the United States turned down requests for further equipment , the Argentine government turned to the other side of the Atlantic , putting their " Plan Europa " ( Plan Europe ) into action . It was hoped that European technology could stimulate Argentine industry so the country could produce its own armaments in the future . Argentina procured 80 AMX @-@ 13 light tanks , as well as 180 AMX @-@ <unk> and 24 AMX @-@ 155 <unk> , from the French government , manufacturing around 40 AMX @-@ 13s and 60 AMX @-@ <unk> at home . The French AMX @-@ 30 and German Leopard 1 were also examined as possible replacements for the Argentine Sherman fleet . 
 In 1973 the Argentine Ministry of Defense drew up a series of requirements for a tank to enter service in the 1980s . The armored vehicle would weigh no more than 30 tonnes ( 29 @.@ 5 long tons ; 33 @.@ 1 short tons ) , move at a maximum speed of 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) , and cover at least 500 km ( 310 mi ) on roads . It would be armed with a modern 105 mm main gun , two machine guns , and grenade launchers . The tank designers also had to take into account Argentina 's existing infrastructure , including railroad capacity , bridges and road capacity , as well as the country 's varied terrain . In late 1973 the Proyecto de Tanque Argentino Mediano ( Medium Argentine Tank Project ) was founded with the goal of designing and developing a tank for the Argentine Army . Lacking the experience and the necessary technology , the Argentine government sought collaboration with a foreign company , resulting in a contract with the German company Thyssen @-@ Henschel . The contract called for a transfer of technology resulting in a program to develop a tank in line with the government 's requirements and under a technical team that included both German and Argentine engineers . The hull of the German Marder armored personnel carrier was used , and the chassis was strengthened to support the increased weight of the TAM . Two prototypes were manufactured in late 1976 and early 1977 , which were put through extensive testing for two years and over a road range of 10 @,@ 000 km ( 6 @,@ 200 mi ) . Simultaneously , another prototype was manufactured to further the investigation of the new vehicle and complete the three prototypes as agreed in the contract . 
 The new tank 's firepower requirements were met by fitting a British Royal Ordnance <unk> 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 13 @-@ inch ) main gun . This gun was later replaced by the modified <unk> and finally by Rheinmetall 's Rh @-@ 105 @-@ 30 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 13 @-@ inch ) gun . This gun is manufactured in Argentina as the FM <unk> Modelo 1L . The Rh @-@ 105 @-@ 30 's advantages include low weight , compact size and increased lethality . Unlike the Rh @-@ 105 @-@ 30 , the FM <unk> does not have a muzzle brake . The locally built cannon can be elevated to 18 degrees or depressed to -7 degrees on the TAM . The gun 's hydraulic recoil mechanism has an extended range of 580 mm ( 22 @.@ 8 inches ) to absorb the 34 @-@ tonne ( 33 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 37 @-@ short @-@ ton ) recoil force . It is designed to fire the <unk> armor @-@ piercing fin @-@ stabilized discarding sabot , which can penetrate a maximum of 370 mm ( 14 @.@ 6 inches ) at 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) . It can also fire high @-@ explosive anti @-@ tank rounds , high @-@ explosive squash head and smoke rounds . The tank 's secondary armaments include a co @-@ axial 7 @.@ 62 mm ( 0 @.@ 30 @-@ inch ) FN MAG 60 @-@ 40 general purpose machine gun and a second FN MAG 60 @-@ 20 mounted on the TAM 's turret roof as an anti @-@ aircraft machine gun . The fire control system includes a Nd : YAG laser with a range of 9 @,@ 900 meters ( 32 @,@ 480 ft ) and a <unk> @-@ HG ballistic computer to compute the gun 's fire solutions — helping the gunner aim and hit the target . The tank commander uses a Zeiss <unk> @-@ R / TA panoramic periscope , with a 2x and 8x zoom . 
 The TAM 's engine requirements included low weight and volume , but with a fast rate of acceleration and high reliability . The program chose MTU 's MB @-@ 833 Ka 500 diesel engine , producing 540 kW ( 720 hp ) at 2 @,@ 400 rpm . This gives the TAM a power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio of 24 horsepower per tonne and a maximum speed of 75 km / h ( 47 mph ) on road and 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) off @-@ road . With a 680 @-@ liter ( 180 @-@ U.S.-gallon ; 150 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ) internal fuel tank , the TAM can travel 500 km ( 310 mi ) . Its range is extended to 900 kilometers ( 560 mi ) if the vehicle is equipped with two 200 @-@ liter ( 53 U.S. gal ; 44 imp gal ) external fuel tanks . The TAM 's transmission is a <unk> <unk> @-@ 204 automatic , with a hydrodynamic torque converter . A double brake system includes hydraulic disk brakes on the roadwheels , and the suspension is a torsion bar . 
 The TAM 's survivability is related to its low profile turret , based on that of the Leopard <unk> and the Leopard 2 , and its physical armor array . It has 50 mm ( 1 @.@ 97 inches ) at 75 degrees on the glacis plate and 32 degrees on the vehicle 's sides . This offers protection against anti @-@ armor shells from up to 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 38 @-@ inch ) guns . The turret front is protected by 50 mm ( 1 @.@ 97 in ) of steel armor at an angle of 32 degrees . Although the tank 's weight and armor protection are light compared to other main battle tanks , it has the advantage of better tactical mobility over the nation 's terrain . 
 As a private venture , Thyssen @-@ Henschel built a fourth prototype designated TH 301 . Completed in 1978 , it added a <unk> R12 periscope , originally designed for the Leopard <unk> , for the tank commander . The gunner and loader each received a day periscope as well . To enable the crew to fire effectively at night , a low light level television ( LLLTV ) camera , which moved in elevation with the main gun , was fitted to the mantlet . Furthermore , the tank received a more powerful 550 kW ( 750 metric horsepower ) engine . The improvement program also made provisions to increase the thickness of the armor for additional protection . 
 In 2010 , a modernization program was announced . Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems was chosen to provide 3 @-@ axis gyro @-@ stabilization , and most probably the <unk> 105 mm cannon will be replaced with a more powerful 120 mm cannon , like the L44 120 mm Cannon . The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013 . 
 = = Variants = = 
 A number of variants were built on the same chassis as the TAM tank . The original program called for the design of an infantry fighting vehicle , and in 1977 the program finished manufacturing the prototype of the Vehículo de Combate Transporte de Personal ( Personnel Transport Combat Vehicle ) , or VCTP . The VCTP is able to transport a squad of 12 men , including the squad leader and nine riflemen . The squad leader is situated in the turret of the vehicle ; one rifleman sits behind him and another six are seated in the chassis , the eighth manning the hull machine gun and the ninth situated in the turret with the gunner . All personnel can fire their weapons from inside the vehicle , and the VCTP 's turret is armed with Rheinmetall 's Rh @-@ 202 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 @-@ inch ) autocannon . The VCTP holds 880 rounds for the autocannon , including <unk> armor @-@ piercing DM63 rounds . It is also armed with a 7 @.@ 62 mm FN MAG 60 @-@ 20 machine gun mounted on the turret roof . Infantry can dismount through a door on the rear of the hull . The commander has a day sight and seven observation periscopes , while the gunner has a day sight and three observation periscopes . 
 Variants also include the Vehículo de Combate de Artillería de 155 mm ( 155 mm Artillery Combat Vehicle ) , or VCA 155 , and the Vehículo de Combate Transporte de <unk> ( Mortar Transport Combat Vehicle ) , or <unk> . The VCA @-@ 155 is an elongated TAM chassis fitted with Oto <unk> 's <unk> 155 mm ( 6 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ) self @-@ propelled howitzer turret . It carries 28 projectiles , 23 of which are stored in the turret bustle . The <unk> carries an AM @-@ 50 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ) internal mortar , which has a range of 9 @,@ 500 meters ( 31 @,@ 167 @.@ 98 ft ) and a rate of fire of 8 to 12 shots per minute . Based on the TAM chassis , the Vehículo de Combate Puesto de Mando ( command combat vehicle ) , or <unk> , is another variant designed in 1982 . The Vehículo de Combate <unk> ( Rocket launcher combat vehicle ) , or <unk> , designed in 1986 , is also based on the TAM chassis and can be fitted with both 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 @-@ inch ) and 350 mm ( 13 @.@ 8 @-@ inch ) rockets . A combat ambulance , Vehículo de Combate <unk> ( VCA ) , and an armored recovery vehicle , Vehículo de Combate de <unk> ( VCRT ) are other combat variants of the tank . 
 = = Production = = 
 Production began in 1979 , with the intent to build a total of 512 armored vehicles ( 200 tanks and 312 VCTP infantry fighting vehicles ) . Economic problems , however , ended production in 1983 with only 150 TAMs and 100 VCTPs built . These vehicles were produced by an Argentine company , Tanque Argentino Mediano Sociedad del Estado ( or TAMSE ) founded by the government in March 1980 . 70 % of the TAM 's components were manufactured in Argentina , while the 30 % manufactured in Germany corresponded to the transmission , optics and fire control system . In 1983 , 20 TAMs and 26 VCTPs were delivered to the Argentine Army after an original order of 80 TAMs by Peru was canceled due to budgetary issues . In 1991 , TAMSE and the TAM production line were shut down , although in 1994 TAMSE was reactivated to complete an order for 120 of both TAMs and VCTPs to replace the M4 Shermans in the 2nd Armored Cavalry Brigade of the Argentine Army . By 1995 the Argentine Army was equipped with 200 TAM tanks and 216 VCTP and <unk> armored vehicles . Although 25 VCA @-@ <unk> were originally planned for production starting in 1990 , only 19 were completed and delivered by 1995 , along with 50 <unk> . No other variants of the TAM , including the <unk> , VAC and VCRT were put into production due to budget restrictions . 
 The TAMSE plant is a 9 @,@ 600 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 103 @,@ 300 sq ft ) facility . The factory is completely covered , with two warehouses for storing components , quality control laboratories , a project office , an engine test room and a firing range . Also participating in the production of TAM and variant components were Argentine companies Military Factories General San Martín ( manufacturing the chassis ) , Río Tercero ( turret and armament ) and Bator <unk> , S.A. 
 = = Export and combat history = = 
 The TAM has never been exported , although a number of nations were interested in buying it . In 1981 , Malaysia signed a contract for 102 vehicles of the TAM family , including the tank , VCTP and VCRT ( renaming these Lion , Tiger and Elephant , respectively ) . None of these vehicles were delivered and Malaysia chose instead to procure Poland 's PT @-@ 91 . In mid @-@ 1983 , Peru established a contract for 80 TAMs . Due to budgetary problems the order was canceled after 20 tanks had been completed . A similar order was established by Panama in 1984 , and was canceled as well . In 1989 the TAM competed in a tank procurement order from Ecuador , alongside the American Stingray light tank , the Austrian SK @-@ 105 <unk> and the French AMX @-@ 13 @-@ 105 light tank . The TAM achieved 950 out of 1 @,@ 000 points , while its closest competitor earned 750 points , but in the end Ecuador did not procure any of the vehicles presented . 
 In the Middle East , both Iran and Saudi Arabia expressed interest in the TAM . The Iranian deal fell through after Saudi Arabia and Iraq successfully appealed to Germany to cancel the order . TAMSE attempted to sell 60 tanks through a Panamanian company , <unk> , offering this company a commission worth 10 % of the contract 's price . This failed when TAMSE lowered the price of the vehicles , angering the Iranian government , which subsequently canceled the offer . The Saudi Arabian deal was scrapped when Israel appealed to Germany to cancel the order . Failing to export the tank , the Argentine government closed the TAMSE fabrication plant in 1995 . 
 The TAM did not participate in the Falklands War , as it had not entered service before the end of the conflict . 
 Seventeen VCTPs were deployed with an Argentina battalion to Yugoslavia during United Nations peacekeeping operations .

 Pennsylvania Route 737 ( PA 737 ) is a state highway in Berks County , Pennsylvania . The route runs from U.S. Route 222 ( US 222 ) in Kutztown north to PA 143 in Albany Township . PA 737 heads north from an interchange with the US 222 Kutztown Bypass north of Kutztown on Krumsville Road . It continues north through a small part of <unk> Township into Greenwich Township . The road features an interchange with Interstate 78 ( I @-@ 78 ) / US 22 near the village of Krumsville . PA 737 then heads northwest into Albany Township where it ends at PA 143 near the village of Kempton . 
 PA 737 was assigned to a formerly un @-@ designated local road between Kutztown and Kempton in 1962 . Around that time , US 222 served as the southern terminus in downtown Kutztown . When the Kutztown Bypass was constructed in the 1970s , US 222 was realigned off of Main Street in Kutztown and onto the bypass . The road , at that point , ended at the now locally maintained Main Street until 1978 , when the designation was truncated . Since then , the route has remained on the same alignment . Two bridges along the route between Kutztown and Krumsville were replaced in 2011 . There are plans to reconstruct the interchange with I @-@ 78 / US 22 into a diamond interchange , shifting the route slightly to the east . 
 = = Route description = = 
 PA 737 begins at an interchange with the US 222 freeway on the northern edge of the borough of Kutztown in Berks County as a four @-@ lane divided highway . South of this interchange , the road continues as Greenwich Street into downtown Kutztown . From US 222 , the route heads north into <unk> Township and soon becomes two @-@ lane undivided Krumsville Road as it runs through forested areas to the east of <unk> Creek . The road winds northwest past a few homes before it enters Greenwich Township . PA 737 continues through forested land alongside the creek before it turns north away from the <unk> Creek and winds through a hilly mix of woods and farm fields with some homes . Farther north , the route heads northeast near a few homes and businesses before it comes to an interchange with I @-@ 78 / US 22 . Past this interchange , the road curves to the north and heads into the residential community of Krumsville , where it intersects Old Route 22 . 
 Past Krumsville , PA 737 becomes an unnamed road and enters agricultural areas with some trees and homes , curving to the northwest . The route turns to the north and enters Albany Township , where it runs through farmland and woodland . The road passes through forests before it curves northwest and reaches the residential community of Stony Run . PA 737 continues west through a mix of farm fields and woods before it turns to the north and comes to the community of Kempton . Here , the route passes homes prior to turning west and crossing the Wanamaker , Kempton and Southern Railroad . PA 737 passes to the south of a mill and continues past rural residences before it reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 143 . 
 = = History = = 
 PA 737 originated as an unnumbered arterial highway from US 222 ( Main Street ) in downtown Kutztown to PA 143 at an intersection in Kempton . The state took over the alignment in 1962 , designating the highway as PA 737 , which ran north on Greenwich Street out of Kutztown before following its present alignment to Kempton . In 1971 , the newly formed Pennsylvania Department of Transportation began construction on the Kutztown Bypass , a freeway alignment of US 222 that was planned to bypass downtown Kutztown . The bypass was constructed in September 1972 and US 222 was realigned onto the new highway in 1973 . After the realignment , PA 737 now ended at unnumbered Main Street in downtown Kutztown for a short time . By 1978 , the southern terminus of PA 737 was moved to the interchange with the US 222 freeway to the north of Kutztown . The route has remained on the same alignment since . 
 In 2009 , Berks County began to work on design for a new " Accelerated Bridge Program " for several bridges , one on PA 737 and two on nearby Quadrant Routes . The bridges are set to use stimulus money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( <unk> ) , which will cost the county about $ 180 @,@ 000 ( 2009 USD ) for the studies . In January 2011 , work began on replacing the bridge over Mill Creek between <unk> Mill Road and Eagle Point Road , with completion slated for August of that year . Another bridge over Mill Creek between <unk> Hill Road and <unk> Road closed on July 11 , 2011 for replacement . The replacement of this bridge , which cost over $ 963 thousand and was funded by the state , was completed on December 9 , 2011 , six months ahead of schedule . There are plans to reconfigure PA 737 at its interchange with I @-@ 78 / US 22 . This project will replace the current interchange with a new diamond interchange and will shift PA 737 to the east , with a roundabout at the ramps serving the eastbound lanes of I @-@ 78 / US 22 and <unk> Road .

 = Jonathan Agnew = 
 Jonathan Philip Agnew ( born 4 April 1960 ) is an English cricket broadcaster and former professional cricketer . He was born in Macclesfield , Cheshire , and educated at Uppingham School . He is nicknamed " <unk> " , and , less commonly , " Spiro " – the latter , according to Debrett 's Cricketers ' Who 's Who , after former US Vice President Spiro Agnew . 
 Agnew had a successful first @-@ class career as a fast bowler for Leicestershire from 1979 to 1990 , returning briefly in 1992 . In first @-@ class cricket he took 666 wickets at an average of 29 @.@ 25 . Agnew won three Test caps for England , as well as playing three One Day Internationals in the mid @-@ 1980s , although his entire international career lasted just under a year . In county cricket , Agnew 's most successful seasons came toward the end of his career , after his last international match , when he had learned to swing the ball . He was second- and third @-@ leading wicket @-@ taker in 1987 and 1988 respectively , including the achievement of 100 wickets in a season in 1987 . He was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack in 1988 . 
 While still a player , Agnew began a career in cricket journalism and commentary . Since his retirement as a player , he has become a leading voice of cricket on radio , as the BBC Radio cricket correspondent and as a commentator on Test Match Special . He has also contributed as a member of Australian broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's Grandstand team . Agnew 's on @-@ air " leg over " comment on Test Match Special , made to fellow commentator Brian Johnston in 1991 , provoked giggling fits during a live broadcast and reaction from across England . The incident has been voted " the greatest sporting commentary ever " in a BBC poll ; Michael Henderson , one of Agnew 's peers and rivals , has described him as " a master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC . "

 = = = Background and early years = = = 
 Agnew was born on 4 April 1960 at West Park Hospital in Macclesfield , Cheshire , to Philip and Margaret Agnew . His parents ' forthcoming marriage was announced in The Times in 1957 : Philip Agnew was described as " the only son of Mr and Mrs Norris M. Agnew of Dukenfield Hall , <unk> , Cheshire " and Margaret as " youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs <unk> McConnell of Hampton Hall , Worthen , Shropshire " . The <unk> had a second son in June 1962 and were recorded as living at " Bainton near Stamford , Lincs " ; in April 1966 , a daughter , Felicity , was born and was announced as " a sister for Jonathan and Christopher " . Agnew 's paternal grandmother , Lady Mona Agnew , died aged 110 years and 170 days in 2010 and is on the list of the 100 longest @-@ lived British people ever . 
 Jonathan Agnew recalls growing up on the family farm and first becoming aware of cricket aged " eight or nine " ; his father would carry a radio around and listen to Test Match Special : 
 " The programme sparked an interest in me , in the same way it has in so many tens of thousands of children down the years , igniting a passion that lasts a lifetime . " 
 Driven by early enjoyment of the media coverage of cricket , Agnew developed a love for playing the game . At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked @-@ out room with the commentary provided by the radio , Agnew would go into the garden and practise his bowling for hours , trying to imitate the players he had seen . Agnew 's father , an amateur cricketer , taught him the rudiments of the sport , including an <unk> action , as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him . Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin , Mary Duggan , who was a women 's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963 . 
 From the age of eight , Agnew boarded at <unk> Hall School near Norwich . His first cricket coach was Eileen Ryder but , according to Agnew , after " a couple of years " a professional arrived at the school : Ken Taylor , a former batsman for Yorkshire who had played three Tests for England in the late 1950s and early 1960s . 
 Agnew attended Uppingham School for his secondary education , and left in 1978 with nine O @-@ levels and two A @-@ levels in German and English . From the age of 16 he developed his skills as a right @-@ arm fast bowler out of school hours at Alf Gover 's cricket school at Surrey . That summer , he saw fast bowler Michael Holding take 14 wickets in the 1976 Oval Test match , a performance of pace bowling referred to as " devastating " by cricket writer Norman Preston , which made a lasting impression on Agnew . More than 30 years later he wrote of his bowling during his schooldays : 
 " For an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old bowler I was unusually fast , and enjoyed terrorising our opponents , be they schoolboys ( 8 wickets for 2 runs and 7 for 11 stick in the memory ) or , better still , the teachers in the annual staff match . This , I gather , used to be a friendly affair until I turned up , and I relished the chance to settle a few scores on behalf of my friends – for whom I was the equivalent of a hired assassin – as well as for myself . " 
 He began playing for Surrey County Cricket Club 's second XI in 1977 , but Surrey made no move to sign him as a player . Leicestershire County Cricket Club did however take note of Agnew 's impressive performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School , for whom he took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 8 in 1977 , and signed him while he was still a schoolboy in time for the 1978 season . 
 = = = County cricket = = = 
 On his first @-@ class debut against Lancashire in August 1978 , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Agnew bowled to England international David Lloyd , an opening batsman with nine Test caps . Reported in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , Lloyd " was halfway through a forward defensive push when his off stump was despatched halfway towards the Leicestershire wicket @-@ keeper . " Agnew took one wicket in each innings of the match , and did not bat ; Leicestershire won by an innings . 
 Agnew won a Whitbread Brewery award at the end of his debut season , an achievement he ascribes to the influence of his county captain , Ray Illingworth : he had taken only six first @-@ class wickets at an average of 35 . Illingworth was quoted in The Times as saying that Agnew was " the second fastest bowler " in England in 1978 , behind only Bob Willis . The award afforded him the opportunity to spend a winter in Australia developing his skills , alongside fellow winners Mike Gatting , Wayne Larkins and Chris <unk> , and to be coached by former England fast bowler , Frank Tyson . All four went on to play Test cricket . On that Australia tour , Agnew played his only youth Test , but made headlines when invited to bowl at the touring England team in the nets : 
 " He struck the captain , Mike Brearley , a nasty blow in the face . It was , Agnew recalls , merely a gentle delivery off two paces that flew off a wet patch ; but it did not deter the headline writers . Such early publicity did him no favours , but when a bowler arrives who is young , fast and English , a quiet settling @-@ in period to one of the more difficult apprenticeships in sport is often denied him . " – Wisden 
 Agnew 's 1979 season was disrupted by injury . The Editor 's Notes of the 1980 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack reported , under the heading " England 's Promising Youngsters " , that Agnew had strengthened himself over the winter by felling trees . Agnew 's own account is that 1979 – 80 was " the worst winter of his life " , although his recollection is that he spent it working as a lorry driver . He did , however , make his List A limited overs debut in 1979 , playing just once , against the Sri Lanka touring team – his competitive List A debut followed in 1980 , in the Benson & Hedges Cup against Scotland : he bowled just three overs ( for five runs ) and did not bat .

 Agnew 's career did not initially live up to his early promise . In his first six seasons as a first @-@ class cricketer , his largest haul of wickets was 31 in 1980 . The 1984 season was his breakthrough year : he played 23 first @-@ class matches , taking 84 wickets at an average of 28 @.@ 72 . Playing in the warm @-@ up game against Cambridge University , he achieved figures of 8 – 47 ( taking 8 wickets while conceding 47 runs ) from 20 @.@ 4 overs and was included in the first team for the County Championship matches that followed . He carried that success forward into the County Championship , picking up wickets for Leicestershire including a ten wicket match haul against Surrey in June , and five wickets in an innings against Kent in the days leading up to the fifth Test against West Indies . The England selectors took note and , with the West Indies leading the series 4 – 0 , Agnew and Richard Ellison were given debuts , in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to avoid the " blackwash " . 
 Wisden describes how in the first innings , Agnew 's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves , but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2 – 51 . Agnew describes how Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets , catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips , and passing on some advice on how to dismiss Viv Richards , Botham 's great friend : " Botham said : ' Right . Don 't pitch a single ball up at him . Have two men back for the hook , and bowl short every ball . ' This I did for three overs or so , by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated , but was definitely on the back foot . Finally I pitched one up , the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15 . " Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew 's " first illustrious victims in Test cricket " . 
 England 's next match was a one @-@ off home Test against Sri Lanka and Agnew retained his place in the England team . At the time , Sri Lanka were regarded as the minnows of world cricket : this was only their 12th Test match and their first at Lord 's , but they dominated the match , taking a 121 @-@ run lead on first innings and declaring twice . It was a disappointment for England and , in a batsman @-@ friendly match in which the Sri Lankans racked up 785 runs for just 14 wickets , Agnew suffered . Wisden described England 's pacemen as ineffective ; Agnew 's match figures were 2 – 177 off 43 overs . Poor performance and a muscle injury limited him to bowling a single over on the last day ; later , Agnew reflected on other negative aspects of this match : " I felt a complete outsider , not part of the set @-@ up . I think the feeling in the dressing room was that the game had been a bit of a cock @-@ up . " 
 England toured India and Sri Lanka that winter , and Agnew was included in the tour party . However , he failed to be selected for a Test match , with England 's decision to field two spinners ( Pat Pocock and Phil Edmonds ) in each Test playing a part in limiting Agnew 's opportunities . Agnew played just one first @-@ class match on the tour , achieving match figures of seven wickets at an average of 29 , but he did play in three One Day Internationals ( ODIs ) , two in India and one in Australia . His debut ODI was promising , as he took 3 – 38 in a losing cause . However , in his remaining two ODIs , he proved very expensive , taking no further wickets and conceding more than seven runs an over in each . 
 Agnew began the 1985 season vying with the established England fast bowlers to get back into the Test side . Over the winter , the side had been settled , with Norman Cowans and Chris Cowdrey playing all five Tests . Neil Foster and Richard Ellison shared the third spot alongside the spinners , playing two and three Tests respectively . Cowdrey and Ellison had struggled with the ball , both averaging more than 70 . However , the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer 's Ashes series . Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India , only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series . England won the first Test , yet dropped Cowans and Peter Willey , replacing them with Phil Edmonds and Foster . After losing the second Test , and struggling with the ball in the third Test , when Australia made 539 all out in their only innings , England decided to make further changes . 
 Agnew had performed consistently in county cricket through June and July , culminating in what was to be , statistically , his finest moment as a bowler . Playing against Kent , he took 9 – 70 in the first innings . His timing was perfect and he was called up for the Fourth Test against Australia . The match finished as a draw , and Agnew failed to take a wicket . He was relegated from an opening bowler in the first innings , to fifth bowler in the second , in which he only bowled nine overs . He was subsequently dropped again from the side , only for Richard Ellison to cement his place with match @-@ winning performances that helped claim the Ashes for England .

 In the 1987 season , Agnew achieved the feat of 100 first @-@ class wickets in an English cricket season when he took 101 wickets for his county . He was the first Leicestershire player to achieve this milestone since Jack <unk> in 1968 , which was the season before the county programme was greatly reduced , making the feat much less common . By this stage , he was working on local radio during the winters and he found the reassurance of the additional income and career path a major factor in his improved form . Wisden preferred to attribute his success to " bowling off a shorter run and ... a wicked slower ball added to his armoury " . The achievement led to him being selected as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year . 
 Agnew 's form remained good : he followed his 1987 feat of taking the second @-@ most wickets in the County Championship by taking the third @-@ most in 1988 . In 1989 , with two years of good form behind him and England losing 4 – 0 in the 1989 Ashes series , Agnew " came frustratingly close to the recall to the England team that I had set my heart on . " 
 County captain and friend of Agnew , David Gower was England captain , and a number of fast bowlers from around the country called the telephone in the Leicestershire dressing room , to tell Gower that they were injured and unavailable for the Sixth Test . According to Agnew 's account , Gower was at a loss as to whom to call into the squad . 
 Agnew recalls that county colleague Peter Willey made a suggestion : 
 " ' What about Agnew ? ' suggested Peter Willey ... ' He 's bowling pretty well at the moment . ' David 's face lit up . ' Of course ! ' he said . ' Jonathan , you 're in . Go home , get your England stuff ready , and I 'll call first thing tomorrow ... ' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice , this was still fantastic news ... After three disappointing Test appearances , this was my second chance , and the opportunity to set the record straight ... [ The following day ] the telephone finally rang . ' Got some bad news , I 'm afraid , ' David began . ' I couldn 't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart , so you 're not in any more . They 've gone for Alan <unk> . Know anything about him ? ' With that , David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test . I felt utterly devastated , and knew I would never play for England again , which had been my main motivating force . So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer , it was an easy decision to make . I might have been only thirty , which was no age to retire from professional cricket , and I could easily have played for another five years . But it was definitely time to move on . " 
 Agnew formally retired from playing professional cricket at the end of the following season : Leicestershire 's last match of the 1990 Championship season was his last first @-@ class game . Aged 30 , Agnew took 1 – 42 in Derbyshire 's only innings and scored 6 in his only turn to bat . In 1992 , two years after retirement , Leicestershire experienced an injury crisis before their NatWest Trophy semi @-@ final against Essex . Agnew answered a request to assist and played , finishing the match with figures of 12 – 2 – 31 – 1 ( bowling twelve overs , including two maiden overs , and taking one wicket for 31 runs ) . Leicestershire won the match and progressed to the final , but Agnew chose not to play . 
 = = = Playing style and career summary = = = 
 Agnew 's best first @-@ class bowling figures were 9 for 70 and he took six ten @-@ wicket hauls in 218 matches . In the 1988 Cricketer of the Year editorial on Agnew , Wisden noted that " his pace comes from a <unk> wrist action and co @-@ ordination ... In the field , Agnew has at times appeared to be moving with his <unk> tied together , but his long run @-@ up was one of the more graceful in the game . However , it was the shortening of that run @-@ up , and a cutting @-@ down of pace , which led to ... achievements [ late in his career ] " 
 As a batsman , Agnew had some highs , but it was his weaker suit . His highest first @-@ class batting score was 90 , starting initially as nightwatchman in 1987 against Yorkshire , at North Marine Road Ground , Scarborough . Wisden commented , " Agnew hit a spectacular , career @-@ best 90 from 68 balls , including six sixes and eight fours , and then took the first five Yorkshire wickets to fall " . Wisden commented that Agnew was no all @-@ rounder , but he could " certainly bat ... on his day he can destroy anything pitched up around off stump . " The same piece noted his usual playing style , " playing hard but always with a sense of fun " . 
 Agnew reflects on his playing career as having had two periods : 
 " My career could be divided up into two sections : the first being when I was an out @-@ and @-@ out fast bowler and played for England when I probably should not have done ; and the second being when I slowed down a bit , learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done . 
 His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut , and his first and last ODIs were played less than a month apart . Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined , " his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country , taking 194 wickets , but in 1989 , when England were desperate for pace bowlers , his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire " . In 1988 , when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year , Wisden recorded this verdict on the <unk> of Agnew 's Test career : " Asked about Agnew 's omission , the chairman of selectors , P. B. H. May , expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make about someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship . " 
 = = Media and broadcasting career = = 
 Agnew began gaining experience as a journalist in 1987 , while still playing cricket , when at the invitation of John Rawling he took off @-@ season employment with BBC Radio Leicester as a sports producer . It was during this period that he " fell in love with radio " , and following his retirement , he had a short stint as chief cricket writer of Today newspaper . While covering the 1990 – 91 Ashes series for Today , he was approached by Peter Baxter about joining Test Match Special . Unhappy at certain editorial decisions that had been taken during his time with the newspaper , Agnew agreed to attend an interview after the tour . 
 Agnew joined Test Match Special in 1991 , in time for the first Test match of the summer . He was initially a junior member of the Test Match Special team , learning at close quarters from figures such as Brian Johnston , Henry Blofeld and Bill <unk> . The same year , he was also appointed the BBC 's cricket correspondent , taking over from Test Match Special colleague , Christopher Martin @-@ Jenkins . In 2007 , when asked which sports journalist he most respected , Martin @-@ Jenkins named Agnew , because he " combines astute journalism with apparently effortless communication skills . " He has also commentated for the Australian ABC radio network during Ashes series in Australia . 
 When Channel 4 won the broadcasting rights to television coverage of England 's home Test matches in 1998 , Agnew was approached by the broadcaster and offered a job on the commentary team . Agnew declined the opportunity , opting to remain BBC cricket correspondent , in part because he was a " radio man " and in part out of loyalty . The following year , England hosted the 1999 Cricket World Cup . The BBC had the UK television rights , but with so many specialist TV cricket presenters now at Channel 4 and therefore unavailable to the BBC , Agnew was asked to present the coverage . His recollections of the experience are that it was something of a trial , helped only by the experienced Richie Benaud alongside him : 
 " I really had no option but to agree to do it , despite my reservations about working in television . Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio , this was quite an irony . I was given one day of training ... [ Transmission ended with the presenter being given a countdown ] from one minute to zero , at which point you have to say goodbye . I did not find that easy at all ... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games ... [ Richie ] ... very kindly , suggested a plan ... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I would ask him a question , and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go . I would then thank him , turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised . Miraculously , for the rest of the tournament I always heard ' zero ' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye ... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one . " 
 In addition to his writing and broadcasting work , Agnew 's commentary has been recorded for several computer games , including the International Cricket Captain and Brian Lara Cricket series . He is a shareholder in <unk> Ltd , a company which runs the website of the same address and acquired The Wisden Cricketer magazine from BSkyB in December 2010 . 
 Agnew has won many awards for his broadcasting , including two Sony Awards for Best Reporter ( 1992 and 1994 ) , and Best Radio Broadcaster of the Year ( 2010 ) , an award from the Association of Sports Journalists . Agnew was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts by De Montfort University , Leicester in November 2008 , and an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Loughborough University in July 2011 . 
 His peers in sports journalism have frequently commented on Agnew 's skills as a broadcaster and writer . As well as the praise of Christopher Martin @-@ Jenkins , Agnew has been described by Lucy Elkins in The Daily Mail as " the voice of cricket " and " one of the most highly regarded cricket commentators in the world . " . Michael Henderson , in the aftermath of the Stanford cricket controversy , wrote of Agnew as a " master broadcaster ... the pick of the sports correspondents at the BBC ... Agnew 's is a sane , reasonable voice in a game that is going potty . Fair @-@ minded , even @-@ tempered , he has become one of the finest specialists the BBC has ever had . In his understated way he speaks for the game : not the people who play it . " 
 = = = Notable broadcasting incidents = = = 
 In 2001 , Agnew was part of the BBC team that was sent to Sri Lanka to cover England 's Test match series . As a result of confusion and a row over broadcasting rights , the BBC team found itself barred from the Galle International Stadium , where the first Test was to take place . Agnew and Pat Murphy refused to be defeated and " decamped to the fort ramparts overlooking the ground and broadcast their programme from there . With both team and equipment protected from the sun by an umbrella held by Mr Agnew 's driver , Simmons , it made a colourful scene . " The England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) chief executive , Tim Lamb became involved in discussions and the Test Match Special team were allowed to return to the ground . 
 The Daily Telegraph called Agnew and Murphy 's effort , " new heights of ingenuity " . Agnew 's reaction to the event was , " It 's a sad day for everyone involved in English cricket . Is it really that cricket is getting so greedy that everyone who wants to come and report on the game for the good of the game is going to have to be charged for it ? " However , he remained upbeat about the situation : " Actually I get rather more of a panoramic view of it from up here than I did yesterday in my commentary box . There 's a little road that runs round the back of the ground . All manner of people are trundling up and down – buses , bikes and little three wheeled tuk @-@ <unk> – it 's rather fun . " 
 In 2004 , the Zimbabwe government banned media from following the England cricket team tour of the country . Agnew 's reaction was combative , appearing on BBC Breakfast and giving his opinion that the ban presented the ECB with a chance to withdraw from the controversial tour and that they should take the opportunity . 
 In the summer of 2008 , then England captain Michael Vaughan reacted testily on @-@ air to questions by Agnew about his batting form . When Vaughan resigned shortly thereafter , Mike Atherton , writing in The Times , commented that it had been an out @-@ of @-@ character outburst that was a portent of the resignation . When Atherton had himself been England captain , Agnew had led the calls for Atherton to resign over a controversy known as the " dirt in the pocket " affair . Fellow BBC commentator Jack Bannister felt that Agnew 's comments were inappropriate , but only to the extent that he had referred to his friendship with Atherton : Bannister advised Agnew that he should continue to be honest and forthright as a reporter . 
 Agnew was involved in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on Test Match Special in 2009 . The Daily Telegraph reported that " the cricket @-@ loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew , and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30 @-@ minute interview " , but Will Buckley , writing for The Observer , described Agnew 's " amorous ambitions " as " positioned ... firmly on the <unk> side of things " . Agnew was furious , noting he " gave ... Will Buckley 24 hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert , and he has declined ... As you can imagine , I have taken being called a pervert quite badly . " Allen herself supported Agnew : " [ I ] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to ... [ Agnew ] , he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during our interview . I don 't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one . " Buckley eventually apologised . 
 = = = " Leg over " incident = = = 
 Agnew has been known to laugh at or include occasional sexual innuendo , while on air . The most notable of these occurrences took place in August 1991 , when Agnew was commentating with Brian Johnston . In a review of the day , Johnston was describing how Ian Botham , while batting , had overbalanced and tried , but failed , to step over his stumps . Botham was consequently given out hit wicket . Agnew 's comment on this action was : " He just didn 't quite get his leg over . " Botham had attracted a number of headlines during his career for his sexual exploits and in British English , " getting one 's leg over " is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse . 
 The comment led to " Johnston , a lover of schoolboy innuendo to rival Frankie Howerd , erupting in a Krakatoa of snorts , whimpers , sneezes and , finally , uncontrollable laughter . " Johnston tried to continue his summary , despite being almost unable to speak for laughing . He did manage to say " <unk> , for goodness ' sake , stop it " between convulsions of mirth . 
 The incident was heard by thousands of commuters driving home from work , many of whom were forced to stop driving because they were laughing so much : a two @-@ mile traffic jam at the entrance to the Dartford Tunnel was reportedly caused by drivers unable to pay the toll due to laughter . Fourteen years later , in 2005 , Agnew 's line , " Just didn 't quite get his leg over " was voted " the greatest sporting commentary of all time " by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live . The other eight finalists included Kenneth Wolstenholme 's " They think it 's all over – it is now ! " and Ian Robertson 's " This is the one . He drops for World Cup glory ... It 's up ! It 's over ! He 's done it ! Jonny Wilkinson is England 's hero yet again " . Agnew and Johnston secured 78 % of the votes .

 In 1992 , a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent , Agnew 's first marriage to Beverley , to whom he was married in 1983 , ended in divorce . He has written about the role that cricket played in the collapse of the relationship , comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe . He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children : 
 I had two young children , aged seven and five ... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job . What chance do you have when , be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it , you are away for months at a time each and every winter ? ... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest , Jennifer , when I returned from one tour ... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often . I find that one especially hard to answer . " 
 Agnew has subsequently remarried : he met Emma Agnew , current editor of BBC East Midlands Today , when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire . 
 Agnew suffers from Dupuytren 's contracture , a medical condition . The condition is causing Agnew 's right hand to contract into a claw @-@ like position . He has had eight operations , but it continues to degenerate and he finds the condition so upsetting he has considered having one of his fingers amputated . However , Agnew enjoys playing the piano and amputation would make worse his already impaired ability on the instrument .

 During Agnew 's playing career , a dispute with team @-@ mate Phillip DeFreitas attracted media attention : when DeFreitas poured salt over Agnew 's lunch , Agnew responded by throwing DeFreitas ' cricket bag and kit from the dressing room balcony . Former England cricketer Derek Pringle has written about Agnew 's sense of humour , describing him as " hysterical " . The pair toured Sri Lanka together on England B 's 1986 tour . Pringle recalls that one hot day when England were in the field , Agnew came in for lunch : " It 's * * * * ing [ sic ] red hot on the field , and when you come off it 's * * * * ing red hot in the dressing @-@ room , " Agnew screamed . " Then , what do you get for lunch , * * * * ing red hot curry ? "

 It was reported in various newspapers in 2013 that Agnew had offered to accompany Brian Dodds , his second wife ’ s ex @-@ husband , to the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic in Zurich after Dodds was diagnosed with motor neurone disease . Dodds died in England from the disease in 2005 . 
 = William Robinson ( gardener ) = 
 William Robinson ( 5 July 1838 – 17 May 1935 ) was an Irish practical gardener and journalist whose ideas about wild gardening spurred the movement that led to the popularising of the English cottage garden , a parallel to the search for honest simplicity and vernacular style of the British Arts and Crafts movement . Robinson is credited as an early practitioner of the mixed herbaceous border of hardy perennial plants , a champion too of the " wild garden " , who vanquished the high Victorian pattern garden of planted @-@ out bedding schemes . Robinson 's new approach to gardening gained popularity through his magazines and several books — particularly The Wild Garden , illustrated by Alfred Parsons , and The English Flower Garden . 
 Robinson advocated more natural and less formal @-@ looking plantings of hardy perennials , shrubs , and climbers , and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening , which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses . He railed against standard roses , statuary , sham Italian gardens , and other artifices common in gardening at the time . Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include : using alpine plants in rock gardens ; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil ; use of hardy perennials and native plants ; and large plantings of perennials in natural @-@ looking drifts . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 Robinson began his garden work at an early age , as a garden boy for the Marquess of Waterford at <unk> , County Waterford . From there , he went to the estate of an Irish baronet in <unk> , County Laois , Sir Hunt Johnson @-@ Walsh , and was put in charge of a large number of greenhouses at the age of 21 . According to one account , as the result of a bitter quarrel , one cold winter night in 1861 he let the fires go out , killing many valuable plants . Other accounts consider the story to be a gross exaggeration . Whether in haste after the greenhouse incident or not , Robinson left for Dublin in 1861 , where the influence of David Moore , head of the botanical garden at Glasnevin , a family friend , helped him find work at the Botanical Gardens of Regent 's Park , London , where he was given responsibility for the hardy herbaceous plants , specialising in British wildflowers . 
 At that time , the Royal Horticultural Society 's Kensington gardens were being designed and planted with vast numbers of greenhouse flowers in mass plantings . Robinson wrote that " it was not easy to get away from all this false and hideous " art " . " But his work with native British plants did allow him to get away to the countryside , where he " began to get an idea ( which should be taught to every boy at school ) that there was ( for gardens even ) much beauty in our native flowers and trees . " 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 In 1866 , at the age of 29 , he became a fellow of the Linnean Society under the sponsorship of Charles Darwin , James Veitch , David Moore , and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists . Two months later , he left Regents Park to write for The Gardener 's Chronicle and The Times , and represented the leading horticultural firm of Veitch at the 1867 Paris Exhibition . He began writing many of his publications , beginning with Gleanings from French Gardens in 1868 , The Parks , Gardens , and <unk> of Paris in 1869 , and Alpine Flowers for Gardens and The Wild Garden in 1870 . In 1871 he launched his own gardening journal , simply named The Garden , which over the years included contributions from notables such as John Ruskin , Oliver Wendell Holmes , Gertrude Jekyll , William Morris , Dean Hole , Canon Ellacombe , and James Britten . 
 His most influential books were The Wild Garden , which made his reputation and allowed him to start his magazine The Garden ; and The English Flower Garden , 1883 , which he revised in edition after edition and included contributions from his lifelong friend Gertrude Jekyll , among others . She later edited The Garden for a couple of years and contributed many articles to his publications , which also included Gardening Illustrated ( from 1879 ) . 
 He first met Jekyll in 1875 — they were in accord in their design principles and maintained a close friendship and professional association for over 50 years . He helped her on her garden at <unk> Wood ; she provided plants for his garden at Gravetye Manor . Jekyll wrote about Robinson that : 
 ... when English gardening was mostly represented by the innate <unk> of the " bedding " system , with its wearisome repetitions and garish colouring , Mr William Robinson chose as his work in live to make better known the treasures that were lying neglected , and at the same time to overthrow the feeble follies of the " bedding " system . It is mainly owing to his unremitting labours that a clear knowledge of the world of hardy @-@ plant beauty is now placed within easy reach of all who care to acquire it , and that the " bedding mania " is virtually dead . 
 Robinson also published God 's Acre Beautiful or The Cemeteries of The Future , in which he applied his gardening aesthetic to urban churchyards and cemeteries . His campaign included trying to win an unwilling public to the advantages of cremation over burial , and he quite freely shared unsavoury stories of what happened in certain crowded graveyards . He was instrumental in the founding of Golders Green Crematorium and designed the gardens there , which replaced the traditional Victorian mourning graveyard with open lawn , flowerbeds , and woodland gardens . 
 = = = Gravetye Manor = = = 
 With his writing career a financial success , in 1884 Robinson was able to purchase the Elizabethan Manor of Gravetye near East Grinstead in Sussex , along with about 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) of rich pasture and woodland . His diary of planting and care was published as Gravetye Manor , or Twenty Years of the Work round an old Manor House ( 1911 ) . Gravetye would find practical fulfilment of many of Robinson 's ideas of a more natural style of gardening . Eventually it would grow to nearly 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 km2 ) . 
 Much of the estate had been managed as a coppiced woodland , giving Robinson the opportunity to plant drifts of <unk> , cyclamen , and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts . On the edges , and in the cleared spaces in the woods , Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone , lily , acanthus , and pampas grass , along with shrubs such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Closer to the house he had some flower beds ; throughout he planted red valerian , which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases . Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually , including 100 @,@ 000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897 . Over the years he added hundreds of trees , some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted . Other features included an oval @-@ shaped walled kitchen garden , a heather garden , and a water garden with one of the largest collections of water lilies in Europe . 
 Robinson invited several well @-@ known painters to portray his own landscape artistry , including the English watercolourist Beatrice Parsons , the landscape and botanical painter Henry Moon , and Alfred Parsons . Moon and Parsons illustrated many of Robinson 's works . 
 After Robinson 's death , Gravetye Manor was left to the Forestry Commission , who left it derelict for many years . In 1958 it was leased to a restaurateur who refurbished the gardens , replacing some of the flower beds with lawn . Today , Gravetye Manor serves as a hotel and restaurant . 
 = = = Long @-@ term impact on Gardening = = = 
 Through his magazines and books , Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas that have become commonplace today . He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border , which he referred to by the older name of ' mixed border ' — it included a mixture of shrubs , hardy and half @-@ hardy herbaceous plants . He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil , with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants . Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses . Following a visit to the Alps , Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens , which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden . 
 His most significant influence was the introduction of the idea of wild gardening , which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden . The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow , <unk> , and waterside is taken for granted today , but was revolutionary in Robinson 's time . In the first edition , he happily used any plant that could be naturalised , including half @-@ hardy perennials and natives from other parts of the world — thus Robinson 's wild garden was not limited to locally native species . Robinson 's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale , but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards , where the ' garden ' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow . Robinson 's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today — from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens . 
 = = The Wild Garden , 1870 = = 
 In The Wild Garden Robinson set forth fresh gardening principles that expanded the idea of garden and introduced themes and techniques that are taken for granted today , notably that of " naturalised " plantings . Robinson 's audience were not the owners of intensely gardened suburban plots , nor dwellers in gentrified country cottages seeking a nostalgic atmosphere ; nor was Robinson concerned with the immediate surroundings of the English country house . Robinson 's wild garden brought the untidy edges , where garden blended into the larger landscape into the garden picture : meadow , water 's edge , woodland edges and openings . 
 The hardy plants Robinson endorsed were not all natives by any means : two chapters are devoted to the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to <unk> schemes . The narcissus he preferred were the small , delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula . <unk> included goldenrod and asters , rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens . Nor did Robinson 's ' wild ' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state — he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic . The nature of plants ' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design , in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable . 
 Without being in any sense retrograde , Robinson 's book brought attention back to the plants , which had been eclipsed since the decline of " gardenesque " plantings of the 1820s and 30s , during the use of tender annuals as massed color in patterned schemes of the mid @-@ century . The book 's popularity was largely due to Robinson 's promise that wild gardening could be easy and beautiful ; that the use of hardy perennials would be less expensive and offer more variety than the frequent mass planting of greenhouse annuals ; and that it followed nature , which he considered the source of all true design . 
 = = The English Flower Garden , 1883 = = 
 In The English Flower Garden , Robinson laid down the principles that revolutionised the art of gardening . Robinson 's source of inspiration was the simple cottage garden , long neglected by the fashionable landscapists . In The English Flower Garden he rejected the artificial and the formal , specifically statuary , topiary , carpet bedding , and waterworks — comparing the modern garden to " the lifeless formality of wall @-@ paper or carpet . " The straight lines and form in many gardens were seen by Robinson to " carry the dead lines of the builder into the garden . " He admired nature 's diversity , and promoted creepers and ramblers , smaller plantings of roses , herbaceous plants and bulbs , woodland plants , and winter flowers . 
 Robinson compared gardening to art , and wrote in the first chapter : 
 The gardener must follow the true artist , however modestly , in his respect for things as they are , in delight in natural form and beauty of flower and tree , if we are to be free from barren geometry , and if our gardens are ever to be true pictures .... And as the artist 's work is to see for us and preserve in pictures some of the beauty of landscape , tree , or flower , so the gardener 's should be to keep for us as far as may be , in the fulness of their natural beauty , the living things themselves . 
 The first part of The English Flower Garden covered garden design , emphasising an approach that was individual and not stereotypical : " the best kind of garden grows out of the situation , as the primrose grows out of a cool bank . " The second part covered individual plants , hardy and half @-@ hardy , showing artistic and natural use of each plant — with several articles included from The Garden and chapters contributed by leading gardeners of the day , including Gertrude Jekyll , who contributed the chapter on " Colour in the Flower Garden " 
 This book was first published in 1883 , with the last and definitive edition published in 1933 . During Robinson 's lifetime , the book found increasing popularity , with fifteen editions during his life . For fifty years , The English Flower Garden was considered a bible by many gardeners . 
 = The List ( The Office ) = 
 " The List " is the eighth season premiere of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's 153rd episode overall . The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 22 , 2011 . It was written and directed by executive producer B. J. Novak . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , new CEO Robert California ( James Spader ) writes a mysterious list that has a line down the middle and every member of the office on either one side or the other . The office members frantically try to figure out what it means , causing a crisis for manager Andy Bernard . 
 " The List " was the first episode of The Office to feature James Spader 's Robert California in a starring role . The episode received moderately positive reviews with many commenting that it proved the series could survive without Carell . According to Nielsen Media Research , " The List " drew an estimated 7 @.@ 63 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 9 rating / 10 % share in the 18 – 49 demographic , making it , at the time , the lowest @-@ rated season premiere since the first @-@ season premiere . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jim explains to the camera that Robert California ( James Spader ) was appointed Regional Manager of the Scranton Branch , but on his first day traveled to Florida and convinced Jo Bennett to give him her position as CEO of Dunder Mifflin @-@ Sabre . Robert then appointed Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) as Scranton Regional Manager in his place . Andy makes it his goal for the office to receive a half day off on the Friday before the Columbus Day weekend . 
 Robert accidentally leaves his personal notebook at Erin Hannon 's ( Ellie Kemper ) desk , and she notices it contains a list of Scranton 's employees on two columns with a line down the middle . Concerned about what the list means , the employees pressure Andy to ask Robert about it . Robert is offended by Andy 's inquiry , assuming that he <unk> through his notebook . While brushing the list off as " doodles , " he conspicuously moves Andy 's name from the left column to the right . Later that day , Robert invites the employees on the left column to lunch : Jim ( John Krasinski ) , Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) , Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) , Kevin ( Brian Baumgartner ) , Phyllis ( Phyllis Smith ) , Toby ( Paul Lieberstein ) and Oscar ( Oscar Nunez ) . After they leave , the " right @-@ siders " try to console themselves with a pizza party , but remain despondent about their exclusion . 
 During lunch , the " left @-@ siders " pester Robert about the list . Slightly intoxicated , Robert informs them that the left @-@ siders are " winners " while the right side are " losers " . Jim is astonished , but the others become cocky . Kevin sends a mass text to the right @-@ siders , mocking them as " losers " , and later squirts Meredith with a water pistol . Andy does not like this and confronts Robert with a demand to alter the list . Robert refuses , and then speaks to everyone by admitting to calling certain members of the office losers , but also reprimanding them for fixating so much on someone else 's opinion of them , saying he will be working with them a long time and that his opinions on certain people may very well change , finishing with " Winners , prove me right ; losers , prove me wrong " . Andy , unsatisfied , lists off the qualities the right @-@ siders have , stating that Stanley ( Leslie David Baker ) may be a <unk> , but has the best sales record in the office ( something Robert admits to being unaware of ) ; Meredith ( Kate Flannery ) is persistent and does not know what the word " no " means ; and Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) is " easily the most creative and kind person [ he has ] ever worked with " . Andy concedes to Robert that putting Gabe ( Zach Woods ) in the losers ' column was " astute " . He then demands the Columbus half day and exits , prompting a respecting smile from Robert . Though the office annually gets the half day in any case , they happily wish him good evening as they depart , and Andy looks very pleased with his work as the boss . 
 Pam is pregnant with her and Jim 's second child ( revealed to be a boy ) and is emotional , easily brought to tears throughout the day . Angela is also pregnant , having married the state senator Robert Lipton over the summer , and says that she 's " Little <unk> " to Pam 's " Big <unk> " . When Jim picks up his things to leave for the day , he " accidentally " drops a piece of paper . Pam picks it up and sees Jim 's personal winners and losers list : Pam , Cece and their new baby are on the left , and the words " everything else " is written on the right . Pam tearfully vows to frame it .

 The pudús ( Mapudungun <unk> or <unk> , Spanish : pudú , Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) are two species of South American deer from the genus Pudu , and are the world 's smallest deer . The name is a loanword from Mapudungun , the language of the indigenous Mapuche people of southern Chile . The two species of pudús are the northern pudú ( Pudu mephistophiles ) from Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru , and the southern pudú ( Pudu puda ; sometimes incorrectly modified to Pudu pudu ) from southern Chile and south @-@ western Argentina . Pudús range in size from 32 to 44 centimeters ( 13 to 17 in ) tall , and up to 85 centimeters ( 33 in ) long . As of 2009 , the southern pudu is classified as near threatened , while the northern pudu is classified as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus Pudu was first erected by English naturalist John Edward Gray in 1850 . <unk> was a Latinized version of the name proposed by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1877 , but was ruled invalid . Pudús are classified in the New World deer subfamily <unk> within the deer family Cervidae . The term " pudú " itself is derived from the Mapuche people of southern Chile . Because they live on the slopes of the Andes Mountain Range , they are also known as the " Chilean mountain goat " . 
 Two similar species of pudús are recognised : 
 The southern pudú ( P. puda ) is the better @-@ known species found in the southern Andes of Chile and Argentina . It is slightly larger than its sister species , the northern pudú , being 35 to 45 cm ( 14 to 18 in ) tall at the shoulder and weighs 6 @.@ 4 to 13 @.@ 4 kg ( 14 to 30 lb ) . The antlers of the southern pudú grow to be 5 @.@ 3 to 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 1 to 3 @.@ 5 in ) long and tend to curve back , somewhat like a mountain goat . Its coat is a dark chestnut @-@ brown , and tends to tuft in the front , covering the antlers . It is found at lower elevations than its sister species , from sea level to 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . 
 The northern pudú ( P. mephistophiles ) , found in the Andes of Colombia , Peru , and Ecuador , is the smallest species of deer in the world , being 32 to 35 cm ( 13 to 14 in ) tall at the shoulder and weighs 3 @.@ 3 to 6 kg ( 7 @.@ 3 to 13 @.@ 2 lb ) . The antlers of the northern pudú grow to about 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) long , also curving backward . Its coat tends to be lighter than that of the southern pudú , but the face is darker compared to the coat . It is found at higher altitudes than its sister species , from 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 to 13 @,@ 100 ft ) above sea level . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pudús are the world 's smallest deer , with the southern pudú being slightly larger than the northern pudú . It has a stocky frame supported by four short and slender legs . It is 32 to 44 cm ( 13 to 17 in ) high at the shoulder and up to 85 cm ( 33 in ) in length . Pudús normally weigh up to 12 kg ( 26 lb ) , but the highest recorded weight of a pudú is 13 @.@ 4 kg ( 30 lb ) . Pudús have small , black eyes , black noses , and rounded ears with lengths of 7 @.@ 5 to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) . Sexual dimorphism in the species includes an absence of antlers in females . Males have short , spiked antlers that are not forked , as seen in most species of deer . The antlers , which are shed annually , can extend from 6 @.@ 5 to 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 to 3 @.@ 0 in ) in length and protrude from between the ears . Also on the head are large preorbital glands . Pudús have small hooves , dewclaws , and short tails about 4 @.@ 0 to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 8 in ) in length when measured without hair . Coat coloration varies with season , sex , and individual genes . The fur is long and stiff , typically pressed close to the body , with a reddish @-@ brown to dark @-@ brown hue . The neck and shoulders of an aged pudú turn a dark gray @-@ brown in the winter . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The pudú inhabits temperate rainforests in South America , where the dense underbrush and bamboo thickets offer protection from predators . Southern Chile , south @-@ west Argentina , Chiloé Island , and northwest South America are home to the deer . The northern pudú is found in the northern Andes of Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru , from 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 to 13 @,@ 100 ft ) above sea level . The southern species is found in the slope of the southern Andes from sea level to 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . 
 The climate of the pudú 's habitat is composed of two main seasons : a damp , moderate winter and an arid summer . Annual precipitation in these areas of Argentina and Chile ranges from 2 to 4 m ( 6 @.@ 6 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Social = = = 
 The pudú is a solitary animal whose behavior in the wild is largely unknown because of its secretive nature . Pudús are crepuscular , most active in the morning , late afternoon , and evening . Their home range generally extends about 16 to 25 ha ( 40 to 62 acres ) , much of which consists of crisscrossing pudú @-@ trodden paths . Each pudú has its own home range , or territory . A single animal 's territory is marked with sizable dung piles found on paths and near eating and resting areas . Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pudú deer . Pudús do not interact socially , other than to mate . An easily frightened animal , the deer barks when in fear . Its fur bristles and the pudú shivers when angered . 
 Predators of the pudús include the horned owl , Andean fox , Magellan fox , cougar , and other small cats . The pudú is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often , smelling the air for scents of predators . Being a proficient climber , jumper , and sprinter , the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued . The lifespan of the pudús ranges from 8 to 10 years in the wild . The longest recorded lifespan is 15 years and 9 months . However , such longevity is rare and most pudús die at a much younger age , from a wide range of causes . Maternal neglect of newborns , as well as a wide range of diseases , can decrease the population . A popular rumor is that if alarmed to a high degree , pudús die from fear @-@ induced cardiac complications . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The pudús are herbivorous , consuming vines , leaves from low trees , shrubs , succulent sprouts , herbs , ferns , blossoms , buds , tree bark , and fallen fruit . They can survive without drinking water for long periods due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diets . 
 Pudús have various methods of obtaining the foliage they need . Their small stature and cautious nature create obstacles in attaining food . They stop often while searching for food to stand on their hind legs and smell the wind , detecting food scents . Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth , but mature males may use their <unk> antlers . The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves . Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size , the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage . They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Pudús are solitary and only come together for rut . Mating season is in the Southern Hemisphere autumn , from April to May . <unk> DNA is arranged into 70 chromosomes . To mate , the pudú male rests his chin on the female 's back , then sniffs her rear before mounting her from behind , holding her with his fore legs . The gestation period ranges from 202 to 223 days ( around 7 months ) with the average being 210 days . A single offspring or sometimes twins are born in austral spring , from November to January . Newborns weigh 700 to 1 @,@ 000 g ( 25 to 35 oz ) with the average birth weight being 890 g ( 31 oz ) . Newborns less than 600 g ( 21 oz ) or more than 1 @,@ 000 g ( 35 oz ) die . Females and males weigh the same at birth . <unk> have reddish @-@ brown fur and southern pudú fawns have white spots running the length of their backs . Young are weaned after 2 months . Females mature sexually in 6 months , while males mature in 8 – 12 months . <unk> are fully grown in 3 months , but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12 months . 
 = = Status and conservation = = 
 As of 2009 , both species of pudús are classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List , mainly because of overhunting and habitat loss . Pudu puda is listed in CITES Appendix I , and Pudu mephistophiles is listed in CITES Appendix II . The southern species is more easily maintained in captivity than the northern , though small populations of the northern formerly existed in zoos . As of 2010 , more than 100 southern pudús are kept at ISIS @-@ registered institutions with the vast majority in European and US zoos . Pudús are difficult to transport because they are easily overheated and stressed . Pudús are protected in various national parks ; parks require resources to enforce protection of the deer . 
 Efforts to preserve the pudú species are being taken in order to prevent extinction . An international captive @-@ breeding program for the southern pudú led by Concepcion University in Chile has been started . Some deer have been bred in captivity and reintroduced into <unk> Huapi National Park in Argentina . Reintroduction efforts include the use of radio collars for tracking . The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has banned the international trading of pudús . The Wildlife Conservation Society protects their natural habitat and works to recreate it for pudús in captivity . Despite efforts made by the World Wildlife Fund , the size of the pudú population remains unknown . Threats to the pudús remain despite various conservation efforts . 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 Pudús are threatened due to the destruction of their rainforest habitat . The land is cleared for human development , cattle ranching , agriculture , logging , and exotic tree plantations . Habitat fragmentation and road accidents cause pudú deaths . They are taken from the wild as pets , as well as exported illegally . They are overhunted and killed for food by specially trained hunting dogs . The recently introduced red deer compete with pudús for food . Domestic dogs prey upon pudús and transfer parasites through contact . Pudús are very susceptible to diseases such as bladder worms , lungworms , roundworms , and <unk> . 
 = The Holocaust in Albania = 
 The Holocaust in Albania consisted of murders , deportations and crimes against humanity committed against Jews , Slavs , Roma and other minorities in Greater Albania by German , Italian and Albanian collaborationist forces while the country was under Italian and German occupation during the Second World War . Throughout the war , nearly 2 @,@ 000 Jews sought refuge in Albania @-@ proper . Most of these Jewish refugees were treated well by the local Albanian population , despite the fact that the country was occupied first by Fascist Italy , and then by Nazi Germany . Albanians , following a traditional custom of hospitality known as <unk> , often sheltered Jewish refugees in mountain villages , and transported them to Adriatic ports from where they fled to Italy . Other Jews joined resistance movements throughout the country . 
 For the 500 Jews who lived in Albanian @-@ dominated Kosovo , the experience was starkly different and many did not survive the war . With the surrender of Italy in September 1943 , German forces occupied Albania , Kosovo and other territories that had been annexed to the country . In 1944 , an Albanian Waffen @-@ SS division was formed , which arrested and handed over to the Germans a further 281 Jews from Kosovo who were subsequently deported to the Bergen @-@ Belsen concentration camp , where many were killed . In late 1944 , German forces were driven out of Albania @-@ proper and Communists led by Enver Hoxha came to power in the country . At the same time , Axis forces in the Albanian @-@ annexed regions of Kosovo and western Macedonia were defeated by the Yugoslav Partisans , who subsequently re @-@ incorporated these areas into the newly Communist Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia . 
 Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania @-@ proper , and Albanian @-@ annexed Kosovo and western Macedonia during the war . As up to 1 @,@ 800 Jews were living in Albania @-@ proper at the end of the war , it is estimated that the country emerged from the Second World War with a population of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning . Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel , but several hundred remained until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before they did the same . In 1995 , the Republic of Albania was declared Righteous Among the Nations for the role that dozens of Albanian families played in saving Jewish refugees in the country during the Second World War . As of 2011 , 69 Albanians have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations . 
 = = Background = = 
 According to the census of 1930 , 24 Jews lived in Albania . In 1937 , the Jewish community , which then numbered nearly 300 , was granted official recognition in the country . With the rise of Nazism , a number of German and Austrian Jews took refuge in Albania , and the Albanian embassy in Berlin continued to issue visas to Jews until the end of 1938 , at a time when no other European country was willing to do so . Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War , most Albanians had never had contact with Jews because of the small number of them in the country . As a result , antisemitism was less widespread in Albania than in other countries . Before the war , most Albanian Jews lived in the town of Korçë , in the southeastern part of the country . The Jewish community in Kosovo , part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , numbered approximately 500 . 
 The least developed country in Europe , Albania was subjected to Italian economic and political influence throughout the 1930s . On 25 March 1939 , Italian dictator Benito Mussolini gave Albanian King Zog I an ultimatum demanding the acceptance of an Italian military protectorate over Albania . When Zog refused to accept , the Italians invaded on 7 April 1939 , and deposed him . Afterwards , they re @-@ established the Albanian state as a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy , then installed a quisling regime headed by the biggest landowner in the country , <unk> <unk> . An Albanian " national assembly " was established , which quickly voted for the full economic and political union of Albania with the Kingdom of Italy , led by Italian King Victor Emmanuel III . Under the direction of viceroy general Francesco <unk> , the Italian administration implemented laws that prohibited Jewish immigration to Albania and mandated the deportation of all foreign Jews in the country . 
 Within a month of the Italian occupation , the Albanian Fascist Party ( Albanian : Partia <unk> e <unk> , or <unk> ) was formed . It enacted laws that prevented Jews from joining it and excluded them from professions such as education . Composed of ethnic Albanians and Italians residing in Albania , the party existed as a branch of the Italian Fascist Party ( Italian : Partito Nazionale <unk> , or PNF ) and its members were required to swear an oath of loyalty to Mussolini . All Albanians serving the Italian occupiers were required to join , and it became the only legal political party in the country . 
 As the war progressed , Italy transformed the Albanian Kingdom into Greater Albania , a protectorate of Italy that included most of Kosovo and a portion of western Macedonia which was detached from Yugoslavia after the Axis powers invaded in 1941 . Kosovo Albanians enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation . Although officially under Italian rule , the Albanians in Kosovo controlled the region and were encouraged to open Albanian schools , which had been prohibited under Yugoslav rule . They were also given Albanian citizenship by Italian authorities and allowed to fly the Albanian flag . Nevertheless , the Italians kept hundreds of thousands of troops in Albania and surrounding areas . Yugoslav sources indicated that there were approximately 20 @,@ 000 Italian soldiers and 5 @,@ 000 Italian police and frontier guards in Kosovo , and 12 @,@ 000 soldiers and 5 @,@ 000 police and border guards in the Albanian @-@ annexed portion of Macedonia . At the same time , Italian military authorities warned that at least ten hostages would be shot for every Italian soldier killed or wounded in these regions .

 After the invasion of Yugoslavia , the Jewish community in Albania grew as Jews from Macedonia and northern Serbia , as well as Jewish refugees from Germany , Austria and Poland , came to Italian @-@ controlled , Albanian @-@ annexed Kosovo and settled in the towns of Pristina , Prizren and <unk> . As many as 1 @,@ 000 refugees arrived , attributed by German sources to a Jewish organization which was responsible for smuggling Jews into the country . The refugees did not experience persecution to the level that Jews were experiencing in German @-@ controlled territories , because the Italians considered them to be of economic importance and " representative of Italian interests abroad " . However , the Italians did arrest approximately 150 Jewish refugees and transferred them to the town of Berat in Albania , where they were given a chance to work to earn money . Also arrested were 192 Jews from the Italian @-@ annexed Bay of Kotor who were transferred to Nazi concentration camps in Albania on 27 or 28 July 1941 , before being transferred to camps located within Italy . As many as 2 @,@ 000 Jews sought refuge in Albania during the war . 
 The local population of Albania was very protective of the Jewish refugees . Many were transported to Albanian ports on the Adriatic from where they could travel to Italy . Other Jews hid in remote mountain villages , while some joined resistance movements across the country . The Albanian treatment of Jews was in accordance with traditional Albanian customs of hospitality and <unk> ( " word of honour " ) . Despite this , instances of cruelty towards Jews did occur in Albania during the war , and on several occasions Jews being smuggled into the country were killed by Albanians who seized their jewellery and money . 
 In January 1942 , the Germans estimated at the Wannsee Conference that Albania was inhabited by 200 Jews . That same month , Jews were interned by the Italians at a camp in the town of Pristina . Although they feared that they would be handed over to the Germans , the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would never happen . However , on 14 March the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews who had been detained there . Some were then handed over to German forces and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp near Belgrade , where they were killed . Others , together with Serbs , were taken to the camp in Berat , where they remained until Italy 's capitulation . It is estimated that as many as 500 Jews were interned in the camps in Berat , Krujë and <unk> during the Italian occupation . 
 = = = 1943 – 45 = = = 
 When Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943 , all concentration camps in Albania were dissolved . Shortly after , the Germans invaded and occupied Albania , and most Italian soldiers in the country surrendered to the Germans . German forces then began to target for extermination all Jews living in Albania and the Albanian @-@ dominated regions of occupied Yugoslavia . The Jewish community in western Macedonia , which had remained untouched under Italian occupation , was targeted and several groups of Jews were dispatched to extermination camps . Their property and belongings were later taken by many organizations , institutions and private individuals . 
 The Germans arranged for Albania 's administration to be reorganized shortly after occupying the country . On 15 September , the Albanian National Committee was established under German sponsorship . It governed until a Regency Council was established and recognized by Germany as the official government of the country on 3 November 1943 . <unk> Deva , a Kosovo Albanian ally of the Germans in the region , was then appointed the Minister of Interior of Albania . Deva later founded the Nazi @-@ aligned Second League of Prizren in Kosovo , which declared jihad ( holy war ) against Slavs , Gypsies and Jews and sought to create an ethnically cleansed Greater Albania . The League had the backing of Haj Amin al @-@ Husseini , the Mufti of Jerusalem . A leading supporter of the Nazis , he pressed for the implementation of the Final Solution . With a new administration in place , the Germans demanded that Albanian authorities provide them with lists of Jews to be deported . However , local authorities did not comply and even provided Jewish families with forged documents . The situation in Albanian @-@ dominated Kosovo was quite different . There , Deva began recruiting Kosovo Albanians to join the Waffen @-@ SS . The 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg ( 1st Albanian ) was formed on 1 May 1944 . Composed of ethnic Albanians , it was named after Albanian national hero George Kastrioti Skanderbeg , who fought the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century . Members took a religious oath using the Quran , pledging " jihad against unbelievers " . The division had a strength of 6 @,@ 500 men at the time of its creation and was better known for murdering , raping , and looting in predominantly Serbian areas than for participating in combat operations on behalf of the German war effort . On 14 May , members of the division raided Jewish homes in Pristina , arrested 281 native and foreign Jews , then handed them over to the Germans . On 23 June , 249 of these were taken to the Bergen @-@ Belsen concentration camp , where many were killed . With the Allied victory in the Balkans imminent , Deva and his men attempted to purchase weapons from withdrawing German soldiers in order to organize a " final solution " of the Slavic population of Kosovo . Nothing came of this as the powerful Yugoslav Partisans prevented any large @-@ scale ethnic cleansing of Slavs from occurring . 
 Kosovo Albanians were generally less hospitable to Jews than their counterparts in Albania . Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire , they tended to be more unfriendly towards non @-@ Albanians . Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result . Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war , but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo in the early years of the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population . It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war . An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region . Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania , Kosovo and other Albanian @-@ controlled territories during the war . A somewhat greater number , as well as several hundred refugees , hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 From October to November 1944 , the Yugoslav Partisans , supported by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union , and assisted by the forces of the newly anti @-@ fascist Bulgarian regime and two brigades of Albanian partisans , retook the region of Kosovo as the Germans withdrew . The area was then reincorporated into the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia . With defeat guaranteed , the withdrawing Germans helped Albanian collaborators escape the country as Communist forces drew closer . However , many failed to escape and were executed by the Communists upon capture . On 28 November 1944 , Communist forces under Enver Hoxha emerged victorious in Albania . Hoxha subsequently implemented a totalitarian Stalinist government which banned all religions in the country . 
 It is estimated that there were 1 @,@ 800 Jews in Albania at the end of the Second World War , eleven times more than the number of Jews living in the country at the beginning of the war . The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war . Few Jews remained in the region and many emigrated to Israel during the Communist period . Similarly , most Jews in Albania decided to emigrate following the Communist takeover , but approximately 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s . The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country . With the fall of Communism , Albania eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel , which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel . From December 1990 to June 1991 , 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed " Operation Flying Carpet " . Most of the 60 remaining Jews in the country left in 1997 , after an outbreak of political violence . 
 The Republic of Albania was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. on 2 February 1995 . As of 2011 , 69 Albanians have been recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations for their role in helping Jews in Albania survive the Holocaust . The only public space in Albania dedicated to the Holocaust is a small display at the National Historical Museum in Tirana . Consisting of photographs , texts , maps , and wartime documents , it was opened on 29 November 2004 . 
 = The Power of Three ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " The Power of Three " is the fourth episode of the seventh series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who that aired on BBC One and BBC One HD on 22 September 2012 . It was written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Douglas Mackinnon . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) spends time on Earth with his travelling companions Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) and her husband Rory ( Arthur Darvill ) while he awaits activity from millions of small cubes that appeared overnight . 
 " The Power of Three " focused on Amy and Rory 's point of view and the impact of the Doctor 's influence on their lives , as they would be leaving in the next episode . The story was inspired by The Man Who Came to Dinner and the story of the MSC Napoli . The episode also saw the return of UNIT and introduced their new scientific advisor , Kate Stewart ( Jemma Redgrave ) , daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge @-@ Stewart . The episode featured brief cameo appearances by Lord Sugar and professor Brian Cox . Despite being the penultimate episode in the first block of the series , " The Power of Three " was the last to be filmed , and was thus the last episode for Gillan and Darvill . 
 The episode was watched by 7 @.@ 67 million viewers in the UK . Critical reception to the episode was generally positive , highlighting the emotion and humour , although many critics derided the solution to the plot . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Amy and Rory have tried to adjust to normal life without travelling with the Doctor . One day billions of small black cubes appear around the globe , but they appear to be inert and invulnerable . The Doctor arrives to help , having been alerted by news stories . UNIT storms the Williams ' house soon after in response to the Doctor 's arrival ; the UNIT force is led by scientific adviser Kate Stewart , the daughter of the Doctor 's friend and former UNIT commander , Brigadier Lethbridge @-@ Stewart . Kate explains that they have no idea of the purpose of the cubes and hope the Doctor can help . After several days of watching the cubes without anything out of the ordinary occurring , the Doctor decides there is no problem and puts Rory 's father Brian in charge of watching the cubes as he returns and departs in the TARDIS . 
 Over the following year , Amy and Rory live out their lives , making commitments despite not knowing if they will always be around . The Doctor visits them at their wedding anniversary party and takes them on a trip for seven weeks , though returns them a few minutes after leaving . Brian notices their absence and , in private , asks the Doctor the fate of his previous companions . The Doctor admits that while most had left on their own or were left behind , some have died , but promises that will not happen to Amy or Rory . Humanity forgets about the cubes ' arrival , and use them as paperweights and similar mundane functions . Unknown to anyone at the hospital where Rory works , a young girl with a cube controls a pair of identical orderlies with distorted faces to capture a few selected patients . 
 A year after their arrival , the cubes start to activate , scanning the world 's information networks and acting in self @-@ defence . The Doctor realises that the cubes are part of a " slow invasion " . While Rory and Brian go to the hospital to help those injured by the cubes , the Doctor and Amy are summoned to the UNIT headquarters under the Tower of London where Kate shows them several cubes under investigation , every single one behaving in a different fashion . The cubes then simultaneously display the number 7 and slowly count down . Meanwhile , at the hospital , Brian is taken by the two orderlies to a lift , where they disappear . Rory soon follows and finds that the back of the lift is a portal to a spaceship in Earth 's orbit . 
 The cubes all open when they reach zero , appearing empty , but soon reports of people dying from cardiac arrest appear from around the globe . The Doctor finds that one of his own hearts has stopped , and realises that the cubes sent out an electrical impulse that killed about one @-@ third of the human population . Kate 's team traces a communication from the cubes to seven different outposts across the world , including one at Rory 's hospital , and the Doctor and Amy race there . Amy uses a defibrillator to restart the Doctor 's heart . They find the girl , who the Doctor realises is an android , and disable her before locating the lift and the portal . 
 Aboard the ship , Amy and Rory rescue Brian while the Doctor encounters a hologram of a member of the Shakri , who , according to Gallifreyan legend , were self @-@ appointed " pest controllers " in the universe . The Shakri states that he and six other ships tied to the other outposts are there to wipe out humanity before it spreads across the galaxy , and prepares to launch a second wave of cubes to kill even more before disappearing . The Doctor uses the ship 's computer to reverse the shock the cubes gave to the original victims , restoring them , and the three escape the ship before the feedback from the cubes causes it to explode . As the world recovers , the Doctor prepares to leave when Brian insists that Amy and Rory go with him , stating the adventures they have with him are a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity . He tells the Doctor to " just bring them back safe " . The three say goodbye to Brian and depart in the TARDIS .

 The Doctor tells Brian that a few of his previous companions have died ; this is a reference to Sara Kingdom , Katarina , and <unk> . At one point , the Doctor , Amy , and Rory relax and eat fish fingers and custard , a reference to " The Eleventh Hour " . Amy and Rory 's meal at the newly opened Savoy hotel is ruined by " a <unk> spaceship parked under the Savoy " ; the Zygons previously featured in the Fourth Doctor serial Terror of the Zygons and would appear again in the 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor ( 2013 ) . The Tower of London had previously served as a UNIT base in " The Christmas Invasion " and was mentioned as such in " The Sontaran Stratagem " . The Doctor also mentions having a metallic dog that could hover ; this refers to K @-@ 9 , the robotic dog of the Fourth Doctor .

 The episode 's title was originally reported as " Cubed " , but was later announced as " The Power of Three " . Chris Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes " 42 " ( 2007 ) , " The Hungry Earth " / " Cold Blood " ( 2010 ) , and the second episode of the seventh series , " Dinosaurs on a Spaceship " . He was also a major contributor to the spinoff series Torchwood . " The Power of Three " is his second contribution to Doctor Who 's seventh series , after " Dinosaurs on a Spaceship " . Chibnall described " The Power of Three " as " a lovely big Earth invasion story " but different from the ones done before , as it focused on Amy and Rory 's time with the Doctor and the impact of him on their lives . He stated it is told more from Amy and Rory 's point of view than ever before , and is about celebrating them before they leave in the following episode . Chibnall 's brief from showrunner Steven Moffat was to " live with the Doctor — The Man Who Came to Dinner , Doctor Who style . " Chibnall was also inspired by the story of the MSC Napoli . Smith put disgust into the Doctor 's remark concerning Twitter in the episode , reflecting his real @-@ life decision to stay off the social network . 
 At Chibnall 's request , " The Power of Three " sees the return of UNIT , which first appeared in The Invasion ( 1968 ) and became a regular feature during the Third Doctor ( Jon Pertwee ) era . The episode reveals that Kate Stewart is now running UNIT ; she is the daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge @-@ Stewart and previously appeared in the <unk> Pictures direct @-@ to @-@ video films Downtime and <unk> Rising played by Beverley <unk> . Following the death of actor Nicholas Courtney in early 2011 , the Doctor learned of the Brigadier 's death in the sixth series finale " The Wedding of River Song " . Matt Smith enjoyed working with Jemma Redgrave , describing her as " graceful , funny and charming and an absolute delight " . 
 The read @-@ through of " The Power of Three " took place at Roath Lock , Cardiff on 27 April 2012 . It was filmed by itself in the series ' third production block . Because of this schedule , it was the final episode Gillan and Darvill filmed as Amy and Rory . Their last scene filmed together was getting into the TARDIS with the Doctor after saying <unk> to Brian ; when the doors closed Gillan , Darvill , and Smith hugged and started crying . Some exterior scenes at Amy and Rory 's house were re @-@ shot in June and July 2012 , with Darvill briefly returning for the June re @-@ shoot . Producer Marcus Wilson stated that a " hundred " individual cube props were made , with " many more " added with computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) . Amy and the Doctor 's conversation outside the Tower of London could not be filmed at the genuine location due to the London Olympics , so it was shot on studio in Cardiff and the live action was combined with other footage to create the illusion . The episode also features cameos from physicist Brian Cox and Lord Sugar , both of whom were long @-@ time fans of the program . Sugar 's cameo was in fact filmed on the set of The Apprentice , with director Douglas Mackinnon standing in for the person who was fired .

 " The Power of Three " received generally positive reviews . Dan Martin of The Guardian stated he " bloody loved " the episode , calling it " a nostalgic run through all the best bits of the Russell T Davies era " . However , he noted that it " also had the weaknesses of some of [ Davies ' ] adventures – the ending was so underdeveloped that even a magic button couldn 't explain it – but ' The Power of Three ' was , in every sense , completely gorgeous " . Neela Debnath , writing for The Independent , praised the way the episode showed the companion 's life outside the TARDIS and celebrated Amy and Rory , as well as the introduction of Kate Stewart and her connection with the Brigadier . 
 Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern described it as " beautifully made television " and welcomed Kate as a " wonderful addition " . However , he stated that he did not " entirely buy the Doctor 's solution " . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the episode as a B + . Despite noting the plot was " fairly standard " and " easily foiled " , he wrote that the concept of the cubes and " slow invasion " was " a cleverly executed bit of business " . IGN 's Matt Risley rated " The Power of Three " a score of 8 out of 10 , writing that the first three quarters were " simply brilliant " because of the emotion and humour . However , he criticised the " rushed resolution " and the lack of explanation for the aliens at the hospital . Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery gave the episode four out of five stars , describing it as " an emotional , fun and involving Doctor Who episode " despite the disappointing resolution . 
 Russell Lewin of SFX gave the episode three and a half out of five stars , naming it as Chibnall 's best Doctor Who episode . While he noted that " the ending was potentially always going to be a let down ... And it is " , there was " much to enjoy beforehand " such as UNIT and the humour . The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it a score of two and a half out of five stars , feeling that it was " treading water " as a lead @-@ in to the following finale . He described the first twenty minutes as " <unk> " and " heavy on exposition but little else " , and pointed out the unexplained action at Rory 's hospital . However , he enjoyed Amy and the Doctor 's conversation and the " countdown element and the mystery of the cubes " , but found the explanation unoriginal and the conclusion too easy . 
 = Edward I of England = 
 Edward I ( 17 / 18 June 1239 – 7 July 1307 ) , also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots ( Latin : Malleus Scotorum ) , was King of England from 1272 to 1307 . The first son of Henry III , Edward was involved early in the political intrigues of his father 's reign , which included an outright rebellion by the English barons . In 1259 , he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement , supporting the Provisions of Oxford . After reconciliation with his father , however , he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict , known as the Second Barons ' War . After the Battle of Lewes , Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons , but escaped after a few months and joined the fight against Simon de Montfort . Montfort was defeated at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 , and within two years the rebellion was extinguished . With England pacified , Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land . The crusade accomplished little , and Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died . Making a slow return , he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster on 19 August . 
 He spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law . Through an extensive legal inquiry , Edward investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties , while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law . Increasingly , however , Edward 's attention was drawn towards military affairs . After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276 – 77 , Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282 – 83 with a full @-@ scale war of conquest . After a successful campaign , Edward subjected Wales to English rule , built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people . Next , his efforts were directed towards Scotland . Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute , Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over the kingdom . In the war that followed , the Scots persevered , even though the English seemed victorious at several points . At the same time there were problems at home . In the mid @-@ 1290s , extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation , and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition . These crises were initially averted , but issues remained unsettled . When the King died in 1307 , he left to his son , Edward II , an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems . 
 Edward I was a tall man for his era , hence the nickname " Longshanks " . He was temperamental , and this , along with his height , made him an intimidating man , and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries . Nevertheless , he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship , as a soldier , an administrator and a man of faith . Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I : while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration , others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility . Currently , Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign , including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III , establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes , and reforming the law through statutes . At the same time , he is also often criticised for other actions , such as his brutal conduct towards the Scots , and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290 , by which the Jews were expelled from England . The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages , and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1656 . 
 = = Early years , 1239 – 63 = = 
 = = = Childhood and marriage = = = 
 Edward was born at the Palace of Westminster on the night of 17 – 18 June 1239 , to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence . Edward is an Anglo @-@ Saxon name , as was not commonly given among the aristocracy of England after the Norman Conquest , but Henry was devoted to the veneration of Edward the Confessor , and decided to name his firstborn son after the saint . Among his childhood friends was his cousin Henry of Almain , son of King Henry 's brother Richard of Cornwall . Henry of Almain would remain a close companion of the prince , both through the civil war that followed , and later during the crusade . Edward was in the care of Hugh Giffard – father of the future Chancellor Godfrey Giffard – until Bartholomew <unk> took over at Giffard 's death in 1246 . 
 There were concerns about Edward 's health as a child , and he fell ill in 1246 , 1247 , and 1251 . Nonetheless , he became an imposing man ; at 6 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) he towered over most of his contemporaries , and hence perhaps his epithet " Longshanks " , meaning " long legs " or " long shins " . The historian Michael Prestwich states that his " long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman , long thighs one as a horseman . In youth , his curly hair was blond ; in maturity it darkened , and in old age it turned white . [ His features were marred by a drooping left eyelid . ] His speech , despite a lisp , was said to be persuasive . " 
 In 1254 , English fears of a Castilian invasion of the English province of Gascony induced Edward 's father to arrange a politically expedient marriage between his fourteen @-@ year @-@ old son and thirteen @-@ year @-@ old Eleanor , the half @-@ sister of King Alfonso X of Castile . Eleanor and Edward were married on 1 November 1254 in the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas in Castile . As part of the marriage agreement , the young prince received grants of land worth 15 @,@ 000 marks a year . Although the endowments King Henry made were sizeable , they offered Edward little independence . He had already received Gascony as early as 1249 , but Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester , had been appointed as royal lieutenant the year before and , consequently , drew its income , so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province . The grant he received in 1254 included most of Ireland , and much land in Wales and England , including the earldom of Chester , but the King retained much control over the land in question , particularly in Ireland , so Edward 's power was limited there as well , and the King derived most of the income from those lands . 
 From 1254 to 1257 , Edward was under the influence of his mother 's relatives , known as the Savoyards , the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy , the queen 's uncle . After 1257 , Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half @-@ brothers of his father Henry III – led by such men as William de Valence . This association was significant , because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy , and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years ' baronial reform movement . There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen , which raised questions about the royal heir 's personal qualities . The next years would be formative on Edward 's character . 
 = = = Early ambitions = = = 
 Edward had shown independence in political matters as early as 1255 , when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony , in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families . This ran contrary to his father 's policy of mediation between the local factions . In May 1258 , a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the King ’ s government – the so @-@ called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans . Edward stood by his political allies and strongly opposed the Provisions . The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence , however , and gradually Edward 's attitude started to change . In March 1259 , he entered into a formal alliance with one of the main reformers , Richard de Clare , Earl of Gloucester . Then , on 15 October 1259 , he announced that he supported the barons ' goals , and their leader , Simon de Montfort . 
 The motive behind Edward 's change of heart could have been purely pragmatic ; Montfort was in a good position to support his cause in Gascony . When the King left for France in November , Edward 's behaviour turned into pure insubordination . He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers , causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d 'état . When the King returned from France , he initially refused to see his son , but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury , the two were eventually reconciled . Edward was sent abroad , and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans , who had been exiled to France . 
 Back in England , early in 1262 , Edward fell out with some of his former Lusignan allies over financial matters . The next year , King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , with only limited results . Around the same time , Simon de Montfort , who had been out of the country since 1261 , returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement . It was at this pivotal moment , as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons ' demands , that Edward began to take control of the situation . Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating , from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father 's royal rights . He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend , Henry of Almain , and John de Warenne , Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels . Through the arbitration of King Louis IX of France , an agreement was made between the two parties . This so @-@ called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side , and laid the seeds for further conflict . 
 = = Civil war and crusades , 1264 – 73 = = 
 = = = Second Barons ' War = = = 
 The years 1264 – 1267 saw the conflict known as the Second Barons ' War , in which baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the King . The first scene of battle was the city of Gloucester , which Edward managed to retake from the enemy . When Robert de Ferrers , Earl of Derby , came to the assistance of the rebels , Edward negotiated a truce with the earl , the terms of which he later broke . Edward then captured Northampton from Montfort 's son Simon , before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby 's lands . The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the Battle of Lewes , on 14 May 1264 . Edward , commanding the right wing , performed well , and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort 's forces . Unwisely , however , he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit , and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated . By the agreement known as the Mise of Lewes , Edward and his cousin Henry of Almain were given up as hostages to Montfort . 
 Edward remained in captivity until March , and even after his release he was kept under strict surveillance . Then , on 28 May , he managed to escape his custodians and joined up with the Earl of Gloucester , who had recently defected to the King 's side . 
 Montfort 's support was now dwindling , and Edward retook Worcester and Gloucester with relatively little effort . Meanwhile , Montfort had made an alliance with Llywelyn and started moving east to join forces with his son Simon . Edward managed to make a surprise attack at Kenilworth Castle , where the younger Montfort was quartered , before moving on to cut off the earl of Leicester . The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons ' War , the Battle of Evesham , on 4 August 1265 . Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces , and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated on the field . 
 Through such episodes as the deception of Derby at Gloucester , Edward acquired a reputation as untrustworthy . During the summer campaign , though , he began to learn from his mistakes , and acted in a way that gained the respect and admiration of his contemporaries . The war did not end with Montfort 's death , and Edward participated in the continued campaigning . At Christmas , he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire , and in March he led a successful assault on the Cinque Ports . A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory Dictum of Kenilworth . In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement , and civil war would resume , but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth , the parties came to an agreement . Edward , however , was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars ; at this point his main focus was on planning his forthcoming crusade . 
 = = = Crusade and accession = = = 
 Edward took the crusader 's cross in an elaborate ceremony on 24 June 1268 , with his brother Edmund and cousin Henry of Almain . Among others who committed themselves to the Ninth Crusade were Edward 's former adversaries – like the Earl of Gloucester , though de Clare did not ultimately participate . With the country pacified , the greatest impediment to the project was providing sufficient finances . King Louis IX of France , who was the leader of the crusade , provided a loan of about £ 17 @,@ 500 . This , however , was not enough ; the rest had to be raised through a tax on the laity , which had not been levied since 1237 . In May 1270 , Parliament granted a tax of a twentieth , in exchange for which the King agreed to reconfirm Magna Carta , and to impose restrictions on Jewish money lending . On 20 August Edward sailed from Dover for France . Historians have not determined the size of the force with any certainty , but Edward probably brought with him around 225 knights and altogether less than 1000 men . 
 Originally , the Crusaders intended to relieve the beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre , but Louis had been diverted to Tunis . The French King and his brother Charles of Anjou , who had made himself King of Sicily , decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa . The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which , on 25 August , took the life of King Louis himself . By the time Edward arrived at Tunis , Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir , and there was little else to do but return to Sicily . The crusade was postponed until next spring , but a devastating storm off the coast of Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis 's successor Philip III from any further campaigning . Edward decided to continue alone , and on 9 May 1271 he finally landed at Acre . 
 By then , the situation in the Holy Land was a precarious one . Jerusalem had fallen in 1244 , and Acre was now the centre of the Christian state . The Muslim states were on the offensive under the Mamluk leadership of Baibars , and were now threatening Acre itself . Though Edward 's men were an important addition to the garrison , they stood little chance against Baibars ' superior forces , and an initial raid at nearby St Georges @-@ de @-@ <unk> in June was largely futile . An embassy to the Ilkhan Abaqa ( 1234 – 1282 ) of the Mongols helped bring about an attack on Aleppo in the north , which helped to distract Baibars ' forces . In November , Edward led a raid on Qaqun , which could have served as a bridgehead to Jerusalem , but both the Mongol invasion and the attack on Qaqun failed . Things now seemed increasingly desperate , and in May 1272 Hugh III of Cyprus , who was the nominal king of Jerusalem , signed a ten @-@ year truce with Baibars . Edward was initially defiant , but an attack by a Muslim assassin in June forced him to abandon any further campaigning . Although he managed to kill the assassin , he was struck in the arm by a dagger feared to be poisoned , and became severely weakened over the following months . 
 It was not until 24 September that Edward left Acre . Arriving in Sicily , he was met with the news that his father had died on 16 November , 1272 . Edward was deeply saddened by this news , but rather than hurrying home at once , he made a leisurely journey northwards . This was partly due to his health still being poor , but also due to a lack of urgency . The political situation in England was stable after the mid @-@ century upheavals , and Edward was proclaimed king at his father 's death , rather than at his own coronation , as had until then been customary . In Edward 's absence , the country was governed by a royal council , led by Robert Burnell . The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France , where among other things he visited Pope Gregory X in Rome , King Philip III in Paris , and suppressed a rebellion in Gascony . Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England , and was crowned on 19 August .

Armed conflicts nevertheless continued , in particular with certain dissatisfied Marcher Lords , such as Gilbert de Clare , Earl of Gloucester , Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun , Earl of Hereford . Problems were exacerbated when Llywelyn 's younger brother Dafydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys , after failing in an assassination attempt against Llywelyn , defected to the English in 1274 . Citing ongoing hostilities and the English king 's harbouring of his enemies , Llywelyn refused to do homage to Edward . For Edward , a further provocation came from Llywelyn 's planned marriage to Eleanor , daughter of Simon de Montfort . 
 In November 1276 , war was declared . Initial operations were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer , Lancaster ( Edward 's brother Edmund ) and William de Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick . Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen . In July 1277 Edward invaded with a force of 15 @,@ 500 , of whom 9 @,@ 000 were Welshmen . The campaign never came to a major battle , and Llywelyn soon realised he had no choice but to surrender . By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277 , he was left only with the land of Gwynedd , though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales . 
 When war broke out again in 1282 , it was an entirely different undertaking . For the Welsh , this war was over national identity , enjoying wide support , provoked particularly by attempts to impose English law on Welsh subjects . For Edward , it became a war of conquest rather than simply a punitive expedition , like the former campaign . The war started with a rebellion by Dafydd , who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277 . Llywelyn and other Welsh chieftains soon joined in , and initially the Welsh experienced military success . In June , Gloucester was defeated at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr . On 6 November , while John Peckham , archbishop of Canterbury , was conducting peace negotiations , Edward 's commander of Anglesey , Luke de Tany , decided to carry out a surprise attack . A pontoon bridge had been built to the mainland , but shortly after Tany and his men crossed over , they were ambushed by the Welsh and suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Moel @-@ y @-@ don . The Welsh advances ended on 11 December , however , when Llywelyn was lured into a trap and killed at the Battle of <unk> Bridge . The conquest of Gwynedd was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd , who was taken to Shrewsbury and executed as a traitor the following autumn . 
 Further rebellions occurred in 1287 – 88 and , more seriously , in 1294 , under the leadership of Madog ap Llywelyn , a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd . This last conflict demanded the King 's own attention , but in both cases the rebellions were put down . 
 = = = = Colonisation = = = = 
 By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan , the Principality of Wales was incorporated into England and was given an administrative system like the English , with counties policed by sheriffs . English law was introduced in criminal cases , though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes . After 1277 , and increasingly after 1283 , Edward embarked on a full @-@ scale project of English settlement of Wales , creating new towns like Flint , Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan . Their new residents were English migrants , with the local Welsh banned from living inside them , and many were protected by extensive walls . 
 An extensive project of castle @-@ building was also initiated , under the direction of Master James of Saint George , a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in Savoy on his return from the crusade . These included the castles of Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Conwy and Harlech , intended to act both as fortresses and royal palaces for the King . His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe , drawing on Eastern influences . Also a product of the Crusades was the introduction of the concentric castle , and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design . The castles made a clear , imperial statement about Edward 's intentions to rule North Wales permanently , and drew on imagery associated with the Byzantine Roman Empire and King Arthur in an attempt to build legitimacy for his new regime . 
 In 1284 , King Edward had his son Edward ( later Edward II ) born at Caernarfon Castle , probably to make a deliberate statement about the new political order in Wales . David Powel , a 16th @-@ century clergyman , suggested that the baby was offered to the Welsh as a prince " that was borne in Wales and could speake never a word of English " , but there is no evidence to support this account . In 1301 at Lincoln , the young Edward became the first English prince to be invested with the title of Prince of Wales , when King Edward granted him the Earldom of Chester and lands across North Wales . The King seems to have hoped that this would help in the pacification of the region , and that it would give his son more financial independence . 
 = = = Diplomacy and war on the Continent = = = 
 Edward never again went on crusade after his return to England in 1274 , but he maintained an intention to do so , and took the cross again in 1287 . This intention guided much of his foreign policy , until at least 1291 . To stage a European @-@ wide crusade , it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent . A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the French House of Anjou ruling southern Italy , and the kingdom of Aragon in Spain . In 1282 , the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to Peter of Aragon , in what has become known as the Sicilian Vespers . In the war that followed , Charles of Anjou 's son , Charles of Salerno , was taken prisoner by the Aragonese . The French began planning an attack on Aragon , raising the prospect of a large @-@ scale European war . To Edward , it was imperative that such a war be avoided , and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles ' release . As far as the crusades were concerned , however , Edward 's efforts proved ineffective . A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291 , when the Mamluks captured Acre , the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land . 
 After the fall of Acre , Edward 's international role changed from that of a diplomat to an antagonist . He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own Duchy of Gascony . In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates Otto de Grandson and the chancellor Robert Burnell , which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany . In 1286 , Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years . The perennial problem , however , was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France , and Edward 's role as the French king 's vassal . On his diplomatic mission in 1286 , Edward had paid homage to the new king , Philip IV , but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English , Gascon , and French sailors ( that had resulted in several French ships being captured , along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle ) . 
 Eleanor of Castile had died on 28 November 1290 . Uncommon for such marriages of the period , the couple loved each other . Moreover , like his father , Edward was very devoted to his wife and was faithful to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time . He was deeply affected by her death . He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so @-@ called Eleanor crosses , one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night . As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294 , it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV 's half @-@ sister Margaret , but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war . 
 Edward made alliances with the German king , the Counts of Flanders and Guelders , and the Burgundians , who would attack France from the north . The alliances proved volatile , however , and Edward was facing trouble at home at the time , both in Wales and Scotland . It was not until August 1297 that he was finally able to sail for Flanders , at which time his allies there had already suffered defeat . The support from Germany never materialised , and Edward was forced to seek peace . His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war , but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English . 
 = = = The Great Cause = = = 
 The relationship between the nations of England and Scotland by the 1280s was one of relatively harmonious coexistence . The issue of homage did not reach the same level of controversy as it did in Wales ; in 1278 King Alexander III of Scotland paid homage to Edward I , but apparently only for the lands he held of Edward in England . Problems arose only with the Scottish succession crisis of the early 1290s . In the years from 1281 to 1284 , Alexander 's two sons and one daughter died in quick succession . Then , in 1286 , King Alexander died himself , leaving as heir to the throne of Scotland the three @-@ year @-@ old Margaret , the Maid of Norway , who was born in 1283 to Alexander 's daughter Margaret and King Eric II of Norway . By the Treaty of Birgham , it was agreed that Margaret should marry King Edward 's then one @-@ year @-@ old son Edward of Carnarvon , though Scotland would remain free of English overlordship . 
 Margaret , by now seven years of age , sailed from Norway for Scotland in the autumn of 1290 , but fell ill on the way and died in Orkney . This left the country without an obvious heir , and led to the succession dispute known to history as the Great Cause . 
 Even though as many as fourteen claimants put forward their claims to the title , the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus . The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome , but not to arbitrate in the dispute . The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol , 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from senior members of the Scottish political community . At Birgham , with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms , the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward . Now he insisted that , if he were to settle the contest , he had to be fully recognised as Scotland 's feudal overlord . The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession , and replied that since the country had no king , no one had the authority to make this decision . This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found . After a lengthy hearing , a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17 November 1292 . 
 Even after Balliol 's accession , Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland . Against the objections of the Scots , he agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum . A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff , son of Malcolm , Earl of Fife , in which Edward demanded that Balliol appear in person before the English Parliament to answer the charges . This the Scottish King did , but the final straw was Edward 's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service in the war against France . This was unacceptable ; the Scots instead formed an alliance with France and launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle . Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack . At the Battle of Dunbar , Scottish resistance was effectively crushed . Edward confiscated the Stone of Destiny – the Scottish coronation stone – and brought it to Westminster placing it in what became known as King Edward 's Chair ; he deposed Balliol and placed him in the Tower of London , and installed Englishmen to govern the country . The campaign had been very successful , but the English triumph would only be temporary .

 = = = Character as king = = = 
 Edward had a reputation for a fierce temper , and he could be intimidating ; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul 's , wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295 , fell down and died once he was in the King 's presence . When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston , the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son 's hair . Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening , particularly in his early days . The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard , an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable . 
 Despite these frightening character traits , however , Edward 's contemporaries considered him an able , even an ideal , king . Though not loved by his subjects , he was feared and respected . He met contemporary expectations of kingship in his role as an able , determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals . In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age : he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously . 
 Edward took a keen interest in the stories of King Arthur , which were highly popular in Europe during his reign . In 1278 he visited Glastonbury Abbey to open what was then believed to be the tomb of Arthur and Guinevere , recovering " Arthur 's crown " from Llywelyn after the conquest of North Wales , while , as noted above , his new castles drew upon the Arthurian myths in their design and location . He held " Round Table " events in 1284 and 1302 , involving tournaments and feasting , and chroniclers compared him and the events at his court to Arthur . In some cases Edward appears to have used his interest in the Arthurian myths to serve his own political interests , including legitimising his rule in Wales and discrediting the Welsh belief that Arthur might return as their political saviour . 
 = = = Administration and the law = = = 
 Soon after assuming the throne , Edward set about restoring order and re @-@ establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father . To accomplish this , he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel . The most important of these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as chancellor , a man who would remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King 's closest associates . Edward then replaced most local officials , such as the <unk> and sheriffs . This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England , that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers . The inquest produced the set of so @-@ called Hundred Rolls , from the administrative subdivision of the hundred . 
 The second purpose of the inquest was to establish what land and rights the crown had lost during the reign of Henry III . 
 The Hundred Rolls formed the basis for the later legal inquiries called the Quo warranto proceedings . The purpose of these inquiries was to establish by what warrant ( Latin : Quo warranto ) various liberties were held . If the defendant could not produce a royal licence to prove the grant of the liberty , then it was the crown 's opinion – based on the writings of the influential thirteenth @-@ century legal scholar Bracton – that the liberty should revert to the king . 
 By enacting the Statute of Gloucester in 1278 the King challenged baronial rights through a revival of the system of general eyres ( royal justices to go on tour throughout the land ) and through a significant increase in the number of pleas of quo warranto to be heard by such eyres . 
 This caused great consternation among the aristocracy , who insisted that long use in itself constituted licence . A compromise was eventually reached in 1290 , whereby a liberty was considered legitimate as long as it could be shown to have been exercised since the coronation of King Richard I , in 1189 . Royal gains from the Quo warranto proceedings were insignificant ; few liberties were returned to the King . Edward had nevertheless won a significant victory , in clearly establishing the principle that all liberties essentially emanated from the crown . 
 The 1290 statute of Quo warranto was only one part of a wider legislative effort , which was one of the most important contributions of Edward I 's reign . This era of legislative action had started already at the time of the baronial reform movement ; the Statute of Marlborough ( 1267 ) contained elements both of the Provisions of Oxford and the Dictum of Kenilworth . The compilation of the Hundred Rolls was followed shortly after by the issue of Westminster I ( 1275 ) , which asserted the royal prerogative and outlined restrictions on liberties . In the Mortmain ( 1279 ) , the issue was grants of land to the church . The first clause of Westminster II ( 1285 ) , known as De donis <unk> , dealt with family settlement of land , and entails . Merchants ( 1285 ) established firm rules for the recovery of debts , while Winchester ( 1285 ) dealt with peacekeeping on a local level . Quia <unk> ( 1290 ) – issued along with Quo warranto – set out to remedy land ownership disputes resulting from alienation of land by <unk> . The age of the great statutes largely ended with the death of Robert Burnell in 1292 . 
 = = = Finances , Parliament and the expulsion of Jews = = = 
 Edward I 's frequent military campaigns put a great financial strain on the nation . There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war , including customs duties , money lending and lay subsidies . In 1275 , Edward I negotiated an agreement with the domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool . In 1303 , a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants , in return for certain rights and privileges . The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi , a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy . This was in return for their service as money lenders to the crown , which helped finance the Welsh Wars . When the war with France broke out , the French king confiscated the Riccardi 's assets , and the bank went bankrupt . After this , the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as money lenders to the English crown . 
 Another source of crown income was represented by England 's Jews . The Jews were the king 's personal property , and he was free to tax them at will . By 1280 , the Jews had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown , but they could still be used in political bargaining . Their usury business – a practice forbidden to Christians – had made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment . In 1275 , Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry , which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions ; in 1279 , in the context of a crack @-@ down on coin @-@ clippers , he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed . In 1280 , he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons , preached by Dominican friars , with the hope of persuading them to convert , but these exhortations were not followed . The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290 , whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England . This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property , but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament . The expulsion , which was reversed in 1656 , followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes : Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182 ; John I , Duke of Brittany , drove them out of his duchy in 1239 ; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East . 
 Edward held Parliament on a reasonably regular basis throughout his reign . In 1295 , however , a significant change occurred . For this Parliament , in addition to the secular and ecclesiastical lords , two knights from each county and two representatives from each borough were summoned . The representation of commons in Parliament was nothing new ; what was new was the authority under which these representatives were summoned . Whereas previously the commons had been expected simply to assent to decisions already made by the magnates , it was now proclaimed that they should meet with the full authority ( <unk> potestas ) of their communities , to give assent to decisions made in Parliament . The King now had full backing for collecting lay subsidies from the entire population . Lay subsidies were taxes collected at a certain fraction of the moveable property of all laymen . Whereas Henry III had only collected four of these in his reign , Edward I collected nine . This format eventually became the standard for later Parliaments , and historians have named the assembly the " Model Parliament " . 
 = = Later reign , 1297 – 1307 = = 
 = = = Constitutional crisis = = = 
 The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great financial demand on Edward 's subjects . Whereas the King had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294 , four such taxes were granted in the years 1294 – 97 , raising over £ 200 @,@ 000 . Along with this came the burden of prises ( appropriation of food ) , seizure of wool and hides , and the unpopular additional duty on wool , dubbed the <unk> . The fiscal demands on the King 's subjects caused resentment , and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition . The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes , however , but by clerical subsidies . In 1294 , Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues . There was some resistance , but the King responded by threatening with outlawry , and the grant was eventually made . At the time , the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant , since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration . Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year . In 1296 , however , his position changed when he received the papal bull <unk> <unk> . This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope . When the clergy , with reference to the bull , refused to pay , Edward responded with outlawry . Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the King and upholding the papal bull , and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit . By the end of the year , a solution was offered by the new papal bull <unk> de statu , which allowed clerical taxation in cases of pressing urgency . 
 Opposition from the laity took longer to surface . This resistance focused on two things : the King 's right to demand military service , and his right to levy taxes . At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297 , Roger Bigod , Earl of Norfolk , in his capacity as Marshal of England , objected to a royal summons of military service . Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King ; if the King intended to sail to Flanders , he could not send his subjects to Gascony . In July , Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun , Earl of Hereford and Constable of England , drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances , in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced . Undeterred , Edward requested another lay subsidy . This one was particularly provocative , because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates , rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament . While Edward was in Winchelsea , preparing for the campaign in Flanders , Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax . As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force , the kingdom seemed to be on the verge of civil war . What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge . The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause . Edward signed the Confirmatio <unk> – a confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forest – and the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland . 
 Edward 's problems with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign . Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made , in particular that of upholding the Charter of the Forest . In the parliament of 1301 , the King was forced to order an assessment of the royal forests , but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession . Ultimately , it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against Edward I. Bohun died late in 1298 , after returning from the Falkirk campaign . As for Bigod , in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the King that was beneficial for both : Bigod , who had no children , made Edward his heir , in return for a generous annual grant . Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305 , when Clement V was elected pope . Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the King , and on Edward 's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office . 
 = = = Return to Scotland = = = 
 The situation in Scotland had seemed resolved when Edward left the country in 1296 , but resistance soon emerged under the leadership of William Wallace . On 11 September 1297 , a large English force under the leadership of John de Warenne , Earl of Surrey , and Hugh de <unk> was routed by a much smaller Scottish army led by Wallace and Andrew Moray at Stirling Bridge . The defeat sent shockwaves into England , and preparations for a retaliatory campaign started immediately . Soon after Edward returned from Flanders , he headed north . On 22 July 1298 , in the only major battle he had fought since Evesham in 1265 , Edward defeated Wallace 's forces at the Battle of Falkirk . Edward , however , was not able to take advantage of the momentum , and the next year the Scots managed to recapture Stirling Castle . Even though Edward campaigned in Scotland both in 1300 , when he successfully besieged Caerlaverock Castle and in 1301 , the Scots refused to engage in open battle again , preferring instead to raid the English countryside in smaller groups . 
 The defeated Scots , secretly urged on by the French , appealed to the pope to assert a claim of overlordship to Scotland in place of the English . His papal bull addressed to King Edward in these terms was firmly rejected on Edward 's behalf by the Barons ' Letter of 1301 . The English managed to subdue the country by other means , however . In 1303 , a peace agreement was reached between England and France , effectively breaking up the Franco @-@ Scottish alliance . Robert the Bruce , the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291 , had sided with the English in the winter of 1301 – 02 . By 1304 , most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward , and this year the English also managed to re @-@ take Stirling Castle . A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir John de Menteith and turned over to the English , who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed . With Scotland largely under English control , Edward installed Englishmen and collaborating Scots to govern the country . 
 The situation changed again on 10 February 1306 , when Robert the Bruce murdered his rival John Comyn and a few weeks later , on 25 March , had himself crowned King of Scotland by Isobel , sister of the Earl of Buchan . Bruce now embarked on a campaign to restore Scottish independence , and this campaign took the English by surprise . Edward was suffering ill health by this time , and instead of leading an expedition himself , he gave different military commands to Aymer de Valence and Henry Percy , while the main royal army was led by the Prince of Wales . The English initially met with success ; on 19 June , Aymer de Valence routed Bruce at the Battle of Methven . Bruce was forced into hiding , while the English forces recaptured their lost territory and castles . 
 Edward responded with severe brutality against Bruce 's allies and supporters . Bruce 's sister , Mary , was hung in a cage outside of Roxburgh for four years . Isabella MacDuff , Countess of Buchan , who had crowned Bruce , was hung in a cage outside of Berwick Castle for four years . Bruce 's younger brother Neil was executed by being hanged , drawn , and quartered ; he had been captured after he and his garrison held off Edward 's forces who had been seeking Bruce 's wife ( Elizabeth ) , daughter Marjorie , sisters Mary and Christina , and Isabella . 
 It was clear that Edward now regarded the struggle not as a war between two nations , but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects . This brutality , though , rather than helping to subdue the Scots , had the opposite effect , and rallied growing support for Bruce . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 = = = Death , 1307 = = = 
 In February 1307 , Bruce reappeared and started gathering men , and in May he defeated Aymer de Valence at the Battle of Loudoun Hill . Edward , who had rallied somewhat , now moved north himself . On the way , however , he developed dysentery , and his condition deteriorated . On 6 July he encamped at Burgh by Sands , just south of the Scottish border . When his servants came the next morning to lift him up so that he could eat , he died in their arms . 
 Various stories emerged about Edward ’ s deathbed wishes ; according to one tradition , he requested that his heart be carried to the Holy Land , along with an army to fight the infidels . A more dubious story tells of how he wished for his bones to be carried along on future expeditions against the Scots . Another account of his deathbed scene is more credible ; according to one chronicle , Edward gathered around him the Earls of Lincoln and Warwick , Aymer de Valence , and Robert Clifford , and charged them with looking after his son Edward . In particular they should make sure that Piers Gaveston was not allowed to return to the country . This wish , however , the son ignored , and had his favourite recalled from exile almost immediately . The new king , Edward II , remained in the north until August , but then abandoned the campaign and headed south . He was crowned king on 25 February 1308 . 
 Edward I 's body was brought south , lying in state at Waltham Abbey , before being buried in Westminster Abbey on 27 October . There are few records of the funeral , which cost £ 473 . Edward 's tomb was an unusually plain sarcophagus of Purbeck marble , without the customary royal effigy , possibly the result of the shortage of royal funds after the King 's death . The sarcophagus may normally have been covered over with rich cloth , and originally might have been surrounded by carved busts and a devotional religious image , all since lost . The Society of Antiquaries opened the tomb in 1774 , finding that the body had been well preserved over the preceding 467 years , and took the opportunity to determine the King 's original height . Traces of the Latin inscription <unk> Primus Scottorum Malleus hic est , 1308 . <unk> <unk> ( " Here is Edward I , Hammer of the Scots , 1308 . Keep the Vow " ) , which can still be seen painted on the side of the tomb , referring to his vow to avenge the rebellion of Robert Bruce . This resulted in Edward being given the epithet the " Hammer of the Scots " by historians , but is not contemporary in origin , having been added by the Abbot John <unk> in the 16th century . 
 = = = Historiography = = = 
 The first histories of Edward in the 16th and 17th centuries drew primarily on the works of the chroniclers , and made little use of the official records of the period . They limited themselves to general comments on Edward 's significance as a monarch , and echoed the chroniclers ' praise for his accomplishments . During the 17th century , the lawyer Edward Coke wrote extensively about Edward 's legislation , terming the King the " English Justinian " , after the renowned Byzantine law @-@ maker , Justinian I. Later in the century , historians used the available record evidence to address the role of parliament and kingship under Edward , drawing comparisons between his reign and the political strife of their own century . 18th @-@ century historians established a picture of Edward as an able , if ruthless , monarch , conditioned by the circumstances of his own time . 
 The influential Victorian historian William Stubbs instead suggested that Edward had actively shaped national history , forming English laws and institutions , and helping England to develop parliamentary and constitutional government . His strengths and weaknesses as a ruler were considered to be emblematic of the English people as a whole . Stubbs ' student , Thomas Tout , initially adopted the same perspective , but after extensive research into Edward 's royal household , and backed by the research of his contemporaries into the early parliaments of the period , he changed his mind . Tout came to view Edward as a self @-@ interested , conservative leader , using the parliamentary system as " the shrewd device of an autocrat , anxious to use the mass of the people as a check upon his hereditary foes among the greater baronage . " 
 Historians in the 20th and 21st century have conducted extensive research on Edward and his reign . Most have concluded this was a highly significant period in English medieval history , some going further and describing Edward as one of the great medieval kings , although most also agree that his final years were less successful than his early decades in power . Three major academic narratives of Edward have been produced during this period . Frederick Powicke 's volumes , published in 1947 and 1953 , forming the standard works on Edward for several decades , and were largely positive in praising the achievements of his reign , and in particular his focus on justice and the law . In 1988 , Michael Prestwich produced an authoritative biography of the King , focusing on his political career , still portraying him in sympathetic terms , but highlighting some of the consequences of his failed policies . Marc Morris 's biography followed in 2008 , drawing out more of the detail of Edward 's personality , and generally taking a harsher view of the King 's weaknesses and less pleasant characteristics . Considerable academic debate has taken place around the character of Edward 's kingship , his political skills , and in particular his management of his earls , and the degree to which this was collaborative or repressive in nature . 
 There is also a great difference between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward . G. W. S. Barrow , in his biography on Robert the Bruce , accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom . This view of Edward is reflected in the popular perception of the King , as can be seen in the 1995 movie Braveheart 's portrayal of the King as a hard @-@ hearted tyrant .

 = Degrassi : The Next Generation = 
 Degrassi : The Next Generation ( later renamed Degrassi for seasons ten through fourteen ) is a Canadian teen drama television series set in the Degrassi universe , which was created by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood in 1979 . It is the fourth series in the Degrassi franchise , following The Kids of Degrassi Street , Degrassi Junior High , and Degrassi High . Like its predecessors , the series follows an ensemble cast of students at Degrassi Community School who face various challenges often seen as taboo such as sex , teen pregnancy , date rape , drug abuse , self image , homosexuality , self @-@ injury , suicide , abortion , domestic violence , death , racism and many other issues . 
 The series was created by Linda Schuyler and Yan Moore , and is produced by Epitome Pictures ( a subsidiary of DHX Media ) in association with Bell Media . The current executive producers are Schuyler , her husband Stephen Stohn and Brendon Yorke . The series is filmed at Epitome 's studios in Toronto , Ontario , rather than on the real De Grassi Street from which the franchise takes its name . 
 Degrassi : The Next Generation has been a critical success and has often received favourable reviews from Entertainment Weekly , The New York Times , and <unk> In its initial years , it was frequently the most watched domestic drama series in Canada , and one of the highest @-@ rated shows on TeenNick in the United States . 
 In 2004 , one episode received just under a million viewers in Canada , and over half a million viewers in the US . The series has won numerous awards , from the Geminis , Writers Guild of Canada and Directors Guild of Canada , and internationally from the Teen Choice Awards , Young Artist Awards , and Prix Jeunesse . 
 The series premiered on CTV on October 14 , 2001 . During the ninth season in 2010 , the series moved to MuchMusic . The tenth season marked a change in production style , which saw the series become a telenovela , a daily soap opera @-@ style format , during the summer months , while the rest of the season aired during the standard fall @-@ spring schedule on a weekly basis . The thirteenth season reverted to a weekly schedule and , part way through , moved to MTV Canada . 
 The series has been syndicated on cable television , and episodes are available on DVD and in new media download formats from <unk> , the iTunes Store , and the Xbox Live Marketplace . Internationally , Degrassi : The Next Generation has been highly successful in the US , where it was broadcast on TeenNick , as well as being broadcast in 140 other countries . 
 The Next Generation aired its final episode on August 2 , 2015 , after MTV Canada and TeenNick announced the show 's cancellation . However , in 2016 , the show , re @-@ titled Degrassi : Next Class , will move to Family Channel in Canada and stream on Netflix in the United States as well as all other countries where the service is available ( excluding Australia , France , and Canada until later 2016 ) .

 = = = Concept = = = 
 The Degrassi universe was created in 1979 by Playing With Time , a production company owned by former school teacher Linda Schuyler and her partner Kit Hood . The franchise began with The Kids of Degrassi Street , which was spawned out of three half @-@ hour short films . Degrassi Junior High followed in 1987 , Degrassi High premiered in 1989 , and the television movie School 's Out aired in 1992 . 
 Schuyler and original Degrassi series head writer Yan Moore began developing a new television drama in 1999 . As the months progressed , they began to think about what had happened to the characters of Degrassi High to develop a school @-@ reunion theme . However , they decided that a series would not work effectively if based around adults instead of children . Moore realized that the character Emma Nelson , born at the end of Degrassi Junior High 's second season , would soon be entering junior high school , and development for the series took a new direction by focusing on Emma and her school experiences . 
 Schuyler 's husband Stephen Stohn suggested Degrassi : The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series , borrowing the concept from Star Trek : The Next Generation , of which he was a fan . The project was pitched to CTV in May 2000 , with the originally planned reunion episode serving as the pilot to the new series . 
 = = = Executive producers , script @-@ writers and directors = = = 
 Produced by Epitome Pictures Inc , in association with CTVglobemedia , renamed Bell Media in 2011 , Degrassi receives funding from Canadian Television Fund and BCE the Shaw Rocket Fund , Mountain Cable Program and the Royal Bank of Canada , the Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund , and the Cogeco Program Development Fund . 
 Linda Schuyler and Stephen Stohn have served as executive producers since the series began . Other Epitome Pictures employees and series crew members have also been credited with the title , including Sara Snow , Brendon Yorke , James Hurst , Aaron Martin . , and Sarah <unk> . 
 Sarah <unk> and Matt <unk> are the current story editors , a position previously filled by Shelley Scarrow , James Hurst , Aaron Martin , and Sean <unk> . Frequent directors include Phil Earnshaw , Stefan <unk> and Bruce McDonald . When production of season three began , a user on the official Degrassi : The Next Generation website with the alias " <unk> " began a forum thread titled " Shooting Season 3 " , revealing production details , guest actors , scheduling information and DVD release details . He referred to himself as " Stephen Stohn " in one post , although it was not until the release of Degrassi : Generations - The Official 411 in 2005 , that Stohn confirmed he was the poster and it was not an imposter . 
 = = = Episode format = = = 
 Each episode of Degrassi is written following the same formula with two or three storylines ( Plot A , Plot B and Plot C ) . The main storyline , A , opens and closes the episode and is usually driven by a single character . Plot B is usually more comedic in tone and sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories , often moving story arcs forward . Plot C was usually used sporadically in a season @-@ long arc , but is now used in every episode as comedic relief . The problems and issues presented in the episode are not always resolved by the end of the episode , and are carried over to the next , or create a mini @-@ arc over several episodes . The majority of episodes are named after songs from the 1980s , and since the tenth season , episodes are named after songs from the 1990s to the present , representing the entering of a new decade and a completely different cast from the earlier seasons . For the first nine seasons , Degrassi : The Next Generation had been produced as a weekly half @-@ hour teen comedy @-@ drama series , with each season consisting of between fifteen and twenty @-@ four episodes . 
 Due to falling viewing figures between seasons six and nine , the series developed a daily soap opera format for the summer run of the tenth season , and increased the number of episodes to forty @-@ four . The tenth season also dropped the tagline " The Next Generation " , with only one original cast member remaining , and due to the young audience unfamiliar with the past generation , referring to the series as " Degrassi " . Season 13 reverted to airing episodes weekly , but still produced more episodes than prior to the soap opera format , airing a block in the summer of 2013 and also the summer of 2014 . 
 = = = Opening sequence = = = 
 The Degrassi opening sequence follows a two- to three @-@ minute cold open . During the first five seasons these credits showed the characters on the school premises and followed a mini storyline . Seasons six and seven featured titles with the actors breaking the fourth wall and facing the camera , over a montage of character videos from past seasons , saturated with blue colour and gold outlines . The montages behind the characters depicting a major event in that character 's storyline . For the eighth season , the show abandoned the style of titles used for the previous two seasons and returned to the original form of showing the characters at school while participating in school @-@ related activities . Season thirteen dropped the opening credits , replacing it with an eleven @-@ second montage . This continued into season fourteen . Instead of listing every ensemble actor , after the montage , season thirteen and fourteen episodes credit only the regular actors appearing in that episode . 
 The theme music , " Whatever It Takes " , was composed by Jim McGrath , with lyrics written by Jody Colero and Stephen Stohn . The song include lines such as , " Whatever it takes , I know I can make it through / Be the best , the best I can be " , to convey what Colero calls , " a sense of joy and optimism . " Lisa <unk> performed the lyrics with a children 's choir over an 1980s pop music style tune during the first three seasons . Dave Ogilvie and Anthony <unk> of Canadian industrial @-@ pop group Jakalope reworked and performed the song with a heavier sound , reflecting the growing maturity of the characters in season four . For seasons six and seven , the theme — still performed by Jakalope — was remixed and stripped of vocals . A fourth version of the theme song , with lyrics sung by <unk> Doyle , was introduced for the eighth season , and a fifth version of the theme , performed by the in @-@ show band " <unk> " is used for the ninth and tenth seasons . For seasons eleven and twelve , a sixth version of the theme song is used , performed by Alexz Johnson . Seasons thirteen and fourteen featured a truncated version of the Alexz Johnson theme . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Jim McGrath creates the musical score for each episode using an instrumental version of the theme music . He also works with actors such as Jake Epstein , Melissa McIntyre and Jamie Johnston , when writing music for their characters Craig Manning , Ashley Kerwin , and Peter Stone to perform in the bands Downtown Sasquatch , Paige Michalchuk and the <unk> ( PMS ) , Hell Hath No Fury , and <unk> . In addition to being scored , Degrassi features a mix of original emo , alternative rock and pop music . Popular songs are used sparingly in the series , mainly because of budget constraints . Usually , music supervisor Jody Colero selects songs from little @-@ known , unsigned Canadian artists . When these songs are included , they originate from a diegetic source . Examples of this can be seen in the first season episode " Jagged Little Pill " , when well @-@ known songs are played during Ashley 's house party , at the wedding reception in the fifth season episode " Weddings , Parties , Anything " , and during the party scene in the seventh season episode " Everything She Wants " . 
 = = = Filming locations = = = 
 The Degrassi universe is set on De Grassi Street in Toronto , Ontario . The four previous series were filmed on and near the street . However , Degrassi is filmed at Epitome Pictures ' four soundstages and backlot located at the company 's 100 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 9 @,@ 300 m2 ) production studios in Toronto . The facade of Degrassi Community School is the exterior of Studio C , and uses the same colours and glass pattern as Centennial College , which was used to depict the school during Degrassi High . The area in front of this facade features a " hoarding area " where students gather , a street , and a bus stop across the road . The studio 's backlot is used for exterior shots of the characters ' houses , which is one unit dressed differently for each house , and The Dot Grill . The building for The Dot is the only one on the backlot large enough to allow filming inside ; scenes taking places inside the school and house interiors are filmed on one of four sound stages . 
 Studio A contains sets for the school 's hallways , washrooms , cafeteria and classrooms . The hallways are stenciled with phrases such as " the perfect human being is all human " , which were found at the Etobicoke School for the Arts , one of the many schools that set designers used during their original research . The washroom set has graffiti on the walls to look authentic , and is used for the girls ' and boys ' room ; urinals are installed and removed as needed . The set used for the cafeteria is " purposefully bland to take the edge off the rest of the school looking so beautiful . " It is also used as the studio 's cafeteria where the cast and crew eat . 
 In addition to being used as the exterior of the school , Studio C holds sets for the school 's entrance foyer , the gymnasium , the media lab and a hallway with lockers . As the series progressed and the budget increased , a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane . For the first few seasons , the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards ; due to warping , it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood . 
 Studio B contains the sets for the characters ' houses and The Core newspaper office which was introduced in season six . It also held sets for Instant Star , another Epitome Pictures production . The fourth studio , Studio D , houses all the production offices , dressing rooms , and make @-@ up and hair departments . The pool hall and university campus club sets were built in Studio D for the seventh season . 
 York University 's Keele Campus in Toronto served as the location for various sites at <unk> University .

 For the new generation of students , producers auditioned over six hundred school @-@ aged children in an attempt to provide characters to which the teenaged target @-@ audience could relate . The decision to cast age @-@ similar actors was purposeful to contrast the series from other shows of the same period such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson 's Creek , which had cast actors in their twenties as teenagers . 
 Eleven children were given star billing in the first season . Sarah <unk> @-@ <unk> portrayed the lonely high @-@ achiever Liberty Van Zandt . Daniel Clark played bad @-@ boy Sean Cameron . Lauren Collins was cast as Paige Michalchuk , the school 's head cheerleader and queen bee . Ryan Cooley portrayed class clown James Tiberius " J.T. " Yorke , with Jake Goldsbie cast as J.T. ' s best friend , Toby Isaacs , a computer geek . Aubrey " Drake " Graham portrayed basketball star Jimmy Brooks , who is from a wealthy family . Shane <unk> played school bully Gavin " Spinner " Mason . Miriam McDonald was cast as Emma Nelson , an environmental rights activist , with Cassie Steele cast in the role of Emma 's best friend , Manuela " Manny " Santos . Melissa McIntyre portrayed Ashley Kerwin , the perfect girl who attracts the popular boys , and who the other girls are jealous of . Christina Schmidt portrayed the overweight and insecure Terri McGreggor . 
 Providing ties to the previous series in the Degrassi universe , Stefan Brogren was approached to play his old character Archie " Snake " Simpson , now working at the school as the media immersion teacher . Dan Woods reprised his role as English teacher Mr. <unk> , now promoted to school principal , and Pat Mastroianni returned to his role as Joey Jeremiah . Amanda Stepto also returned to the franchise to play her character Christine " Spike " Nelson in a recurring role . 
 In the pilot episode , former Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High actors <unk> Jean Brown ( Trish Skye ) , Darrin Brown ( Dwayne Myers ) , Michael Carry ( Simon Dexter ) , Irene <unk> ( Alexa <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> ( Diana <unk> ) , Anais Granofsky ( Lucy Fernandez ) , Rebecca Haines ( Kathleen Mead ) , Sarah Holmes ( Alison Hunter ) , Neil Hope ( Derek " Wheels " Wheeler ) , Kyra Levy ( Maya Goldberg ) , Cathy Keenan ( Liz O 'Rourke ) , Stacie Mistysyn ( Caitlin Ryan ) , and <unk> <unk> ( Yick Yu ) reprised their roles for the class reunion storyline . 
 In season two , Mastroianni returned to the Degrassi franchise in a starring role as Joey Jeremiah , a car salesman and single father of two children . Joey 's stepson , musician Craig Manning , played by Jake Epstein , is a new student at Degrassi Community School . Three other new characters were introduced in season two in recurring roles . Stacey Farber played Ellie Nash , a goth whose home life is in turmoil , and Adamo Ruggiero portrayed Marco Del Rossi , who is struggling to accept the reality that he is homosexual . Melissa Di Marco was cast as science and gym teacher Daphne <unk> . Mistysyn also returned to her former Degrassi role as Joey 's ex @-@ high school sweetheart , Caitlyn Ryan , who in the years following graduation has become a world @-@ renowned journalist . 
 In season three , Farber , Ruggiero and Mistysyn were given regular roles , as were Andrea Lewis ( Hazel Aden ) and Stepto , who had held recurring roles since the first season . Mike Lobel ( Jay <unk> ) , Deanna <unk> ( Alex Nuñez ) , Ephraim Ellis ( Rick Murray ) and John <unk> ( Dylan Michalchuk ) were introduced in recurring roles as new students . Towards the end of the season , Schmidt 's character , Terri McGreggor , was written out of the show when her possessive boyfriend Rick pushed her to the ground and knocked her head against a rock , causing her to fall into a coma . 
 Over the course of the ten seasons of Degrassi : The Next Generation , there have been several departures from the series . Season six depicted the first death of one of the show 's main characters when J.T. Yorke was stabbed and killed . Clark 's character Sean Cameron has been written out of the show twice . He left the series during the fourth season in the wake of the death of Rick Murray , and returned for the sixth season , but departed the series again at the end of the season . At the end of season five several main characters graduated from Degrassi Community School , and either left the series or went on to university . Six new characters were introduced in season seven in a storyline where nearby rival high school Lakehurst merged with Degrassi following a fire . Season eight saw many changes when many of the existing cast members , including Collins , Farber , Graham , Stepto , Ruggiero , and DiMarco either moved to recurring status or left the series entirely . The exodus of several major cast members was reportedly an executive decision that left the actors and producers on bad terms , with Graham stating in an interview with Vibe that " [ the producers ] did us foul . " Thirteen actors were added to the main cast to replace them . By season nine , Brogren , McDonald , Steele and <unk> were the only actors from season one who remained in the series as storylines began to focus on a new generation of children attending the school . This was done to avoid moving the show to a primarily college setting , as the first generation cast aged or " graduated " out of Degrassi Community School into college . 
 As of season 10 , none of the characters from the earlier seasons remain , with the exception of Brogren , whose character has been promoted to the principal of Degrassi Community School ; the series now centres on the new generation of Degrassi students .

 Viewing figures continued to fall throughout season eight ; Bill Brioux , the television columnist for The Canadian Press , was surprised that Degrassi : The Next Generation had even reached its eighth season with such poor ratings , asking " What other show in the history of Canadian or American television has so consistently drawn so few viewers yet gets renewed year after year ? " The season premiere was watched by 398 @,@ 000 viewers , almost 200 @,@ 000 viewers fewer than what the premiere of season seven achieved . Viewing figures continued to drop when episodes two and six were both watched by an average of 220 @,@ 000 viewers .

The following week , the episode that concluded the two @-@ parter picked up viewers , reaching an estimated total of 206 @,@ 000 . Brioux commented again about Degrassi : The Next Generation still being on the schedules , wondering when CTV was going to announce its cancellation and noting that The Amazing Race , which follows it in the scheduling , was watched by ten times the number of Degrassi 's viewers . That pattern was repeated the following week , when Degrassi : The Next Generation was watched by 222 @,@ 000 viewers , compared to 1 @,@ 834 @,@ 000 viewers for The Amazing Race , 1 @,@ 579 @,@ 000 viewers for Desperate Housewives and 1 @,@ 106 @,@ 000 viewers for The Mentalist , which were broadcast by CTV later in the evening .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Degrassi : The Next Generation has received generally positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly has called it " a cult hit " , and The New York Times named it " Tha Best Teen TV N da <unk> ( The best teen TV in the world ) " . Of the first season , The Ottawa Citizen 's Tony Atherton had mixed feelings of the new incarnation , saying it " has a cleaner , more polished look , has lost its edge [ and offers ] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series , nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since ... there is a sense of déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters " . He did , however , praise the show for having " the same simple narrative told from a kid 's viewpoint , and the same regard for unvarnished reality [ as Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High ] " . 
 Before its debut in the United States , The Seattle Times ' Melanie McFarland wondered whether the series would do well , writing : " soft @-@ pedaling through the issues might work for today 's family of viewers , but what 's gentle enough for Mom and Dad 's peace of mind might not be enough to hook Junior or the original Degrassi 's older fans " . The issues that the characters experience have often been commented on in the media . It has been noted that the series never attempts to hide from depicting honest accounts of the trials and tribulations that real teenagers may often experience . Sarah Liss from CBC News said that despite often being corny and soap opera @-@ y , Degrassi : The Next Generation tackles issues that other genre series prefer to gloss over , and was part of her essential viewing . She named the series one of " the [ ten ] most important television shows of the 2000s " , and was the only children 's series , and the only Canadian television series , to appear on the list , which included Mad Men , Lost , the CSI franchise , and Sex and the City . 
 In 2008 , Jeffrey Bento @-@ Carrier described one storyline that showed a teacher being accused of sexually assaulting one of his students as " shock [ ing ] " , adding that " Degrassi is not for everyone , mainly because it 's an honest account what it 's like to be a teen in a society which values cliques and confrontation over truth and real growth . " Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times echoed the sentiments , and praised the series for " stay [ ing ] in touch with teens ' lives " . 
 In spite of these comments , The N held back one of the more controversial episodes of the first season , which showed a character losing control after taking an ecstasy pill , and refused to broadcast it until it was presented with an edited copy from the producers . The N also refused to broadcast two episodes from the second season that featured a storyline about date @-@ rape until suitable edits could be made , and withheld other episodes from season three that showed a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old character having an abortion after having consensual sexual intercourse with her boyfriend , and feeling no regrets . The decision caused an uproar amongst fans who organized a petition that caught the attention of the New York Times , as well as CBC , the National Post and the London Free Press in Canada . The episodes eventually aired three years later as part of an " every episode ever " marathon , with very little advertisement from the network . Another storyline was featured in the media after ten children from a Québécois school were found to have a number of cuts on their bodies . They said they had copied the show when one character began cutting herself in an episode . 
 Comparisons between Degrassi : The Next Generation and other genre specific series have also been made throughout the run . Jake Surette , a writer with AfterElton.com , a website which focuses on the portrayal of homosexual and bisexual men in the media , reported on the portrayal of two Degrassi : The Next Generation gay characters . " Degrassi features ongoing stories of real @-@ life teen dilemmas — including intense gay and lesbian storylines — and does it without the righteous , ' On a Very Special Blossom ' endings that many teen dramas and sitcoms thrive on . " Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post said the series " is told from a teenager 's point of view since the writers have no interest in appealing to a broad @-@ based demographic like the writers on , say , Fox 's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level " . PopMatters 's Jodie <unk> Horn also compared it with The O.C. , saying that while scenes from Degrassi could be " actual scenes from my actual teenage life ... The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life " , adding that it is the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre . 
 The San Jose Mercury News has said " If they [ Everwood , The O.C. , and One Tree Hill ] want to be taken seriously , the shows could take a cue from Canadian drama Degrassi : The Next Generation , which ... addresses the same gritty teen issues without being far @-@ fetched " , the New York Times has also made favourable reviews of the series in comparison to Everwood , The O.C. , and One Tree Hill , as well as Beverly Hills , 90210 , Gilmore Girls , Dawson 's Creek , and adult series such as Sex and the City , Maude , and Six Feet Under . AOL TV ranked it as the sixth TV 's Biggest Guilty Pleasure .

 = = Plot = = 
 Homer is distraught when he is unable to acquire tickets for an upcoming football game involving the Springfield Atoms . When Ned Flanders wins two tickets to the game on a radio competition , he invites Homer as his guest . Though reluctant because of his dislike of Flanders , Homer is desperate to attend the game and accepts . Ned pays for all the food and even gets the winning quarterback , Stan " The Boy " Taylor , to give the game ball to Homer . Overwhelmed by Ned 's generosity and no longer ashamed to be associated with him , Homer becomes friends with Ned and his family . Homer begins acting overly grateful and annoys Ned and his family to no end by interrupting their family time together . The situation is not helped after Homer follows Ned to a homeless shelter for charity work ; Homer becomes bored with Ned 's slowly dishing soup for the homeless and takes over , however his impatience is mistaken for generosity by a newspaper photographer , and the resulting article declares Homer a hero . Homer 's popularity with the townspeople surges and eclipses Ned 's reputation . The Flanders family and the Simpson family go on a camping trip , but the families do not get along . When the Simpsons initiate a food fight , Ned later tells his wife that he has grown to hate Homer . 
 Upon returning home , Homer remains oblivious to Ned 's animosity . He arrives at the Flanders 's house expecting to play golf , but Flanders and his family get in their car and race off without him . Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding , Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch , and his good name is destroyed after Wiggum announces that Ned is " high as a kite " ( even though he simply fell over ) . At church , when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer , Homer inhales very loudly through his nose , causing Ned to finally snap and yell at Homer . This alarms the congregation who denounce Flanders as bitter and jealous , but nevertheless , Homer sticks up for Ned and everyone apologizes to him for not getting the full story and misjudging him . Ned is touched at Homer for sticking up for him and the two reconcile their friendship . 
 Shocked , Lisa and Bart , thinking that everything would be back to normal by now , consider that this may be the end of their wacky adventures . However , the following week , Homer once again hates Ned and everything is back to normal , much to Lisa and Bart 's relief . The family then spends the night in a haunted house ( which formerly belonged to Homer 's Great Uncle Boris ) , and are heard screaming after the lights go out . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Homer Loves Flanders " was the last episode to be pitched by Conan O 'Brien before he left The Simpsons . David Richardson was assigned to write it , and Wesley Archer to direct it . Richardson wrote the episode at a Motel 6 in Hemet , California while he was dating an actress who was shooting a film there . In this season , the staff wanted to take a deeper look at the relationships of the characters . One of the things they wanted to explore in particular was what Homer and Flanders have in common and how they could turn into friends . Former show runner David Mirkin enjoyed making Homer and Flanders get along because they do not normally act that way . 
 The episode begins with the Simpson family watching a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a " kill @-@ bot factory " . Mirkin said this was a joke the staff " particularly loved to do " because it pointed out how negative and mean @-@ spirited news broadcasts can be , and how they are seemingly " always trying to scare everybody " by creating panic and depression . In one scene in the episode , Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield 's water supply , which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield 's rival town , Shelbyville . The Fox network 's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge " getting high " on LSD . Mirkin , however , defended the scene and argued Marge was not " doing it on purpose " , so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode . In another scene , Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game , so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God . Marge points out to him , however , that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there . This scene , inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers ' room , is one of Mirkin 's and Richardson 's " all time favorite " jokes . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 When Homer hears the 1978 song " Two Tickets to Paradise " by Eddie Money on the radio , he sings along and plays air guitar . As Homer is eating nachos at the football game , he makes up a song called " Nacho Man " , a reference to Village People 's 1978 song " Macho Man " . When Flanders is mistakenly arrested for taking drugs , Chief Wiggum asks him " Where 's your Messiah now ? " , a line commonly mistakenly believed to be spoken by Edward G. Robinson 's character <unk> in the 1956 film The Ten Commandments but in fact originates from Billy Crystal 's stand @-@ up impersonation of Robinson . Ned 's dream involves him shooting at people inside the university clock tower based on the 1975 movie The Deadly Tower , itself based on Charles Whitman 's 1966 killing spree . The scene where Homer chases Flanders 's car is a parallel of the sequence in Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , in which Robert Patrick 's character T @-@ 1000 chases the heroes in the police car after escaping from the hospital . When Rod and Todd are watching television in the Flanders 's living room , a picture of Leonardo da Vinci 's painting The Last Supper can be seen behind them . The homeless shelter that Homer and Flanders visit is called Helter Shelter , a reference to the 1968 song " Helter Skelter " by The Beatles .

 In its original American broadcast , " Homer Loves Flanders " finished 43rd in the ratings for the week of March 14 – 20 , 1994 , with a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 9 . The episode was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following Beverly Hills , 90210 and Melrose Place . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . In 2007 , Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth favorite of the show . He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode , as well as Lisa 's self @-@ referential quote about how , " by next week , we 'll be back to where we started from , ready for another wacky adventure . " The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , thought the episode had " some great existential musings " from Lisa . They added that it also " contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson said : " I always remembered [ " Homer Loves Flanders " ] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly . Sure , the show goes with a less than creative presence ; it ’ s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways . However , the development of the theme is terrific , as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson . " DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score . Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B − grade , claiming the " rather large dose of sentimentality " and " fewer moments of absurdity " in the episode gave it " the feeling that it belongs in one of the series ' earlier seasons " . The Orlando Sentinel 's Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme .

 " In My Place " is a song by the British alternative rock band Coldplay . The song was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second album , A Rush of Blood to the Head .

The song also reached number 17 on Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks . 
 " In My Place " was well received by critics , who complimented its arrangement and profound lyrics . The song won the award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 45th Grammy Awards .

 In an interview with Q magazine , frontman Chris Martin stated that " In My Place " was a song Coldplay had left after recording their debut album Parachutes ( 2000 ) . When the band finished recording their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head , Martin said that the album was complete . However , after guitarist Jonny Buckland played the song on his guitar , Martin said that they now needed to record it and include it on the album . Martin also said that : " That 's about where you 're put in the world , and how you 're given your position , and the way you look , and how you have to get on with it . " In an interview , Buckland revealed that the song was hard to record , as the band had played the song live . He also commented that when they started recording the song , they did not know how it should sound , due to the band members ' contrasting ideas . 
 The song opens with a single crash cymbal followed by two bars of 4 / 4 drumming , then a plaintive three @-@ note guitar line rings through a strummy rhythm , and Martin 's vocals . Its instrumentation is varied with the sound of thumping drums , chiming guitars , a singalong chorus , and a string arrangement . The song also features a guitar lick swirl . The three lines of the third verse allude to a man 's love of a woman , who does not reciprocate his love . He is saying he will always wait for her , but he does not think that she should stay where she is any longer . The lyrics emphasize : " But I wait for you / if you go , if you go / leaving me here on my own / well I wait for you . " The song 's lyrics also include references to a desire for weary optimism . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Critics were positive towards the song . In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album , critic David Browne wrote : " Songs like ' In My Place ' and ' Warning Sign ' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes ( ' ' ... You were an island / And I passed you by ' ' in the touching latter song ) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle . " Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote : " When the shimmering , pretty lead @-@ off single ' In My Place ' represents the album 's weakest moment , you know you 've got something extraordinary . Currently storming the charts a la ' Yellow ' , ' In My Place ' is another surprisingly simple song , carried by Jonny Buckland 's chiming guitar and Chris Martin ’ s heartfelt vocals . It really shouldn 't amount to much , but Coldplay make it work very well . When Martin sings , " Please , please , please / Come back and sing to me , " he totally sells it , and you buy it . And why not ? The song 's lovely . 
 Amy M. Bruce of The <unk> wrote : " With a slew of introspective rock songs like ' In My Place ' and ' God Put a Smile upon Your Face , ' this album is worthy of the hype surrounding the band 's first album . " Jules Willis of the BBC wrote : " The second track , the first written post @-@ Parachutes and sounding like a refugee from that album , is the grower ' In My Place ' . It 's a fantastic pop tune that justifies Coldplay 's status as one of UK 's most exciting bands . "

 Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin , released on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom on Atlantic Records . Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969 . Production was credited to lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page , while it also served as Led Zeppelin 's first album to utilise the recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer . With elements of blues and folk music , Led Zeppelin II also exhibits the band 's evolving musical style of blues @-@ derived material and their guitar and riff @-@ based sound . It has been described as the band 's heaviest album . 
 Upon release , Led Zeppelin II sold well and was the band 's first album to reach number one in the UK and the US . In 1970 , art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for the album . On 15 November 1999 , it was certified 12 × Platinum by the RIAA for sales in excess of 12 million copies . Since its release , writers and music critics have regularly cited it in polls of the greatest and most influential rock albums . 
 = = Conception = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Led Zeppelin II was conceived during a hectic and much @-@ travelled period of Led Zeppelin 's career from January through August 1969 , when they completed four European and three American concert tours . Each song was separately recorded , mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America . The album was written on tour , during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts , a studio was booked and the recording process begun , resulting in a sound with spontaneity and urgency through necessity . Bassist John Paul Jones recalled that " We were touring a lot . Jimmy [ Page ] ' s riffs were coming fast and furious . A lot of them came from onstage especially during the long improvised section of ' Dazed and Confused ' . We 'd remember the good stuff and dart into a studio along the way . " 
 Some of the recording studios used by the band were not the most advanced . One studio in Vancouver , credited as " a hut " , had an 8 @-@ track set up that did not even have proper headphone facilities . The group 's lead singer Robert Plant later discussed the writing and recording process , stating " It was crazy really . We were writing the numbers in hotel rooms and then we 'd do a rhythm track in London , add the vocal in New York , overdub the harmonica in Vancouver and then come back to finish mixing at New York . " 
 " Thank You " , " The Lemon Song " and " Moby Dick " were overdubbed during the tour , while the mixing of " Whole Lotta Love " and " Heartbreaker " was also done on tour . Page later stated " In other words , some of the material came out of rehearsing for the next tour and getting new material together . " 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 Recording sessions for the album took place at Olympic and Morgan Studios in London , England ; A & M , Quantum , Sunset , Mirror Sound and Mystic Studios in Los Angeles , California ; Ardent Studios in Memphis , Tennessee ; A & R , Juggy Sound , Groove and Mayfair Studios in New York City ; and the " hut " in Vancouver . Production was entirely credited to Jimmy Page , while it also served as Led Zeppelin 's first album to utilise the skills and recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer . Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis wrote of the album 's production , stating " That the album turned out to be such a triumph , in particular for a production quality that still sounds fresh today , was in no small way due to the successful alliance with Page and Kramer in the control room . " This partnership was particularly exhibited in the central section of the track " Whole Lotta Love " . Kramer later said , " The famous Whole Lotta Love mix , where everything is going bananas , is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console twiddling every knob known to man . " 
 In another interview , Kramer later gave great credit to Page for the sound that was achieved , despite the inconsistent conditions in which it was recorded : " We did that album piece @-@ meal . We cut some of the tracks in some of the most bizarre studios you can imagine , little holes in the wall . Cheap studios . But in the end it sounded bloody marvellous . There was a unification of sound on [ Led ] Zeppelin II because there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page . " Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A & R Studios . 
 One other song from the sessions , " La La " was included on the 2014 deluxe edition of the album . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The finished tracks reflect the raw , evolving sound of the band and their ability as live performers . The album has been noted for featuring a further development of the lyrical themes established by Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin 's debut album , as Robert Plant had not until that point written any lyrics for the band . This all served to create a work which would then become more widely acclaimed and arguably more influential . " Whole Lotta Love " and " The Lemon Song " both feature sexual themes , as the latter contains a metaphor , which , according to one music writer , implores " unnamed ladies to squeeze his lemon ' til the juice runs down my leg . ' " As was later observed by Plant himself : 
 Led Zep II was very virile . That was the album that was going to dictate whether or not we had the staying power and the capacity to stimulate . It was still blues @-@ based but it was a much more carnal approach to the music and quite flamboyant . It was created on the run between hotel rooms and the <unk> , and that was quite something . 
 Led Zeppelin II also features experimentation with other musical styles and approaches , as on the alternately soft @-@ and @-@ loud " What Is and What Should Never Be " and " Ramble On " ( which featured Page 's acoustic guitar ) , or the pop @-@ influenced ballad " Thank You " . With its mysterious atmospherics , " Ramble On " helped develop hard rock 's association with fantasy themes , which had been partly derived from the psychedelic rock genre of two to three years before , but also from Plant 's personal interest in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien . This musical direction would later culminate on Led Zeppelin IV ( and countless subsequent groups would later carry the influence to further extremes ) . Conversely , the instrumental " Moby Dick " features an extended drum solo by John Bonham , which would be extended further during Led Zeppelin concert performances sometimes for as long as half an hour . 
 Page 's contribution to this album was significant , as his electric guitar solo on the song " Heartbreaker " was emulated by many younger rock guitarists , and exemplifies the group 's intense musical attack . Led Zeppelin II is the band 's first album to feature Page playing a 1959 Gibson Les Paul , the electric guitar he helped popularise . His innovative recording and drum miking effects on tracks such as " Ramble On " and " Whole Lotta Love " also demonstrated his considerable skill , resourcefulness and originality as a producer . Rolling Stone magazine later called Page 's guitar riff for the latter song " one of the most exhilarating guitar riffs in rock & roll . " John Paul Jones later discussed Page 's contributions : 
 Jimmy started coming into his own as a producer around " Whole Lotta Love " . The backwards echo stuff . A lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired . Everybody thinks he goes into the studio with huge walls of amps , but he doesn 't . He uses a really small amp and he just mic 's it up really well , so it fits into a sonic picture . 
 The album 's material also marked a certain honing of Plant 's vocal approach , and signalled his emergence as a serious songwriter . Plant 's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band 's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist . His influence on tracks such as " What Is and What Should Never Be " and " Ramble On " were pointers to the band 's musical future . Plant has commented that it was only during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin . In a 2008 interview for Uncut , he stated " [ D ] uring Led Zep I ( 1969 ) as far as I was concerned , I thought that I was going to [ leave the band ] anyway . I didn 't feel that comfortable because there were a lot of demands on me vocally — which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing . And I was quite nervous and didn 't really get into enjoying it until II . "

 The album sleeve design was from a poster by David Juniper , who was simply told by the band to come up with an interesting idea . Juniper was a fellow student of Page 's at Sutton Art College in Surrey . His design was based on a photograph of the Jagdstaffel 11 Division of the German Air Force during World War I , the famed Flying Circus led by the Red Baron . After the picture was tinted , the faces of the four members of the band were airbrushed on from a 1969 publicity photograph . Other faces added , according to Juniper , were either Miles Davis or Blind Willie Johnson , a friend of Andy Warhol ( possibly Mary <unk> ) and astronaut Neil Armstrong , although it is actually fellow astronaut Frank Borman . The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background ( similar to the cover of the band 's first album ) , which gave the album its nickname " Brown Bomber " .

 The album was released on 22 October 1969 on Atlantic Records , with advance orders of 400 @,@ 000 copies . The advertising campaign was built around the slogans ' Led Zeppelin - The Only Way to Fly ' and ' Led Zeppelin II Now Flying ' . Commercially , Led Zeppelin II was the band 's first album to hit No. 1 in the US , knocking The Beatles ' Abbey Road ( 1969 ) twice from the top spot , where it remained for seven weeks . By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales , whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138 @-@ week residence on the LP chart , climbing to the top spot in February 1970 . 
 The album also yielded Led Zeppelin 's biggest hit with the track " Whole Lotta Love " . This song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1970 , after Atlantic went against the group 's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45 . The single 's B @-@ side , " Living Loving Maid ( She 's Just a Woman ) " , also hit the Billboard chart , peaking at No. 65 in April 1970 . The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction , as for the next year , the group continued to tour relentlessly , initially performing in clubs and ballrooms , then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew . 
 In 1970 art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of best album package for Led Zeppelin II . On 10 November 1969 , the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and in 1990 it was certified 5x platinum reflecting shipping of five million copies . By 14 November 1999 , Led Zeppelin II had shipped twelve million copies and was certified 12x platinum by the RIAA . The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the Billboard Top 10 when it got to # 9 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Led Zeppelin II has been cited by music writers as a blueprint for heavy metal bands that followed it . Blues @-@ derived songs like " Whole Lotta Love " , " Heartbreaker " , " The Lemon Song " , " Moby Dick " , and " Bring It On Home " have been seen as representing standards of the genre , where the guitar @-@ based riff ( rather than vocal chorus or verses ) defines the song and provides the key hook . Such arrangements and emphasis were at the time atypical in popular music . Page 's guitar solo in " Heartbreaker " featuring rapid @-@ fire runs of notes tapped only by the left hand , was a major inspiration to the later work of metal soloists and " shredders " such as Eddie Van Halen and Steve Vai . As such , the album is generally considered to be very influential on the development of rock music , being an early forerunner of heavy metal , and inspiring a host of other rock bands including Aerosmith , Iron Maiden and Guns N ' Roses . 
 Since its initial critical reception , Led Zeppelin II has been acknowledged by many critics and music writers as one of the most influential albums of rock music , and has earned several accolades from music publications , frequently placed at or near the top of " best album " lists . In 1989 , Spin magazine ranked the album No. 5 on its list of The 25 Greatest Albums of All Time . In 2000 , Q magazine placed Led Zeppelin II at number 37 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time .

 = Ahalya = 
 In Hindu mythology , Ahalya ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> , IAST <unk> ) , also known as Ahilya , is the wife of the sage Gautama Maharishi . Many Hindu scriptures say that she was seduced by Indra ( the king of gods ) , cursed by her husband for infidelity , and liberated from the curse by Rama ( an avatar of the god Vishnu ) . 
 Created by the god Brahma as the most beautiful woman , Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama . In the earliest full narrative , when Indra comes disguised as her husband , Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances . Later sources often absolve her of all guilt , describing how she falls prey to Indra 's trickery . In all narratives , Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama . The curse varies from text to text , but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption . Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible to the world and how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality , in the popular retelling developed over time , Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama 's foot . 
 Ahalya 's seduction by Indra and its repercussions form the central narrative of her story in all scriptural sources for her life . Although the Brahmanas ( 9th to 6th centuries BCE ) are the earliest scriptures to hint at her relationship with Indra , the 5th- to 4th @-@ century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana – whose hero is Rama – is the first to explicitly mention her extra @-@ marital affair in detail . Medieval story @-@ tellers often focus on Ahalya 's deliverance by Rama , which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God . Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern @-@ age poetry and short stories , as well as in dance and drama . While ancient narratives are Rama @-@ centric , contemporary ones focus on Ahalya , telling the story from her perspective . Other traditions deal with her children . 
 In traditional Hinduism , Ahalya is extolled as the first of the panchakanya ( " five virgins " ) , archetypes of female chastity whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited . While some praise her loyalty to her husband and her undaunted acceptance of the curse and gender norms , others condemn her adultery . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word Ahalya can be divided into two parts : a ( a prefix indicating negation ) and <unk> , which Sanskrit dictionaries define as being related to the plough , ploughing , or deformity . In the Uttar Kanda book of the Ramayana , the god Brahma explains the meaning of the Sanskrit word Ahalya as " one without the <unk> of ugliness " , or " one with an impeccable beauty " while telling Indra how he created Ahalya by taking the special beauty of all creation and expressing it in every part of her body . Because some Sanskrit dictionaries translate Ahalya as " unploughed , " some recent authors view this as an implicit reference to sexual intercourse and argue that the name refers to a virgin or a motherly figure . This fits the context of the character Ahalya , who is viewed as being in one way or another beyond Indra 's reach . However , Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore ( 1861 – 1941 ) , focusing on the literal meaning of " unploughed , " interpreted Ahalya as a symbol of stone @-@ like , infertile land that was made cultivable by Rama . Delhi University professor Bharati <unk> concurs with Tagore , interpreting Ahalya as unploughed land , on the basis of the tribal Bhil Ramayana of Gujarat , an undated oral tradition . 
 = = Creation and marriage = = 
 Ahalya is often described as an <unk> , one not born of a woman . The Bala Kanda of the Ramayana ( 5th to 4th century BCE ) mentions that Brahma moulds her " with great effort out of pure creative energy " . The Brahma Purana ( 401 – 1300 CE ) and the Vishnudharmottara Purana ( 401 – 500 CE ) also record her creation by Brahma . According to the Mahari dance tradition , Brahma created Ahalya out of water as the most beautiful woman in order to break the pride of Urvashi , the foremost celestial nymph . The tribal Bhil Ramayana begins with the tale of Ahalya , Gautama and Indra . In the tale , Ahalya is created from the ashes of the sacrificial fire by the Saptarishi ( seven seers ) and gifted to Gautama . In contrast , the Bhagavata Purana ( 501 – 1000 CE ) and the Harivamsa ( 1 – 300 CE ) regard Ahalya as a princess of the Puru Dynasty , the daughter of King Mudgala and sister of King <unk> . 
 In the Uttara Kanda book of the Ramayana ( regarded by most scholars as a later addition to the epic ) , Brahma crafts Ahalya as the most beautiful woman and places her in the care of Gautama until she reaches puberty . When that time arrives , the sage returns Ahalya to Brahma , who , impressed by Gautama 's sexual restraint and asceticism , bestows her upon him . Indra , who believes that the best women are meant for him , resents Ahalya 's marriage to the forest @-@ dwelling ascetic . 
 The Brahma Purana gives a similar account of Ahalya 's birth and initial custody , recording that her marriage was determined through an open contest . Brahma declares that the first being to go around the three worlds ( heaven , earth and the underworld ) will win Ahalya . Indra uses his magical powers to complete the challenge , finally reaching Brahma and demanding the hand of Ahalya . However , the divine sage Narada tells Brahma that Gautama went around the three worlds before Indra . Narada explains that Gautama circumambulated the wish @-@ bearing cow Surabhi while she gave birth , as part of his daily puja ( ritual offering ) , making the cow equal to three worlds according to the Vedas . Brahma agrees and Ahalya marries Gautama , leaving Indra envious and infuriated . A similar , but shorter , version of Ahalya 's early life appears in the Padma Purana ( 701 – 1200 CE ) . 
 In all versions of the tale , after marrying Gautama , Ahalya settles into his ashram ( hermitage ) , which generally becomes the site of her epic curse . The Ramayana records that Gautama 's ashram is in a forest ( Mithila @-@ <unk> ) near Mithila , where the couple practices asceticism together for several years . In other scriptures , the ashram is usually near the river bank . The Brahma Purana says that it is near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana ( 701 – 1200 CE ) places it near the river Narmada . The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana ( 801 – 1100 CE ) describe the ashram as near the holy city of Pushkar . 
 = = Hints of a relationship with Indra = = 
 The Brahmanas ( 9th to 6th centuries BCE ) are the oldest scriptures to mention a relationship between Ahalya and Indra in the " subrahmanya formula " , a chant used by Vedic priests " at the beginning of a sacrifice to invite the main participants : Indra , the gods and the Brahmins " ( priests ) . The <unk> Brahmana and the <unk> Brahmana from the Samaveda tradition , the Shatapatha Brahmana and the Taittiriya Brahmana from the Yajurveda tradition and two <unk> ( <unk> and <unk> ) invoke Indra , the " lover of Ahalya ... O Kaushika [ Brahmin ] , who calls himself Gautama " . The Samaveda tradition identifies her as Maitreyi , who the commentator Sayana ( died 1387 ) explains is " the daughter of [ the god ] Mitra " . 
 In the subrahmanya formula , Ahalya does not have a husband . The <unk> Brahmana does not explicitly state that Ahalya has a husband , although Kaushika ( interpreted by most scholars as Ahalya 's husband ) is present in the story and his relationship to her can be inferred through Indra 's adoption of the Brahmin 's form to " visit " Ahalya . Renate <unk> @-@ Thieme , research associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies , feels that the Kaushika of the <unk> Brahmana is the same individual described as cursing Indra in the 5th- to 4th @-@ century BCE epic Mahabharata ( discussed below in " Curse and redemption " ) . 
 The Shatapatha Brahmana 's commentator , <unk> Bhatta ( c . 700 ) , reasons that the Ahalya – Indra narrative is an allegory for the Sun or the light ( Indra ) taking away the shade of night ( Ahalya ) . Edward Washburn Hopkins , an American indologist , interpreted the Ahalya of the subrahmanya formula not as a woman , but literally as " yet unploughed land " , which Indra makes fertile . 
 = = Seduction by Indra = = 
 The Bala Kanda of the Ramayana is the earliest text to describe Ahalya 's seduction in detail . It states that Indra becomes enamoured by Ahalya 's beauty , learns of her husband 's absence and comes to the ashram disguised as Gautama to request sexual intercourse with her , praising her as a shapely and slim @-@ waisted woman . She sees through his disguise , but consents owing to her " curiosity " . According to another interpretation , Ahalya 's pride in her beauty compels her . Having satiated his lust , Ahalya requests that Indra , her " lover " and the " best of gods " , flee and protect them from Gautama 's wrath . The Kathasaritsagara ( 11th century CE ) is one of the few texts that mirror the Bala Kanda 's Ahalya , who makes a conscious decision to accept Indra 's advances . However , in this text Indra arrives undisguised . 
 Although the Bala Kanda mentions that Ahalya consciously commits adultery , the Uttar Kanda of the Ramayana and the Puranas ( compiled between the 4th and 16th centuries CE ) absolve her of all guilt . The Uttar Kanda recasts the tale as Ahalya 's rape by Indra . In one allusion in the Mahabharata , King <unk> reminds Brihaspati , Indra 's guru , how Indra " violated " the " renowned " rishi @-@ <unk> ( wife of a sage ) Ahalya . According to <unk> @-@ Thieme , the usage of the words " violated " and " renowned " indicates that Ahalya is not considered an adulteress . 
 The Puranas introduce themes that are echoed in later works , including the deception of the unsuspecting Ahalya by Indra 's devious disguise as Gautama in his absence . The Padma Purana states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath , Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him . Ahalya , engrossed in worship , rejects him , considering it inappropriate to have sex at the cost of neglecting the gods . Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him . Finally Ahalya gives in , but Gautama learns of Indra 's deception through his supernatural powers and returns to the ashram . A similar account is found in the Brahma Purana . At times , Indra takes the form of a cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions , as in the 18th @-@ century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior @-@ poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty . In other versions , he uses an accomplice , such as the moon @-@ god Chandra , to distract Gautama . In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana , Ahalya comes to bathe in the <unk> ( heavenly river ) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her . Assuming Gautama 's form , Indra has sex with her until they sink to the river bed in exhaustion . However , Gautama catches them in the act . Another version in the same Purana focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra . In this version , Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour , which is flatly refused by Ahalya . Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective . 
 In some versions , though initially deluded by Indra 's disguise , Ahalya eventually recognises the impersonator . In the Skanda Purana , Ahalya smells Indra 's celestial fragrance and realises her folly as he embraces and kisses her and " so forth " ( probably indicating a sexual act ) . Threatening Indra with a curse , she compels him to reveal his true form . However , Kamban 's 12th @-@ century Tamil adaptation of the Ramayana , the Ramavataram , narrates that Ahalya realises that her lover is an imposter but continues to enjoy the dalliance . Here , Ahalya agrees to have sex with the disguised Indra because she has long been craving affection from her ascetic husband .
