 Maine has 281 miles ( 452 km ) of the trail . The northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail is on Mount Katahdin 's Baxter Peak in Baxter State Park . 
 In some parts of the trail in Maine , such as Mahoosuc Notch , even the strongest hikers may only average 1 mile per hour ( 1 @.@ 6 km / h ) . There are other parts in which hikers must hold on to tree limbs and roots to climb and descend , which are especially dangerous and hazardous in wet weather conditions . 
 The western section includes a mile @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) stretch of boulders , some of which hikers must pass under , at Mahoosuc Notch , sometimes called the trail 's hardest mile . Although there are dozens of river and stream fords on the Maine section of the trail , the Kennebec River is the only one on the trail that requires a boat crossing . The most isolated portion of the Appalachian Trail , known as the " Hundred @-@ Mile Wilderness " , occurs in Maine . It heads east @-@ northeast from the town of Monson and ends outside Baxter State Park just south of <unk> Bridge . 
 Park management strongly discourages thru @-@ hiking within the park before May 15 or after October 15 . 
 The AMC maintains the AT from the New Hampshire border to Grafton Notch , with the Maine Appalachian Trail Club responsible for maintaining the remaining miles to Mt . Katahdin . The international extension , called the International Appalachian Trail begins at Mt . Katahdin .

 The Appalachian Trail has been a resource for researchers in a variety of disciplines . Portions of the trail in Tennessee were used on a study on trail maintenance for the trail 's " uniform environmental conditions and design attributes and substantial gradient in visitor use . " Beginning in 2007 , various citizen groups , including the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the American Hiking Society , began a study to monitor environmental changes that have resulted from higher ozone levels , acid rain , smog , and other air quality factors . Such research has been supported by the National Park Service , U.S. Forest Service , Cornell University , the National Geographic Society , and <unk> Corporation . 
 Behavioral studies have also been conducted on hikers themselves . A 2007 study on hikers found that most persons hike the trail " for fun and enjoyment of life and for warm relationships with others " and that " environmental awareness , physical challenge , camaraderie , exercise , and solitude " were chief results among hikers . Since the highest single demographic of thru @-@ hikers are males between the ages of 18 – 29 , one informal study sought to find the correlation between this group and male college drop @-@ outs . 
 = Battle of Prokhorovka = 
 The Battle of Prokhorovka was fought on 12 July 1943 near Prokhorovka , 87 kilometres ( 54 mi ) southeast of Kursk , in the Soviet Union , during the Second World War . Taking place on the Eastern Front , the fighting was part of the wider Battle of Kursk , and occurred when the 5th Guards Tank Army of the Soviet Red Army attacked the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps of the German Wehrmacht in one of the largest tank battles in military history . 
 In April 1943 , the German high command began preparing for Operation Citadel , with the aim of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient . The Soviet high command , Stavka , learned of the German intentions and prepared a series of defensive lines along the routes of the planned German offensive . The Soviets also massed several armies deep behind their defences as a reserve . This group , the Steppe Front , was to be used to launch their own counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated . The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary offensive formation of the Steppe Front . On 5 July 1943 the Germans launched their offensive . On the southern side of the salient , the German 4th Panzer Army , with Army Detachment Kempf on its eastern flank , attacked the Soviet defences of the Voronezh Front . 
 A week into the German offensive the Soviets counterattacked . On the southern side of the salient near Prokhorovka the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army , resulting in a large clash of armour . The 5th Guards Tank Army was decimated in the attack , but succeeded in preventing the Germans from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt to achieve operational freedom . The German offensive was later cancelled and their forces were withdrawn . The Red Army went on a general offensive and seized the strategic initiative on the Eastern Front , which it was to hold for the rest of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the spring rasputitsa ( mud ) season came to an end in 1943 , both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations . The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union , but they were convinced by a number of key commanders , including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov , to assume a defensive posture instead . This would allow the Germans to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions , after which the Soviet forces would be able to <unk> and go on the offensive . A similar strategy discussion occurred on the German side , with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviets to advance , while the Germans launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition . But for political reasons Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive , choosing the Kursk salient for the attack . On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for Unternehmen Zitadelle ( " Operation Citadel " ) . 
 The German offensive plan envisioned an assault at the base of the Kursk salient from both the north and south , with the intent of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the salient . The two spearheads were to meet near Kursk . From the south , the XLVIII Panzer Corps and General Paul Hausser 's II SS @-@ Panzer Corps , forming the left and right wings of the 4th Panzer Army commanded by Colonel General Hermann Hoth , would drive northward . The III Panzer Corps of Army Detachment Kempf was to protect Hoth 's right flank from counterattack by the Soviet strategic reserves known to be located east of the salient . The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf were under Army Group South , commanded by Manstein . Air support over the southern portion of the offensive was provided by Colonel General Otto <unk> 's Luftflotte 4 , whose major air formation , the VIII Fliegerkorps , was commanded by General Hans Seidemann . 
 Multiple delays by the Germans allowed the Soviets a great deal of time to prepare their defences . Employing defence in depth , they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations . Three belts made up of extensive minefields , anti @-@ tank ditches , and anti @-@ tank gun emplacements were created , with an additional three belts that were mostly unoccupied and less fortified backing the first three . The Voronezh Front , commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin , defended the southern face of the salient . The Steppe Front , commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev , formed the strategic reserve . It was to be held back until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive . This formation included Lieutenant General Alexei <unk> 's 5th Guards Army and Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov 's 5th Guards Tank Army . 
 = = = German advance leading up to Prokhorovka = = = 
 The Germans launched their attack on the morning of 5 July 1943 and met heavy resistance . There were far more Soviet anti @-@ tank guns , minefields , anti @-@ tank ditches than had been anticipated , making a breakthrough more difficult to achieve . Furthermore , from the outset they were subjected to frequent counterattacks from Soviet tank units . Despite this , by the end of 5 July the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps had advanced through the first defensive belt and reached the second , although the plan was to breach the first two belts and reach the third on the first day . Nonetheless , the panzer corps ' penetration caused great concern among Soviet commanders , compelling Vatutin to commit almost all of Voronezh Front 's operational reserves by the end of the first day . 
 To the southeast , III Panzer Corps met with stiff resistance as well and had great difficulty creating and maintaining a bridgehead across the Northern Donets River . They eventually succeeded by the morning of 6 July , but the delay in their advance kept them from protecting the east flank of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps . 
 Late on 6 July , the 5th Guards Tank and the 5th Guards Armies of the Steppe Front began moving up from their reserve position , travelling at night to avoid detection . The 5th Guards Tank Army covered the 390 kilometres ( 240 mi ) over three nights , and arrived at the Prokhorovka area on the night of 9 July , and the 5th Guards Army 's 33rd Guards Rifle Corps arrived at the settlement on the night of 10 July . 
 Slow progress by the XLVIII Panzer Corps , caused Hoth to shift elements of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps on 8 July to aid the XLVIII Panzer Corp 's drive toward Oboyan and Kursk . On the same day , the Soviets counterattacked the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps with several tank corps . These attacks did not destroy the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps as hoped , but slowed its progress . By the end of 8 July , II SS @-@ Panzer Corps had advanced about 29 kilometres ( 18 mi ) and broken through the first and second defensive belts . 
 On the following day , 9 July , a meeting of the German commanders of the forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that a breakthrough in the northern side of salient was unlikely . Nevertheless , they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties , thereby tying down the Soviet forces there . The success of Operation Citadel now depended on a breakthrough being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf . On the evening of 9 July , the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress , from due north to the northeast toward the settlement Prokhorovka . Hoth had formulated this move , and had discussed it with Manstein since early May , as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east , and he did not want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel when they arrived . The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka , but this could not be realised . The Soviet command , however , interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the Germans had faced driving toward Oboyan , and believed the change indicated the German panzer forces were weakening . 
 Soviet intelligence reports issued from 8 to 9 July reported that defensive works were being constructed by German infantry on the flanks of the 4th Panzer Army , and that German armoured formations were not present in these locations , despite the fact that Soviet armoured formations were situated opposite these flanks . Voronezh Front headquarters supposed the Germans must be reaching their limit , and on 10 July decided to set its counteroffensive to coincide with the Soviet counteroffensive in the northern side of the Kursk salient . 
 Starting on the morning of 10 July , the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps began its attack toward Prokhorovka . Its 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf attacked across the Psel River and secured a bridgehead . The 1st SS Panzergrenadier Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler captured Komsomolets State Farm and Hill 241 @.@ 6 . The 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Division Das Reich defended the panzer corps ' flank from Soviet armoured counterattacks . 
 The II SS @-@ Panzer Corps continued its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July . The advance of Leibstandarte was checked by the 2nd Tank Corps , which had been reinforced by the 9th Guards Airborne Division and 301st Anti @-@ tank Artillery Regiment , both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps . Totenkopf was resisted by the 31st Tank Corps , the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps ' 95th Guards Rifle Division , and 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps . To the south of Leibstandarte , the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps ' 183rd Rifle Division opposed the advance of Das Reich . 
 By day 's end on 11 July Leibstandarte had advanced deep into the Soviet third defensive belt . They had moved up the Psel corridor , cleared Soviet resistance at the <unk> ( " October " ) State Farm ( Russian : <unk> <unk> ) , crossed a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) -deep antitank ditch at the base of Hill 252 @.@ 2 and seized the hill itself after a brief but bloody battle , leaving them only 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) south of Prokhorovka . To its north the panzergrenadiers of Totenkopf achieved a bridgehead across the Psel and tanks had been brought across , but they had yet to take Hill 226 @.@ 6 and there was a 5 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) gap between Totenkopf and Leibstandarte . To the south Das Reich had also met stiff resistance and lagged behind some 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) to the south . With its advance Leibstandarte ‍ ' s flanks were exposed both to the north and the south , placing them under sporadic counterattacks from the 95th Guards Rifle Division and the remnants of 2nd Tank Corps . 
 Late on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army prepared for its forthcoming counterattack . Leibstandarte 's advance had disrupted Rotmistrov 's preparations , as the assembly areas he intended to use for the tank army 's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands by the end of the day , forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions . The late arrival of the 5th Guard Tank Army was impactful in two major ways . The tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoiter the terrain they would be traveling across . Equally , if not more importantly , the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire . Thus the artillery fire which the tankers depended upon to sweep their path of advance and suppress German anti @-@ tank gunners was not adequately present . 
 = = Planning = = 
 = = = German plans for 12 July = = = 
 Late on the evening of 11 July , General Paul Hausser , the commander of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps , issued orders for a classic battle manoeuvre for the following day 's advance on Prokhorovka . It was known that the Soviets had dug in many anti @-@ tank guns on the west slopes of Prokhorovka , making a direct attack by Leibstandarte very difficult . The plan was for Totenkopf to capture Hill 226 @.@ 6 , and advance northeast along the Psel River to the <unk> @-@ Prokhorovka road , and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka . Leibstandarte was ordered to nudge forward and secure <unk> and <unk> just outside Prokhorovka , then it and Das Reich were to wait until Totenkopf 's attack had disrupted the Soviet positions , after which Leibstandarte was to attack the main Soviet defences on the west slope of Prokhorovka . To Leibstandarte 's right , elements of Das Reich were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka , then turn south away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps ' advance and force a gap . The VIII Fliegerkorps was to make its main effort in support of the advance of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps , with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources . 
 Unbeknownst to Hausser , on the night of 11 July Rotmistrov had moved his 5th Guards Tank Army to an assembly area just south of Prokhorovka in preparation for a massive armoured attack the following day . Throughout the night , German frontline troops could hear Soviet tank engines as the 18th and 29th Tank Corps moved into their assembly areas . A battalion from Leibstandarte ‍ ' s 2nd SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment situated on the reverse slope of Hill 252 @.@ 2 had been listening to the engines of the Soviet tanks and were uneasy about the impending attack it implied . 
 = = = Soviet plans for 12 July = = = 
 The 5th Guards Army and 5th Guards Tank Army of the Steppe Front had been brought up from reserve and reassigned to the Voronezh Front on 8 and 11 July respectively . On 11 July Vatutin ordered the armies of the Voronezh Front to go over onto the offensive on the following day . This counterattack was planned to coincide with the Soviet offensive on the northern side of the Kursk Salient , Operation Kutuzov . Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to destroy the German forces near Prokhorovka with his 5th Guards Tank Army , without allowing the Germans to withdraw southward . 
 For the battle , Rotmistrov ordered his tanks to move forward at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the advantages the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88 mm guns . He believed the more manoeuvrable T @-@ 34 would be able to quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks . In fact , Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinands and Tigers possessed by the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps . In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South , as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army . Soviet tank @-@ crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were armed with the KwK 40 anti @-@ tank gun , which also had extra armour added to their turret , for Tigers ; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the Germans during the Battle of Kursk . 
 Soviet air support in the southern part of the salient was provided by the 2nd Air Army and the 17th Air Army , commanded by Lieutenant General Stepan <unk> and Lieutenant General Vladimir <unk> , respectively . However , the bulk of the air support was committed in support of Soviet units attacking XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west of Prokhorovka and the III Panzer Corps to the southeast , and only limited numbers of aircraft were available to support 5th Guards Tank Army 's attack . 
 Rotmistrov 's plans for a counterattack were threatened by events to the south . III Panzer Corps managed to cross the Northern Donets at <unk> on the night of 11 July , and were about 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) southeast of Prokhorovka , and advancing northwards . This threat jeopardised Rotmistrov 's entire plan by threatening the rear of the 5th Guards Tank Army . Early on 12 July , Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to send reinforcements to the Soviet 7th Guards and 69th Armies facing the III Panzer Corps . He organised a task force under the command of his deputy , Major General Kuzma <unk> , which consisted of the 26th Guards Tank Brigade from the 2nd Guards Tank Corps , the 11th and 12th Guards Mechanized Brigades from the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps , and the 53rd Guards Tank Regiment of the 5th Guards Tank Army . Other units of the Voronezh Front also joined the group on its way south . In doing so Rotmistrov committed over half of his army 's reserves before the Battle of Prokhorovka had begun .

 = = = Disposition of German forces = = = 
 The German forces involved in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three Waffen @-@ SS divisions of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps : Leibstandarte , Das Reich , and Totenkopf . On the evening of 11 July , the serviceable armour strength of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps was 294 tanks and assault guns , which included 15 Tigers . The armoured strength of Leibstandarte , Das Reich , and Totenkopf were 77 , 95 , and 122 tanks and assault guns respectively . Ten of the Tigers were to the north of the Psel River with Totenkopf , four were with Leibstandarte , and Das Reich had just one . 
 Leibstandarte had advanced the most deeply toward Prokhorovka and was situated in the centre of the German position . A railway line , with a 30 @-@ feet high <unk> , divided the area of Leibstandarte division north and south . The bulk of the division was positioned to the north of the rail line , including the division 's 1st SS @-@ Panzer Regiment and 2nd SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment , as well as its reconnaissance , artillery and command units . To the south of the rail line was Leibstandarte 's 1st SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment , along with the division 's 1st SS @-@ Panzerjäger battalion . Das Reich was positioned to the southeast of Leibstandarte , and it protected the southern flank of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps . Totenkopf was positioned to the northwest of Leibstandarte . The division 's 3rd SS @-@ Panzer Regiment had largely crossed over the Psel in preparation for the assault . Leibstandarte placed its lightly armed 1st SS @-@ Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion in the 5 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) gap between it and Totenkopf to provide some flank protection . The unit was later buttressed by the division 's four remaining Tigers , commanded by SS @-@ Second Lieutenant Michael Wittmann . 
 = = = Disposition of Soviet forces = = = 
 The main Soviet armoured formation involved in the battle was the 5th Guards Tank Army , which controlled five corps by 12 July : the 2nd Guards , 2nd , 5th Guards Mechanized , 18th and 29th Tank Corps . All together they fielded 793 tanks and 37 to 57 self @-@ propelled guns for a total of approximately 840 armoured fighting vehicles . About two @-@ thirds of these tanks were T @-@ 34s , while the remainder were T @-@ 70 light tanks , with some 31 to 35 Churchill heavy tanks as well . Not all of the 5th Guards Tank Army was present in the Prokhorovka area during the battle , as part of the formation had been sent south to check the advance of the III Panzer Corps . The Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army – including the newly attached 2nd Guards Tank Corps and 2nd Tank Corps , as well as the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps held in reserve – that faced the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps on 12 July was about 616 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns . In addition , five artillery regiments , one artillery brigade , and one anti @-@ aircraft artillery division were attached to the 5th Guards Tank Army for the assault . 
 The main attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army was conducted against Leibstandarte by its fresh 29th and 18th Tank Corps that had been brought up from the Soviet strategic reserve . These two Soviet tank formations together provided the greatest number of tanks in the attack , with the 18th Tank Corps fielding 190 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns , and the 29th Tank Corps fielding 212 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns . Infantry support to the 18th and 29th Tank Corps was provided by the 9th Guards Airborne Division . A portion of the 18th Tank Corps was directed against the eastern flank of Totenkopf 's 6th SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment Eicke . On the southeastern wing of the 5th Guards Tank Army , Rotmistrov deployed the 120 surviving tanks of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps ; later on 12 July during the battle , the tank corp 's 26th Guards Tank Brigade with its estimated 40 tanks were sent south to face the III Panzer Corps . The 2nd Guards Tank Corps , supported by the remnants of the 2nd Tank Corps , was to attack Das Reich . Their infantry support was provided by the 183rd Rifle Division . The western flank of the 5th Guards Tank Army , which faced Totenkopf , was defended by the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps ' 42nd and 95th Guards Rifle Divisions , which were supported by the remnants of the 31st Tank Corps and the heavily depleted 23rd Guards Rifle Corps ' 52nd Guards Rifle Division . The forces of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps that were not sent south were held as reserve northwest of Prokhorovka , and they numbered about 113 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns . 
 Vatutin directed Soviet air assets to make their primary effort in attempting to check the III Panzer Corps ' drive northward , and in supporting the attack against the XLVIII Panzer Corps . Missions were flown in support of the attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army as well , but to a limited extent . The 2nd Air Army had some 472 aircraft operational on 12 July , while the 17th Air Army had 300 operational aircraft . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 05 : 45 on 12 July , Leibstandarte 's headquarters started receiving reports of the sound of many tank engines as the Soviet tanks moved into their assembly areas for the attack . At around 06 : 50 , elements of Leibstandarte 's 1st SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment nudged forward and drove the Soviet infantry out of <unk> , while elements of the division 's 2nd SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment fanned out from the October State Farm . The Soviets began a preparatory artillery barrage at around 08 : 00 , and as the last shells fell at 08 : 30 , Rotmistrov radioed the code words " Stal ! Stal ! Stal ! " ( " Steel , Steel , Steel ! " ) – the order to commence the attack . With that the Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army began their advance . 
 = = = Ground engagement = = = 
 In total , about 500 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns of the 5th Guards Tank Army attacked the positions of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps on 12 July , doing so in two massive waves , with 430 tanks in the first echelon and 70 more in the second . 
 Down from the slopes in front of Prokhorovka , the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps , firing as they came at Leibstandarte 's positions . As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes , they carried the men of the 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls . The troops of Leibstandarte were not slated to go into action until later in the day . Exhausted from the previous week 's fighting , many were just starting their day at the outset of the attack and were largely taken by surprise . As the Soviet armour appeared , German outposts all across the corp 's frontage began firing purple warning flares signaling a tank attack . Obersturmbannführer Rudolf von Ribbentrop , commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Regiment , stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway . He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti @-@ tank ditch . Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252 @.@ 2 . On the crest of the hill , Sturmbannführer Joachim Peiper 's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun . As Ribbentrop 's tanks spread out , he and the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Regiment were suddenly confronted by Soviet tanks of the 29th Tank Corp 's 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades : " About 150 – 200 meters in front of me appeared fifteen , then thirty , then forty tanks . Finally there were too many of them to count . " The Soviet armour , firing on the move , charged down the western slopes of Hill 252 @.@ 2 into the panzer company , and a hotly contested tank battle ensued . Four of the Panzer IVs under Ribbentrop were destroyed by the time their position was overrun . The three surviving tanks rode along with the advancing Soviet armour unnoticed , and they reported that they destroyed 14 Soviet tanks from close range . Rotmistrov 's tactic to close at high speed disrupted the control and co @-@ ordination of the Soviet tank formations and also greatly reduced their accuracy . In a three @-@ hour battle , the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Regiment engaged the attacking Soviet tanks and repulsed them , reporting that they destroyed about 62 Soviet tanks . Later that afternoon , tanks from the 31st Tank Brigade and the 53rd Motorized Brigade overran elements of the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion and reached Komsomolets State Farm , threatening Leibstandarte 's lines of communication and the division command post , located at Hill 241 @.@ 6 . The Soviet tanks attacked the division 's 1st SS @-@ Panzer Artillery Regiment , killing a number of the crews before they themselves were destroyed by direct fire and anti @-@ tank teams . 
 Wittman 's group of four Tigers supported the reconnaissance group in its effort to protect Leibstandarte 's left flank , and faced the 18th Tank Corps ' advancing 181st Tank Brigade . In a three @-@ hour battle the Tigers engaged the Soviet tanks at ranges from 1000 meters down to point @-@ blank , inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet tankers and successfully repelling their attack . Later , elements of the 170th Tank Brigade engaged the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Regiment , which was already fighting the 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades . Despite losing its commander and about 30 tanks in the fight , by early afternoon the 170th Tank Brigade had forced the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Regiment back to the October State Farm and reached the position of the 1st SS @-@ Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion . At around 18 : 00 , the 170th and 181st Tank Brigades penetrated the German line connecting Totenkopf and Leibstandarte . Assault guns and panzers supporting Totenkopf 's Eicke regiment repelled the Soviet attack and re @-@ established the line , forcing the Soviet tanks to withdraw to the village of <unk> . 
 The advance of Soviet armour down Hill 252 @.@ 2 was disrupted abruptly when they reached the anti @-@ tank ditch at the base of the hill . A number of tanks crashed into the 15 @-@ foot deep ditch while others moved along the edge looking for a way to cross . Heavy fire was exchanged between the Soviet tanks and two companies of a panzergrenadier battalion on the opposite side of the ditch . Peiper 's surviving panzergrenadiers engaged the Soviet infantry and attacked the Soviet tanks with magnetic anti @-@ tank grenades . Twenty of his battalion 's half @-@ tracks were lost in the fighting , some destroyed in ramming the much heavier Soviet tanks in an effort to stop them . Eventually , due to heavy Soviet pressure and dangerously exposed flanks , Leibstandarte tactically withdrew from the October State Farm and established firmer defensive lines 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the south .

 The 2nd and 17th Air Armies flew 893 sorties compared to the VIII Fliegerkorps 's 654 sorties over the southern part of the salient . Of note , most of the Soviet sorties flown that day were flown against the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west and the III Panzer Corps to the south . Low clouds in the morning and thunderstorms in the afternoon inhibited air operations in Prokhorovka for both sides . Over the Prokhorovka battlefield the Luftwaffe gained control of the air . Formations of Stukas , including a small number of G @-@ 2s experimentally equipped with 3 @.@ 7 @-@ centimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) BK 37 cannon that were commanded by Staffelkapitän Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel , attacked the Soviet formations , along with Fw 190 fighter @-@ bombers and Hs 129 ground @-@ attack aircraft equipped with 3 @-@ centimetre ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) anti @-@ tank cannon . The 31st Tank Brigade reported : " We suffered heavy losses in tanks through enemy artillery and aircraft . At 10 : 30 our tanks reached the Komsomolets State Farm , but due to continuous air attacks , they were unable to advance any further and shifted to the defence . " The tank brigade also reported : " our own air cover was fully absent until 13 : 00 . " The 5th Guards Tank Army reported : " the enemy 's aircraft literally hung above our combat formations throughout the entire battle , while our own aircraft , and particularly the fighter aviation , was totally insufficient . "

 By the end of the day , Leibstandarte still held Hill 252 @.@ 2 , but had been exhausted by the effort of turning back five tank brigades . To its left , Totenkopf had succeeded in capturing Hill 226 @.@ 6 and had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River to reach the <unk> – Prokhorovka road , 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) northwest of Prokhorovka . It was in position to outflank the Soviet forces at Prokhorovka , but was under pressure from Soviet attacks and its hold on the forward ground was tenuous . Das Reich had been unable to push forward at all . Forced onto the defensive by the attacks of the 2nd Guards and 2nd Tank Corps , Das Reich was unable to conduct its planned offensive maneuvers . 
 On the Soviet side , all the tank units under Rotmistrov 's 5th Guards Tank Army involved in the battle on 12 July suffered heavy losses . Rotmistrov later wrote that the 29th Tank Corps lost 60 percent of its armour and the 18th Tank Corps lost 30 percent on 12 July . A Soviet General Staff report recorded : " Thus on 12 July , the 5th Guards Tank Army failed to accomplish its assigned mission . As a result of the frontal attack , the army 's corps fought heavy battles against large enemy tank forces during which they were forced to assume defence . " Rotmistrov was forced to shift the 18th and 29th Tank Corps over to defence and reinforce them with infantry . They dug more trenches , dug in some of their tanks , laid new minefields , prepared anti @-@ tank strong points and massed artilleries . The 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps made preparations to push back Totenkopf the next morning . On the evening of 12 July , Stalin dispatched Zhukov to Vatutin 's headquarters as Stavka representative , in order to coordinate the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts ' operations . 
 = = Following the main engagement = = 
 On the night of 12 July , Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka , destroy German forces that had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River , and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress . Orders issued by the Germans for 13 July instructed Totenkopf to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka . Leibstandarte was to strengthen its front line and co @-@ ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopf 's attack from the northwest . Das Reich was to consolidate and strengthen its front line and prepare for an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps .

 On the morning of 13 July , the 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades , in cooperation with the 95th and 52nd Guards Rifle Corps , launched attacks against Totenkopf . These Soviet attacks preoccupied Totenkopf and prevented it from attacking south toward Prokhorovka . Around noon , Leibstandarte 's 1st SS @-@ Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to attack northward toward the Psel River to consolidate its front line with Totenkopf , while the division 's panzer units were to attack toward Soviet positions northeast of the October State Farm toward Prokhorovka . The 1st SS @-@ Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion attacked the defensive positions held by the 42nd Guards Rifle Division and the remaining armour of the 18th Tank Corps , while the panzer units attacked the defences of 9th Guards Airborne Division and the 29th Tank Corps . These German attacks were repelled by massive anti @-@ tank artillery fire . The 29th Tank Corps followed up with a counterattack and penetrated German lines , reaching Komsomolets State Farm before being beaten back by direct fire from German artillery . That afternoon , Totenkopf was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to more defendable positions around Hill 226 @.@ 6 . Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful , and Totenkopf completed its withdrawal by nightfall . 
 = = = German decision = = = 
 On 13 July Hitler summoned Manstein and the commander of Army Group Center Field Marshal Günther von Kluge to his headquarters , the Wolfsschanze in East Prussia . The Allied invasion of Sicily on the night of 9 – 10 July , combined with the Soviet counteroffensive of Operation Kutuzov against the flank and rear of General Walter Model 's 9th Army in the northern side of the Kursk salient on 12 July , and the violent attacks by strong Soviet forces at Prokhorovka the same day had caused Hitler to stop the offensive and shift forces to the Mediterranean theatre . He ordered his generals to terminate Operation Citadel . 
 Kluge welcomed the decision , as he was already in the process of withdrawing units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank . But Manstein was greatly disappointed . He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough in the southern side of the salient . As he saw it , with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka , and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve , they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand . With an eye toward the west , Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive . Manstein persisted , proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated , so the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for the rest of the summer . Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein 's goal was achieved . 
 = = = Operation Roland = = = 
 Manstein hastily put together the plans for Operation Roland , realizing that he only had a few days to conduct the operation before he lost the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps . The plan called for Das Reich to attack east and south and link up with III Panzer Corps , which would attack to the northwest . Totenkopf and Leibstandarte were to anchor the western and northern flanks of Das Reich , respectively . Once the link was achieved and the Soviet forces encircled , the Soviet defence would be crippled and Prokhorovka would likely fall shortly thereafter to the combined forces of the two panzer corps . The goal of the operation was to destroy the Soviet armoured reserves massed in the southern sector of the Kursk salient , and thereby check Soviet offensive capacity for the rest of the summer . 
 The orders for Operation Roland were issued in the closing hours of 13 July 1943 . However , after Hitler 's meeting with Manstein , Hitler countermanded the XXIV Panzer Corps ' deployment to the Kursk salient , sending them on 14 July to support the 1st Panzer Army to the south . The assault began at 04 : 00 on 14 July . Following a brief artillery barrage , the 4th SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Regiment Der Führer of Das Reich struck out for the high ground south @-@ west of <unk> , evicting the remnants of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of <unk> following violent house @-@ to @-@ house and hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting . Das Reich 's 2nd SS @-@ Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Soviets to withdraw eastward to a new line . Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line . The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with Das Reich , but <unk> , commanding the Soviet forces in the gap , was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal . The link @-@ up failed to trap the Soviet forces , though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti @-@ tank guns . Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the Germans , and Totenkopf began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel , following orders issued late on 15 July , as the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front . 
 On 17 July the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts launched a major offensive across the Mius and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South , pressing upon the 6th and 1st Panzer Armies . In the early afternoon of 17 July , Operation Roland was terminated with an order for the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to Belgorod . The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it as early as the evening of 16 July . Leibstandarte 's tanks were distributed between Das Reich and Totenkopf , and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy , while Das Reich and Totenkopf were dispatched south to meet the new Soviet offensives . 
 = = Casualties and losses = = 
 Losses are difficult to establish for either combatant . Tank losses attributed to the Germans vary , in part due to the Wehrmacht 's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses . Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses , but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such . Likewise , reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Soviets in the Battle of Prokhorovka are difficult to establish . 
 = = = German = = = 
 The II SS @-@ Panzer Corps reported 842 men killed , wounded , or missing for 12 July . Since the Germans controlled the Prokhorovka battlefield until 17 July , they were able to recover most of their disabled armoured vehicles . German historian Karl Frieser attributed three to five permanent tank losses to the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps for 12 July , while a study by the US Army ’ s Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation attributed six permanent tank losses , not counting Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks or German assault guns . 
 Archival data of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps shows that the corps had 294 operable tanks and assault guns on the evening of 11 July , and 251 on the evening of 13 July . Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July , these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during the battle of Prokhorovka , which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte . However , all of the inoperable Tiger tanks were repairable , and none were write @-@ offs . An estimated total of between 60 and 80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July . By the end of 16 July , the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns , almost the same number it had at the beginning of the battle on 12 July . On 12 July , Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the VIII Fliegerkorps and its attached squadron of Stukas reported eleven aircraft damaged , of which six were total write @-@ offs , all by Soviet anti @-@ aircraft artillery .

 A document prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised the combat losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive for all of its five corps , as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters . The document reported the following irrecoverable losses : 222 T @-@ 34s , 89 T @-@ 70s , 12 Churchill tanks , 8 SU @-@ <unk> , 3 SU @-@ 76s , and 240 support vehicles . The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T @-@ 34s , 56 T @-@ 70s , 7 Churchill tanks , 3 SU @-@ <unk> , and 3 SU @-@ 76s , with no figures for support vehicles . The document reported personnel casualties as 2 @,@ 940 killed in action , 3 @,@ 510 wounded in action , and 1 @,@ 157 missing in action . This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self @-@ propelled guns , with another 212 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns under repair , and 7 @,@ 607 casualties . 
 Soviet personnel losses at Prokhorovka for 12 July were estimated by the historian Christer Bergström to have been as high as 5 @,@ 500 men . For equipment damaged or destroyed , David Glantz and Jonathan House estimate that the whole 5th Guards Tank Army lost at least 400 tanks in its attacks on 12 July . The Soviet historians Grigoriy <unk> and Boris Soloviev estimate about 300 tanks and self @-@ propelled guns of 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed on 12 July . The study by the US Army ’ s Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation reports that the 2nd Guards , 18th and 29th Tanks Corps altogether permanently lost 144 tanks on 12 July , not including self @-@ propelled guns . George Nipe estimates that between 600 and 650 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed while fighting the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps on 12 July . 
 = = Outcome = = 
 Debate exists over the significance and outcome of the battle . The Germans destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army , but they were unable to take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground . For the Soviets , the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps or throw it onto the defensive , but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance . Thus , neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS @-@ Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for the day . While the battle is generally considered a tactical success for the Germans due to the high numbers of Soviet tanks destroyed , ultimately there was no German breakthrough at Prokhorovka , and with the end of Operation Citadel the strategic initiative permanently swung over to the Red Army .

Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny as a part of the branch , and that he is not going to rescind Danny 's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable . Before Dwight leaves for the day , he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client @-@ stealing past , then immediately welcomes him to the company . 
 Meanwhile , Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) starts a band after reading about how well one of his friends is doing in the music business .

 " The Sting " was directed by Randall Einhorn and written by Mindy Kaling , who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show . It was the first episode to feature Timothy Olyphant in a guest appearance as Danny Cordray , a rival paper salesman . Olyphant would return for the season 's Halloween special , " Costume Contest " , and would appear in a deleted scene for Carell 's penultimate episode , " Michael 's Last Dundies " . Olyphant enjoyed his stint on the show , later telling IGN that filming both " The Sting " and his scenes for other episodes was " a blast " and " a kick to do " because The Office is " such a fun show , the nature of the whole thing . The way they do it is just so fun and easy . " 
 The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Jim and Danny discussing Danny 's success at selling his father 's restaurant for a large amount of money , Michael expressing his delight at helping Jim and Dwight despite the fact that he is " an old man " , Michael mistaking Danny for a male model , extended scenes of Andy 's band , extra footage of Meredith flirting with Danny , Michael remembering that Danny was once a backpack model , and Danny saying that the only reason he will be working at Dunder Mifflin is because " they offered [ him ] a stupid amount of money " .

 In the cold opening , Oscar shows the office his new bicycle , which Dwight notes is a Lance Armstrong model . Kelly is offended , because she is " team Sheryl Crow " , a reference to the two 's engagement and break up . The potential customer that Jim and Dwight are trying to woo shares the same name with famous athlete Steve Nash , and Jim has to explain to Dwight that the famous Nash is a point guard for the Phoenix Suns basketball team . Michael compares the plot to learn Danny 's secret to the 1973 film The Sting , which starred Paul Newman and Robert Redford . Kelly notes that Danny reminds her of actor Josh Duhamel . The reason for Andy forming a band is that he discovers that his friend and rival <unk> Rob ( later played in the series by Stephen Colbert ) collaborated with Trey Anastasio , the lead singer and songwriter from the jam band Phish , and wrote a song together . This plot device would later be mentioned in the ninth season episode " Here Comes Treble " .

 Tierney was a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs during the 110th and 111th Congresses . Tierney introduced the 2007 House legislation that created the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan to study government contracting related to the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War . The same year Tierney chaired a congressional hearing over conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The center had been criticized in the press for its dilapidated conditions and inadequate care , as well as for prioritizing a " VIP ward " for non @-@ soldiers . The House approved Tierney 's amendment to direct $ 75 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to secular school construction in Pakistan to compete against Islamic <unk> . 
 Tierney is a critic of U.S. investment in missile defense , and has called for large budget cuts to the Missile Defense Agency . He introduced an amendment to redirect $ 966 million in funding from missile defense systems to other military initiatives . The proposal , opposed by Armed Services Committee leaders as " going too far " , was rejected in a House vote .

 In August 2010 , Tierney 's wife Patrice 's brothers Robert and Daniel Eremian were indicted in federal court for operating an illegal internet gambling business . Robert had allegedly , with Daniel 's help , operated the business out of St. John 's , Antigua and Barbuda , and funneled a portion of the profits into a Bank of America account in Massachusetts . In October 2010 , Patrice was charged in U.S. District Court with four counts of " aiding and abetting the filing of false tax returns " by Robert . John Tierney issued a statement announcing his wife 's intention to plead guilty , stating that Patrice accepted " full responsibility for being ' willfully blind ' to what her brother was doing . " Patrice pleaded guilty on October 6 , 2010 , and on January 13 , 2011 , was sentenced to 30 days in prison followed by five months of house arrest .

 = Italian cruiser Elba = 
 Elba was a protected cruiser of the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) . She was the fifth of six Regioni @-@ class ships , all of which were named for regions of Italy , with the exception of Elba , which was named for the island . Elba was built by the Regio Cantieri di Castellammare di Stabia ; her keel was laid in September 1890 , she was launched in August 1893 , and she was commissioned in February 1896 . The ship was equipped with a main armament of four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) and six 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns , and she could steam at a speed of nearly 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Elba spent much of her career abroad . She participated in the blockade of Venezuela during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902 – 03 and was present in East Asia during the Russo @-@ Japanese War in 1904 – 05 . In February 1904 , her crew witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay between Japanese and Russian warships ; after the battle ended in Russian defeat , Elba and British and French cruisers picked up survivors . She took part in the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 – 12 but saw no action , being used primarily to blockade Turkish ports in the Red Sea . In 1914 , Elba was converted into the first seaplane tender of the Regia Marina , with equipment to handle three seaplanes . This service did not last long , however , as she was too small and too old . Decommissioned by 1916 , the old warship was sold for scrap in January 1920 and broken up . 
 = = Design = = 
 Elba was slightly larger than her sister ships . She was 88 @.@ 2 meters ( 289 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 72 m ( 41 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 86 m ( 15 @.@ 9 ft ) . She displaced up to 3 @,@ 110 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 060 long tons ; 3 @,@ 430 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple @-@ expansion engines , with steam supplied by four cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers . On her speed trials , she reached a maximum of 17 @.@ 9 knots ( 33 @.@ 2 km / h ; 20 @.@ 6 mph ) at 7 @,@ 471 indicated horsepower ( 5 @,@ 571 kW ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 2 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ; 2 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 213 – 278 . Also unlike her sisters , she had a copper @-@ sheathed hull , which reduced fouling during lengthy periods between dockyard maintenance . 
 Elba was armed with a main battery of four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 40 guns mounted singly , with two side by side forward and two side by side aft . Six 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 40 guns were placed between them , with three on each broadside . Light armament included ten 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns , six 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and a pair of machine guns . She was also equipped with two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . Elba was protected by a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick deck , and her conning tower had 50 mm thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for Elba was laid down at the Regio Cantieri di Castellammare di Stabia in the eponymous city on 22 September 1890 . Her completed hull was launched on 12 August 1893 , and fitting @-@ out work proceeded at a leisurely pace . Elba was finally ready for service on 27 February 1896 . Elba was stationed in East Asian waters in 1899 , along with the armored cruiser Marco Polo and the old sail cruiser Amerigo Vespucci . In 1901 she was replaced by her sister Lombardia and returned to Italy . Elba was sent to Venezuelan waters in 1902 during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902 – 03 , when an international force of British , German , and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country 's refusal to pay foreign debts . Elba was joined by the protected cruiser Giovanni Bausan and the armored cruiser Carlo Alberto . 
 Elba was present , along with the British cruiser HMS Talbot , the French cruiser Pascal , and the United States ' gunboat USS Vicksburg during the Battle of Chemulpo Bay on 9 February 1904 during the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Elba , Talbot , and Pascal cleared for action in the event that the Japanese warships opened fire on them . After the battle ended in a Russian defeat , the three cruisers sent boats to pick up the survivors from the sinking cruiser Varyag and gunboat Korietz . Elba took off a total of 6 officers and 172 enlisted men from the two vessels , out of a total of 27 officers and 654 enlisted saved from the ships . Elba thereafter went to Seoul to protect the Italian embassy there . On 24 February , the cruiser Piemonte arrived to relieve Elba . The latter ship departed the following morning for Hong Kong , where she would deposit the Russian sailors . It was not until 10 March , however , that a French mail ship was available for Elba to discharge her passengers for their return trip to Europe . 
 Starting in October 1907 , Elba was modified to handle an observation balloon . The balloon was linked to the ship via a telephone line , and was used to spot naval mines . During the annual fleet maneuvers in 1908 , Elba and her balloon were used to keep watch on the harbor entrance of Augusta , Sicily , which proved to be effective in alerting defenders to attacking warships . By the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in September 1911 , Elba had been stationed in Italy 's East African colonies , Eritrea and Somaliland . In January 1912 , she and her sister Liguria escorted a pair of mail steamships to the Red Sea , where they were used to enforce the blockade of several Ottoman ports . Elba remained in the region for the remainder of the war , assisting in the blockade effort . Ottoman naval forces had already been defeated at the Battle of Kunfuda Bay , so there was no chance for Elba to see action . The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October , ending the war . 
 Elba operated the observation balloon through 1913 . The following year , she was modified to serve as a depot ship for three seaplanes , and she entered service in this new role on 4 June 1914 . During this period she operated Nieuport IV seaplanes . She was the first dedicated seaplane tender of the Italian navy , though seaplanes had already been operated aboard several battleships and cruisers . Elba was nevertheless too small and too old for her intended role , and she was retired in 1916 . She remained in the Italian inventory until 4 January 1920 , when she was sold for scrap . 
 = The Hawking Excitation = 
 " The Hawking Excitation " is the 21st episode of the fifth season of The Big Bang Theory that first aired on CBS on April 5 , 2012 . It is the 108th episode overall . After learning that Stephen Hawking is coming to lecture at Caltech , Howard ( Simon Helberg ) is hired to maintain his wheelchair equipment . When Sheldon ( Jim Parsons ) discovers this , he is desperate to meet Hawking . Howard says he can , but only if he completes a humiliating series of tasks . 
 The final scene of the episode features a short cameo appearance by cosmologist Stephen Hawking . Hawking was revealed to appear on the show in March 2012 ; he was the third high @-@ profile guest star in season 5 . The episode had 13 @.@ 29 million viewers in America and garnered mixed reviews . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Raj ( Kunal Nayyar ) and Leonard ( Johnny Galecki ) are at lunch with Howard when he gets an e @-@ mail from Stephen Hawking 's office ; Hawking is coming to lecture at Caltech and needs an engineer to help maintain his wheelchair equipment . Sheldon is a big fan of Hawking , so Howard considers bringing Sheldon along to meet Hawking . Sheldon then arrives and says that he has revolutionized understanding of the Higgs boson particle ; he explains it to Raj and Leonard but ignores Howard , thinking he wouldn 't understand . 
 Howard , feeling insulted , refuses to introduce Sheldon to Hawking even after Sheldon pleads . The next day , Howard talks about his work with Hawking to frustrate Sheldon . After Sheldon begs , Howard agrees to give Sheldon 's paper on the Higgs boson to Hawking on the condition that Sheldon performs several tasks for him . 
 The first task is to polish Howard 's belt buckles . Howard tends to stand too close to the urinal and urine often splashes back onto the buckles . Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean . Sheldon performs the task flawlessly . For his second task , Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette ( Melissa Rauch ) . Sheldon is seen in the cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him . 
 When Penny ( Kaley Cuoco ) goes to do her laundry , she finds Sheldon washing Howard 's panties . Sheldon explains that he is being punished for being , according to Howard , a " condescending jerk " , and asks Penny if she thinks he is condescending . Penny agrees with Howard . 
 Howard shows Bernadette a picture of Sheldon wearing the French maid costume . She thinks Howard is being too cruel and says that Sheldon is unaware of how mean he is . Howard agrees to stop making Sheldon perform tasks . Howard 's mother interrupts to remind Bernadette that they made plans to go dress shopping ; Bernadette says that she cannot make it , but that Sheldon will accompany her instead . Sheldon is forced to go shopping with Mrs. Wolowitz . 
 Sheldon 's final task is to give Howard a compliment about his work : he says that Howard is good at his job , although Sheldon does not consider his work to be " worth doing " . Howard reveals that he gave Hawking the paper three days ago . Sheldon finally gets to meet Hawking in person . When they meet , Hawking points out an arithmetic error in Sheldon 's paper that makes the whole paper incorrect : at this , a shocked Sheldon faints .

 Hawking had been asked to appear on the show previously but was too ill to do so . Bill Prady stated that Stephen Hawking was always their " dream guest star " for the show , but that Hawking appearing was " a long shot of astronomical proportions " . Hawking is a fan of The Big Bang Theory and requested to watch a rehearsal of the episode after filming his scene . Simon Helberg , who plays Howard , does an impression of Hawking 's voice in the episode ; he felt slightly uncomfortable mimicking Hawking , but Hawking seemed to enjoy the impression . 
 Hawking is the third high @-@ profile guest star to appear in season 5 , after Mike Massimino and Leonard Nimoy . Hawking later appeared in the season 6 episode " The Extract Obliteration " , the season 7 episode " The Relationship <unk> " and the season 8 episode " The Troll Manifestation " , but in these episodes only his voice is heard . Hawking was shown in a pre @-@ recorded video segment at the Big Bang Theory panel at Comic @-@ Con 2013 . He apologized for not being there in person and sang the show 's theme tune .

 Achilles displaced 13 @,@ 550 long tons ( 13 @,@ 770 t ) as built and 14 @,@ 500 long tons ( 14 @,@ 700 t ) fully loaded .

She was powered by four @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 23 @,@ 650 indicated horsepower ( 17 @,@ 640 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 23 @.@ 3 knots ( 43 @.@ 2 km / h ; 26 @.@ 8 mph ) . The engines were powered by 19 Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers and six cylindrical boilers . The ship carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 050 long tons ( 2 @,@ 080 t ) of coal and an additional 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 7 @,@ 960 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 740 km ; 9 @,@ 160 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Her main armament consisted of six BL 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 234 mm ) Mark X guns in single Mk V turrets distributed in two centerline turrets ( one each fore and one aft ) and four turrets disposed in the corners about the funnels . Her secondary armament of four BL 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 191 mm ) Mark II or Mark V guns in single Mk II turrets was carried amidships , between the wing 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch guns . Twenty @-@ six Vickers QF 3 @-@ pounders were fitted , ten on turret roofs and eight each on the forward and aft superstructures . The last four ships of the Duke of Edinburgh @-@ class cruisers had a secondary armament of turreted 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns rather than the 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns in open barbettes of the first two ships ; these latter four were sometimes referred to as the Warrior class . Because of the extra topweight of the turrets in comparison to their half @-@ sisters their stability was reduced which made them very good seaboats and steady gun platforms because they did not roll as much . The ship also mounted three submerged 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes , one of which was mounted in the stern . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 A single Hotchkiss QF 6 @-@ pounder anti @-@ aircraft gun on a high @-@ angle Mark Ic mounting was mounted on the quarterdeck in 1915 . It had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . The gun fired a 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . They had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . Achilles 's foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire @-@ control director after the Battle of Jutland in 1916 , but when the director was actually fitted is not known . 
 = = Service = = 
 Achilles was ordered as part of the 1903 – 04 naval construction programme as the third of four armoured cruisers . She was laid down on 22 February 1904 at Elswick by Armstrong Whitworth . The ship was launched on 17 June 1905 and completed on 22 April 1907 at the cost of £ 1 @,@ 191 @,@ 103 . Like her sister ships , she joined the 5th Cruiser Squadron in 1907 , and made a port visit to Russia in 1908 . The ship was later transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1909 . Achilles , accompanied by her sister Cochrane , and three other armoured cruisers were sent to reinforce the defences of the Shetland Islands on 2 August 1914 , days before the start of the First World War . She , and her squadron , was assigned to the Grand Fleet after the beginning of the war . 
 Achilles missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 because she was refitting . On the evening of 18 August , the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet , minus the II Battle Squadron , would be leaving harbour that night . The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August , with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines . The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship , which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt . Realising their mistake , the Germans then set course for home . During the Grand Fleet 's sortie , Achilles spotted a U @-@ boat . During another sortie by the High Seas Fleet on 18 October 1916 , Achilles and three other armoured cruisers were ordered to patrol the northern end of the North Sea , between the approaches to Pentland Firth and Hardangerfjord in Norway , but they saw no German ships . 
 On 16 March 1917 , Achilles and the armed boarding steamer Dundee were patrolling north of the Shetland Islands when they encountered the disguised German auxiliary cruiser Leopard . The latter ship heaved to when commanded , but manoeuvred to prevent Dundee from boarding her and then fired two torpedoes which missed . Dundee retaliated by raking Leopard 's stern , badly damaging the German ship and then Achilles opened fire herself . The German ship sank an hour later with no survivors . Achilles was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties , but returned to Britain for a refit between February and December 1918 . Upon completion of this refit Achilles became a stoker 's training ship at Chatham . The ship was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 . 
 = HMS Hesperus ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Hesperus was an H @-@ class destroyer that had originally been ordered by the Brazilian Navy with the name <unk> in the late 1930s , but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939 and later renamed . She was damaged by German aircraft during the Norwegian Campaign in May 1940 and was assigned to convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine patrols after her repairs were completed . The ship was assigned to the Western Approaches Command for convoy escort duties in late 1940 . She was briefly assigned to Force H in 1941 , but her anti @-@ aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force the next month for escort duties in the North Atlantic . Hesperus was transferred to the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force in late 1941 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the next three years . She was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1943 after suffering damage from one of her two ramming attacks that sank German submarines . The ship sank two other submarines during the war by more conventional means . After the end of the war , Hesperus escorted the ships carrying the Norwegian government in exile back to Norway and served as a target ship through mid @-@ 1946 . She was scrapped beginning in mid @-@ 1947 .

 Hesperus displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Hesperus carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 152 officers and enlisted men . 
 The vessel was designed for four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear , but ' Y ' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Hesperus had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted , but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting @-@ out . The ship 's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well . 
 Hesperus was completed without a director @-@ control tower ( DCT ) so the three remaining 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch low @-@ angle guns fired in local control using ranges provided by a rangefinder . She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Hesperus had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun while under repair in May – June 1940 . The ship received a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast and a Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar during her mid @-@ 1941 refit . While under repair at Immingham , she received her DCT . During her early 1942 refit at Falmouth , Cornwall , the ship 's short @-@ range AA armament was augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm guns on the wings of the ship 's bridge . In addition , her recently installed DCT and rangefinder above the bridge were replaced by a Type 271 target indication radar . Whilst under repair in early 1943 , the ship was converted to an escort destroyer . ' A ' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar and the .50 @-@ calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons . Additional depth charge stowage replaced the 12 @-@ pounder high @-@ angle gun and Hesperus received the one @-@ ton Mk X depth charge and four Mk IV depth @-@ charge throwers during the same refit . Hesperus was also fitted with the <unk> acoustic decoy to protect her against German acoustically guided torpedoes .

 She was originally ordered as <unk> on 16 December 1937 by the Brazilian Navy . The ship was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company at Woolston , Hampshire on 6 July 1938 and launched by Senhora <unk> <unk> on 1 August 1939 . The ship was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of World War II . Renamed HMS Hearty , the ship was commissioned on 22 January 1940 under command of former Fleet Air Arm pilot Commander Donald Macintyre . Hearty was renamed Hesperus on 27 February , after the Hesperus of mythology , to avoid confusion with the destroyer Hardy . 
 The six Brazilian H @-@ class or Havant @-@ class destroyers initially formed the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet assigned to anti @-@ submarine protection of Scapa Flow . Upon the German occupation of Denmark , Hesperus and her sister Havant were assigned to cover the British occupation of the Faroe Islands in mid @-@ April . During the Norwegian Campaign , Hesperus transported elements of the Scots Guards to Mo i Rana on 15 May and was damaged by near misses from Junkers Ju @-@ 87 dive @-@ bombers that same day . The ship was sent to Dundee for repairs that lasted a month . Upon their completion , the ship was assigned to convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine patrol duties . 
 In November 1940 , the 9th Destroyer Flotilla was transferred to the Western Approaches Command and re @-@ designated the 9th Escort Group . During a tropical storm in January 1941 , the platform on which ' B ' gun was mounted was lifted until the gun pressed against the bridge . After repairs , she resumed her convoy escort duties until April when she was assigned to Force H in Gibraltar whilst Macintyre transferred to the destroyer Walker in March . Hesperus escorted ships during Operations Tiger and Tracer in May and June . Hesperus was transferred out of Force H as her anti @-@ aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak for operations in the Mediterranean . She received a brief refit in Liverpool and was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force on 7 July . 
 In August 1941 , Hesperus was one of the destroyers that escorted the battleship Prince of Wales carrying Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Atlantic Charter meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Placentia Bay . The ship was structurally damaged by heavy weather and was temporarily repaired by a repair ship in Iceland and then was given permanent repairs at Immingham . Upon their completion Hesperus rejoined the 9th Escort Group before she was attached to Force H in December for convoy duties at Gibraltar . 
 Together with her sister Harvester , Hesperus sank the German submarine U @-@ 208 on 7 December 1941 in the Atlantic west of Gibraltar . On 15 January 1942 , whilst defending Convoy HG 78 , the ship 's radar detected U @-@ 93 on the surface and the captain , Lieutenant Commander A. A. Tait , ordered Hesperus to ram . Although a glancing hit , the collision was so violent that it flung the U @-@ boat 's captain and first lieutenant from the submarine 's conning tower into the motorboat stowed on the destroyer 's deck . By dropping depth charges at their shallowest setting and hitting the submarine multiple times with 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch shells , the submarine 's crew was persuaded to abandon ship . Hesperus rescued 40 of the submarine 's crew , but was unable to board the submarine before it sank . The impact flooded part of the forward hull , buckled her starboard hull plating and bent the tips of her starboard propeller . She received temporary repairs at Gibraltar and then was given permanent repairs in Falmouth between 9 February and April . 
 In March 1942 , the remaining five Havant @-@ class destroyers were designated leaders of Escort Groups B @-@ 1 through B @-@ 5 . Commander Tait was transferred to Harvester ; and Commander <unk> Orpen assumed command of Hesperus and B @-@ 2 Escort Group when Hesperus completed repairs in April . Commander Macintyre returned to the ship when Orpen was promoted to captain in June . Whilst escorting Convoy HX 219 near Rockall on 26 December , Hesperus and the destroyer Vanessa sank the German submarine U @-@ 357 by ramming . This time , the ship 's bottom was ripped open for nearly a quarter of her length and she needed three months of repairs in Liverpool . 
 The ship rejoined her group on 17 March and sank U @-@ 191 with her Hedgehog on 23 April 1943 whilst escorting Convoy ONS 4 . Almost three weeks later , she sank U @-@ 186 whilst defending convoy SC 129 on 12 May 1943 . Hesperus remained on convoy escort duties until she was refitted between January and 29 March 1944 . Commander <unk> <unk> assumed command of Hesperus in March 1944 and the group escorted convoys between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom . In July 1944 , the ship transported the remains of Captain Frederic John Walker for burial at sea . Later that year , she was transferred to the 19th Escort Group . In January 1945 , Commander R.A. Currie assumed command of Hesperus as commander of the 14th Escort Group , based in Plymouth . On 30 April 1945 , the ship , together with her sister Havelock , attacked the wreck of U @-@ 246 northwest of the island of Anglesey thinking that it was U @-@ 242 which had been spotted by a Short Sunderland flying boat earlier that day . 
 Two weeks later , Hesperus and the 14th Escort Group escorted a group of surrendered German U @-@ boats from Loch Alsh to Lough Foyle . On 27 May , the ship and her sister Havelock escorted the exiled Norwegian government back to Oslo and remained there until 1 June . Ten days later , she began service as an aircraft target , a role that lasted for the next year . Hesperus was approved for scrapping on 18 February 1946 and was placed in Category C reserve in May . She was towed to Grangemouth for scrapping , but that did not begin until 17 May 1947 . Hesperus 's ensign was preserved in Yeovil Parish Church . 
 = Bold Orion = 
 The Bold Orion missile , also known as Weapons System 199B ( WS @-@ 199B ) , was a prototype air @-@ launched ballistic missile ( ALBM ) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s . Developed in both one- and two @-@ stage designs , the missile was moderately successful in testing , and helped pave the way for development of the GAM @-@ 87 Skybolt ALBM . In addition , the Bold Orion was used in early anti @-@ satellite weapons testing , performing the first interception of a satellite by a missile . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The Bold Orion missile was developed as part of Weapons System 199 , initiated by the United States Air Force ( USAF ) in response to the U.S. Navy 's Polaris program , with funding authorised by the United States Congress in 1957 . The purpose of WS @-@ 199 was the development of technology that would be used in new strategic weapons for the USAF 's Strategic Air Command , not to deliver operational weapons ; a primary emphasis was on proving the feasibility of an air @-@ launched ballistic missile . 
 The designation WS @-@ 199B was assigned to the project that , under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft , would become the Bold Orion missile . The design of Bold Orion was simple , using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce the cost and development time of the project . The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single @-@ stage vehicle , using a Thiokol TX @-@ 20 Sergeant solid @-@ fuel rocket . Following initial testing , the Bold Orion configuration was altered to become a two @-@ stage vehicle , an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage being added to the missile .

 Having been given top priority by the Air Force , the first flight test of the Bold Orion missile was conducted on May 26 , 1958 , from a Boeing B @-@ 47 Stratojet carrier aircraft , which launched the Bold Orion vehicle at the apex of a high @-@ speed , high @-@ angle climb . The zoom climb tactic , combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself , allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range , or , alternatively , to reach space . 
 A twelve @-@ flight test series of the Bold Orion vehicle was conducted ; however , despite suffering only one outright failure , the initial flight tests of the single @-@ stage rocket proved less successful than hoped . Authorisation was received to modify the Bold Orion to become a two @-@ stage vehicle ; in addition to the modifications improving the missile 's reliability , they increased the range of Bold Orion to over 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) . Four of the final six test firings were of the two @-@ stage vehicle ; these were considered completely successful , and established that the ALBM was a viable weapon .

 The final test launch of Bold Orion , conducted on October 13 , 1959 , was a test of the vehicle 's capabilities in the anti @-@ satellite role .

Had the missile been fitted with a nuclear warhead , the satellite would have been destroyed . 
 The Bold Orion ASAT test was the first interception of a satellite by any method , proving that anti @-@ satellite missiles were feasible . However this test , along with an earlier , unsuccessful test of the High Virgo missile in the anti @-@ satellite role , had political repercussions ; the Eisenhower administration sought to establish space as a neutral ground for everyone 's usage , and the " indication of hostile intent " the tests were seen to give was frowned upon , with anti @-@ satellite weapons development being curtailed shortly thereafter .

 = Vasa ( ship ) = 
 Vasa ( or Wasa ) is a Swedish warship built between 1626 and 1628 . The ship foundered and sank after sailing about 1 @,@ 300 m ( 1 @,@ 400 yd ) into her maiden voyage on 10 August 1628 . She fell into obscurity after most of her valuable bronze cannons were salvaged in the 17th century until she was located again in the late 1950s in a busy shipping lane just outside the Stockholm harbor . <unk> with a largely intact hull in 1961 , she was housed in a temporary museum called <unk> ( " The Wasa Shipyard " ) until 1988 and then moved to the Vasa Museum in Stockholm . The ship is one of Sweden 's most popular tourist attractions and has been seen by over 29 million visitors since 1961 . Since her recovery , Vasa has become a widely recognized symbol of the Swedish " great power period " and is today a de facto standard in the media and among Swedes for evaluating the historical importance of shipwrecks . 
 The ship was built on the orders of the King of Sweden Gustavus Adolphus as part of the military expansion he initiated in a war with Poland @-@ Lithuania ( 1621 – 1629 ) . She was constructed at the navy yard in Stockholm under a contract with private entrepreneurs in 1626 – 1627 and armed primarily with bronze cannons cast in Stockholm specifically for the ship . Richly decorated as a symbol of the king 's ambitions for Sweden and himself , upon completion she was one of the most powerfully armed vessels in the world . However , Vasa was dangerously unstable and top @-@ heavy with too much weight in the upper structure of the hull . Despite this lack of stability she was ordered to sea and foundered only a few minutes after encountering a wind stronger than a breeze . 
 The order to sail was the result of a combination of factors . The king , who was leading the army in Poland at the time of her maiden voyage , was impatient to see her take up her station as flagship of the reserve squadron at Älvsnabben in the Stockholm Archipelago . At the same time the king 's subordinates lacked the political courage to openly discuss the ship 's structural problems or to have the maiden voyage postponed . An inquiry was organized by the Swedish Privy Council to find those responsible for the disaster , but in the end no one was punished for the fiasco . 
 During the 1961 recovery , thousands of artifacts and the remains of at least 15 people were found in and around the Vasa 's hull by marine archaeologists . Among the many items found were clothing , weapons , cannons , tools , coins , cutlery , food , drink and six of the ten sails . The artifacts and the ship herself have provided scholars with invaluable insights into details of naval warfare , shipbuilding techniques and everyday life in early 17th @-@ century Sweden . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 During the 17th century , Sweden went from being a sparsely populated , poor , and peripheral northern European kingdom of little influence to one of the major powers in continental politics . Between 1611 and 1718 it was the dominant power in the Baltic , eventually gaining territory that encompassed the Baltic on all sides . This rise to prominence in international affairs and increase in military prowess , called <unk> ( " age of greatness " or " great power period " ) , was made possible by a succession of able monarchs and the establishment of a powerful centralized government , supporting a highly efficient military organization . Swedish historians have described this as one of the more extreme examples of an early modern state using almost all of its available resources to wage war ; the small northern kingdom transformed itself into a fiscal @-@ military state and one of the most militarized states in history . 
 Gustavus Adolphus ( 1594 – 1632 ) has been considered one of the most successful Swedish kings in terms of success in warfare . When Vasa was built , he had been in power for more than a decade . Sweden was embroiled in a war with Poland @-@ Lithuania , and looked apprehensively at the development of the Thirty Years ' War in present @-@ day Germany . The war had been raging since 1618 and from a Protestant perspective it was not successful . The king 's plans for a Polish campaign and for securing Sweden 's interests required a strong naval presence in the Baltic . 
 The navy suffered several severe setbacks during the 1620s . In 1625 , a squadron cruising in the Bay of Riga was caught in a storm and ten ships ran aground and were wrecked . In the Battle of Oliwa in 1627 , a Swedish squadron was outmaneuvered and defeated by a Polish force and two large ships were lost . <unk> ( " The Tiger " ) , which was the Swedish admiral 's flagship , was captured by the Poles , and Solen ( " The Sun " ) was blown up by her own crew when she was boarded and near capture . In 1628 , three more large ships were lost in less than a month ; Admiral Klas Fleming 's flagship Kristina was wrecked in a storm in the Gulf of Danzig , <unk> ( " Key of the Realm " ) ran aground at <unk> in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and Vasa foundered on her maiden voyage . Gustavus Adolphus was engaged in naval warfare on several fronts , which further exacerbated the difficulties of the navy . In addition to battling the Polish navy , the Swedes were indirectly threatened by Imperial forces that had invaded Jutland . The Swedish king had little sympathy for the Danish king , Christian IV , and Denmark and Sweden had been bitter enemies for well over a century . However , Sweden feared a Catholic conquest of Copenhagen and Zealand . This would have granted the Catholic powers control over the strategic passages between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea , which would be disastrous for Swedish interests . As it turned out , the Imperial occupation of Denmark ended before Swedish intervention was necessary , and a squadron assigned to assist Denmark was <unk> to help lift the Imperial siege of Stralsund . 
 Until the early 17th century , the Swedish navy was composed primarily of small to medium @-@ sized ships with a single gundeck , normally armed with 12 @-@ pounder and smaller cannons ; these ships were cheaper than larger ships and were well @-@ suited for escort and patrol . They also suited the prevailing tactical thinking within the navy , which emphasized boarding as the decisive moment in a naval battle rather than gunnery . The king , who was a keen artillerist , saw the potential of ships as gun platforms , and large , heavily armed ships made a more dramatic statement in the political theater of naval power . Beginning with Vasa , he ordered a series of ships with two full gundecks , outfitted with much heavier guns . Five such ships were built after Vasa ( Äpplet , Kronan , Scepter and Göta Ark ) before the Privy Council cancelled the orders for the others after the king 's death in 1632 . These ships , especially Kronan and Scepter , were much more successful and served as flagships in the Swedish navy until the 1660s . The second of the so @-@ called <unk> ( usually translated as " royal ships " ) , Äpplet ( " The Apple " ; the Swedish term for the globus <unk> ) , was built simultaneously with Vasa . The only significant difference between the design of Vasa and her sister ship was an increase in width of about a meter ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In the early 1620s , work at the Stockholm navy yard was led by a pair of Dutch @-@ born entrepreneurs , Antonius Monier and master shipwright Henrik Hybertsson , who was usually referred to as " Master Henrik " . When a new contract for operation of the navy yard was negotiated in the winter of 1624 – 1625 , Monier withdrew and Master Henrik took on a young merchant from Amsterdam , Arendt de Groote , as partner . On 16 January 1625 , Henrik and Arendt signed a contract to build four ships , two larger with a keel length of 128 feet ( 38 m ) and two smaller , with dimensions to match the earlier ship Gustavus . 
 Master Henrik and Arendt de Groote began buying the raw materials needed for the first ships in 1625 , purchasing timber from individual estates in Sweden as well as buying rough @-@ sawn planking in Riga , Königsberg ( modern Kaliningrad ) , and Amsterdam . As they prepared to begin the first of the new ships in the autumn of 1625 , Henrik corresponded with the king through the Vice Admiral Fleming about which ship to build first . The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga led the king to propose building two ships of a new , medium size as a quick compromise , and he sent a specification for this , a ship which would be 120 feet ( 35 @.@ 6 m ) long on the keel . Henrik declined , since he had already cut the timber for a large and a small ship . He laid the keel for a larger ship in late February or early March 1626 . Master Henrik never saw Vasa completed ; he fell ill in late 1625 , and by the summer of 1626 he had handed over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright , Henrik " Hein " Jacobsson . He died in the spring of 1627 , probably about the same time as the ship was launched . 
 After launching , work continued on finishing the upper deck , the sterncastle , the beakhead and the rigging . Sweden had still not developed a sizeable sailcloth industry , and material had to be ordered from abroad . In the contract for the maintenance of rigging , French sailcloth was specified , but the cloth for the sails of Vasa most likely came from Holland . The sails were made mostly of hemp and partly of flax . The rigging was made entirely of hemp imported from Latvia through Riga . The king visited the shipyard in January 1628 and made what was probably his only visit aboard the ship . 
 In the summer of 1628 , the captain responsible for supervising construction of the ship , Söfring Hansson , arranged for the ship 's stability to be demonstrated for the Vice Admiral responsible for procurement , Klas Fleming , who had recently arrived in Stockholm from Prussia . Thirty men ran back and forth across the upper deck to start the ship rolling , but the admiral stopped the test after they had made only three trips , as he feared the ship would capsize . According to testimony by the ship 's master , Göran Mattson , Fleming remarked that he wished the king were at home . Gustavus Adolphus had been sending a steady stream of letters insisting that the ship put to sea as soon as possible . 
 There has been much speculation about whether Vasa was lengthened during construction and whether an additional gun deck was added late during the build . Little evidence suggests that Vasa was substantially modified after the keel was laid . Ships contemporary to Vasa that were elongated were cut in half and new timbers spliced between the existing sections , making the addition readily identifiable , but no such addition can be identified in the hull , nor is there any evidence for any late additions of a second gundeck . The king ordered 72 24 @-@ pound cannons for the ship on 5 August 1626 , and this was too many to fit on a single gun deck . Since the king 's order was issued less than five months after construction started , it would have come early enough for the second deck to be included in the design . The French Galion du Guise , the ship used as a model for Vasa , according to Arendt de Groote , also had two gun decks . Laser measurements of Vasa 's structure conducted in 2007 – 2011 confirmed that no major changes were implemented during construction , but that the center of gravity was too high . 
 Vasa was an early example of a warship with two full gun decks , and was built when the theoretical principles of shipbuilding were still poorly understood . There is no evidence that Henrik Hybertsson had ever built a ship like it before , and two gundecks is a much more complicated compromise in seaworthiness and firepower than a single gundeck . Safety margins at the time were also far below anything that would be acceptable today . Combined with the fact that 17th @-@ century warships were built with intentionally high superstructures ( to be used as firing platforms ) , this made Vasa a risky undertaking . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Vasa was built during a time of transition in naval tactics , from an era when boarding was still one of the primary ways of fighting enemy ships to an era of the strictly organized ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and a focus on victory through superior gunnery . Vasa was armed with powerful guns and built with a high stern , which would act as a firing platform in boarding actions for some of the 300 soldiers she was supposed to carry , but the high @-@ sided hull and narrow upper deck were not optimized for boarding . She was neither the largest ship ever built , nor the one carrying the greatest number of guns . What made her arguably the most powerful warship of the time was the combined weight of shot that could be fired from the cannon of one side : 588 pounds ( 267 kg ) , excluding <unk> , guns used for firing anti @-@ personnel ammunition instead of solid shot . This was the largest concentration of artillery in a single warship in the Baltic at the time , perhaps in all of northern Europe , and it was not until the 1630s that a ship with more firepower was built . This large amount of naval artillery was placed on a ship that was quite small relative to the armament carried . By comparison , USS Constitution , a famous Napoleonic era frigate built 169 years after Vasa , had roughly the same firepower , but was over 700 tonnes heavier . 
 The Constitution , however , belonged to a later era of naval warfare that employed the line of battle @-@ tactic , where ships fought in single file ( or line ahead ) while the group as a whole attempted to present the batteries of one side toward the enemy . The guns would be aimed in the same direction and fire could be concentrated on a single target . In the 17th century , tactics involving organized formations of large fleets had still not been developed . Rather , ships would fight individually or in small improvised groups , and focused on boarding . Vasa , though possessing a formidable battery , was built with these tactics in mind , and therefore lacked a unified broadside with guns that were all aimed in roughly the same direction . Rather , the guns were intended to be fired independently and were arranged according to the curvature of the hull , meaning that the ship would be bristled with artillery in all directions , covering virtually all angles . 
 Naval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy . Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship . Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of , while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years . In Sweden and many other European countries , a ship would normally not " own " its guns , but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season . Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size . What allowed Vasa to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship , but also that the 46 main 24 @-@ pounder guns were of a new and standardized lightweight design , cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm , under the direction of the Swiss @-@ born founder <unk> <unk> . Two additional 24 @-@ pounders , of a heavier and older design , were mounted in the bows , the so @-@ called bow chasers . Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern , but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships , and Vasa waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament . When the ship sailed in August 1628 , eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered . All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused , but Vasa 's guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimeters , and their bores were almost exactly 146 mm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) . The remaining armament of Vasa consisted of eight 3 @-@ pounders , six large caliber <unk> ( similar to what the English called howitzers ) for use during boarding actions , and two 1 @-@ pound <unk> . Also included on board were 894 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 970 lb ) of gunpowder and over 1000 shot of various types for the guns . 
 = = = Ornamentation = = = 
 As was the custom with warships at the time , Vasa was decorated with sculptures intended to glorify the authority , wisdom and martial prowess of the monarch and also to deride , taunt and intimidate the enemy . The sculptures made up a considerable part of the effort and cost of building the ship . The symbolism used in decorating the ship was mostly based on the Renaissance idealization of Roman and Greek antiquity , which had been imported from Italy through German and Dutch artists . Imagery borrowed from Mediterranean antiquity dominates the motifs , but also include figures from the Old Testament and even a few from ancient Egypt . Many of the figures are in Dutch grotesque style , depicting fantastic and frightening creatures , including mermaids , wild men , sea monsters and tritons . The decoration inside the ship is much sparser and is largely confined to the steerage and the great cabin , at the after end of the upper gundeck . 
 Residues of paint have been found on many sculptures and on other parts of the ship . The entire ornamentation was once painted in vivid colors . The sides of the beakhead ( the protruding structure below the bowsprit ) , the bulwarks ( the protective railing around the weather deck ) , the roofs of the quarter galleries , and the background of the transom ( the flat surface at the stern of the ship ) were all painted red , while the sculptures were decorated in bright colors , and the dazzling effect of these was in some places emphasized with gold leaf . Previously , it was believed that the background color had been blue and that all sculptures had been almost entirely gilded , and this is reflected in many paintings of Vasa from the 1970s to the early ' 90s , such as the lively and dramatic drawings of Björn <unk> or the painting by Francis <unk> . In the late 1990s , this view was revised and the colors are properly reflected in more recent reproductions of the ship 's decoration by maritime painter Tim Thompson and the 1 : 10 scale model in the museum . Vasa is an example not so much of the heavily gilded sculptures of early Baroque art but rather " the last gasps of the medieval sculpture tradition " with its fondness for gaudy colors , in a style that today would be considered extravagant or even vulgar . 
 The sculptures are carved out of oak , pine or linden , and many of the larger pieces , like the huge 3 @-@ meter ( 10 ft ) long figurehead lion , consist of several parts carved individually and fitted together with bolts . Close to 500 sculptures , most of which are concentrated on the high stern and its galleries and on the beakhead , are found on the ship . The figure of Hercules appears as a pair of pendants , one younger and one older , on each side of the lower stern galleries ; the pendants depict opposite aspects of the ancient hero , who was extremely popular during antiquity as well as in 17th @-@ century European art . On the transom are biblical and nationalistic symbols and images . A particularly popular motif is the lion , which can be found as the <unk> originally fitted on the insides of the gunport doors , grasping the royal coat of arms on either side , the figurehead , and even clinging to the top of the rudder . Each side of the beakhead originally had 20 figures ( though only 19 have actually been found ) that depicted Roman emperors from Tiberius to Septimius Severus . Overall , almost all heroic and positive imagery is directly or indirectly identified with the king and was originally intended to glorify him as a wise and powerful ruler . The only actual portrait of the king , however , is located at the very top of the transom in the stern . Here he is depicted as a young boy with long , flowing hair , being crowned by two griffins representing the king 's father , Charles IX . 
 A team of at least six expert sculptors worked for a minimum of two years on the sculptures , most likely with the assistance of an unknown number of apprentices and assistants . No direct credit for any of the sculptures has been provided , but the distinct style of one of the most senior artists , Mårten <unk> , is clearly identifiable . Other accomplished artists , like Hans <unk> , Johan <unk> <unk> ( or <unk> in Swedish ) and possibly Marcus <unk> , are known to have been employed for extensive work at the naval yards at the time Vasa was built , but their respective styles are not distinct enough to associate them directly with any specific sculptures . 
 The artistic quality of the sculptures varies considerably , and about four distinct styles can be identified . The only artist who has been positively associated with various sculptures is Mårten <unk> , whose style has been described as " powerful , lively and naturalistic " . He was responsible for a considerable number of the sculptures . These include some of the most important and prestigious pieces : the figurehead lion , the royal coat of arms , and the sculpture of the king at the top of the transom . Two of the other styles are described as " elegant ... a little stereotyped and <unk> " , and of a " heavy , leisurely but nevertheless rich and lively style " , respectively . The fourth and last style , deemed clearly inferior to the other three , is described as " stiff and ungainly " and was done by other carvers , perhaps even apprentices , of lesser skill . 
 = = Maiden voyage = = 
 On 10 August 1628 , Captain Söfring Hansson ordered Vasa to depart on her maiden voyage to the naval station at Älvsnabben . The day was calm , and the only wind was a light breeze from the southwest . The ship was warped along the eastern waterfront of the city to the southern side of the harbor , where four sails were set , and the ship made way to the east . The gun ports were open , and the guns were out to fire a salute as the ship left Stockholm . 
 As Vasa passed under the lee of the bluffs to the south ( what is now Södermalm ) , a gust of wind filled her sails , and she heeled suddenly to port . The sheets were cast off , and the ship slowly righted herself as the gust passed . At <unk> , where there is a gap in the bluffs , an even stronger gust again forced the ship onto its port side , this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface , allowing water to rush in onto the lower gundeck . The water building up on the deck quickly exceeded the ship 's minimal ability to right itself , and water continued to pour in until it ran down into the hold ; the ship quickly sank to a depth of 32 m ( 105 ft ) only 120 m ( 390 ft ) from shore . Survivors clung to debris or the upper masts , which were still above the surface , to save themselves , and many nearby boats rushed to their aid , but despite these efforts and the short distance to land , 30 people perished with the ship , according to reports . Vasa sank in full view of a crowd of hundreds , if not thousands , of mostly ordinary <unk> who had come to see the great ship set sail . The crowd included foreign ambassadors , in effect spies of Gustavus Adolphus ' allies and enemies , who also witnessed the catastrophe . 
 = = = Inquest = = = 
 The Council sent a letter to the king the day after the loss , telling him of the sinking , but it took over two weeks to reach him in Poland . " <unk> and negligence " must have been the cause , he wrote angrily in his reply , demanding in no uncertain terms that the guilty parties be punished . Captain Söfring Hansson , who survived the disaster , was immediately taken for questioning . Under initial interrogation , he swore that the guns had been properly secured and that the crew was sober . A full inquest before a tribunal of members of the Privy Council and Admiralty took place at the Royal Palace on 5 September 1628 . Each of the surviving officers was questioned as was the supervising shipwright and a number of expert witnesses . Also present at the inquest was the Admiral of the Realm , Carl Carlsson <unk> . The object of the inquest was as much or more to find a scapegoat as to find out why the ship had sunk . Whoever the committee might find guilty for the fiasco would face a severe penalty . 
 Surviving crew members were questioned one by one about the handling of the ship at the time of the disaster . Was it rigged properly for the wind ? Was the crew sober ? Was the ballast properly stowed ? Were the guns properly secured ? However , no one was prepared to take the blame . Crewmen and contractors formed two camps ; each tried to blame the other , and everyone swore he had done his duty without fault and it was during the inquest that the details of the stability demonstration were revealed . 
 Next , attention was directed to the shipbuilders . " Why did you build the ship so narrow , so badly and without enough bottom that it capsized ? " the prosecutor asked the shipwright Jacobsson . Jacobsson stated that he built the ship as directed by Henrik Hybertsson ( long since dead and buried ) , who in turn had followed the specification approved by the king . Jacobsson had in fact widened the ship by 1 foot 5 inches ( c . 42 cm ) after taking over responsibility for the construction , but construction of the ship was too far advanced to allow further widening . 
 In the end , no guilty party could be found . The answer Arendt de Groote gave when asked by the court why the ship sank was " Only God knows " . Gustavus Adolphus had approved all measurements and armaments , and the ship was built according to the instructions and loaded with the number of guns specified . In the end , no one was punished or found guilty for negligence , and the blame effectively fell on Henrik Hybertsson . 
 = = Vasa as a wreck = = 
 Less than three days after the disaster , a contract was signed for the ship to be raised . However , those efforts were unsuccessful . The earliest attempts at raising Vasa by English engineer Ian Bulmer , resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery . Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today , but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise Vasa more than 300 years later . Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck , and ropes attached to several anchors were sent down and hooked to the ship . The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe , the ropes tightened , and the water pumped out . The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters . The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level . Even if the underwater weight of Vasa was not great , the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome . More than 30 years after the ship 's sinking , in 1663 – 1665 , <unk> von <unk> and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns . With a simple diving bell , the team of Swedish and Finnish divers retrieved more than 50 of them . 
 Such activity waned when it became clear that the ship could not be raised by the technology of the time . However , Vasa did not fall completely into obscurity after the recovery of the guns . The ship was mentioned in several histories of Sweden and the Swedish Navy , and the location of the wreck appeared on harbor charts of Stockholm in the 19th century . In 1844 , the navy officer Anton Ludwig <unk> turned in a request for salvaging rights to the ship , claiming he had located it . <unk> was an inventor who designed an early form of light diving suit and had previously been involved in other salvage operations . There were dives made on the wreck in 1895 – 1896 , and a commercial salvage company applied for a permit to raise or salvage the wreck in 1920 , but this was turned down . In 1999 , a witness also claimed that his father , a petty officer in the Swedish navy , had taken part in diving exercises on Vasa in the years before World War I. There is no evidence that anyone visited the wreck site after this until the beginning of the modern Vasa project . 
 = = = Deterioration = = = 
 In the 333 years that Vasa lay on the bottom of Stockholm harbor ( called Stockholms ström , " the Stream " , in Swedish ) , the ship and its contents were subject to several destructive forces , first among which were decomposition and erosion . Among the first things to decompose were the thousands of iron bolts that held the beakhead and much of the sterncastle together , and this included all of the ship 's wooden sculptures . Almost all of the iron on the ship rusted away within a few years of the sinking , and only large objects , such as anchors , or items made of cast iron , such as cannonballs , survived . Organic materials fared better in the anaerobic conditions , and so wood , cloth and leather are often in very good condition , but objects exposed to the currents were eroded by the sediment in the water , so that some are barely recognizable . Objects which fell off the hull into the mud after the nails corroded through were well protected , so that many of the sculptures still retain areas of paint and gilding . Of the human remains , most of the soft tissue was quickly consumed by bacteria , fish and crustaceans , leaving only the bones , which were often held together only by clothing , although in one case , hair , nails and brain tissue survived . 
 The parts of the hull held together by joinery and wooden treenails remained intact for as much as two centuries , suffering gradual erosion of surfaces exposed to the water , unless they were disturbed by outside forces . Eventually the entire sterncastle , the high , aft portion of the ship that housed the officers ' quarters and held up the transom , gradually collapsed into the mud with all the decorative sculptures . The quarter galleries , which were merely nailed to the sides of the sterncastle , collapsed fairly quickly and were found lying almost directly below their original locations . 
 Human activity was the most destructive factor , as the initial salvage efforts , the recovery of the guns , and the final salvage in the 20th century all left their marks . Peckell and <unk> broke up and removed much of the planking of the weather deck to get to the cannons on the decks below . Peckell reported that he had recovered 30 cartloads of wood from the ship ; these might have included not just planking and structural details but also some of the sculptures which today are missing , such as the life @-@ size Roman warrior near the bow and the sculpture of Septimius Severus that adorned the port side of the beakhead . Since Vasa lay in a busy shipping channel , ships occasionally dropped anchor over the ship , and one large anchor demolished most of the upper sterncastle , probably in the 19th century . Construction work in Stockholm harbor usually results in blasting of bedrock , and the resulting tons of rubble were often dumped in the harbor ; some of this landed on the ship , causing further damage to the stern and the upper deck . 
 = = = Vasa rediscovered = = = 
 In the early 1950s , amateur archaeologist Anders Franzén considered the possibility of recovering wrecks from the cold brackish waters of the Baltic because , he reasoned , they were free from the shipworm Teredo <unk> , which usually destroys submerged wood rapidly in warmer , saltier seas . By 1953 , he was actively searching for Vasa , using a dragline and coring device to locate and test possible targets on the bottom of the harbor . He initially searched the southern side of the harbor , near <unk> , but in the winter of 1955 – 1956 he discovered documents in the national archives which provided better information on the location of the wreck . He also received the results of soundings made in his target area which revealed a suspicious lump on the bottom just off the island of <unk> . Together with the navy 's chief salvage diver , Per Edvin <unk> , he spent the summer of 1956 carefully searching the waters just off the Gustav V drydock . On 25 August , they found a large object , and the coring device returned plugs of black oak , timber that had been underwater so long that it had turned black . The navy sent a diving team to the site in September , and <unk> was able to report climbing up the side of a large wooden ship with two rows of gunports – Vasa had been found . 
 The Vasa Committee was established to investigate the possibility of raising and preserving the ship , and Franzén persuaded the navy , the National Heritage Board , the National Maritime Museum and a large private salvage company , the Neptune Company , to back the project . They began exploratory dives in the fall of 1956 and discussed how the ship might be raised . 
 = = = Recovery = = = 
 A number of possible recovery methods were proposed , including filling the ship with ping @-@ pong balls and freezing it in a block of ice , but the method chosen by the Vasa Board ( which succeeded the Vasa Committee ) was essentially the same one attempted immediately after the sinking . Divers spent two years digging six tunnels under the ship for steel cable slings , which were taken to a pair of lifting pontoons at the surface . The work under the ship was extremely dangerous , requiring the divers to cut tunnels through the clay with high @-@ pressure water jets and suck up the resulting slurry with a dredge , all while working in total darkness with hundreds of tons of mud @-@ filled ship overhead . A persisting risk was that the wreck could shift or settle deeper into the mud while a diver was working in a tunnel , trapping him underneath the wreckage . The almost vertical sections of the tunnels near the side of the hull could also potentially collapse and bury a diver inside . Despite the dangerous conditions , more than 1 @,@ 300 dives were made in the salvage operation without any serious accidents . 
 Each time the pontoons were pumped full , the cables tightened and the pontoons were pumped out , the ship was brought a meter closer to the surface . In a series of 18 lifts in August and September 1959 , the ship was moved from depth of 32 meters ( 105 ft ) to 16 meters ( 52 ft ) in the more sheltered area of <unk> , where divers could work more safely to prepare for the final lift . Over the course of a year and a half , a small team of commercial divers cleared debris and mud from the upper decks to lighten the ship , and made the hull as watertight as possible . The gun ports were closed by means of temporary lids , a temporary replacement of the collapsed sterncastle was constructed , and many of the holes from the iron bolts that had rusted away were plugged . The final lift began on 8 April 1961 , and on the morning of 24 April , Vasa was ready to return to the world for the first time in 333 years . Press from all over the world , television cameras , 400 invited guests on barges and boats , and thousands of spectators on shore watched as the first timbers broke the surface . The ship was then emptied of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V dry dock on <unk> , where the ship was floated on its own keel onto a concrete pontoon , on which the hull still stands . 
 From the end of 1961 to December 1988 , Vasa was housed in a temporary facility called <unk> ( " The Vasa Shipyard " ) , which included exhibit space as well as the activities centred on the ship . A building was erected over the ship on its pontoon , but it was very cramped , making conservation work awkward . Visitors could view the ship from just two levels , and the maximum viewing distance was in most places only a couple of meters , which made it difficult for viewers to get an overall view of the ship . In 1981 , the Swedish government decided that a permanent building was to be constructed , and a design competition was organized . The winning design , by the Swedish architects <unk> and <unk> , called for a large hall over the ship in a polygonal , industrial style . Ground was broken in 1987 , and Vasa was towed into the half @-@ finished Vasa Museum in December 1988 . The museum was officially opened to the public in 1990 . 
 = = Archaeology = = 
 Vasa posed an unprecedented challenge for archaeologists . Never before had a four @-@ story structure with most of its original contents largely undisturbed been available for excavation . The conditions under which the team had to work added to the difficulties . The ship had to be kept wet in order that it not dry out and crack before it could be properly conserved . Digging had to be performed under a constant drizzle of water and in a sludge @-@ covered mud that could be more than one meter ( approximately three feet ) deep . In order to establish find locations , the hull was divided into several sections demarcated by the many structural beams , the decking and by a line drawn along the center of the ship from stern to bow . For the most part , the decks were excavated individually , though at times work progressed on more than one deck level simultaneously . 
 = = = Finds = = = 
 Vasa had four preserved decks : the upper and lower gun decks , the hold and the orlop . Because of the constraints of preparing the ship for conservation , the archaeologists had to work quickly , in 13 @-@ hour shifts during the first week of excavation . The upper gun deck was greatly disturbed by the various salvage projects between 1628 and 1961 , and it contained not only material that had fallen down from the rigging and upper deck , but also more than three centuries of harbor refuse . The decks below were progressively less disturbed . The gundecks contained not just gun carriages , the three surviving cannons , and other objects of a military nature , but were also where most of the personal possessions of the sailors had been stored at the time of the sinking . These included a wide range of loose finds , and also chests and casks with spare clothing and shoes , tools and materials for mending , money ( in the form of low @-@ denomination copper coins ) , privately purchased provisions , and all of the everyday objects needed for life at sea . Most of the finds are of wood , testifying not only to the simple life on board , but to the generally unsophisticated state of Swedish material culture in the early 17th century . The lower decks were primarily used for storage , and so the hold was filled with barrels of provisions and gunpowder , coils of anchor cable , iron shot for the guns , and the personal possessions of some of the officers . On the orlop , a small compartment contained six of the ship 's ten sails , rigging spares and the working parts for the ship 's pumps . Another compartment contained the possessions of the ship 's carpenter , including a large tool chest . 
 After the ship itself had been salvaged and excavated , the site of the loss was excavated thoroughly during 1963 – 1967 . This produced many items of rigging tackle as well as structural timbers that had fallen off , particularly from the beakhead and sterncastle . Most of the sculptures that had decorated the exterior of the hull were also found in the mud , along with the ship 's anchors and the skeletons of at least four people . The last object to be brought up was the nearly 12 @-@ meter @-@ long longboat , called <unk> in Swedish , found lying parallel to the ship and believed to have been towed by Vasa when she sank . 
 Many of the more recent objects contaminating the site were disregarded when the finds were registered , but some were the remains of the 1660s salvage efforts and others had their own stories to tell . Among the best known of these was a statue of 20th @-@ century Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi , which was placed on the ship as a prank by students of Helsinki University of Technology the night before the final lift . 
 = = Causes of sinking = = 
 Vasa sank because it had very little initial stability , which can be thought of as resistance to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull . The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast , guns , provisions , and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship . The center of gravity is too high , and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over , and there is not enough righting moment , force trying to make the ship return to an upright position . The reason that the ship has such a high center of gravity is not due to the guns . These weighed little over 60 tons , or about 5 % of the total displacement of the loaded ship . This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size . The problem is in the hull construction itself . The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water . The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were , on average , only 1 @.@ 67 meters ( 5 feet 5 ½ inches ) tall , and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed . In addition , the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over @-@ dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry , so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works . 
 The use of different measuring systems on either side of the vessel caused its mass to be distributed asymmetrically , heavier to port . During construction both Swedish feet and Amsterdam feet were in use by different teams . 
 Although the mathematical tools for calculating or predicting stability were still more than a century in the future , and 17th @-@ century scientific ideas about how ships behaved in water were deeply flawed , the people associated with building and sailing ships for the Swedish navy were very much aware of the forces at work and their relationships to each other . In the last part of the inquest held after the sinking , a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank . Their discussion and conclusions show very clearly that they knew what had happened , and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains , who said that the ship did not have enough " belly " to carry the heavy upperworks . 
 Ship design was not yet a science , but was an empirical process based on experience rather than calculation . Balancing the military need for firepower against the maritime need for seaworthiness resulted in some compromises that would not pass modern standards for stability . A ship with two gundecks was an even more demanding proposition , as the lower tier of gunports had to be uncomfortably close to the water , and there was an unavoidably large amount of weight being carried above the waterline . One of the solutions which became common was graduated armament , in which the guns of the upper decks were progressively lighter . Such an armament , with 24 @-@ pounders on the lower gundeck and 12 @-@ pounders on the upper gundeck , was considered for Vasa in 1627 , but eventually the armament plan reverted to the king 's original desire of 24 @-@ pounders on both decks . Vasa 's sister ship , Äpplet , had her upper gundeck 24 @-@ pounders changed for 12 @-@ pounders early in her career , probably in attempt to improve her stability . 
 Vasa might not have sunk on 10 August 1628 , if the ship had been sailed with the gunports closed . Ships with multiple tiers of gunports normally had to sail with the lowest tier closed , since the pressure of wind in the sails would usually push the hull over until the lower gunport sills were under water . For this reason , the gunport lids are made with a double lip which is designed to seal well enough to keep out most of the water . Captain Söfring Hansson had ordered the lower gundeck ports closed once the ship began to take on water , but by then it was too late . If he had done it before he sailed , Vasa might not have sunk on that day . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Although Vasa was in surprisingly good condition after 333 years at the bottom of the sea , it would have quickly deteriorated if the hull had been simply allowed to dry . The large bulk of Vasa , over 600 cubic meters ( 21 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of oak timber , constituted an unprecedented conservation problem . After some debate on how to best preserve the ship , conservation was carried out by impregnation with polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , a method that has since become the standard treatment for large , waterlogged wooden objects , such as the 16th @-@ century English ship Mary Rose . Vasa was sprayed with PEG for 17 years , followed by a long period of slow drying , which is not yet entirely complete . 
 The reason that Vasa was so well @-@ preserved was not just that the shipworm that normally devours wooden ships was absent but also that the water of Stockholms ström was heavily polluted until the late 20th century . The highly toxic and hostile environment meant that even the toughest microorganisms that break down wood had difficulty surviving . This , along with the fact that Vasa had been newly built when she sank , contributed to her conservation . Unfortunately , the properties of the water also had a negative effect . Chemicals present in the water around Vasa had penetrated the wood , and the timber was full of the corrosion products from the bolts and other iron objects which had disappeared . Once the ship was exposed to the air , reactions began inside the timber that produced acidic compounds . In the late 1990s , spots of white and yellow residue were noticed on Vasa and some of the associated artifacts . These turned out to be sulfate @-@ containing salts that had formed on the surface of the wood when sulfides reacted with atmospheric oxygen . The salts on the surface of Vasa and objects found in and around it are not a threat themselves ( even if the discoloring may be distracting ) , but if they are from inside the wood , they may expand and crack the timber from inside . As of 2002 , the amount of sulfuric acid in Vasa 's hull was estimated to be more than 2 tonnes , and more is continually being created . Enough sulfides are present in the ship to produce another 5 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 11 @,@ 000 lb ) of acid at a rate of about 100 kilograms ( 220 lb ) per year ; this might eventually destroy the ship almost entirely . 
 While most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for Vasa 's long @-@ term decay is sulfuric acid , Ulla <unk> , professor of wood technology at Luleå University of Technology , has proposed another mechanism with her colleague Börje Stenberg . Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with PEG in an acidic environment can generate formic acid and eventually <unk> the wood . Vasa was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries , and therefore has a relatively low pH . Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present , and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition . 
 The museum is constantly monitoring the ship for damage caused by decay or warping of the wood . Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible . A current problem is that the old oak of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull . " The amount of movement in the hull is worrying . If nothing is done , the ship will most likely capsize again " , states Magnus <unk> from the Vasa Museum . An effort to secure Vasa for the future is under way , in cooperation with the Royal Institute of Technology and other institutions around the globe . 
 To deal with the problem of the inevitable deterioration of the ship , the main hall of the Vasa Museum is kept at a temperature of 18 – 20 ° C ( 64 – 68 ° F ) and a humidity level of 53 % . To slow the destruction by acidic compounds , different methods have been tried . Small objects have been sealed in plastic containers filled with an inert atmosphere of nitrogen gas , for halting further reactions between sulfides and oxygen . The ship itself has been treated with cloth saturated in a basic liquid to neutralize the low pH , but this is only a temporary solution as acid is continuously produced . The original bolts rusted away after the ship sank but were replaced with modern ones that were galvanized and covered with epoxy resin . Despite this , the new bolts have also started to rust and are releasing iron into the wood , which accelerates the deterioration . These bolts are currently being replaced with bolts made of stainless steel .

 Vasa has become a popular and widely recognized symbol for a historical narrative about the Swedish <unk> ( " the Great Power @-@ period " ) in the 17th century , and about the early development of a European nation state . Within the disciplines of history and maritime archaeology the wrecks of large warships from the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries have received particularly widespread attention as perceived symbols of a past greatness of the state of Sweden . Among these wrecks , Vasa is the single most well @-@ known example , and has also become recognized internationally , not least through a deliberate use of the ship as a symbol for marketing Sweden abroad . The name Vasa has in Sweden become synonymous with sunken vessels that are considered to be of great historical importance , and these are usually described , explained and valued in relation to Vasa itself . The Swedish maritime archaeologist Carl @-@ Olof Cederlund , who has been active in the various Vasa @-@ projects , has described the phenomenon as <unk> @-@ <unk> , " the royal ship syndrome " ( after the term used in the 17th century for the largest warships in the Swedish navy ) . He associates the " syndrome " to a nationalist aspect of the history of ideas and traditional perceptions about hero @-@ kings and glory through war . The focus of this historical theory lies on the " great periods " in " our [ Swedish ] history " and shares many similarities with the nationalist views of the Viking era in the Nordic countries and the praising of Greek and Roman Antiquity in the Western world in general . Cederlund has stressed the ritualized aspects of the widely publicized salvage in 1961 and has compared the modern Vasa Museum with " a temple in the Classical sense of the word " . The placement of the museum on Djurgården , traditional crown property , and its focus on " the King 's ship " has led him to suggest a description of it as " The Temple of the Royal Ship " . 
 = = = Literature and popular culture = = = 
 Vasa has been the subject of hundreds of books , articles and papers on topics ranging from marine archaeology to culinary history . Three children 's books about Vasa have been written in Swedish and later translated into English , German , Danish , and Norwegian : The Vasa Saga by Bertil <unk> , The Vasa Sets Sail by Mats Wahl ( illustrated by Sven <unk> ) , and The Vasa Piglet by Björn <unk> . 
 Vasa 's unique status has drawn considerable attention and captured the imagination of more than two generations of scholars , tourists , model builders , and authors . Though historically unfounded , the popular perception of the building of the ship as a botched and disorganized affair ( dubbed " the Vasa @-@ syndrome " ) has been used by many authors of management literature as an educational example of how not to organize a successful business . 
 The Vasa Museum has co @-@ sponsored two versions of a documentary about the history and recovery of the ship , both by documentary filmmaker Anders Wahlgren . The second version is currently shown in the museum and has been released on VHS and DVD with narration in 16 languages . In late 2011 , a third Vasa @-@ film premiered on Swedish television , with a longer running time and a considerably larger budget ( with over 7 @.@ 5 million kronor provided by SVT ) . An educational computer game , now in its second generation , has been made and is used in the museum and on its website to explain the fundamentals of 17th century ship construction and stability . Several mass @-@ produced model kits and countless custom @-@ built models of the ship have been made . In 1991 , a 308 @-@ tonne pastiche reproduction of the ship was built in Tokyo to serve as a 650 @-@ passenger sightseeing ship . Vasa has inspired many works of art , including a gilded Disney @-@ themed parody of the pilaster sculptures on the ship 's quarter galleries . Being a popular tourist attraction , Vasa is used as a motif for various souvenir products such as T @-@ shirts , mugs , refrigerator magnets , and posters . Commercially produced replicas — such as drinking glasses , plates , spoons , and even a backgammon game — have been made from many of the objects belonging to the crew or officers found on the ship .

 " Next " was written by Jenna Bans and Kevin Murphy and directed by Larry Shaw . While developing storylines for the second season , series creator Marc Cherry stated , " I want to keep finding new ways to talk about issues that relate to everyday women , " explaining that the show needs to focus on " small , real , everyday issues " in order to keep the audience interested . Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy : " Lynette will have a job next season ( returning to her advertising roots ) , so I want to address how difficult it is to go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house . " Huffman recognized that her character 's storylines needed a change of pace , but hoped that Lynette 's domestic life would still play an integral role this season . " My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world ; that it 's still a home and family / husband and children story , " she explained . " But how many times can you go , ' Kids , clear your plates ! ' " The episode also introduced Joely Fisher as Lynette 's new boss , Nina Fletcher . Fisher describes her character as " nasty , " elaborating : " Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she 's childless by choice . Even though Nina is not a housewife , she is desperate in her own way . " Due to the death of his character , Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season . For the open casket scene in " Next " , producers created a life mask of the actor . Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season . 
 The episode is the first to feature Alfre Woodard and Mehcad Brooks as series regulars after they were introduced in the final two episodes of the first season . Woodard played Betty Applewhite , a " deeply religious , overbearing single mother " while Mehcad portrayed her son , Matthew . In regards to the characters and their mystery storyline , Cherry stated : " They come on the street ; they seem like nice people — but they 've got a secret . And it 's pretty gothic . It 's real and human and awful all at the same time . " Woodard commented that her character " never means harm ... Let 's just say she has flaws . She had to make some really tough decisions quick and if the law ever catches up with her , she 'll have to serve time ... But they 'll never catch her . " The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first season finale but saved for " Next " instead . 
 While the <unk> are regarded as the first major black characters on the series , Cherry stated that the role of Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses , both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues . He clarified : " There 's nothing strategically black about her character . Her color is incidental . " Woodard had never seen the show before accepting the role . Desperate Housewives producers sent her fifteen episodes of the show , which she divided amongst various family members . After they compared storylines , Woodard recalled that she became " instantly hooked " on the series . Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role . Both Brooks and his brother , Billy , auditioned for the role of Matthew . The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors . According to Cherry , Brooks was cast because he exuded a " dangerous " element , as well as " a combination of this wholesome , sweet quality and a dark , brooding quality . "

 Variety 's Brian Lowry gave the episode a positive review . He opined that the Lynette storyline looked " extremely promising " and enjoyed the addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette 's " tight @-@ assed new boss . " He identified the Bree storyline as " the real water @-@ cooler sequence " and complimented Marcia Cross ' performance . However , Lowry criticized the Gabrielle and Susan storylines , opining that they are " exhibiting signs of wear and tear . " Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode had " a particularly sleepy opening 20 minutes " while its exciting plot points all occurred in the second half of the episode . He praised the scene in which Bree changes the tie on Rex 's corpse and called Cross ' performance throughout the episode " pitch @-@ perfect . " Slezak also complimented Huffman 's performance , but wondered if Fisher was " a steely enough an actress to go Manolo @-@ a @-@ Manolo with Huffman every week . " Though he criticized the repetitive nature of the Susan and Gabrielle storylines , Slezak thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the show 's chances of falling into a sophomore slump . He praised Woodward 's acting as well as her character 's storyline , opining , " there 's something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodard 's performance , such apple @-@ pie wholesomeness , that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling .

 Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline , writing : " Forget Lynette 's career stress , Gabrielle 's baby daddy drama , and even Bree 's new widowhood : This story has legs , and apparently arms . " She found it strange that the Bree , Andrew , and Danielle characters showed little emotion in regards to Rex 's death . Additionally , she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan , a character " so often saddled with the comic relief of the show , had a sad and serious premiere . " Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review , stating the episode delivered " lots of juicy resolution , several power suits , and ( you guessed it ) lots of tears and shouting . " The Futon Critic selected " Next " as the 42nd best television episode of 2005 , writing , " Say what you will about the show 's rocky sophomore season but one can 't deny how strongly it started , " and citing the tie @-@ changing scene as the episode 's most memorable moment . 
 In 2005 , Bans and Murphy were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Comedy writing , but lost to Jenji Kohan , who penned the pilot episode of the Showtime series Weeds .

 Clannad ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key and released on April 28 , 2004 for Windows PCs . While both of Key 's first two previous works , Kanon and Air , had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market , Clannad was released with a rating for all ages . It was later ported to the PlayStation 2 , PlayStation Portable , Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita consoles . An English version for Windows was released on Steam by Sekai Project in 2015 . 
 The story follows the life of Tomoya Okazaki . In the first story arc , called School Life , he is a high school delinquent who meets many people in his last year at school , including five girls , and helps resolve their individual problems . The second story arc , called After Story , follows his life as an adult after graduating from school . The gameplay of Clannad follows a branching plot line which offers a number of alternate scenarios with dialogue choices and courses of interaction , focusing on the player character 's interactions with various non @-@ player characters . 
 The game was ranked as the best @-@ selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release , and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards . Key went on to produce an adult spin @-@ off titled Tomoyo After : It 's a Wonderful Life in November 2005 , which expanded on the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami , one of the five heroines from Clannad . 
 Clannad has made several transitions to other media . There have been four manga adaptations published by ASCII Media Works , Flex Comix , Fujimi Shobo and Jive . Comic anthologies , light novels and art books have also been published , as have audio dramas and several albums of music . An animated film by Toei Animation was released in September 2007 , followed by two TV anime series including two original video animation ( OVA ) episodes by Kyoto Animation produced between 2007 and 2009 . Both anime series and their accompanying OVAs are licensed by Sentai Filmworks and were released in North America in 2009 . The animated adaptations have received high sales figures in Japan as well as critical acclaim abroad . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Clannad is a drama and romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki . Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story 's narrative and dialogue . Clannad follows a branching plot line with multiple endings ; depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game , the plot will progress in a specific direction . 
 There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience , five which are initially available . Throughout gameplay , the player is given multiple options to choose from , and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made . To view all plot lines in their entirety , the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to change the plot progression . 
 When first playing the game , the scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called the School Life story arc . When the player completes a character 's scenario , he or she receives an orb of light . When eight of these lights are obtained , the game 's second story arc , called After Story , is made available . One of the lights disappears during School Life , but reappears in After Story . To view the true ending of Clannad , all 13 lights must be obtained . Originally , the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game , but since this increased the game 's complexity , and detracted from the storyline , the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive .

 = = = Setting and themes = = = 
 The first half of the story takes place primarily at <unk> Private High School , a fictional school located in Japan . Outside of the school , frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa 's parents , and the dormitory where Youhei <unk> lives . Throughout the story , glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown . This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl , though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her . The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city , after the conclusion of the first half . While the town 's name was never directly mentioned , one can infer that the town 's name is <unk> based on the many companies and establishments that share this name . 
 There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story . The main theme is the value of having a family , as the title of the series implies because the main scenario writer Jun Maeda mistakenly thought the name of the Irish band Clannad meant " clan " or " family " in Irish . Of the six main characters , Tomoya , Nagisa , and Kotomi have no siblings , though their parents are major factors in their stories . Nagisa 's story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a " perfect family " with a focus on mental consciousness . In Nagisa 's story , there is a recurring appearance of " The Big Dango Family " ( <unk> , Dango Daikazoku ) ( a fictional group mascot for children ) that Nagisa is fond of . Tomoya 's and Nagisa 's characters were written in a style to exemplify a " growth to adulthood " by the end of the story . Fuko 's and Kyou 's stories have their sisters playing an integral part , and Tomoyo 's story is influenced by her entire family . A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game , " Mag Mell " , which means roughly " plain of joy " and is connected with Irish mythology . The arrange album , a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game , that was bundled with the original game release was titled Mabinogi , which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts . 
 = = = Main characters = = = 
 The player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki , the protagonist of Clannad . Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent ; at the beginning of the story , he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set . He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind , even if he comes off as rude during such times . Despite this , Tomoya is very loyal to his friends , and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support . He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them . 
 Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa , the main heroine of Clannad , at the onset of the story . Nagisa is a soft @-@ spoken girl who has very low self @-@ esteem and self @-@ confidence which causes her to rely on those around her for support . She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself , such as <unk> . Kyou Fujibayashi , another of Clannad 's heroines , is a bad @-@ mouthed and aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family . When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes . Despite this attitude , she also has a more subdued side , especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi . 
 Tomoya meets a genius girl named Kotomi Ichinose , one day in the school library . She is ranked in the top 10 throughout the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject — she always goes to library to read extra materials , especially books in foreign languages . Kotomi is a very quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her ; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading , even if they make loud disturbances around her . Clannad 's fourth heroine is a second @-@ year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya 's school . Tomoyo , like Kyou , can be extremely aggressive , and Tomoyo is a very strong fighter , preferring to use kicking over punching , and is very athletic . Although Tomoya is older than her , Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student . Tomoyo appears in Key 's fifth game , Tomoyo After : It 's a Wonderful Life , as the main heroine . 
 The last heroine in Clannad is a first @-@ year student named Fuko Ibuki who has a distant attitude towards others and , before she met Tomoya , was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents . Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish , or things that are star @-@ shaped , and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Clannad 's story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki , a third year high school student who dislikes his life . Tomoya 's mother ( Atsuko ) died when Tomoya was young , leaving his father ( Naoyuki ) to raise him . After the accident , Tomoya 's father turned to alcohol and gambling , and had frequent fights with his son . One day , Naoyuki , while arguing with his son , slammed Tomoya against the window , dislocating Tomoya 's shoulder . This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team , and causes him to distance himself from others . Ever since then , his father has treated Tomoya nicely , but distantly , as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family . This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father , and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night . Thus his delinquent life begins . Tomoya 's good friend Youhei <unk> , who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors , is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much . 
 The story opens on Monday April 14 , 2003 at the beginning of the school year , when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa , a soft @-@ spoken girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year . Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness , but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated . Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill , he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club . During this period , Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems . 
 = = = = After Story = = = = 
 In the second part of the story , which starts immediately after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years , Tomoya and Nagisa start living together , and eventually get married . Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from , especially Nagisa 's illness . Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio , she dies , which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed . He is barely able to function , let alone look after an infant . As a result , Nagisa 's parents , Akio and Sanae , take care of their granddaughter . Five years later , Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki , his paternal grandmother . Shino tells Tomoya of his father 's traumatic past , which is eerily similar to Tomoya 's current situation . Afterwards , Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father . Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression , Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had . Tomoya , Sanae and Akio struggle to save her — Tomoya even quits his job — but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain . In the coming winter , wanting to do anything for his daughter , Tomoya takes her on a trip , but she dies shortly after . 
 Tomoya 's psychology is developed in his dreams of a bleak world , called the Illusionary World ( <unk> , <unk> Sekai ) , where small orbs of light float around . In the first few dreams , he sees a world devoid of all life , except for one girl . Each time he dreams , he finds out more about the world . Tomoya discovers that the girl has a special ability to fuse junk together to create new things , which she uses to create a body for him . Over time , Tomoya comes to the conclusion that only the two of them are " alive " . To pass time , Tomoya and the girl try to build another doll with more junk they find , but as it has no soul , it fails to come to life . Remembering the distant world where he came from , Tomoya convinces the girl to build a ship so that the two can escape the approaching winter and continue to live a happy life . Eventually , winter sets in , and the girl becomes cold to the point where she cannot move any more . The girl tells Tomoya that he has another chance to go back and make things right . To do so , he must collect certain " lights " ( symbols of happiness ) similar to those floating around in the Illusionary World . If all the " lights " are collected throughout both story parts , a chance to save Nagisa from dying will become available , as well as the true ending , where she survives and lives with Tomoya and Ushio .

 The executive producer for Clannad was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt 's , the publishing company which controls Key . Jun Maeda , who was one of three main scenario writers with Kai , and Yūichi Suzumoto , led the planning for Clannad and wrote the majority of the scenarios . Scenario assistance was provided by Tōya Okano . Itaru Hinoue headed the art direction , and also worked on the character design . Miracle Mikipon , Mochisuke , Na @-@ Ga , and Shinory supplemented the computer graphics . Torino provided the background art . The game 's music was composed by Maeda , Shinji Orito , and Magome Togoshi . 
 For Key 's second visual novel Air , Maeda admitted he felt he was able to write what he wanted to for the game 's scenario , but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience . Due to this , Maeda felt that for Key 's next work Clannad , he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible . In any case , he wanted to make it an entertaining game , and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Air 's completion . From the start of Clannad 's planning , Maeda did not want to write a story like in Air , but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the ' people and the town ' , and ' humanity ' . Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad , and equates Clannad 's writing process as a " wall that I will never be able to get over again . " While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared , the entire game 's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted , and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length . Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game 's base scenario which caused the ' branch ' scenarios to increase as well . 
 There were more concerns about Clannad being similar to Air . When Nagisa 's scenario was being written , there were some disputes concerning the length of her scenario , and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine . Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how Air was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio . Takahiro Baba , the company president of VisualArt 's , is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters ' scenarios , but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game 's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different , and thought the end result was a good one . Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc , mainly a continuation of Nagisa 's scenario , would eclipse the entire game 's scenario , much like what happened with Air according to Maeda . In order to prevent the same thing happening in Clannad , Maeda focused on making the first half of the story , the School Life arc , just as enjoyable by making it long and heart @-@ breaking . Clannad is Key 's second longest work , as reported by Yūto Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4 @,@ 000 words fewer than Key 's 2008 game Little Busters ! Ecstasy .

She attended high school in Biggar , and moved to Saskatoon to attend university . She started out towards a degree in computer science , but transferred after her first year to work for a degree in physical education .

 In 1993 , teammate Marcia <unk> introduced Schmirler to Shannon England . On June 22 , 1996 , they were married . In 1997 , Schmirler was pregnant with their first child . When this information was revealed to reporters at the Scott Tournament of Hearts , they jokingly dubbed her " Schmirler the <unk> " . On September 15 , 1997 , their daughter Sara Marion was born . In April 1999 , Sandra 's father Art Schmirler died from esophageal cancer . On June 30 , 1999 , the couple 's second daughter , Jenna Shirley , was born . 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 After Jenna 's birth , Schmirler experienced many health problems . She had suffered from back pain , which was thought to be pregnancy related , and following Jenna 's birth , she began to suffer from stomach pains . Tests showed that a cancerous node the size of a fist had developed behind her heart . As her condition worsened , she underwent surgery on September 6 , 1999 . During surgery , a dead piece of the tumour broke off and released a blood clot into her lung . Her heart stopped beating , and only emergency heart massage kept her alive . Almost a month after being diagnosed with cancer , doctors finally provided a specific diagnosis – metastatic adenocarcinoma , with an unknown primary site . Because no one could pin down where the cancer came from , Sandra referred to it as " the cancer from Mars . " In addition to chemotherapy and radiation , Schmirler explored <unk> medicine through the Canadian Cancer Research Group . This form of alternative medicine involves large doses of vitamins and nutrients . 
 In 2000 , Schmirler worked as colour commentator for CBC during Canada 's national junior curling championships . During her illness , Schmirler had been largely removed from the public eye . While in Moncton for the championships , Schmirler held a press conference to update her situation . In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time , Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through , while also expressing her hope for the future : " There were three goals I had coming out of this thing , and the first one was to look after my family . And the second one ... because I curl so much , I 've never taken a hot vacation , so I 'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place . And the last one was to actually be here today , and I thank CBC , I thank Lawrence ( Kimber ) , and Joan Mead . " 
 After returning from Moncton , Schmirler felt physically well , but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs . The decision was made not to proceed with further chemotherapy , but she continued with the <unk> therapy . She had been scheduled to work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts , but was unable to do so . She faxed a statement from the hospital , which was read by TSN 's Vic Rauter . " I 'm still fighting hard and I still hope to make it to the Brier , not playing but talking . For Saskatchewan , I was hoping to be in your green shoes ( at the Scott ) . But keep things in perspective . There are other things in life besides curling , which I have found . But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year . And I 'll see you all in Sudbury ( the next Scott site ) in 2001 . Your curling friend , Sandra . " However , the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition . She had been moved to palliative care . She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2 , 2000 at age 36 . She was survived by her husband and her two daughters . 
 Her death caused reactions not just within Saskatchewan and the curling community , but also across the country . Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said in a statement : " All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler . Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada . But what really set her apart was her bright , engaging personality and her incredible zest for life , qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness . She will be sorely missed . " In honour of Schmirler , flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half @-@ staff . 
 TSN offered to broadcast her funeral live and to make the signal available to any other stations at no charge . Her husband , Shannon England , agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service . CBC also broadcast the service , marking the first time a Canadian athlete 's funeral had been televised live on two networks . The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral , which was broadcast on screens at the rink . Regina 's <unk> and Schmirler 's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral . Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home , thousands watched at satellite locations around the province , and hundreds of thousands watched on television . The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells , and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker , teammate Joan McCusker 's husband .

 Columbia / <unk> / is a city in and the county seat of Boone County , Missouri , United States . Founded in 1820 as the county seat and home to the University of Missouri , it had a 2015 estimated population of 119 @,@ 108 , and it is the principal city of the Columbia Metropolitan Area , the state 's fourth most populous metropolitan area . As a midwestern college town , the city has a reputation for progressive politics , public art , and powerful journalism . The tripartite establishment of Stephens College ( 1833 ) , the University of Missouri ( 1839 ) , and Columbia College ( 1851 ) has long made the city a center of education , culture , and athletic competition . These three schools surround Downtown Columbia on the east , south , and north ; at the center is the Avenue of the Columns , which connects Francis Quadrangle and Jesse Hall to the Boone County Courthouse and the City Hall . Originally an agricultural town , the cultivation of the mind is Columbia 's chief economic concern today . Never a major center of manufacturing , the city also depends on healthcare , insurance , and technology businesses . Several companies , such as Shelter Insurance , Carfax , and Slackers CDs and Games , were founded in the city . Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society of Missouri , the Museum of Art and Archaeology , and the annual True / False Film Festival . The Missouri Tigers , the state 's only major athletic program , play football at Faurot Field and basketball at Mizzou Arena as members of the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) . 
 The city is built upon the forested hills and rolling prairies of Mid @-@ Missouri , near the Missouri River valley , where the Ozark Mountains begin to transform into plains and savanna ; limestone forms bluffs and glades while rain carves caves and springs which water the Hinkson , Roche Perche , and Petite Bonne Femme creeks . Surrounding the city , Rock Bridge Memorial State Park , Mark Twain National Forest , and Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge all form a greenbelt preserving sensitive and rare environments . The first humans were nomadic hunters who entered the area at least twelve thousand years ago . Later , woodland tribes lived in villages along waterways and built mounds in high places . The Osage and Missouria nations were expelled by the exploration of French traders and the rapid settlement of American pioneers . The latter arrived by the Boone 's Lick Trail and hailed from the slave @-@ owning culture of the Upland South , especially Virginia , Kentucky , and Tennessee , giving <unk> the name " Little Dixie " during the American Civil War . German , Irish , and other European immigrants soon joined . The modern populace is unusually diverse , over eight percent foreign @-@ born . While White and Black remain the largest ethnicities , Asians are now the third @-@ largest group . Today 's Columbians are remarkably highly educated and culturally midwestern , though traces of their Southern past remain . The city has been called the " Athens of Missouri " or a reference to its classic beauty and educational emphasis , but is more commonly called " <unk> " .

 The Columbia area was once part of the Mississippian culture and home to the Mound Builders . When European explorers arrived , the area was populated by the Osage and Missouri Indians . In 1678 , La Salle claimed all of Missouri for France . The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed by the area on the Missouri River in early June 1804 . In 1806 , two sons of Daniel Boone established a salt lick 40 miles ( 64 km ) northwest of <unk> giving the area its early name : <unk> . The Boone 's Lick Trail wound from St. Charles to the lick in present @-@ day Howard County . In 1818 , a group of settlers , incorporated under the Smithton Land Company , purchased over 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 km2 ) and established the village of Smithton less than a mile from current day downtown Columbia . In 1821 , the settlers moved , because of lack of water , across the Flat Branch to the plateau between the Flat Branch and Hinkson creeks in what is now the downtown district . They renamed the settlement Columbia — a poetic personification of the United States . 
 The roots of Columbia 's three economic foundations — education , medicine , and insurance — can be traced back to incorporation in 1821 . Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university . In 1833 , Columbia Baptist Female College opened , which later became Stephens College . Columbia College ( distinct from today 's ) , later to become the University of Missouri , was founded in 1839 . When the state legislature decided to establish a state university , Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city and James S. Rollins donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle . Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian Female College , the first college for women west of the Mississippi , which later became the current Columbia College . The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails , and later from the Missouri @-@ Kansas @-@ Texas Railroad . In 1822 the first hospital was set up by William Jewell . In 1830 , the first newspaper began ; in 1832 , the first theater in the state was opened ; and in 1835 , the state 's first agricultural fair was held . By 1839 , the population ( 13 @,@ 000 ) and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County , which at that time included the City of St. Louis . 
 Columbia 's infrastructure was relatively untouched by the Civil War . Missouri , as a slave state , had Southern sympathies , but remained in the Union . The majority of the city was pro @-@ Union , however , the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro @-@ Confederate . Because of this , the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated . No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking , though several major battles occurred nearby at Boonville and Centralia . After the Civil War , race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern ; a black man , George Burke , was lynched in 1889 . 
 In 1963 , Columbia become home to the headquarters of both the University of Missouri System , which today serves over 71 @,@ 000 students , and the Columbia College system , which today serves about 25 @,@ 000 students . The insurance industry also became important to the local economy as several companies established headquarters in Columbia , including Shelter Insurance , Missouri Employers Mutual , and Columbia Insurance Group . State Farm Insurance has a regional office in Columbia . In addition , the now defunct Silvey Insurance was once a large local employer . Columbia became a transportation crossroads when U.S. Route 63 and U.S. Route 40 ( which became present @-@ day Interstate 70 ) were routed through the city . Soon after the city opened the Columbia Regional Airport . The latter 20th century saw tremendous growth , and by 2000 the population was nearly 85 @,@ 000 in the city proper . 
 In early 2006 , Columbia embarked on a plan to manage the continued growth as the city passed 100 @,@ 000 population . The city continues to grow , especially east around the newly opened Battle High School . The downtown district has maintained its status as a cultural center and is undergoing significant development in both residential and commercial sectors . The University of Missouri , which has tremendous economic impact on the city , experienced record enrollment in 2006 and is undertaking significant construction .

 = Black Thunder ( chocolate bar ) = 
 Black Thunder ( <unk> , Burakku <unk> ) is a chocolate bar made and sold in Japan by the Yuraku Confectionery Company . It contains a cocoa @-@ flavored cookie bar mixed with Japanese @-@ style rice puffs , coated with chocolate . The manufacturer 's suggested retail price is 30 yen , before tax . The main advertising slogan translates to " Delicious taste in a flash of lightning ! " The story of the Yuraku Confectionery Company and its Black Thunder bar has been treated in the Japanese business press as something of a modern @-@ day rags to riches story . 
 The Black Thunder bar was conceived as an easily marketable candy bar with three popular components and a reasonable price . The name was partially inspired by the Japanese god of thunder . Black Thunder bars were first made in a factory in the city of Toyohashi in 1994 . The target demographic was university students in the Kanto region and sales growth depended mostly on word @-@ of @-@ mouth recommendations . Through a series of marketing deals starting in 2004 , sales of Black Thunder gradually climbed . In 2008 , the Yuraku Confectionery company sponsored the Men 's Gymnastics team at the 2008 Summer Olympics , and brand recognition correspondingly increased . 
 Starting in 2008 , Yuraku Confectionery company began developing and marketing variations on the Black Thunder bar . Similar products in the same line include the Big Thunder , Black Thunder Mini @-@ bar , " White Black Thunder " , and the Morning Thunder breakfast bar . In 2009 , Yuraku began collaborative efforts with other agencies to develop related products inspired by the Black Thunder candy bar . 
 = = Product = = 
 The original concept was a candy bar that would have three main components , a heavy texture , rich flavor , and a reasonable price ; the combination of these qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product . It was later decided it should be appealing to as many demographic groups as possible , including children . A candy bar was developed with a dark cocoa @-@ flavored cookie pieces mixed with Japanese @-@ style <unk> rice , and finally coated with dark milk chocolate . The cookie bar is pressed relatively flat on five sides ; however , the top of the bar presents an uneven surface , even with the chocolate coating . When it came to a name for the product , it was decided that the keyword should be the color " black " , which would allude to the dark chocolate flavor . This is in keeping with other marketing trends in Japan , where the color " black " is associated with dark or bittersweet chocolate , such as the popular Meiji Black chocolate bar . To give the product some " impact " with consumers , it was decided to name it after the Japanese god of thunder , Raijin . Although the name of the product uses the English words " Black Thunder " ( pronounced or transliterated as Burakku <unk> ) , the outer package also carries the Japanese kanji term for the product in a smaller font ( <unk> , pronounced <unk> <unk> ) , so that the meaning would not be lost on consumers . An advertising slogan recorded from the development period translates to , " Delicious taste like a flash of lightning ! " ( <unk> ! ) , but was initially rejected in favor of the basic one @-@ line descriptive " Black cocoa crunch " . 
 = = History = = 
 During initial development , a chocolate bar with three kinds of nuts was developed , called " <unk> 3 " . However , it was terminated within a short time , as it was thought it would not appeal to children . The Black Thunder bar was then developed based on the original concept specifications but also with the idea that it would appeal to multiple demographic segments , including children . 
 In 1994 , a small factory with only twenty employees in Toyohashi city , Aichi @-@ ken , began making the Black Thunder chocolate bars . The packaging at that time used alphabetic script that read " Black Thunder " , and the suggested retail price was set at 30 yen . By the year 2000 , sales were not impressive , but it was decided to keep the product . At the same time , the package design was altered , and the concept slogan was added : " Delicious taste in a flash of lightning ! " In August 2003 , the package was changed again to its current design , in which alphabetic font for the brand name was replaced with Japanese lettering in katakana . Finally , a new advertising slogan aimed at a specific demographic was added to the front of the package : " A big hit among young women ! " Throughout this early period , sales growth was largely dependent on word @-@ of @-@ mouth recommendations . 
 Though initially distributed only to 7 @-@ Eleven stores in the Kanto region , a potential for expanded marketing was realized , and Black Thunder was released for sale through a cooperative business association into more areas . During the 2004 to 2005 sales year , Black Thunder bars saw a sudden surge in popularity in the Kyushu region . During the summer of 2005 , Black Thunder bars were distributed in more regions across the country . By the end of the year , over 900 @,@ 000 units had been sold and Black Thunder bars were the best @-@ selling product of the Yuraku Confectionery Company . In 2006 , it was picked up by the Shiraishi @-@ san Co @-@ op and sold over the internet , and product sales received a boost as it gained in popularity among university students . In the first three years after sales commenced over the internet , about ten times the number of Black Thunder bars were sold since its inception eleven years earlier . In 2008 , the Yuraku Confectionery company sponsored the Men 's Gymnastics team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . The team earned the Silver Medal , as did individual gymnast Kōhei Uchimura . After the 19 @-@ year @-@ old gymnast actively endorsed the product in news media , brand recognition jumped considerably and from 2008 to 2009 , total sales jumped from just under 50 million units to the landmark number of 100 million . By 2010 , sales had reached 130 million units . 
 At present , Black Thunder bars are made in four factories located in Sapporo , Tokyo , Osaka , and the original factory in Toyohashi . From any of these , Black Thunder bars can be shipped to various convenience stores and discount stores across the country , and they are still distributed to all university student co @-@ operatives in the Kanto area .

 In 2008 , Yuraku decided to branch out with the product in an effort to appeal to a broader demographic . The " Big Thunder " candy bar was developed , which is about twice the length and width of the original bar , but about half the thickness . The main slogan can be translated to " Big satisfaction for the glutton ! ! " ( <unk> ！ ！ ) , though the package also bears the slogans " <unk> ! Size ! Double the lightning strike !

While the regular Big Thunder bar is sold mainly in convenience stores , the target venue for the Mini @-@ bars has been grocery stores . 
 = = = Dear Girl Thunder = = = 
 In March 2009 , in collaboration with the radio show Dear Girl Stories with Hiroshi Kamiya and Daisuke Ono and Nippon Cultural Broadcasting , the " Dear Girl Thunder " candy bar was developed . The flavor of the Dear Girl Thunder bar was advertised as " The Taste of First Love : Salt and Chocolate " ( <unk> ・ <unk> ) . In Japan , chocolate is associated with Valentine 's Day and is considered an appropriate gift between sweethearts ; salty foods are considered " adult " and are thus associated with maturity . A person 's " first love " is , like in other cultures , something of a rite of passage ; an episode in life sweet in sentiment , but with maturing results . In July 2009 , a limited edition of 480 units of the Dear Girl Thunder bar went on sale and quickly sold out . In October 2010 , the Dear Girl Thunder bar went on sale in <unk> convenience stores ( with the exception of the stores in one region ) . During 2010 , consumers questioned why Black Thunder bars were not distributed to areas of Hokkaido , Miyazaki , Kagoshima , and Okinawa , and the company responded with research into the feasibility of nationwide distribution . In January 2011 , it was decided that a second edition of the Dear Girl Thunder bar would be distributed to Animate stores , a retailer that specializes in anime , manga , and video games . It would also be marketed on the mail order website of Cho ! A & G + , a branch of Nippon Cultural Broadcasting , Inc . , that focuses on digital radio broadcasting . Both deals ensure that consumers across the country can purchase the Dear Girl Thunder bars .

The package mentions " From Hokkaido " , an area which has been associated with white chocolate since its introduction by the <unk> Confectionery , based in Obihiro , Hokkaido , in the 1970s . The advertising slogan can be translated as : " Straight descent into deliciousness ! " ( <unk> ) , and uses a term distinctly related to the steep slopes of Alpine skiing . Within a short time , the White Thunder bar has proven to be quite popular , as demonstrated by the rapid depletion of stocks .

 = Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War = 
 The Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War ( Azerbaijani : Qarabağ <unk> ) , referred to as the Artsakh Liberation War ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) by Armenians , was an ethnic conflict that took place in the late 1980s to May 1994 , in the enclave of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan , between the majority ethnic Armenians of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh backed by the Republic of Armenia , and the Republic of Azerbaijan . As the war progressed , Armenia and Azerbaijan , both former Soviet Republics , entangled themselves in a protracted , undeclared war in the mountainous heights of Karabakh as Azerbaijan attempted to curb the secessionist movement in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . The enclave 's parliament had voted in favor of uniting itself with Armenia and a referendum , boycotted by the Azerbaijani population of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , was held , whereby most of the voters voted in favor of independence . The demand to unify with Armenia , which began anew in 1988 , began in a relatively peaceful manner ; however , in the following months , as the Soviet Union 's disintegration neared , it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between ethnic Armenians and ethnic Azerbaijanis , resulting in claims of ethnic cleansing by both sides . 
 Inter @-@ ethnic clashes between the two broke out shortly after the parliament of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( NKAO ) in Azerbaijan voted to unify the region with Armenia on 20 February 1988 . The declaration of secession from Azerbaijan was the final result of a territorial conflict regarding the land . As Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union and removed the powers held by the enclave 's government , the Armenian majority voted to secede from Azerbaijan and in the process proclaimed the unrecognized Republic of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . 
 Full @-@ scale fighting erupted in the late winter of 1992 . International mediation by several groups including the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) failed to bring an end resolution that both sides could work with . In the spring of 1993 , Armenian forces captured regions outside the enclave itself , threatening the involvement of other countries in the region . By the end of the war in 1994 , the Armenians were in full control of most of the enclave and also held and currently control approximately 9 % of Azerbaijan 's territory outside the enclave . As many as 230 @,@ 000 Armenians from Azerbaijan and 800 @,@ 000 Azeris from Armenia and Karabakh have been displaced as a result of the conflict . A Russian @-@ brokered ceasefire was signed in May 1994 and peace talks , mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group , have been held ever since by Armenia and Azerbaijan . 
 = = Background = = 
 The territorial ownership of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh today is still heavily contested between Armenians and Azerbaijanis . The current conflict has its roots in events following World War I. Shortly before the Ottoman Empire 's capitulation in the war , the Russian Empire collapsed in November 1917 and fell under the control of the Bolsheviks . The three nations of the Caucasus , Armenians , Azerbaijanis and Georgians , previously under the rule of the Russians , declared the formation of the Transcaucasian Federation which dissolved after only three months of existence . 
 = = = Armenian – Azerbaijani war = = = 
 Fighting soon broke out between the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in three specific regions : <unk> , Zangezur ( today the Armenian province of Syunik ) and Karabakh itself , in Azerbaijan . 
 Armenia and Azerbaijan quarreled about the putative boundaries of the three provinces . The Karabakh Armenians attempted to declare their independence but failed to make contact with the Republic of Armenia . Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I , Armenian General Andranik Ozanian entered Karabakh with military success and was headed towards the region capital of Shusha in December 1918 . British troops occupied the South Caucasus in 1919 , and the British command suggested Andranik cease his offense and allow the conflict to be solved at the Paris Peace Conference . Afterward , the British provisionally affirmed Azerbaijani statesman <unk> bey <unk> as the governor @-@ general of Karabakh and ordered him to " squash any unrest in the region " . Afterward followed the Shusha massacre of an estimated 20 @,@ 000 Armenians . 
 = = = Soviet division = = = 
 Two months later however , the Soviet 11th Army invaded the Caucasus and within three years , the Caucasian republics were formed into the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union . The Bolsheviks thereafter created a seven @-@ member committee , the Caucasus Bureau ( typically referred to as the Kavburo ) . Under the supervision of the People 's Commissar for Nationalities , the future Soviet ruler Joseph Stalin , the Kavburo was tasked to head up matters in the Caucasus . On 4 July 1921 the committee voted 4 – 3 in favor of allocating Karabakh to the newly created Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia but a day later the Kavburo reversed its decision and voted to leave the region within Azerbaijan SSR . The Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( NKAO ) was created in 1923 , leaving it with a population that was 94 % Armenian . The reversal was substantiated with the economic connections the region had with Azerbaijan . The capital was moved from Shusha to <unk> , which was later renamed as Stepanakert . 
 Armenian and Azeri scholars have speculated that the decision was an application of the principle of " divide and rule " by Soviet Union . This can be seen , for example , by the odd placement of the Nakhichevan exclave , which is separated by Armenia but is a part of Azerbaijan . Others have also postulated that the decision was a goodwill gesture by the Soviet government to help maintain " good relations with Atatürk 's Turkey . " Over the following decades of Soviet rule the Armenians retained a strong desire for unification of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh with Armenia , an aim that some members of the Armenian Communist Party attempted to accomplish . First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia Aghasi <unk> was murdered by Deputy Head ( and soon Head ) of the NKVD Lavrentiy Beria after submitting Armenian grievances to Stalin , which included requests to return Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and Nakhichevan to Armenia . The Armenians insisted that their national rights had been suppressed and their cultural and economic freedoms were being curtailed . 
 = = Revival of the Karabakh issue = = 
 After Stalin 's death , Armenian discontent began to be voiced . In 1963 , around 2 @,@ 500 Karabakh Armenians signed a petition calling for Karabakh to be put under Armenian control or to be transferred to Russia . Also in 1963 , there were violent clashes in Stepanakert , leading to the death of 18 Armenians . In 1965 and 1977 , there were large demonstrations in Yerevan , which also called for unifying Karabakh with Armenia . As the new general secretary of the Soviet Union , Mikhail Gorbachev , came to power in 1985 , he began implementing his plans to reform the Soviet Union . These were encapsulated in two policies : perestroika and glasnost . While perestroika had more to do with economic reform , glasnost or " openness " granted limited freedom to Soviet citizens to express grievances about the Soviet system itself and its leaders . Capitalizing on this new policy of Moscow , the leaders of the Regional Soviet of Karabakh decided to vote in favor of unifying the autonomous region with Armenia on 20 February 1988 . The resolution read : 
 Welcoming the wishes of the workers of the Nagorny Karabakh Autonomous Region to request the Supreme Soviets of the Azerbaijani SSR and the Armenian SSR to display a feeling of deep understanding of the aspirations of the Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh and to resolve the question of transferring the Nagorny Karabakh Autonomous Region from the Azerbaijani SSR to the Armenian SSR , at the same time to intercede with the Supreme Soviet of the USSR to reach a positive resolution on the issue of transferring the region from the Azerbaijani SSR to the Armenian SSR . 
 On 24 February , Boris <unk> , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh autonomous region party secretary and an Azerbaijan loyalist , was dismissed . 
 Karabakh Armenian leaders complained that the region had neither Armenian language textbooks in schools nor in television broadcasting , and that Azerbaijan 's Communist Party General Secretary Heydar Aliyev had extensively attempted to " <unk> " the region and increase the influence and the number of Azeris living in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , while at the same time reducing its Armenian population ( in 1987 , Aliyev would step down as General Secretary of Azerbaijan 's Politburo ) . By 1988 , the Armenian population of Karabakh had dwindled to nearly three @-@ quarters of the total population . 
 The movement was spearheaded by popular Armenian figures and found support among intellectuals in Russia as well . According to journalist Thomas De Waal some members of the Russian intelligentsia , such as the dissident Andrei Sakharov expressed support for Armenians . More prominent support for the movement among the Moscow elite was interpreted by some in the public : in November 1987 L <unk> published the personal comments made by Abel <unk> , an economic adviser to Gorbachev , to Armenians living in France , in which he suggested that Nagorno @-@ Karabakh could be ceded to Armenia . Prior to the declaration , Armenians had begun to protest and stage workers ' strikes in Yerevan , demanding a unification with the enclave . This prompted Azeri counter @-@ protests in Baku . After the demonstrations in Yerevan to demand unification of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh with Armenia began , Gorbachev met with two leaders of the Karabakh movement , Zori <unk> and Silva Kaputikyan on 26 February 1988 . Gorbachev asked them for a one @-@ month moratorium on demonstrations . When Kaputikyan returned to Armenia the same evening , she told the crowds the " Armenians [ had ] triumphed " although Gorbachev hadn 't made any concrete promises . According to Svante Cornell , this was an attempt to pressure Moscow . On March 10 , Gorbachev stated that the borders between the republics would not change , in accordance with Article 78 of the Soviet constitution . Gorbachev also stated that several other regions in the Soviet Union were yearning for territorial changes and redrawing the boundaries in Karabakh would thus set a dangerous precedent . But the Armenians viewed the 1921 Kavburo decision with disdain and felt that in their efforts they were correcting a historical error through the principle of self @-@ determination , a right also granted in the constitution . Azeris , on the other hand , found such calls for relinquishing their territory by the Armenians unfathomable and aligned themselves with Gorbachev 's position . 
 On 19 February 1988 , during the seventh day of the Armenian rallies , the first <unk> was held in Baku . The poet Bakhtiyar <unk> and the historian Suleyman <unk> published an open letter in the newspaper Azerbaijan , declaring that Karabakh was historically Azerbaijani territory . 
 = = = Askeran and Sumgait = = = 
 Ethnic infighting soon broke out between Armenians and Azerbaijanis living in Karabakh . It is claimed as early as the end of 1987 Azerbaijanis from the villages of <unk> and <unk> in Armenia were forced to leave their homes as a result of tensions between them and their Armenian neighbors and in November 1987 two freight cars full of Azerbaijanis are alleged to have arrived at the train station in Baku . In later interviews , the mayors of the two villages denied that any such tension existed at the time and no such documentation has been adduced to support the notion of forced expulsions . 
 On 20 February 1988 two Azerbaijani trainee female students in Stepanakert hospital were allegedly raped by Armenians . On 22 February 1988 a direct confrontation between Azerbaijanis and Armenians , near the town of Askeran ( located on the road between Stepanakert and Agdam ) in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , degenerated into a skirmish . During the clashes two Azerbaijani youths were killed . One of them was probably shot by a local policeman , possibly an Azerbaijani , either by accident or as a result of a quarrel . On 27 February 1988 , while speaking on Baku 's central television , the Soviet Deputy Procurator Alexander <unk> reported that " two inhabitants of the Agdam district fell victim to murder " and gave their Muslim names . 
 The clash in Askeran was the prelude to the pogroms in Sumgait , where emotions , already heightened by news about the Karabakh crisis , turned even uglier in a series of protests starting on 27 February . Speaking at the rallies , Azerbaijani refugees from the Armenian town of <unk> accused Armenians of " murder and atrocities " . According to the Soviet media , these allegations were disproved and many of the speakers were reportedly agents provocateurs . Within hours , a pogrom against Armenian residents began in Sumgait , a city some 25 kilometers north of Baku . The pogroms resulted in the deaths of 32 people ( 26 Armenians and 6 Azerbaijanis ) , according to official Soviet statistics , although many Armenians felt that the true figure was not reported . Nearly all of Sumgait 's Armenian population left the city after the pogrom . Armenians were beaten , raped , mutilated and killed both on the streets of Sumgait and inside their apartments during three days of violence ( with no intervention from the police or the local bodies ) that only subsided when Soviet armed forces entered the city and quelled much of the rioting on 1 March . The manner in which they were killed reverberated among Armenians , recalling memories of the Armenian Genocide . 
 On 23 March 1988 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union rejected the demands of Armenians to cede Nagorno @-@ Karabakh to Armenia . Troops were sent to Yerevan to prevent protests against the decision . Gorbachev 's attempts to stabilize the region were to no avail , as both sides remained equally intransigent . In Armenia , there was a firm belief that what had taken place in the region of Nakhichevan would be repeated in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh : prior to its absorption by Soviet Russia , it had a population which was 40 % Armenian ; by the late 1980s , its Armenian population was virtually non @-@ existent . 
 = = Interethnic violence = = 
 Armenians refused to allow the issue to subside despite a compromise made by Gorbachev , which included a promise of a 400 million @-@ ruble package to introduce Armenian language textbooks and television programming in Karabakh . At the same time , Azerbaijan was unwilling to cede any territory to Armenia . Calls to transfer Karabakh to Armenia briefly subsided when a devastating earthquake hit Armenia on 7 December 1988 , which leveled the towns of Leninakan ( now Gyumri ) and Spitak , killing an estimated 25 @,@ 000 people . But conflict brewed up once more when the eleven members of the newly formed Karabakh Committee , including the future president of Armenia Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan , were jailed by Moscow officials in the ensuing chaos of the earthquake . Such actions polarized relations between Armenia and the Kremlin ; Armenians lost faith in Gorbachev , despising him even more because of his handling of the earthquake relief effort and his uncompromising stance on Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . 
 In the months following the Sumgait pogroms , a forced population exchange took place as Armenians living in Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis living in Armenia were compelled to abandon their homes . According to the Azerbaijani government , between 27 and 29 November 1988 33 Azerbaijanis were killed in Spitak , Gugark , and <unk> and 216 in the 1987 – 1989 period . According to Azerbaijani MP Arif <unk> in November of the same year twenty Azerbaijanis from the Armenian village of Vartan were reportedly burned to death . However , according to Armenian sources , the number of Azerbaijanis killed in the 1988 – 1989 period was 25 . 
 Interethnic fighting also spread throughout cities in Azerbaijan , including , in December 1988 , in <unk> and Nakhichevan , where seven people ( among them four soldiers ) were killed and hundreds injured when Soviet army units attempted once more to stop attacks directed at Armenians . Estimates differ on how many people were killed during the first two years of the conflict . The Azerbaijani government alleges that 216 Azerbaijanis were killed in Armenia , while the researcher Arif <unk> gives 127 to those killed in 1988 alone . An October 1989 piece by Time , however , stated that over 100 people were estimated to have been killed since February 1988 , in both Armenia and Azerbaijan . 
 By the end of 1988 , dozens of villages in Armenia had become deserted , as most of Armenia 's more than 200 @,@ 000 Azerbaijanis and Muslim Kurds left . While Muslim Kurds did not take up arms against Armenians , almost all of them fled their homes from the Armenian controlled areas ( at most , 1 @,@ 000 Muslim Kurds are estimated to remain in Armenia today ) . 
 = = = Black January = = = 
 Inter @-@ ethnic strife began to take a toll on both countries ' populations , forcing most of the Armenians in Azerbaijan to flee to Armenia and most of the Azeris in Armenia to Azerbaijan . The situation in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh had grown so out of hand that in January 1989 the central government in Moscow temporarily took control of the region , a move welcomed by many Armenians . In September 1989 , Popular Front ( APF ) leaders and their ever @-@ increasing supporters managed to institute a railway blockade against Armenia and the NKAO , effectively crippling Armenia 's economy , as 85 % of the cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic , although some claim this was a response to Armenia 's embargo against Nakhichevan ASSR that had started earlier that summer . The disruption of rail service to Armenia was , accordingly , in part due to the attacks of Armenian militants on Azerbaijani train crews entering Armenia . 
 In January 1990 , another pogrom directed at Armenians in Baku forced Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency and send troops from the MVD to restore order . Amid the rising independence movement in Azerbaijan , Gorbachev dispatched the military to dragoon the events , as the Soviet regime inched closer to collapse . Soviet troops received orders to occupy Baku at midnight on January 20 , 1990 . City residents , who saw tanks coming at about 5 AM , said the troops were the first to open fire . The Shield Report , an independent commission from the USSR military procurator 's office , rejected the military claims of returning fire , finding no evidence that those manning the barricades on the roads to Baku were armed . A curfew was established and violent clashes between the soldiers and the surging Azerbaijan Popular Front were common , in the end leading to the deaths of 120 Azerbaijanis and eight MVD soldiers in Baku . During this time , however , Azerbaijan 's Communist Party had fallen and the belated order to send the MVD forces had more to do with keeping the Party in power than with protecting the city 's Armenian population . The events , referred to as " Black January " , also strained the relations between Azerbaijan and the central government . 
 = = = Fighting in <unk> = = = 
 Azerbaijan has several exclaves within the territory of Armenia : <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in the northwest and an exclave of <unk> in the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan Republic . In early 1990 , the road alongside the border village of <unk> came under routine attack by militia members from Azerbaijan . At the same time , Armenian forces attacked both these Azerbaijani enclaves within the Armenian territory and the border villages of <unk> and <unk> rayon in Azerbaijan proper . On 26 March 1990 several cars with Armenian paramilitaries arrived in the Armenian border village of <unk> . At dusk , they crossed the border storming the Azerbaijani village Bağanis Ayrum . About 20 houses were burned and 8 to 11 Azerbaijani villagers killed . The bodies of members of one family , including infants , were found in the charred ruins of their burned homes . By the time the Soviet Interior Ministry troops arrived in Bağanis Ayrum , the attackers had already fled . 
 On 18 August a significant accumulation of Armenian militants near the border was observed . The following day , units of the Armenian national army bombarded Azeri villages <unk> Əskipara , Bağanis Ayrum , <unk> Əskipara and <unk> <unk> , and according to eyewitnesses used rocket @-@ propelled grenades and mortars . The first attack was repulsed with additional reinforcements arriving from Yerevan , Armenian forces were able to seize <unk> Əskipara and Bağanis Ayrum . On 20 August tanks , anti @-@ aircraft guns and helicopter gunships of the Soviet army under the command of Major General Yuri <unk> were brought in and by the end of the day the Armenians were driven off . According to the Soviet Ministry of Interior , one internal ministry officer and two police officers were killed , nine soldiers and thirteen residents were injured . According to Armenian media reports , five militants were killed and 25 were wounded ; according to Azerbaijani media , about 30 were killed and 100 wounded . 
 = = = Operation Ring = = = 
 In the spring of 1991 , President Gorbachev held a special countrywide referendum called the Union Treaty which would decide if the Soviet republics would remain together . Newly elected , non @-@ communist leaders had come to power in the Soviet republics , including Boris Yeltsin in Russia ( Gorbachev remained the President of the Soviet Union ) , Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan in Armenia , and Ayaz Mutalibov in Azerbaijan . Armenia and five other republics boycotted the referendum ( Armenia would hold its own referendum and declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 21 September 1991 ) , whereas Azerbaijan voted in compliance to the Treaty . 
 As many Armenians and Azeris in Karabakh began an arms build up ( by acquiring weaponry located in caches throughout Karabakh ) in order to defend themselves , Mutalibov turned to Gorbachev for support in launching a joint military operation in order to disarm Armenian militants in the region . Termed Operation Ring , Soviet forces acting in conjunction with the local Azerbaijani OMON forcibly deported Armenians living in the villages of the region of Shahumyan . The operation involved the use of ground troops , military , armored vehicles and artillery . The deportations of the Armenian civilians were carried out with gross human rights violations documented by international human rights organizations . 
 Ring was perceived by both Soviet and Armenian government officials as a method of intimidating the Armenian populace to giving up their demands for unification . Operation Ring proved counter @-@ productive to what it had originally sought to accomplish . The violence that took place during the operation only reinforced the belief among Armenians that the only solution to the Karabakh conflict was through armed resistance . The initial Armenian resistance inspired volunteers to start forming irregular volunteer detachments .

 First peace mediation efforts were started by the Russian President , Boris Yeltsin and Kazakhstan President , Nursultan Nazarbayev in September 1991 . After peace talks in Baku , Ganja , Stepanakert ( <unk> ) and Yerevan on 20 – 23 September , the sides agreed to sign the <unk> Communiqué in the Russian city of <unk> taking the principles of territorial integrity , non @-@ interference in internal affairs of sovereign states , observance of civil rights as a base of the agreement . The agreement was signed by Yeltsin , Nazarbayev , Mutalibov , and Ter @-@ Petrosian . The peace efforts came to a halt due to continuing bombardment and atrocities by Azerbaijani OMON in Stepanakert and <unk> in late September . With the final blow being the Azerbaijani MI @-@ 8 helicopter shoot down near the village of <unk> in the Martuni District with peace mediating team consisting of Russian , Kazakh observers and Azerbaijani high @-@ ranking officials on board . 
 = = = Conflict in the last days of the USSR = = = 
 In late 1991 , Armenian militias launched offensives to capture Armenian @-@ populated villages seized by Azerbaijani OMON in May – July 1991 . Leaving these villages , the Azerbaijani units in some cases burned them . According to the Moscow @-@ based Human Rights organization Memorial , at the same time , as a result of attacks by Armenian armed forces , several thousand residents of Azerbaijani villages in the former <unk> , <unk> , Martakert , Askeran , Martuni rayons of Azerbaijan had to leave their homes , too . Some villages ( e.g. , Imereti and <unk> ) were burned by the militants . There were instances of serious violence against the civilian population ( in particular , in the village <unk> ) . 
 Starting in late autumn of 1991 , when the Azerbaijani side started its counter @-@ offensive , the Armenian side began targeting Azerbaijani villages . According to Memorial , the villages <unk> and <unk> , from which Azeri forces regularly bombarded Stepanakert , were attacked by Armenians where the houses were burned and dozens of civilians were killed . Each side accused the other of using the villages as strategic gathering points , covering the artillery positions . On 19 December , Internal Ministry troops began to withdraw from Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , which was completed by 27 December . With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of internal troops from Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , the situation in the conflict zone became uncontrollable . 
 = = Weapons vacuum = = 
 As the disintegration of the Soviet Union became a reality for Soviet citizens in the autumn of 1991 , both sides sought to acquire weaponry from military caches located throughout Karabakh . The initial advantage tilted in Azerbaijan 's favor . During the Cold War , the Soviet military doctrine for defending the Caucasus had outlined a strategy where Armenia would be a combat zone in the event that NATO member Turkey were to have invaded from the west . Thus , there were only three divisions stationed in the Armenian SSR and no airfields , while Azerbaijan had a total of five divisions and five military airfields . Furthermore , Armenia had approximately 500 railroad cars of ammunition in comparison to Azerbaijan 's 10 @,@ 000 . 
 As MVD forces began pulling out , they bequeathed the Armenians and Azerbaijanis a vast arsenal of ammunition and stored armored vehicles . The government forces initially sent by Gorbachev three years earlier were from other republics of the Soviet Union and many had no wish to remain any longer . Most were poor , young conscripts and many simply sold their weapons for cash or even vodka to either side , some even trying to sell tanks and armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) . The unsecured weapons caches led both sides to blame Gorbachev 's policies as the ultimate cause of the conflict . The Azerbaijanis purchased a large quantity of these vehicles , as reported by the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan in November 1993 , which reported it had acquired 286 tanks , 842 armored vehicles , and 386 artillery pieces during the power vacuum . The emergence of black markets helped facilitate the import of Western weaponry . 
 Most weaponry was Russian @-@ made or came from the former Eastern bloc countries ; however , some improvisation was made by both sides . Azerbaijan received substantial military aid and provisions from Turkey , Israel and numerous Arab countries . The Armenian Diaspora donated a significant amount of aid to Armenia through the course of the war and even managed to push for legislation in the United States Congress to pass a bill entitled Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act in response to Azerbaijan 's blockade against Armenia , placing a complete ban on military aid from the United States to Azerbaijan in 1992 . While Azerbaijan charged that the Russians were initially helping the Armenians , it was said that " the Azeri fighters in the region [ were ] far better equipped with Soviet military weaponry than their opponents . " 
 With Gorbachev resigning as Soviet General @-@ Secretary on 26 December 1991 , the remaining republics including Ukraine , Belarus , and Russia , declared their independence and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on 31 December 1991 . This dissolution gave way to any barriers that were keeping Armenia and Azerbaijan from waging a full @-@ scale war . One month prior , on 21 November , the Azerbaijani Parliament had rescinded Karabakh 's status as an autonomous region and renamed its capital " <unk> . " In response , on 10 December , a referendum was held in Karabakh by parliamentary leaders ( with the local Azerbaijani community boycotting it ) , whereby the Armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence . On 6 January 1992 , the region declared its independence from Azerbaijan . 
 The withdrawal of the Soviet interior forces from Nagorno @-@ Karabakh in the Caucasus region was only temporary . By February 1992 , the former Soviet states were consolidated as the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) . While Azerbaijan abstained from joining , Armenia , fearing a possible invasion by Turkey in the escalating conflict , entered the CIS , which brought it under the organization 's " collective security umbrella . " In January 1992 , CIS forces established their new headquarters at Stepanakert and took up a slightly more active role in peacekeeping , incorporating old units , including the 366th Motorized Rifle Regiment and elements of the Soviet 4th Army .

 The sporadic battles between Armenians and Azeris had intensified after Operation Ring recruited thousands of volunteers into improvised armies from both Armenia and Azerbaijan . In Armenia , a recurrent and popular theme at the time compared and idolized the separatist fighters to historical Armenian guerrilla groups and revered individuals such as Andranik Ozanian and Garegin Nzhdeh , who fought against the Ottoman Empire during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . In addition to the government 's conscription of males aged 18 – 45 , many Armenians volunteered to fight and formed <unk> , or detachments of about forty men , which , combined with several others , came under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel . Initially , many of these men chose when and where to serve and acted on their own behalf , rarely with any oversight , when attacking or defending areas . Direct insubordination was common as many of the men simply did not show up , looted the bodies of dead soldiers and commodities such as diesel oil for armored vehicles disappeared only to be sold in black markets . 
 Many women enlisted in the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh military , taking part in the fighting as well as serving in auxiliary roles such as providing first @-@ aid and evacuating wounded men from the battlefield . 
 Azerbaijan 's military functioned in much the same manner ; however , it was better organized during the first years of the war . The Azeri government also carried out conscription and many Azeris enthusiastically enlisted for combat in the first months after the Soviet Union collapsed . Azerbaijan 's National Army consisted of roughly 30 @,@ 000 men , in addition to nearly 10 @,@ 000 in its OMON paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from the Popular Front . Suret Huseynov , a wealthy Azeri , also improvised by creating his own military brigade , the 709th of the Azerbaijani Army and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from the 23rd Motor Rifle Division 's arsenal . <unk> <unk> 's <unk> or Grey Wolves brigade also mobilized for action . The government of Azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through the revenue it was making from its oil field assets on and near the Caspian Sea . 
 Former troops of the Soviet Union also offered their services to either side . For example , one of the most prominent officers to serve on the Armenian side was former Soviet General Anatoly <unk> , who remained in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh for five years ( 1992 – 1997 ) and was involved in planning and implementation of many operations of the Armenian forces . By the end of war he held the position of Chief of Staff of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic ( NKR ) armed forces . The estimated amount of manpower and military vehicles each entity involved in the conflict had in the 1993 – 1994 time period was : 
 Because at the time Armenia did not have the kind of far reaching treaties with Russia ( signed later in 1997 and 2010 ) , and because CSTO did not exist then , Armenia had to protect its border with Turkey by itself . For the duration of the war most of the military personnel and equipment of the Republic of Armenia stayed in Armenia proper guarding the Armenian @-@ Turkish border against possible aggression . 
 In an overall military comparison , the number of men eligible for military service in Armenia , in the age group of 17 – 32 , totalled 550 @,@ 000 , while in Azerbaijan it was 1 @.@ 3 million . Most men from both sides had served in the Soviet Army and so had some form of military experience prior to the conflict , including tours of duty in Afghanistan . Among Karabakh Armenians , about 60 % had served in the Soviet Army . Most Azeris , however , were often subject to discrimination during their service in the Soviet military and relegated to work in construction battalions rather than fighting corps . Despite the establishment of two officer academies including a naval school in Azerbaijan , the lack of such military experience was one factor that rendered Azerbaijan unprepared for the war . The Azerbaijani military was assisted by Afghan commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . The recruitment for the purpose was mostly made in Peshawar by commander Fazle Haq Mujahid and several groups were dispatched to Azerbaijan for different duties .

 On 2 January 1992 Ayaz Mutalibov assumed the office of the presidency of Azerbaijan . Officially , the newly created Republic of Armenia publicly denied any involvement in providing any weapons , fuel , food , or other logistics to the secessionists in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . However , Ter @-@ Petrosyan later did admit to supplying them with logistical supplies and paying the salaries of the separatists , but denied sending any of its own men to combat . Armenia faced a debilitating blockade by the now Republic of Azerbaijan , as well as pressure from neighboring Turkey , which decided to side with Azerbaijan and build a closer relationship with it . In early February , the Azeri villages of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were conquered and their population evicted , leading to at least 99 civilian deaths and 140 wounded . 
 The only land connection Armenia had with Karabakh was through the narrow mountainous Lachin corridor which could only be reached by helicopters . The region 's only airport was in the small town of Khojaly , which was seven km ( 4 @.@ 3 miles ) north of capital Stepanakert with an estimated population of 6 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 people . Additionally , Khojaly had been serving as an artillery base from which GRAD missiles were launched upon the civilian population of capital Stepanakert : On some days as many as 400 GRAD missiles rained down on Armenian multi- storey apartments . By late February , the Armenian forces reportedly warned about the upcoming attack and issued an ultimatum that unless the Azerbaijanis stopped the shelling from Khojaly they would seize the town . 
 By late February , Khojaly had largely been cut off . On 26 February , Armenian forces , with the aid of some armored vehicles from the 366th , mounted an offensive to capture Khojaly . According to the Azerbaijani side and the affirmation of other sources including Human Rights Watch , the Moscow @-@ based human rights organization Memorial and the biography of a leading Armenian commander , Monte Melkonian , documented and published by his brother , after Armenian forces captured Khojaly , they proceeded to kill several hundred civilians evacuating from the town . Armenian forces had previously stated they would attack the city and leave a land corridor for them to escape through . However , when the attack began , the attacking Armenian force easily outnumbered and overwhelmed the defenders who along with the civilians attempted to retreat north to the Azeri held city of Agdam . The airport 's runway was found to have been intentionally destroyed , rendering it temporarily useless . The attacking forces then went on to pursue those fleeing through the corridor and opened fire upon them , killing scores of civilians . Facing charges of an intentional massacre of civilians by international groups , Armenian government officials denied the occurrence of a massacre and asserted an objective of silencing the artillery coming from Khojaly . 
 An exact body count was never ascertained but conservative estimates have placed the number to 485 . The official death toll according to Azerbaijani authorities for casualties suffered during the events of 25 – 26 February is 613 civilians , of them 106 women and 83 children . On 3 March 1992 , the Boston Globe reported over 1 @,@ 000 people had been slain over four years of conflict . It quoted the mayor of Khojaly , Elmar <unk> , as also saying 200 more were missing , 300 were held hostage and 200 injured in the fighting . A report published in 1992 by the human rights organization Helsinki Watch however stated that their inquiry found that the Azerbaijani OMON and " the militia , still in uniform and some still carrying their guns , were interspersed with the masses of civilians " which may have been the reason why Armenian troops fired upon them . 
 Under pressure from the APF due to the mismanagement of the defense of Khojaly and the safety of its inhabitants , <unk> was forced to submit his resignation to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan . 
 = = = Capture of Shusha = = = 
 When Armenians launched one of the first offensives , at Stepanakert on 13 February 1988 , many Azerbaijanis fled to the stronghold of Shusha . On 28 March , Azerbaijani troops deployed to attack Stepanakert , attacked enemy positions above the village <unk> from the village of <unk> . During the afternoon of the next day , Azerbaijani units took up positions in close proximity to the city , but were quickly repulsed by the Armenians . 
 In the ensuing months after the capture of Khojaly , Azeri commanders holding out in the region 's last bastion of Shusha began a large @-@ scale artillery bombardment with GRAD rocket launchers against Stepanakert . By April , the shelling had forced many of the 50 @,@ 000 people living in Stepanakert to seek refuge in underground bunkers and basements . Facing ground incursions near the city 's outlying areas , military leaders in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh organized an offensive to take the town . 
 On 8 May a force of several hundred Armenian troops accompanied by tanks and helicopters attacked the Azeri citadel of Shusha . Fierce fighting took place in the town 's streets and several hundred men were killed on both sides . Although the Armenians were outnumbered and outgunned by the Azeri army , they managed to capture the town and force the Azeris to retreat on 9 May . 
 The capture of Shusha resonated loudly in neighboring Turkey . Its relations with Armenia had grown better after it had declared its independence from the Soviet Union ; however , they gradually worsened as a result of Armenia 's gains in the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh region . Turkey 's prime minister Suleyman Demirel said that he was under intense pressure by his people to have his country intervene and aid Azerbaijan . Demirel , however , was opposed to such an intervention , saying that Turkey 's entrance into the war would trigger an even greater Muslim @-@ Christian conflict ( Turks are overwhelmingly Muslims ) . 
 Turkey never did send troops to Azerbaijan but did contribute substantial military aid and advisers . In May 1992 , the military commander of the CIS forces , Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov , issued a warning to Western nations , especially the United States , to not interfere with the conflict in the Caucasus , stating it would " place us [ the Commonwealth ] on the verge of a third world war and that cannot be allowed . " 
 A Chechen contingent , led by <unk> Basayev , was one of the units to participate in the conflict . According to Azeri Colonel <unk> <unk> , in 1992 , " hundreds of Chechen volunteers rendered us invaluable help in these battles led by <unk> Basayev and Salman <unk> . " Basayev was said to be one of the last fighters to leave Shusha . According to Russian news reports Basayev later said during his career , he and his battalion had only lost once and that defeat came in Karabakh in fighting against the " Dashnak battalion . " He later said he pulled his forces out of the conflict because the war seemed to be more for nationalism than for religion . Basayev received direct military training from the Russian GRU during the War in Abkhazia ( 1992 – 1993 ) since the Abkhaz were backed by Russia . Other Chechens also were trained by the GRU in warfare . Many of these Chechens who fought for the Russians in Abkhazia against Georgia had fought for Azerbaijan against Armenia in the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh war .

 The loss of Shusha led the Azeri parliament to lay the blame on Yaqub Mammadov , then acting President of Azerbaijan , which removed him from power and cleared Mutalibov of any responsibility after the loss of Khojaly , reinstating him as President on 15 May 1992 . Many Azeris saw this act as a coup in addition to the cancellation of the parliamentary elections slated in June of that year . The Azeri parliament at that time was made up of former leaders from the country 's communist regime and the losses of Khojaly and Shusha only <unk> their desires for free elections . 
 To contribute to the turmoil , an offensive was launched by Armenian forces on 18 May to take the city of Lachin in the narrow corridor separating Armenia and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . The city itself was poorly guarded and , within the next day , Armenian forces took control of the town and cleared any remaining Azeris to open the road that linked the region to Armenia . The taking of the city then allowed an overland route to be connected with Armenia itself with supply convoys beginning to trek up the mountainous region of Lachin to Karabakh . 
 The loss of Lachin was the final blow to Mutalibov 's regime . Demonstrations were held despite Mutalibov 's ban and an armed coup was staged by Popular Front activists . Fighting between government forces and Popular Front supporters escalated as the political opposition seized the parliament building in Baku as well as the airport and presidential office . On 16 June 1992 Abulfaz Elchibey was elected leader of Azerbaijan with many political leaders from the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party were elected into the parliament . The instigators characterized Mutalibov as an <unk> and weak leader in the war in Karabakh . Elchibey was staunchly against receiving any help from the Russians , instead favoring closer ties to Turkey . 
 The fighting also spilled into nearby Nakhchivan , which was shelled by Armenian troops in May 1992 .

 Operation Goranboy was a large @-@ scale Azerbaijani offensive in the summer of 1992 aimed at taking control over the entire Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and putting a decisive end to the resistance . This offensive is regarded as the only successful breakthrough by the Azeri Army and marks the peak of <unk> success in the entirety of the six @-@ year @-@ long conflict . It also marks the beginning of a new , more intense , phase of the war . Over 8 @,@ 000 Azeri troops and four additional battalions , at least 90 tanks and 70 Infantry fighting vehicles , as well as Mi @-@ 24 attack @-@ helicopters were used in this operation . 
 On 12 June 1992 , the Azerbaijani military launched a large @-@ scale diversionary attack in the direction of the Askeran region at the center of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . Two groups , numbering 4 @,@ 000 men , attacked the positions to the north and south of Askeran . As a result of fierce fighting the Azeris managed to establish control over some settlements in the Askeran region : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 On 13 June 1992 , Azerbaijan launched its main offensive against the region of Goranboy , located north of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , which was defended by just two small and poorly @-@ equipped Armenian voluntary detachments . This three @-@ day offensive was code @-@ named Operation Goranboy and commanded by Suret Huseynov . After fifteen hours of fierce fighting against Azerbaijani forces , the two Armenian detachments were forced to retreat . Azerbaijan managed to capture several dozen villages in the Goranboy region originally held by the Armenian forces , and the entire Armenian civilian population of this region fled . On 4 July 1992 , the Azeris captured the largest town in the region , Mardakert . 
 The scale of the Azeri offensive prompted the Armenian government to threaten Azerbaijan that it would directly intervene and assist the separatists fighting in Karabakh . The assault forced Armenian forces to retreat south toward Stepanakert where Karabakh commanders contemplated destroying a vital hydroelectric dam in the Martakert region if the offensive was not halted . An estimated 30 @,@ 000 Armenian refugees were also forced to flee to the capital as the assaulting forces had taken nearly half of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh .
