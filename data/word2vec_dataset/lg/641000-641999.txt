 The best known approximations to π dating before the Common Era were accurate to two decimal places ; this was improved upon in Chinese mathematics in particular by the mid first millennium , to an accuracy of seven decimal places . After this , no further progress was made until the late medieval period . 
 Some Egyptologists have claimed that the ancient Egyptians used an approximation of π as 22 / 7 from as early as the Old Kingdom . This claim has met with skepticism . 
 The earliest written approximations of π are found in Egypt and Babylon , both within one percent of the true value . In Babylon , a clay tablet dated 1900 – 1600 BC has a geometrical statement that , by implication , treats π as 25 / 8 = 3 @.@ 125 . In Egypt , the Rhind Papyrus , dated around 1650 BC but copied from a document dated to 1850 BC , has a formula for the area of a circle that treats π as ( 16 / 9 ) 2 ≈ 3 @.@ 1605 . 
 Astronomical calculations in the Shatapatha Brahmana ( ca . 4th century BC ) use a fractional approximation of 339 / 108 ≈ 3 @.@ 139 ( an accuracy of 9 × 10 − 4 ) . Other Indian sources by about 150 BC treat π as √ 10 ≈ 3 @.@ 1622 . 
 = = = Polygon approximation era = = = 
 The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of π was a geometrical approach using polygons , devised around 250 BC by the Greek mathematician Archimedes . This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1 @,@ 000 years , and as a result π is sometimes referred to as " Archimedes ' constant " . Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of π by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle , and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96 @-@ sided regular polygon . By calculating the perimeters of these polygons , he proved that 223 / 71 < π < 22 / 7 ( that is 3 @.@ 1408 < π < 3 @.@ 1429 ) . Archimedes ' upper bound of 22 / 7 may have led to a widespread popular belief that π is equal to 22 / 7 . Around 150 AD , Greek @-@ Roman scientist Ptolemy , in his Almagest , gave a value for π of 3 @.@ 1416 , which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from Apollonius of Perga . Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of π in 1630 , a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits . 
 In ancient China , values for π included 3 @.@ 1547 ( around 1 AD ) , √ 10 ( 100 AD , approximately 3 @.@ 1623 ) , and 142 / 45 ( 3rd century , approximately 3 @.@ 1556 ) . Around 265 AD , the Wei Kingdom mathematician Liu Hui created a polygon @-@ based iterative algorithm and used it with a 3 @,@ 072 @-@ sided polygon to obtain a value of π of 3 @.@ 1416 . Liu later invented a faster method of calculating π and obtained a value of 3 @.@ 14 with a 96 @-@ sided polygon , by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor of 4 . The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi , around 480 AD , calculated that π ≈ 355 / 113 ( a fraction that goes by the name <unk> in Chinese ) , using Liu Hui 's algorithm applied to a 12 @,@ 288 @-@ sided polygon . With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits , this value of 3 @.@ <unk> ... remained the most accurate approximation of π available for the next 800 years . 
 The Indian astronomer Aryabhata used a value of 3 @.@ 1416 in his <unk> ( 499 AD ) . Fibonacci in c . 1220 computed 3 @.@ 1418 using a polygonal method , independent of Archimedes . Italian author Dante apparently employed the value 3 + √ 2 / 10 ≈ 3 @.@ <unk> . 
 The Persian astronomer <unk> al @-@ <unk> produced 9 sexagesimal digits , roughly the equivalent of 16 decimal digits , in 1424 using a polygon with 3 × 228 sides , which stood as the world record for about 180 years . French mathematician François Viète in 1579 achieved 9 digits with a polygon of 3 × 217 sides . Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593 . In 1596 , Dutch mathematician <unk> van <unk> reached 20 digits , a record he later increased to 35 digits ( as a result , π was called the " <unk> number " in Germany until the early 20th century ) . Dutch scientist Willebrord Snellius reached 34 digits in 1621 , and Austrian astronomer Christoph <unk> arrived at 38 digits in 1630 using 1040 sides , which remains the most accurate approximation manually achieved using polygonal algorithms . 
 = = = Infinite series = = = 
 The calculation of π was revolutionized by the development of infinite series techniques in the 16th and 17th centuries . An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence . Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute π with much greater precision than Archimedes and others who used geometrical techniques . Although infinite series were exploited for π most notably by European mathematicians such as James Gregory and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , the approach was first discovered in India sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD . The first written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute π was laid out in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in his <unk> , around 1500 AD . The series are presented without proof , but proofs are presented in a later Indian work , <unk> , from around 1530 AD . Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician , Madhava of <unk> , who lived c . 1350 – c . 1425 . Several infinite series are described , including series for sine , tangent , and cosine , which are now referred to as the Madhava series or Gregory – Leibniz series . Madhava used infinite series to estimate π to 11 digits around 1400 , but that value was improved on around 1430 by the Persian mathematician <unk> al @-@ <unk> , using a polygonal algorithm . 
 The first infinite sequence discovered in Europe was an infinite product ( rather than an infinite sum , which are more typically used in π calculations ) found by French mathematician François Viète in 1593 : 
 <formula> <unk> 
 The second infinite sequence found in Europe , by John Wallis in 1655 , was also an infinite product : 
 <formula> 
 The discovery of calculus , by English scientist Isaac Newton and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 1660s , led to the development of many infinite series for approximating π . Newton himself used an <unk> series to compute a 15 digit approximation of π in 1665 or 1666 , later writing " I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations , having no other business at the time . " 
 In Europe , Madhava 's formula was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician James Gregory in 1671 , and by Leibniz in 1674 : 
 <formula> 
 This formula , the Gregory – Leibniz series , equals π / 4 when evaluated with z = 1 . In 1699 , English mathematician Abraham Sharp used the Gregory – Leibniz series for <formula> to compute π to 71 digits , breaking the previous record of 39 digits , which was set with a polygonal algorithm . The Gregory – Leibniz for <formula> series is simple , but converges very slowly ( that is , approaches the answer gradually ) , so it is not used in modern π calculations . 
 In 1706 John Machin used the Gregory – Leibniz series to produce an algorithm that converged much faster : 
 <formula> 
 Machin reached 100 digits of π with this formula . Other mathematicians created variants , now known as Machin @-@ like formulae , that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of π . Machin @-@ like formulae remained the best @-@ known method for calculating π well into the age of computers , and were used to set records for 250 years , culminating in a 620 @-@ digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson – the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device . 
 A record was set by the calculating prodigy Zacharias <unk> , who in 1844 employed a Machin @-@ like formula to calculate 200 decimals of π in his head at the behest of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss . British mathematician William Shanks famously took 15 years to calculate π to 707 digits , but made a mistake in the 528th digit , rendering all subsequent digits incorrect . 
 = = = = Rate of convergence = = = = 
 Some infinite series for π converge faster than others . Given the choice of two infinite series for π , mathematicians will generally use the one that converges more rapidly because faster convergence reduces the amount of computation needed to calculate π to any given accuracy . A simple infinite series for π is the Gregory – Leibniz series : 
 <formula> 
 As individual terms of this infinite series are added to the sum , the total gradually gets closer to π , and – with a sufficient number of terms – can get as close to π as desired . It converges quite slowly , though – after 500 @,@ 000 terms , it produces only five correct decimal digits of π . 
 An infinite series for π ( published by Nilakantha in the 15th century ) that converges more rapidly than the Gregory – Leibniz series is : 
 <formula> 
 The following table compares the convergence rates of these two series : 
 After five terms , the sum of the Gregory – Leibniz series is within 0 @.@ 2 of the correct value of π , whereas the sum of Nilakantha 's series is within 0 @.@ 002 of the correct value of π . Nilakantha 's series converges faster and is more useful for computing digits of π . Series that converge even faster include Machin 's series and Chudnovsky 's series , the latter producing 14 correct decimal digits per term . 
 = = = Irrationality and transcendence = = = 
 Not all mathematical advances relating to π were aimed at increasing the accuracy of approximations . When Euler solved the Basel problem in 1735 , finding the exact value of the sum of the reciprocal squares , he established a connection between π and the prime numbers that later contributed to the development and study of the Riemann zeta function : 
 <formula> 
 Swiss scientist Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1761 proved that π is irrational , meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers . Lambert 's proof exploited a continued @-@ fraction representation of the tangent function . French mathematician Adrien @-@ Marie Legendre proved in 1794 that π2 is also irrational . In 1882 , German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that π is transcendental , confirming a conjecture made by both Legendre and Euler . Hardy and Wright states that " the proofs were afterwards modified and simplified by Hilbert , Hurwitz , and other writers " . 
 = = = Adoption of the symbol π = = = 
 The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in his 1706 work Synopsis <unk> <unk> ; or , a New Introduction to the Mathematics . The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase " 1 / 2 Periphery ( π ) " in the discussion of a circle with radius one . Jones may have chosen π because it was the first letter in the Greek spelling of the word periphery . However , he writes that his equations for π are from the " ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin " , leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones . It had indeed been used earlier for geometric concepts . William Oughtred used π and δ , the Greek letter equivalents of p and d , to express ratios of periphery and diameter in the 1647 and later editions of <unk> Mathematicae . 
 After Jones introduced the Greek letter in 1706 , it was not adopted by other mathematicians until Euler started using it , beginning with his 1736 work Mechanica . Before then , mathematicians sometimes used letters such as c or p instead . Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe , the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly . In 1748 , Euler used π in his widely read work Introductio in analysin infinitorum ( he wrote : " for the sake of brevity we will write this number as π ; thus π is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius 1 " ) and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world . 
 = = Modern quest for more digits = = 
 = = = Computer era and iterative algorithms = = = 
 The development of computers in the mid @-@ 20th century again revolutionized the hunt for digits of π . American mathematicians John Wrench and Levi Smith reached 1 @,@ 120 digits in 1949 using a desk calculator . Using an inverse tangent ( arctan ) infinite series , a team led by George <unk> and John von Neumann that same year achieved 2 @,@ 037 digits with a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time on the ENIAC computer . The record , always relying on an arctan series , was broken repeatedly ( 7 @,@ 480 digits in 1957 ; 10 @,@ 000 digits in 1958 ; 100 @,@ 000 digits in 1961 ) until 1 million digits were reached in 1973 . 
 Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute π . First , the discovery of new iterative algorithms for computing π , which were much faster than the infinite series ; and second , the invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers very rapidly . Such algorithms are particularly important in modern π computations , because most of the computer 's time is devoted to multiplication . They include the <unk> algorithm , <unk> – Cook multiplication , and Fourier transform @-@ based methods . 
 The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975 – 1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard Brent . These avoid reliance on infinite series . An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation , each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs , and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value . The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss , in what is now termed the arithmetic – geometric mean method ( AGM method ) or Gauss – Legendre algorithm . As modified by Salamin and Brent , it is also referred to as the Brent – Salamin algorithm . 
 The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms : whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms , iterative algorithms generally multiply the number of correct digits at each step . For example , the Brent @-@ Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration . In 1984 , the Canadian brothers John and Peter <unk> produced an iterative algorithm that <unk> the number of digits in each step ; and in 1987 , one that increases the number of digits five times in each step . Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician Yasumasa Kanada to set several records for computing π between 1995 and 2002 . This rapid convergence comes at a price : the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series . 
 = = = Motivations for computing π = = = 
 For most numerical calculations involving π , a handful of digits provide sufficient precision . According to Jörg Arndt and Christoph <unk> , thirty @-@ nine digits are sufficient to perform most cosmological calculations , because that is the accuracy necessary to calculate the circumference of the observable universe with a precision of one atom . Despite this , people have worked strenuously to compute π to thousands and millions of digits . This effort may be partly ascribed to the human compulsion to break records , and such achievements with π often make headlines around the world . They also have practical benefits , such as testing supercomputers , testing numerical analysis algorithms ( including high @-@ precision multiplication algorithms ) ; and within pure mathematics itself , providing data for evaluating the randomness of the digits of π . 
 = = = Rapidly convergent series = = = 
 Modern π calculators do not use iterative algorithms exclusively . New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms , yet are simpler and less memory intensive . The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914 , when the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan published dozens of innovative new formulae for π , remarkable for their elegance , mathematical depth , and rapid convergence . One of his formulae , based on modular equations , is 
 <formula> 
 This series converges much more rapidly than most arctan series , including Machin 's formula . Bill <unk> was the first to use it for advances in the calculation of π , setting a record of 17 million digits in 1985 . Ramanujan 's formulae anticipated the modern algorithms developed by the <unk> brothers and the Chudnovsky brothers . The Chudnovsky formula developed in 1987 is 
 <formula> 
 It produces about 14 digits of π per term , and has been used for several record @-@ setting π calculations , including the first to surpass 1 billion ( 109 ) digits in 1989 by the Chudnovsky brothers , 2 @.@ 7 trillion ( 2 @.@ 7 × 1012 ) digits by Fabrice Bellard in 2009 , and 10 trillion ( 1013 ) digits in 2011 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo . For similar formulas , see also the Ramanujan – Sato series . 
 In 2006 , Canadian mathematician Simon Plouffe used the <unk> integer relation algorithm to generate several new formulas for π , conforming to the following template : 
 <formula> 
 where q is <unk> ( Gelfond 's constant ) , k is an odd number , and a , b , c are certain rational numbers that Plouffe computed . 
 = = = Monte Carlo methods = = = 
 Monte Carlo methods , which evaluate the results of multiple random trials , can be used to create approximations of π . Buffon 's needle is one such technique : If a needle of length ℓ is dropped n times on a surface on which parallel lines are drawn t units apart , and if x of those times it comes to rest crossing a line ( x > 0 ) , then one may approximate π based on the counts : 
 <formula> 
 Another Monte Carlo method for computing π is to draw a circle inscribed in a square , and randomly place dots in the square . The ratio of dots inside the circle to the total number of dots will approximately equal π / 4 . 
 Another way to calculate π using probability is to start with a random walk , generated by a sequence of ( fair ) coin tosses : independent random variables <unk> such that <unk> ∈ { − 1 @,@ 1 } with equal probabilities . The associated random walk is 
 <formula> 
 so that , for each n , Wn is drawn from a standard binomial distribution . As n varies Wn defines a ( discrete ) stochastic process . Then π can be calculated by 
 <formula> 
 This Monte Carlo method is independent of any relation to circles , and is a consequence of the central limit theorem , discussed above . 
 These Monte Carlo methods for approximating π are very slow compared to other methods , and do not provide any information on the exact number of digits that are obtained . Thus they are never used to approximate π when speed or accuracy is desired . 
 = = = <unk> algorithms = = = 
 Two algorithms were discovered in 1995 that opened up new avenues of research into π . They are called spigot algorithms because , like water dripping from a spigot , they produce single digits of π that are not reused after they are calculated . This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms , which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced . 
 American mathematicians Stan Wagon and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995 . Its speed is comparable to arctan algorithms , but not as fast as iterative algorithms . 
 Another spigot algorithm , the <unk> digit extraction algorithm , was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe : 
 <formula> 
 This formula , unlike others before it , can produce any individual hexadecimal digit of π without calculating all the preceding digits . Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits , and <unk> digits can be extracted from one or two hexadecimal digits . Variations of the algorithm have been discovered , but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found that rapidly produces decimal digits . An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record π computations : After a new record is claimed , the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal , and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several random hexadecimal digits near the end ; if they match , this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct . 
 Between 1998 and 2000 , the distributed computing project <unk> used Bellard 's formula ( a modification of the <unk> algorithm ) to compute the <unk> ( <unk> ) bit of π , which turned out to be 0 . In September 2010 , a Yahoo ! employee used the company 's <unk> application on one thousand computers over a 23 @-@ day period to compute 256 bits of π at the two @-@ <unk> ( 2 × <unk> ) bit , which also happens to be zero . 
 = = Use = = 
 Because π is closely related to the circle , it is found in many formulae from the fields of geometry and trigonometry , particularly those concerning circles , spheres , or ellipses . Other branches of science , such as statistics , physics , Fourier analysis , and number theory , also include π in some of their important formulae . 
 = = = Geometry and trigonometry = = = 
 π appears in formulae for areas and volumes of geometrical shapes based on circles , such as ellipses , spheres , cones , and tori . Below are some of the more common formulae that involve π . 
 The circumference of a circle with radius r is <unk> . 
 The area of a circle with radius r is πr2 . 
 The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4 / <unk> . 
 The surface area of a sphere with radius r is <unk> . 
 The formulae above are special cases of the volume of the n @-@ dimensional ball and the surface area of its boundary , the ( n − 1 ) -dimensional sphere , given below . 
 Definite integrals that describe circumference , area , or volume of shapes generated by circles typically have values that involve π . For example , an integral that specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by : 
 <formula> 
 In that integral the function √ 1 − x2 represents the top half of a circle ( the square root is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem ) , and the integral <unk> 1 
 − 1 computes the area between that half of a circle and the x axis . 
 The trigonometric functions rely on angles , and mathematicians generally use radians as units of <unk> π plays an important role in angles measured in radians , which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2π radians . The angle measure of 180 ° is equal to π radians , and 1 ° = π / 180 radians . 
 Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of π ; for example , sine and cosine have period 2π , so for any angle θ and any integer k , 
 <formula> 
 = = = Topology = = = 
 The constant π appears in the Gauss – Bonnet formula which relates the differential geometry of surfaces to their topology . Specifically , if a compact surface Σ has Gauss curvature K , then 
 <formula> 
 where χ ( Σ ) is the Euler characteristic , which is an integer . An example is the surface area of a sphere S of curvature 1 ( so that its radius of curvature , which coincides with its radius , is also 1 . ) The Euler characteristic of a sphere can be computed from its homology groups , and is found to be equal to two . Thus we have 
 <formula> 
 reproducing the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius 1 . 
 The constant appears in many other integral formulae in topology , in particular those involving characteristic classes via the Chern – Weil homomorphism . 
 = = = Vector calculus = = = 
 Vector calculus is a branch of calculus that is concerned with the properties of vector fields , and has many physical applications such as to electricity and magnetism . The Newtonian potential for a point source Q situated at the origin of a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is 
 <formula> 
 which represents the potential energy of a unit mass ( or charge ) placed a distance | x | from the source , and k is a dimensional constant . The field , denoted here by E , which may be the ( Newtonian ) gravitational field or the ( Coulomb ) electric field , is the negative gradient of the potential : 
 <formula> 
 Special cases include Coulomb 's law and Newton 's law of universal gravitation . Gauss ' law states that the outward flux of the field through any smooth , simple , closed , <unk> surface S containing the origin is equal to <unk> : 
 <formula> <formula> <formula> 
 It is standard to absorb this factor of 4π into the constant k , but this argument shows why it must appear somewhere . Furthermore , 4π is the surface area of the unit sphere , but we have not assumed that S is the sphere . However , as a consequence of the divergence theorem , because the region away from the origin is vacuum ( source @-@ free ) it is only the homology class of the surface S in R3 \ { 0 } that matters in computing the integral , so it can be replaced by any convenient surface in the same homology class , in particular a sphere , where spherical coordinates can be used to calculate the integral . 
 A consequence of the Gauss law is that the negative Laplacian of the potential V is equal to <unk> times the Dirac delta function : 
 <formula> 
 More general distributions of matter ( or charge ) are obtained from this by convolution , giving the Poisson equation 
 <formula> 
 where ρ is the distribution function . 
 The constant π also plays an analogous role in four @-@ dimensional potentials associated with Einstein 's equations , a fundamental formula which forms the basis of the general theory of relativity and describes the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy : 
 <formula> 
 where <unk> is the Ricci curvature tensor , R is the scalar curvature , <unk> is the metric tensor , Λ is the cosmological constant , G is Newton 's gravitational constant , c is the speed of light in vacuum , and <unk> is the stress – energy tensor . The left @-@ hand side of Einstein 's equation is a non @-@ linear analog of the Laplacian of the metric tensor ( and reduces to that in the weak field limit ) , and the right hand side is the analog of the distribution function , times <unk> . 
 = = = Cauchy 's integral formula = = = 
 One of the key tools in complex analysis is contour integration of a function over a positively oriented ( rectifiable ) Jordan curve γ . A form of Cauchy 's integral formula states that if a point z0 is interior to γ , then 
 <formula> 
 Although the curve γ is not a circle , and hence does not have any obvious connection to the constant π , a standard proof of this result uses <unk> 's theorem , which implies that the integral is invariant under homotopy of the curve , so that it can be deformed to a circle and then integrated explicitly in polar coordinates . More generally , it is true that if a rectifiable closed curve γ does not contain z0 , then the above integral is 2πi times the winding number of the curve . 
 The general form of Cauchy 's integral formula establishes the relationship between the values of a complex analytic function f ( z ) on the Jordan curve γ and the value of f ( z ) at any interior point z0 of γ : 
 <formula> 
 provided f ( z ) is analytic in the region enclosed by γ and extends continuously to γ . Cauchy 's integral formula is a special case of the residue theorem , that if g ( z ) is a <unk> function the region enclosed by γ and is continuous in a neighborhood of γ , then 
 <formula> 
 where the sum is of the residues at the poles of g ( z ) . 
 = = = The gamma function and Stirling 's approximation = = = 
 The factorial function n ! is the product of all of the positive integers through n . The gamma function extends the concept of factorial ( normally defined only for non @-@ negative integers ) to all complex numbers , except the negative real integers . When the gamma function is evaluated at half @-@ integers , the result contains π ; for example <formula> and <formula> . 
 The gamma function is defined by its Weierstrass product development : 
 <formula> 
 where γ is the Euler – Mascheroni constant . Evaluated at z 
 = 1 / 2 and squared , the equation Γ ( 1 / 2 ) 2 = 
 π reduces to the Wallis product formula . The gamma function is also connected to the Riemann zeta function and identities for the functional determinant , in which the constant π plays an important role . 
 The gamma function is used to calculate the volume Vn ( r ) of the n @-@ dimensional ball of radius r in Euclidean n @-@ dimensional space , and the surface area Sn − 1 ( r ) of its boundary , the ( n − 1 ) -dimensional sphere : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 Further , it follows from the functional equation that 
 <formula> 
 The gamma function can be used to create a simple approximation to the factorial function n ! for large n : <formula> which is known as Stirling 's approximation . Equivalently , 
 <formula> 
 As a geometrical application of Stirling 's approximation , let <unk> denote the standard simplex in n @-@ dimensional Euclidean space , and ( n + 1 ) <unk> denote the simplex having all of its sides scaled up by a factor of n + 1 . Then 
 <formula> 
 Ehrhart 's volume conjecture is that this is the ( optimal ) upper bound on the volume of a convex body containing only one lattice point . 
 = = = Number theory and Riemann zeta function = = = 
 The Riemann zeta function ζ ( s ) is used in many areas of mathematics . When evaluated at s = 2 it can be written as 
 <formula> 
 Finding a simple solution for this infinite series was a famous problem in mathematics called the Basel problem . Leonhard Euler solved it in 1735 when he showed it was equal to π2 / 6 . Euler 's result leads to the number theory result that the probability of two random numbers being relatively prime ( that is , having no shared factors ) is equal to 6 / π2 . This probability is based on the observation that the probability that any number is divisible by a prime p is 1 / p ( for example , every 7th integer is divisible by 7 . ) Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is 1 / p2 , and the probability that at least one of them is not is 1 − 1 / p2 . For distinct primes , these <unk> events are mutually independent ; so the probability that two numbers are relatively prime is given by a product over all primes : 
 <formula> 
 This probability can be used in conjunction with a random number generator to approximate π using a Monte Carlo approach . 
 The solution to the Basel problem implies that the geometrically derived quantity π is connected in a deep way to the distribution of prime numbers . This is a special case of Weil 's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers , which asserts the equality of similar such infinite products of arithmetic quantities , localized at each prime p , and a geometrical quantity : the reciprocal of the volume of a certain locally symmetric space . In the case of the Basel problem , it is the hyperbolic 3 @-@ manifold SL2 ( R ) / SL2 ( Z ) . 
 The zeta function also satisfies Riemann 's functional equation , which involves π as well as the gamma function : 
 <formula> 
 Furthermore , the derivative of the zeta function satisfies 
 <formula> 
 A consequence is that π can be obtained from the functional determinant of the harmonic oscillator . This functional determinant can be computed via a product expansion , and is equivalent to the Wallis product formula . The calculation can be recast in quantum mechanics , specifically the variational approach to the spectrum of the hydrogen atom . 
 = = = Fourier series = = = 
 The constant π also appears naturally in Fourier series of periodic functions . Periodic functions are functions on the group T = R / Z of fractional parts of real numbers . The Fourier decomposition shows that a complex @-@ valued function f on T can be written as an infinite linear superposition of unitary characters of T. That is , continuous group homomorphisms from T to the circle group U ( 1 ) of unit modulus complex numbers . It is a theorem that every character of T is one of the complex exponentials <formula> . 
 There is a unique character on T , up to complex conjugation , that is a group isomorphism . Using the Haar measure on the circle group , the constant π is half the magnitude of the Radon – Nikodym derivative of this character . The other characters have derivatives whose magnitudes are positive integral multiples of 2π . As a result , the constant π is the unique number such that the group T , equipped with its Haar measure , is Pontrjagin dual to the lattice of integral multiples of 2π . This is a version of the one @-@ dimensional Poisson summation formula . 
 = = = Modular forms and theta functions = = = 
 The constant π is connected in a deep way with the theory of modular forms and theta functions . For example , the Chudnovsky algorithm involves in an essential way the j @-@ invariant of an elliptic curve . 
 Modular forms are holomorphic functions in the upper half plane characterized by their transformation properties under the modular group <formula> ( or its various subgroups ) , a lattice in the group <formula> . An example is the Jacobi theta function 
 <formula> 
 which is a kind of modular form called a Jacobi form . This is sometimes written in terms of the nome <formula> . 
 The constant π is the unique constant making the Jacobi theta function an <unk> form , which means that it transforms in a specific way . Certain identities hold for all <unk> forms . An example is 
 <formula> 
 which implies that θ transforms as a representation under the discrete Heisenberg group . General modular forms and other theta functions also involve π , once again because of the Stone – von Neumann theorem .

 is a probability density function . The total probability is equal to one , owing to the integral : 
 <formula> 
 The Shannon entropy of the Cauchy distribution is equal to log ( 4π ) , which also involves π . 
 The Cauchy distribution plays an important role in potential theory because it is the simplest Furstenberg measure , the classical Poisson kernel associated with a Brownian motion in a half @-@ plane . <unk> harmonic functions and so also the Hilbert transform are associated with the asymptotics of the Poisson kernel . The Hilbert transform H is the integral transform given by the Cauchy principal value of the singular integral 
 <formula> 
 The constant π is the unique ( positive ) normalizing factor such that H defines a linear complex structure on the Hilbert space of square @-@ integrable real @-@ valued functions on the real line . The Hilbert transform , like the Fourier transform , can be characterized purely in terms of its transformation properties on the Hilbert space L2 ( R ) : up to a normalization factor , it is the unique bounded linear operator that commutes with positive <unk> and <unk> with all reflections of the real line . The constant π is the unique normalizing factor that makes this transformation unitary .

 An occurrence of π in the Mandelbrot set fractal was discovered by David Boll in 1991 . He examined the behavior of the Mandelbrot set near the " neck " at ( − 0 @.@ 75 , 0 ) . If points with coordinates ( − 0 @.@ 75 , ε ) are considered , as ε tends to zero , the number of iterations until divergence for the point multiplied by ε converges to π . The point ( 0 @.@ 25 , ε ) at the cusp of the large " valley " on the right side of the Mandelbrot set behaves similarly : the number of iterations until divergence multiplied by the square root of ε tends to π .

 Although not a physical constant , π appears routinely in equations describing fundamental principles of the universe , often because of π 's relationship to the circle and to spherical coordinate systems . A simple formula from the field of classical mechanics gives the approximate period T of a simple pendulum of length L , swinging with a small amplitude ( g is the earth 's gravitational acceleration ) :

 One of the key formulae of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle , which shows that the uncertainty in the measurement of a particle 's position ( Δx ) and momentum ( Δp ) cannot both be arbitrarily small at the same time ( where h is Planck 's constant ) :

 The fact that π is approximately equal to 3 plays a role in the relatively long lifetime of <unk> . The inverse lifetime to lowest order in the fine @-@ structure constant α is

 π is present in some structural engineering formulae , such as the buckling formula derived by Euler , which gives the maximum axial load F that a long , slender column of length L , modulus of elasticity E , and area moment of inertia I can carry without buckling :

 The field of fluid dynamics contains π in Stokes ' law , which approximates the frictional force F exerted on small , spherical objects of radius R , moving with velocity v in a fluid with dynamic viscosity η :

 Under ideal conditions ( uniform gentle slope on an homogeneously erodible substrate ) , the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches π . The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight @-@ line distance from source to mouth . Faster currents along the outside edges of a river 's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges , thus pushing the bends even farther out , and increasing the overall loopiness of the river . However , that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and " short @-@ circuit " , creating an ox @-@ bow lake in the process . The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of π between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth .

 <unk> is the practice of memorizing large numbers of digits of π , and world @-@ records are kept by the Guinness World Records . The record for memorizing digits of π , certified by Guinness World Records , is 70 @,@ 000 digits , recited in India by <unk> Meena in 9 hours and 27 minutes on 21 March 2015 . In 2006 , Akira <unk> , a retired Japanese engineer , claimed to have recited 100 @,@ 000 decimal places , but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records . 
 One common technique is to memorize a story or poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of π : The first word has three letters , the second word has one , the third has four , the fourth has one , the fifth has five , and so on . An early example of a memorization aid , originally devised by English scientist James Jeans , is " How I want a drink , alcoholic of course , after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics . " When a poem is used , it is sometimes referred to as a <unk> . Poems for memorizing π have been composed in several languages in addition to English . Record @-@ setting π <unk> typically do not rely on poems , but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the method of loci . 
 A few authors have used the digits of π to establish a new form of constrained writing , where the word lengths are required to represent the digits of π . The <unk> Cadenza contains the first <unk> digits of π in this manner , and the full @-@ length book Not a Wake contains 10 @,@ 000 words , each representing one digit of π .

 Perhaps because of the simplicity of its definition and its ubiquitous presence in formulae , π has been represented in popular culture more than other mathematical constructs . 
 In the 2008 Open University and BBC documentary co @-@ production , The Story of Maths , aired in October 2008 on BBC Four , British mathematician Marcus du Sautoy shows a visualization of the - historically first exact - formula for calculating π when visiting India and exploring its contributions to trigonometry . 
 In the Palais de la <unk> ( a science museum in Paris ) there is a circular room known as the pi room . On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of π . The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome @-@ like ceiling . The digits were based on an 1853 calculation by English mathematician William Shanks , which included an error beginning at the 528th digit . The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949 . 
 In Carl Sagan 's novel Contact it is suggested that the creator of the universe buried a message deep within the digits of π . The digits of π have also been incorporated into the lyrics of the song " Pi " from the album Aerial by Kate Bush . 
 In the United States , Pi Day falls on 14 March ( written 3 / 14 in the US style ) , and is popular among <unk> π and its digital representation are often used by self @-@ described " math geeks " for inside jokes among mathematically and technologically minded groups .

 During the 2011 auction for Nortel 's portfolio of valuable technology patents , Google made a series of unusually specific bids based on mathematical and scientific constants , including π . 
 In 1958 Albert Eagle proposed replacing π by τ

 6 @.@ <unk> ... = 2π , arguing that τ , as the number of radians in one turn or as the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its radius rather than its diameter , is more natural than π and simplifies many formulas . Celebrations of this number , because it approximately equals 6 @.@ 28 , by making 28 June " Tau Day " and eating " twice the pie " , have been reported in the media . However , this use of τ has not made its way into mainstream mathematics . 
 In 1897 , an amateur American mathematician attempted to persuade the Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill , which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for π , including 3 @.@ 2 . The bill is notorious as an attempt to establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat . The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives , but rejected by the Senate . 
 = HMS Ark Royal ( 1914 ) = 
 HMS Ark Royal was the first ship in history designed and built as a seaplane carrier . She was purchased by the Royal Navy in 1914 shortly after her keel had been laid and the ship was only in frames ; this allowed the ship 's design to be modified almost totally to accommodate seaplanes . In World War I , Ark Royal participated in the Gallipoli Campaign in early 1915 with her aircraft conducting aerial reconnaissance and observation missions . Her aircraft later supported British troops on the Macedonian Front in 1916 , before she returned to the Dardanelles to act as a depot ship for all the seaplanes operating in the area . In January 1918 , several of her aircraft unsuccessfully attacked the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben when she sortied from the Dardanelles to attack Allied ships in the area . The ship left the area later in the year to support seaplanes conducting anti @-@ submarine patrols over the southern Aegean Sea . 
 After the end of the war , Ark Royal mostly served as an aircraft transport and depot ship for those aircraft in support of White Russian and British operations against the Bolsheviks in the Caspian and Black Sea regions . She also supported Royal Air Force ( RAF ) aircraft in British Somaliland in the campaign against the Mad Mullah in 1920 . Later that year , the ship was placed in reserve . Ark Royal was recommissioned to ferry an RAF squadron to the Dardanelles during the Chanak crisis in 1922 . She was reduced to reserve again upon her return to the United Kingdom the following year . 
 Ark Royal was recommissioned in 1930 to serve as a training ship for seaplane pilots and to evaluate aircraft catapult operations and techniques . She was renamed HMS Pegasus in 1934 and continued to serve as a training ship until the beginning of World War II in September 1939 . Assigned to Home Fleet at the beginning of the war , she took on tasks as an aircraft transport , in addition to her training duties , until she was modified to serve as the prototype fighter catapult ship in late 1940 . This type of ship was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long @-@ range maritime patrol bombers by launching fighters via their catapult to provide air cover for the convoy . Pegasus served in this role until mid @-@ 1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a training ship . This lasted until early 1944 when she became a barracks ship . The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year . However , the owner ran out of money during the process and Anita I , as she had been renamed , was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for scrap . She was not broken up until late 1950 .

 The Royal Navy had conducted trials in 1913 with a modified cruiser , Hermes , to evaluate the ability of seaplanes to work with the fleet . They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £ 81 @,@ 000 in the 1914 – 1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with Hermes to better accommodate seaplanes . A tramp steamer was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the Blyth Shipbuilding Company so it could be easily modified to suit its new role . 
 Ark Royal was laid down on 7 November 1913 by the Blyth Shipbuilding Company in Blyth , Northumberland , as a freighter , probably intended for the coal @-@ for @-@ grain trade in the Black Sea . She was purchased in May 1914 and was launched on 5 September 1914 . The ship was commissioned on 10 December 1914 . 
 Extensive changes to the ship were made in converting her to a seaplane tender , with the superstructure , funnel , and propulsion machinery moved aft and a working deck occupying the forward half of the ship . The deck was not intended as a flying @-@ off deck , but for starting and running up of seaplane engines and for recovering damaged aircraft from the sea . The ship was equipped with a large aircraft hold , 150 feet ( 45 @.@ 7 m ) long , 45 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 m ) wide and 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high along with extensive workshops . Two 3 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 3 @.@ 0 t ) steam cranes on the sides of the forecastle lifted the aircraft through the sliding hatch of the hangar onto the flight deck or into the water . She carried 4 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 18 @,@ 000 l ; 4 @,@ 800 US gal ) of petrol for her aircraft in standard commercial 2 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 9 @.@ 1 l ; 2 @.@ 4 US gal ) tins . 
 She could carry five floatplanes and two to four regular , wheeled aircraft . The latter would have to return to land after launch , but the seaplanes would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier , lifted on and off the ship by the cranes . Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder , two Wight <unk> , three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft . 
 Ark Royal had an overall length of 366 feet ( 111 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 50 feet 10 inches ( 15 @.@ 5 m ) , and a draught of 18 feet 9 inches ( 5 @.@ 7 m ) . She normally displaced 7 @,@ 080 long tons ( 7 @,@ 190 t ) , with a displacement of 7 @,@ 450 long tons ( 7 @,@ 570 t ) at deep load . The ship had one vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engine driving one propeller shaft . The ship 's three cylindrical boilers generated enough steam to produce 3 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 200 kW ) from the engine . The ship had a designed speed of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) , but she made a speed of 10 @.@ 64 knots ( 19 @.@ 71 km / h ; 12 @.@ 24 mph ) during her sea trials with 2 @,@ 675 shaft horsepower ( 1 @,@ 995 kW ) in December 1914 . Ark Royal carried 500 tonnes ( 490 long tons ) of fuel oil , enough to give her a range of 3 @,@ 030 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 610 km ; 3 @,@ 490 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with four QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns and two machine guns . Including 60 aviation personnel , her crew totalled 180 officers and men . " Her truly unique feature was the steadying sail on the mizzen to help keep her head to the wind ; she remains the only aircraft carrier to have been fitted with a sail . "

 The ship proved to be too slow to work with the Grand Fleet and for operations in the North Sea in general , so Ark Royal was ordered to the Mediterranean in mid @-@ January 1915 to support the Gallipoli campaign . Under the command of Commander Robert Clark @-@ Hall , the ship sailed on 1 February 1915 and arrived at the island of Tenedos on 17 February . She attempted to fly three of her seaplanes on the day of her arrival to reconnoitre the Straits , but two of them had engine troubles and the third could not take off despite the calm water . A Wight Pusher eventually managed to get into the air and discovered new fortifications down the Straits ; it dropped a single 20 @-@ pound ( 9 @.@ 1 kg ) bomb on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles and returned with seven bullet holes in its skin . Two days later , the ship 's aircraft attempted unsuccessfully to spot for the fleet as they bombarded the Ottoman fortifications defending the Straits . They conducted more aerial reconnaissance and observation missions in support of the fleet later in the month and in early March as it moved further up the Straits . Ark Royal lost her first aircraft on 5 March as the propeller of one of her Sopwiths splintered into pieces at 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) . Both of the aircraft 's crewmen were recovered by the destroyer HMS Usk . 
 Later in the month , the ship 's aircrew learned to spot mines from the air and were moderately successful , although they failed to detect the minefield that sank one French and two British predreadnoughts and damaged a British battlecruiser on 18 March . Later in the month , Ark Royal and her aircraft were relieved by No. 3 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) . In preparation for the squadron 's arrival , the ship 's crew cleared a vineyard on the island to serve as an airfield and unloaded its crated aircraft on 26 – 27 March . From 31 March to 7 April , Ark Royal and her companions made several fake landing attempts and her aircraft bombarded the port of Smyrna with little effect . When she returned to Tenedos on 8 April , she exchanged her Tabloids , which had never flown from the ship , for a pair of Sopwith Schneider single @-@ seat floatplanes . In addition , she received two Sopwith Type 860s , another Wight Pusher , and a Short Type 166 , all two @-@ seat floatplanes , as replacements . The ship had no room for all these aircraft and she used the collier <unk> to store them and for additional workshop space . Her aircraft resumed reconnaissance and observation missions over the Dardanelles ; aircraft discovered a large ammunition dump on 12 April , and provided corrective data to direct gunfire from HMS Lord Nelson onto the target . 
 Ark Royal 's aircraft provided support to the Australian and New Zealand troops at Anzac Cove as they landed on 25 April on the Gallipoli Peninsula . Two days later , the ship was taken under fire by the Ottoman predreadnought Turgut Reis , firing across the peninsula , and she had to move in a hurry to avoid being hit . A month later , the battle on the peninsula had bogged down and the success of the German submarine U @-@ 21 in sinking two British predreadnoughts forced Ark Royal to move to a safer anchorage at Imbros at the end of May . There she became a depot ship for all the seaplanes in the area , while her own aircraft continued to support operations at Gallipoli . On occasion , aircraft were loaned out to other ships for reconnaissance or observation missions . 
 The ship left Imbros on 1 November for Mytilene , from where her aircraft flew aerial reconnaissance missions over Smyrna , before she continued onwards to Salonika , where she arrived on 8 November . While based there , her aircraft supported British troops fighting the Bulgarians , spotted for British ships conducting shore bombardments , and conducted anti @-@ submarine patrols . At this time , Ark Royal operated five Short <unk> and a couple of Sopwith seaplanes . On 27 March 1917 , the ship was transferred to Mudros to serve as a depot ship for all the seaplanes assigned to No. 2 Wing RNAS , which controlled all RNAS aircraft in the area . By the end of 1917 , she operated a mixture of Short Type 184 and Sopwith Baby aircraft . 
 On the morning of 20 January 1918 , the Ottoman battlecruiser Yavûz Sultân Selîm , together with the light cruiser Midilli , ( formerly the German Goeben and Breslau , and still with German crews ) , sortied from the Dardanelles to attack British warships based at Mudros . Yavuz struck a mine shortly after they exited the mouth of the Dardanelles so they switched targets and sank two British monitors off Imbros Island . As they were returning to the Dardanelles , the two ships were attacked by two of Ark Royal 's Sopwith Babies with 65 @-@ pound ( 29 kg ) bombs . One Baby was quickly shot down and the other was forced to make an emergency landing with engine problems off Imbros ; the pilot was able to taxi the aircraft onto a beach and it was recovered several days later . Midilli struck five mines and sank on the return whilst Yavuz struck two more mines and then ran aground inside the Straits . Ark Royal 's Short 184s attempted to bomb her at dawn on the following morning , but all ten bombs missed , and an attempt to attack the ship with a Short 184 modified to carry a 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo failed when the weight of the torpedo proved to be more than the aircraft could lift . 
 On 3 April , the ship was transferred to the island of Syros , where she could support the seaplanes of No. 62 Wing of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) on anti @-@ submarine patrols ; part of the former No. 2 Wing RNAS redesignated when the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps were merged to form the RAF . Ark Royal was transferred to Piraeus in October and was still there when the Armistice of Mudros with Turkey was signed on 31 October . The ship joined the Allied fleet that occupied Constantinople after the surrender .

 After the war , Ark Royal transported aircraft across the Black Sea to Batumi , where they were ferried across the Caucasus to the British naval forces supporting White Russian forces fighting the Bolsheviks in the Caspian Sea during the Russian Civil War . The ship was withdrawn from the Black Sea in late 1919 and disembarked her seaplanes at Malta to load a dozen de Havilland DH @-@ 9 bombers and 181 personnel of the supporting Z Force for transport to British Somaliland . The ship arrived in Berbera on 30 December and the squadron was unloaded to support the air and land campaign against the Mad Mullah . Ark Royal served during this campaign solely as a depot and repair ship for the RAF . She was withdrawn before its conclusion and transferred to the Black Sea to support the White Russian forces there as they began to collapse . The ship twice ferried refugees from the Caucasian coast to the Crimea and , after the second voyage , had to be fumigated at Constantinople after an outbreak of typhus among her passengers . During the summer of 1920 , Ark Royal ferried RAF aircraft and personnel to Basra . She then returned to Britain for a refit and was put into reserve at Rosyth in November . 
 She was recommissioned in September 1922 to transport 4 Squadron , equipped with a dozen Bristol F.2 Fighters , out to the Dardanelles during the Chanak crisis . The aircraft were ferried semi @-@ assembled and then transferred to the aircraft carrier Argus where they were fully erected . On 11 October , the <unk> flew from the carrier to an airfield at <unk> on the European side of the straits . The ship remained in the area until she was given a brief refit at Malta in early 1923 . Now equipped with Fairey IIID seaplanes , Ark Royal returned to the Dardanelles until she was transferred back to the United Kingdom late in the year . Upon her arrival , the ship was placed back in reserve and became the depot ship for the reserve of minesweepers at Sheerness until 1930 . 
 In 1930 , Ark Royal was recommissioned again as a training ship and an aircraft catapult was installed on her forecastle , forward of her cranes . For the next nine years , the ship conducted trials and evaluations of catapults and seaplane launch and recovery equipment and techniques . On 21 December 1934 , she was renamed HMS Pegasus to release her name for a new carrier that was then beginning construction . The ship was assigned to Home Fleet when World War II began and was mostly used to train seaplane pilots in catapult launching and shipboard recovery techniques , using the Fairey <unk> , Supermarine Walruses and Fairey Swordfish of 764 Squadron . She also served as an aircraft transport and was present in Scapa Flow , having just delivered some aircraft , on 14 October when the battleship Royal Oak was sunk by the German submarine U @-@ 47 . As the closest ship to Royal Oak , Pegasus was able to rescue some 400 survivors . 
 Pegasus was converted to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940 , carrying three Fairey Fulmar fighters from 807 Squadron between 1 December and 10 February 1941 , which were replaced by aircraft from 804 Squadron between 10 February and 23 July . These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 maritime patrol bombers and to prevent them from radioing location reports to U @-@ boats . If out of range of land , the fighters would have to ditch at sea and hope to be recovered by a ship from their convoy . The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941 . At some point during the war , the ship 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was supplemented with a pair of Oerlikon 20 mm light anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted in the bow , the ship 's bridge was enlarged and the mast was replaced with a tripod mast bearing a Type 291 air warning radar . The ship then became a seaplane training ship again , hosting 763 Squadron aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944 . Pegasus then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June . 
 She was sold to R. C. Ellerman on 18 October , renamed Anita I , and registered under the Panamanian flag . Under the management of the Compania de Navigation <unk> , the ship sailed from Cardiff to Antwerp in October 1947 to begin conversion to a freighter . The work ceased in early 1948 and Anita I was seized by her creditors and auctioned off to a Dutch shipbreaking firm on 16 June 1949 . She was resold once more before the ship was purchased by the British Iron and Steel Corporation in October 1950 . Later that year , the ship was broken up for scrap at Grays , Essex . 
 = Juliomys anoblepas = 
 Juliomys anoblepas is a rodent in the genus Juliomys of the subfamily Sigmodontinae known from a single broken skull . The specimen was collected by Peter Wilhelm Lund in the caves of Lagoa Santa , Minas Gerais , Brazil , in the first half of the 19th century and described by Herluf Winge in 1887 as Calomys anoblepas . The species remained unstudied and its affinities unclear until 2011 , when it was recognized as a member of the genus Juliomys , which includes three other species from southern Brazil and nearby Argentina and Paraguay . J. anoblepas is probably a separate extinct species of the genus , which is no longer found at Lagoa Santa . 
 Juliomys anoblepas is similar to the other members of its genus in the configuration of its zygomatic plate ( a bony plate on the side of the skull ) . It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull , and that connection is relatively low on the skull . Furthermore , the incisive foramina , openings in the front part of the palate , extend to a point between the first molars , and the palate is short , with its back margin between the third molars . The living species of Juliomys differ from J. anoblepas in various characters , including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) in J. anoblepas . The upper molar row is 4 @.@ 13 mm long , which makes J. anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Between 1835 and 1849 , Danish zoologist Peter Wilhelm Lund collected abundant remains of mammals around the village of Lagoa Santa in Brazil . After his death , his fellow Dane Herluf Winge described Lund 's collections in detail , among many others publishing a monograph about the rodents of the collection in 1887 . Winge described numerous new species , many of which received little attention from systematists afterward , and among these is the species he named Calomys anoblepas . The specific name , anoblepas , derives from the Greek ἄνω ( ano ) " upwards " and <unk> ( <unk> ) " to look " and thus means " looking upward " . Although Winge did not explain the name , it most likely refers to the zygomatic plate ( a bone plate at the side of the skull ) , which is bended outward . Winge understood the genus Calomys in a sense very different from that used today , including in it the species Calomys longicaudatus ( currently Oligoryzomys nigripes ) , Calomys coronatus ( currently Euryoryzomys russatus ) , Calomys rex ( currently Sooretamys <unk> ) , Calomys laticeps ( currently Cerradomys <unk> ) , Calomys saltator ( currently Hylaeamys laticeps ) , and Calomys <unk> ( currently Delomys , species uncertain ) . He wrote that C. anoblepas was the most divergent of the species of Calomys , but that it was similar to C. longicaudatus . 
 Winge 's concept of the genus Calomys essentially included unspecialized species with <unk> molars , which are characterized by the presence of a crest known as the mesoloph on the upper and mesolophid on the lower molars , and excluded species now placed in Calomys , which he classified in Hesperomys instead . Since 1898 , authors have placed Winge 's Calomys species in Oryzomys , conforming to the more conventional taxonomic arrangement ; after that , the species was referred to as Oryzomys anoblepas . Over many decades , the identity of most of Winge 's species remained uncertain , and in many cases it was not until the 1990s that the original material was restudied to provide a definitive identification of the material . In a 2002 review of the fossil sigmodontine rodents of South America , Argentinean zoologist Ulyses Pardiñas and his coworkers wrote that O. & <unk> ; anoblepas was " possibly an Oecomys " , but this claim was based only on a cursory investigation . 
 In 2011 , Pardiñas and Pablo Teta published another paper on " Calomys anoblepas " after re @-@ examining the only known specimen in Copenhagen , and concluded that the animal was instead related to the living genus Juliomys , which currently includes three living species from southern Brazil and nearby Paraguay and Argentina . They recognized some features by which J. anoblepas differs from the living species , and consequently kept it as a distinct , extinct species . Juliomys is a genus of unclear relations within the subfamily Sigmodontinae , which is widespread and very diverse in South America and southern North America . 
 = = Description = = 
 Juliomys anoblepas is known only from the front half of a skull , which was found in a cave known as " Lapa da Serra das <unk> " . Compared to other species of Juliomys , it is large and has a more robust skull and teeth . Its rostrum ( the front part ) is broad and short and the interorbital region ( between the skull ) is hourglass @-@ shaped , with squared margins . The <unk> rodent Rhipidomys and the oryzomyine Oecomys , both of which also occur in eastern Brazil , both have a broader interorbital region with better @-@ developed ridges at the margins . One of three living species of Juliomys , Juliomys pictipes , also has a broader interorbital region . Behind the position of the nasals ( which are missing in the only known skull ) is an <unk> depression , a lowered portion of the skull ; the suture ( connection ) between the two frontal bones is incompletely closed there . This <unk> fontanelle is shared with Juliomys <unk> , but not with Juliomys pictipes , nor with most specimens of Juliomys ossitenuis . In Wilfredomys , a Brazilian rodent with some similarities to J. anoblepas , the premaxillary bone forms a narrow projection towards the frontals , which is absent in J. anoblepas and other Juliomys species . 
 The zygomatic plates are almost completely vertical . As Winge already noted , the front margin of the zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge , which connects the plate to the body of the skull . This feature distinguishes J. anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines , but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J. anoblepas . In addition , the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys . The zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) spread broadly . More than in other Juliomys species , the front part of the zygomatic arches is bended forward and the zygomatic plates are bended outward . Furthermore , the zygomatic notch , the notch between the zygomatic plate and arch , is deep , not shallow as in J. ossitenuis and J. <unk> . 
 The incisive foramina ( openings in the palate between the incisors and the molars ) are broad and long , extending to the front margins of the first upper molar ( M1 ) . Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina , extending between the molars , but the foramina are shorter in J. ossitenuis and J. pictipes . The palate itself is wide and short , with its back margin between the M3s . Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates , extending beyond the third molars . Fine openings ( foramina ) are present on the palate . The back margin of the palate is squared ; J. anoblepas lacks a spine in the middle of the back margin , as is present in Rhipidomys . Wilfredomys has the back margin U @-@ shaped instead and has a longer palate , with the back margin behind the M3s . 
 The well @-@ developed upper incisors have orange enamel at their front surfaces and are slightly opisthodont ( with their cutting edge behind the vertical plane of the incisors ) . The molars are brachyodont ( low @-@ crowned ) and bear crests and cusps arranged in pairs opposite each other . The front cusp of M1 , the anterocone , is divided into two smaller cusps on each side of the tooth by a valley , the anteromedian flexus . Both M1 and the second molar ( M2 ) have a well @-@ developed mesoloph ( a crest near the middle of the tooth ) . Although M3 is relatively large , its back part is reduced . 
 The interorbital region is 4 @.@ 14 mm long and the zygomatic plate is 2 @.@ 38 mm . The diastema ( gap ) between the incisors and molars is 6 @.@ 39 mm long .

 Juliomys anoblepas is known only from Lagoa Santa , where the genus no longer occurs ; the nearest records are about 70 km ( 43 @.@ 5 mi ) to the southeast . It is one of several Lagoa Santa fossil rodents that no longer occur in the area . Although the precise environmental background of the Lagoa Santa fossil assemblage remains unclear , they may have been deposited in a period of climatic cooling that led to higher local diversity . 
 = Tropical cyclone basins = 
 Traditionally , areas of tropical cyclone formation are divided into seven basins . These include the north Atlantic Ocean , the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean , the southwestern Pacific , the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans , and the northern Indian Ocean ( Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal ) . The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active . An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide , with 47 reaching hurricane / typhoon strength , and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones ( at least of Category 3 intensity ) . 
 = = Overview = = 
 = = Northern Hemisphere = = 
 = = = North Atlantic Ocean = = = 
 This region includes the North Atlantic Ocean , the Caribbean Sea , and the Gulf of Mexico . Tropical cyclone formation here varies widely from year to year , ranging from one to over twenty @-@ five per year . Most Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30 . The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and issues reports , watches and warnings about tropical weather systems for the Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres for tropical cyclones as defined by the World Meteorological Organization . On average , 11 named storms ( of tropical storm or higher strength ) occur each season , with an average of 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 becoming major hurricanes . The climatological peak of activity is around September 10 each season . 
 The United States Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast , Mexico , Central America , the Caribbean Islands , and Bermuda are frequently affected by storms in this basin . Venezuela , the 4 provinces of Atlantic Canada , and Atlantic Macaronesian islands also are occasionally affected . Many of the more intense Atlantic storms are Cape Verde @-@ type hurricanes , which form off the west coast of Africa near the Cape Verde islands . Occasionally , a hurricane that evolves into an extratropical cyclone can reach western Europe , including Hurricane Gordon , which spread high winds across Spain and the British Isles in September 2006 . Hurricane Vince , which made landfall on the southwestern coast of Spain as a tropical depression in October 2005 , is the only known system to impact mainland Europe as a tropical cyclone ( correction / citation needed here to mention 1842 Spain hurricane ) . 
 = = = Eastern Pacific = = = 
 The Northeastern Pacific is the second most active basin and has the highest number of storms per unit area . The hurricane season runs between May 15 and November 30 each year , and encompasses the vast majority of tropical cyclone activity in the region . In the 1971 – 2005 period , there were an average of 15 – 16 tropical storms , 9 hurricanes , and 4 – 5 major hurricanes ( storms of Category 3 intensity or greater ) annually in the basin . 
 Storms that form here often affect western Mexico , and less commonly the Continental United States ( in particular California ) , or northern Central America . No hurricane included in the modern database has made landfall in California ; however , historical records from 1858 speak of a storm that brought San Diego winds over 75 mph ( 65 kn ; 121 km / h ) ( marginal hurricane force ) , though it is not known if the storm actually made landfall . Tropical storms in 1939 , 1976 and 1997 brought gale @-@ force winds to California . 
 The Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility ( AOR ) begins at the boundary with the National Hurricane Center ' AOR ( at 140 ° W ) , and ends at the International Date Line , where the Northwestern Pacific begins . The hurricane season in the North Central Pacific runs annually from June 1 to November 30 ; The Central Pacific Hurricane Center monitors the storms that develop or move into the defined area of responsibility . The CPHC previously tasked with monitoring tropical activity in the basin was originally known as the Joint Hurricane Warning Center ; today it is called the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . 
 Central Pacific hurricanes are rare and on average 4 to 5 storms form or move in this area annually . As there are no large contiguous landmasses in the basin , direct hits and landfalls are rare ; however , they occur occasionally , as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992 , which made landfall on Hawaii , and Hurricane Ioke in 2006 , which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll . 
 = = = Northwestern Pacific Ocean = = = 
 The Northwest Pacific Ocean is the most active basin on the planet . Annually , an average of 25 @.@ 7 tropical cyclones in the basin acquire tropical storm strength or greater ; also , an average of 16 typhoons occurred each year during the 1968 – 1989 period . The basin occupies all the territory north of the equator and west of the International Date Line , including the South China Sea . The basin sees activity year @-@ round ; however , tropical activity is at its minimum in February and March . 
 Tropical storms in this region often affect China , Hong Kong , Japan , North Korea , South Korea , the Philippines , Taiwan and Vietnam , plus numerous Oceanian islands such as Guam , the Northern Marianas and Palau . Sometimes , tropical storms in this region affect Cambodia , Laos , Malaysia , Thailand and even Singapore . This is by far the most active basin , accounting for one @-@ third of all tropical cyclone activity . The coast of China sees the most landfalling tropical cyclones worldwide . The Philippines archipelago receives an average of 6 – 7 tropical cyclone landfalls per year . 
 = = = North Indian Ocean = = = 
 This basin is divided into two areas : the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea , with the Bay of Bengal dominating ( 5 to 6 times more activity ) . Still , this basin is the most inactive worldwide , with only 4 to 6 storms per year . This basin 's season has a double peak : one in April and May , before the onset of the monsoon , and another in October and November , just after . Although it is an inactive basin , the deadliest tropical cyclones in the world have formed here , including the 1970 Bhola cyclone , which killed 500 @,@ 000 people . Nations affected include India , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Myanmar , and Pakistan . Rarely do tropical cyclones that form in this basin affect the Arabian Peninsula or Somalia ; however , Cyclone Gonu caused heavy damage in Oman on the peninsula in 2007 . 
 = = = Mediterranean Sea = = = 
 On rare occasions , tropical @-@ like systems , that can reach the intensity of hurricanes , occur over the Mediterranean Sea . Such a phenomenon is called a <unk> ( mediterranean @-@ hurricane ) . Although the geographical dimensions of tropical oceans and the Mediterranean Sea are clearly different , the precursor mechanisms of these perturbations , based on the air @-@ sea thermodynamic imbalance , are similar . Their origins are typically non @-@ tropical , and develop over open waters under strong , initially cold @-@ core cyclones , similar to subtropical cyclones or anomalous tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin , like Karl ( 1980 ) , Vince ( 2005 ) , Grace ( 2009 ) or Chris ( 2012 ) . Sea surface temperatures in late @-@ August and early @-@ September are quite high over the basin ( 24 / 28 ° C or 75 / 82 ° F ) , though research indicates water temperatures of 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) are normally required for development . 
 Meteorological literature document that such systems occurred in September 1947 , September 1969 , January 1982 , September 1983 , January 1995 , October 1996 , September 2006 , November 2011 and November 2014 . The 1995 system developed a well @-@ defined eye , and a ship recorded 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) winds , along with an atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar . Although it had the structure of a tropical cyclone , it occurred over 61 ° F ( 16 ° C ) water temperatures , suggesting it could have been a polar low . 
 = = Southern Hemisphere = = 
 Within the Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclones generally form on a regular basis between the African coast and the middle of the South Pacific . Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times . For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form , there are several different ways to split the area between the American and African coasts . For instance the World Meteorological Organization define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones . These are the South @-@ West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90 ° E , the Australian region between 90 ° E and 160 ° E and the South Pacific between 160 ° E and 120 ° W. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the whole region , but splits it at 135 ° E into the South Pacific and the Southern Indian Ocean . 
 = = = South @-@ West Indian Ocean = = = 
 The South @-@ West Indian Ocean is located within the Southern Hemisphere between the Africa 's east coast and 90 ° E and is primarily monitored by the Meteo France 's La Reunion RSMC , while the Mauritian , Australian Indonesian , and Madagascan weather services also monitor parts of it . Until the start of the 1985 – 86 tropical cyclone season the basin only extended to 80 ° E , with the 10 degrees between 80 and <unk> considered to be a part of the Australian region . On average about 9 cyclones per develop into tropical storms , while 5 of those go on to become tropical cyclones that are equivalent to a hurricane or a typhoon . The tropical cyclones that form in this area can affect some of the various Indian Ocean island nations and or various countries along Africa 's east coast . 
 = = = Australian region = = = 
 Through the middle of 1985 , this basin extended westward to 80E . Since then , its western boundary has been <unk> . Tropical activity in this region affects Australia and Indonesia . According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , the most frequently hit portion of Australia is between Exmouth and Broome in Western Australia . The basin sees an average of about seven cyclones each year , although more can form or come in from other basins , such as the South Pacific . The tropical cyclone Cyclone Vance in 1999 produced the highest recorded speed winds in an Australian town or city at around 267 km / h ( 166 mph ) . 
 = = = South Pacific Ocean = = = 
 The South Pacific Ocean basin starts at 160 ° E and extends to 120 ° W with cyclones developing in it officially monitored by Fiji and New Zealand 's Meteorological Services . Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries to the west of the dateline , though during El Nino 's cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia . On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical cyclones . 
 = = = South Atlantic Ocean = = = 
 Cyclones rarely form in other tropical ocean areas , which are not formally considered tropical cyclone basins . Tropical depressions and tropical storms occur occasionally in the South Atlantic , and the only full @-@ blown tropical cyclones on record were 2004 's Hurricane Catarina , which made landfall in Brazil and 2010 's Tropical Storm Anita , which formed off the coast of Rio Grande do Sul . South Atlantic ocean is not officially classified as a tropical cyclone basin by the World Meteorological Organization and do not have a designated regional specialized meteorological center ( RSMC ) . However , the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center has started in 2011 to assign names to tropical and subtropical systems in this basin , when they have sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . 
 = Lady of Quality = 
 Lady of Quality is the last Regency romance novel written by Georgette Heyer . It was first published in 1972 and was the last of her novels to be published during her lifetime . 
 The story describes the romantic relationship between Annis Wychwood , a wealthy spinster , and Oliver Carleton , a rake who cares little for society 's opinion of him . The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton 's ward , Lucilla . Heyer granted her heroine a level of independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer 's novels . Although the hero 's personality is similar to that of many of Heyer 's other heroes , in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little personal growth in the novel ; his primary change was to accept that he would like to have a wife . 
 Heyer frequently highlights the heroine 's many masculine qualities , which include a fierce independence and a disregard for social mores . Modern literary critics have noted that the relationship between the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century , offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence . The heroine 's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero , rather than repels him . 
 = = Background = = 
 British author Georgette Heyer essentially invented the Regency romance in 1935 with the publication of Regency Buck , and her early Regencies were quite successful . In 1950 she began to work on what she called " the magnum opus of my latter years " , a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435 . To earn income , she periodically interrupted her research to write additional Regency romances ; Lady of Quality , published in 1972 , was the last of them , and the last of her novels to be published during her lifetime . Heyer suffered a stroke in July 1973 and was in ill health until her death the following year . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The novel is set in Regency England somewhere around 1818 , and events are related through third @-@ person narrative . As the story opens , a wealthy , beautiful and intelligent woman named Annis Wychwood reaches the age of majority . Now having greater control over her personal and financial affairs , Annis decides to move to Bath and live alone , to the displeasure of her brother and his family . Several years later , on the way back to Bath after a visit to her childhood home , Annis meets Lucilla Carleton and Ninian Elmore . Lucilla is running away to Bath to avoid her marriage to Ninian , a match that her guardian is very much in favour of , and Ninian is escorting her to ensure her safe arrival . Annis volunteers to chaperone Lucilla and notifies the girl 's guardian of her plans . 
 Lucilla 's guardian , Oliver Carleton , visits Bath to investigate her new living arrangements . Carleton is a rake – a sexually experienced man who refuses to conform to many of society 's guidelines . His biting wit has earned him the label of rudest man in England , but he and Annis soon find mutual enjoyment in lively banter . As Carleton and Annis 's friendship develops , they discover deeper feelings for each other . Carleton proposes marriage , but Annis refuses , unwilling to relinquish her independence . Using the excuse that he must find Lucilla a new guardian , Carleton returns to London . 
 Annis 's brother , Sir Geoffrey Wychwood , hears rumours of her developing relationship with Carleton and sends his wife and children to Bath to discourage Carleton . Soon after their arrival members of the household contract influenza , and Annis nurses them until she too becomes infected . When Carleton hears that Annis is seriously ill he returns to Bath , arriving on the first day that she is able to get out of bed . Annis agrees to marry Carleton , despite the objections of her brother . 
 = = Genre and themes = = 
 Like many of Heyer 's novels , Lady of Quality is a Regency romance , relying heavily on its setting as a plot device . As noted by literary critic Kay Mussell , Heyer 's Regency romances revolved around a " structured social ritual – the marriage market represented by the London season " where " all are in danger of ostracism for inappropriate behavior " . Heyer 's novels were known for their painstaking attention to detail , which she used to infuse the novels with the " tone of the time " . 
 The heroine , Annis , is one of Heyer 's more modern characters . Her wealth and spinsterhood allow her a level of freedom that is unusual in a Heyer novel , as it was in the Regency period . Many of the actions Annis takes , such as moving to a different city despite her family 's objections , were common among women living in the 1970s when the novel was written , but in a Regency setting they mark Annis as a bold and unusually independent woman . 
 Heyer 's hero , Carleton , is a worldly and independent man , similar to those found in many of her other novels . In a departure from her other novels however , Carleton is an " unrepentant hero " who refuses to apologise for his past misdeeds and sees no need to change aspects of his behaviour such as his temper . Although in most romance novels the hero changes throughout the course of the narrative , in Lady of Quality Carleton is essentially the same character at the novel 's conclusion that he was at its beginning . The sole difference is his realisation that he loves Annis and wishes to marry her . 
 In contrast to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships , Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla . He must ensure that she is not drawn into a scandal , ruining her prospects of marriage , a role Heyer often gives to her heroes . It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility , but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society . Like the hero , the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses , yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example , as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society 's mores . Annis 's age , and the life experience she has gained , give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue . As in Heyer 's other novels , her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine 's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period . Rather than repel others , the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero . 
 = = Publication and reception = = 
 Exact publication figures are unavailable for this book , but a first printing of one of Heyer 's novels in the British Commonwealth often consisted of 65 @,@ 000 – 75 @,@ 000 copies , and each of her books generally sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies in paperback . As with Heyer 's other popular fiction , this book was largely ignored by contemporary critics ; only after her death did they begin to take more interest in her work . 
 Philippa Toomey , a literary critic for The Times , wrote a short review of Lady of Quality soon after its publication . While noting that the plots of all Heyer 's romance novels were similar , Toomey described Lady of Quality as " almost identical twins " with Heyer 's earlier work Black Sheep . Despite the formulaic nature of the plot , Toomey believed that Heyer fans would enjoy the novel , as it showcased Heyer 's skill in creating interesting characters who acted appropriately for their setting . 
 Lady of Quality was profiled in Pamela Regis 's 2003 book A Natural History of the Romance Novel . Regis describes the relationship between the protagonists as very modern ; both are financially independent , and neither cares overly much for the opinions of others . Literary critic Karin Westman , writing at about the same time agreed , noting that the novel provides " a vision of marriage as companionship , a union which does not require ceding independence ... thanks to a heroine who can conduct herself as a hero " . 
 = 1937 Fox vault fire = 
 The 1937 Fox vault fire was a major fire in a 20th Century Fox film storage facility in Little Ferry , New Jersey on 9 July 1937 . It was caused by the spontaneous combustion of nitrate film stored in inadequately @-@ ventilated vaults . The fire resulted in one death and two injuries , and destroyed all of the film present . 
 This fire was responsible for the loss of most of the silent films produced by Fox Film Corporation before 1932 . Also destroyed were Educational Pictures negatives and films of several other studios . It brought attention to the potential for decaying nitrate film to spontaneously ignite , and changed the focus of film preservation efforts to include a greater focus on fire safety . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Nitrate film = = = 
 The early motion picture industry primarily used nitrocellulose film stock , commonly called nitrate film . This film is flammable , and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns . Nitrate fires burn rapidly , and cannot typically be extinguished , capable of burning even underwater . Additionally , nitrocellulose is subject to thermal decomposition and hydrolysis , breaking down over time in the presence of high temperatures and moisture . This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily . Under the right conditions , nitrate film can even spontaneously combust . In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film , there is considerable uncertainty about the circumstances necessary for self @-@ ignition . Sustained temperatures of 106 ° F ( 41 ° C ) or higher , large quantities of nitrate film , increased humidity , poor ventilation , and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors . Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months , in closed facilities with limited ventilation , compounding several of these variables . Especially in confined areas , such fires can result in explosions . 
 Large and dangerous fires sometimes resulted . On 4 May 1897 , one of the first major fires involving nitrate film began when a Lumière projector caught fire at the Bazar de la <unk> in Paris ; the resulting blaze caused 180 deaths . In the United States , a series of fires occurred at industry facilities . The Lubin Manufacturing Company 's vault in Philadelphia exploded on 13 June 1914 , followed on 9 December by a fire that destroyed Thomas Edison 's laboratory complex in West Orange , New Jersey . The New York studio of the Famous Players Film Company burned in September 1915 ; in July 1920 , the shipping facility of its corporate successor , Famous Players @-@ Lasky , was destroyed by a fire in Kansas City , Missouri , despite construction intended to minimize that risk . The United Film Ad Service vault , also in Kansas City , burned on 4 August 1928 , and a fire was reported at Pathé Exchange nine days later . In October 1929 , the Consolidated Film Industries facility was badly damaged by a nitrate fire . Spontaneous combustion was not proven to have occurred in any of these fires ; it is possible that the potential of nitrate film to self @-@ ignite was not even recognized before 1933 . 
 = = = Little Ferry = = = 
 When Little Ferry , New Jersey contractor William <unk> was hired to construct a film storage facility in 1934 , he designed the structure to be fireproof . The building had 12 @-@ inch ( 30 cm ) outer walls and a reinforced concrete roof . Internally , it was divided into forty @-@ two individual vaults , each enclosed behind a steel door and separated with 8 @-@ inch ( 20 cm ) brick interior walls . The local fire department confirmed <unk> 's fireproofing . Despite the potential for fire , the facility was located in a residential neighborhood , and was equipped with neither a fire sprinkler system nor mechanical ventilation . 
 Film processing company <unk> Laboratories owned the building , and rented it to 20th Century Fox to store the silent films acquired from Fox Film Corporation during the merger . 
 = = Fire = = 
 Northern New Jersey experienced a heat wave in July 1937 , with daytime temperatures of 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) and warm nights . The sustained heat contributed to nitrate decomposition in the film vaults , and the building 's ventilation was inadequate to prevent a dangerous buildup of gasses . At some time shortly after 2 : 00 a.m. on the 9th , spontaneous ignition occurred in the vault at the building 's northwest corner . Local truck driver Robert Davison observed flames coming from one of the structure 's window vents and , within five minutes , used a municipal fire alarm call box to report the fire . 
 Davison then attempted to awaken the residents of the surrounding houses , many of whom were already alerted to the situation by the noise and intense heat . As decomposition gasses in additional vaults ignited , bursts of fire shot over 100 feet ( 30 m ) horizontally across the ground from the windows , and a similar distance into the air from the building 's roof vents . Anna Greeves and her two sons , John and Charles , were caught in one such " sheet of flame " while attempting to flee the area . All three were seriously burned ; 13 @-@ year @-@ old Charles eventually died from his injuries on 19 July . Other area families were able to escape unharmed as the fire spread to five neighboring residences and destroyed two vehicles . 
 Little Ferry firefighters first arrived at 2 : 26 a.m. , followed by additional companies from Hawthorne , Ridgefield Park , River Edge , and South Hackensack . Despite 150 men employing fourteen hose streams , the fire was not extinguished until 5 : 30 a.m. 
 Property damage was estimated at $ 150 @,@ 000 — 200 @,@ 000 . All of the film in the facility was destroyed ; more than 40 @,@ 000 reels of negatives and film prints burned to ashes inside their film cans . Fifty @-@ seven truckloads of burned film were hauled from the site to have their silver content extracted . Each can contained about five cents worth of silver ; the salvaged metal returned $ 2 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Although 20th Century Fox officials at the time remarked that " only old films " were destroyed , the 1937 Fox vault fire is now understood as a significant loss of American film heritage . Film historian Anthony Slide called the destruction of the Fox Film Corporation vault " the most tragic " American nitrate fire . The highest quality examples of every Fox film produced prior to 1932 were destroyed . Although copies located elsewhere allowed some of these films to survive , mostly as lower @-@ quality prints or mere fragments of film , more than 75 % of Fox 's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost . Total or near lost filmography rates occurred for Fox performers like Theda Bara , <unk> <unk> , William Farnum , George Walsh and notorious celebutante performer Evelyn Nesbit , who made less than a score of films for the Studio . The Little Ferry vaults also held works by other film studios which had contracted with Fox for distribution . Educational Pictures had more than 2 @,@ 000 negatives and prints destroyed , including the negatives of Buster Keaton 's silent films with the company . Also present was the original negative of D. W. Griffith 's Way Down East ( which Fox had purchased with the intent of remaking ) , the negative for the controversial Christie Productions sponsored film The Birth of a Baby , and films by smaller studios such as Atherton Productions , Peck 's Bad Boy Corporation , Principal Pictures , and Serial Producing . Archival material intended for the Museum of Modern Art 's Film Library was lost as well . 
 The destruction of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in fire safety as an aspect of film preservation . Unlike previous large nitrate film fires , the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock was determined to be responsible . Investigators suggested that the older nitrocellulose film stored in the archive was of lower quality than then @-@ current film and thus more prone to instability . The Society of Motion Picture Engineers 's Committee on Preservation of Film , three months after the vault fire , cited " recent and rather extensive film fires " as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the " fire problem " . More heavily reinforced film vaults were suggested , to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities . Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed , as was further research into improving the quality of cellulose acetate film to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film . 
 = Battle of Nam River = 
 The Battle of Nam River was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( NK ) forces early in the Korean War from August 31 to September 19 , 1950 , in the vicinity of the Nam River and the Naktong River in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops were able to repel a North Korean attack across the river . 
 Positioned in defense of Masan during the Battle of Masan , the US 35th Infantry Regiment , 25th Infantry Division took up positions along the Nam River , one of the many tributaries of the Naktong River on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter . The North Korean People 's Army 's 7th Division effected a crossing of the river on August 31 , and though the 35th Infantry was able to stem the North Korean advance , thousands of North Korean troops were able to exploit a hole in the line and surround the regiment . What followed was an intense battle in which the US and North Korean units were heavily engaged all along and behind the Kum River line . Eventually , though , the North Korean force was routed and defeated by the US troops . 
 During the battle , the 35th Infantry was instrumental in forcing back the North Korean division and preventing it from advancing to capture Pusan . The delay was enough for UN forces to counterattack Inchon , effectively defeating the entire North Korean army at the Pusan Perimeter . The 35th Infantry 's performance in the battle earned the regiment a Presidential Unit Citation .

 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the June 25 , 1950 , outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea . The United States , a member of the UN , subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II , five years earlier , and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division , headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th was ordered to South Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive . The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans , making time for the 1st Cavalry and the 7th and 25th Infantry Divisions , along with other US Eighth Army supporting units , to move into position . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , the first encounter between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith , the 24th Infantry Division was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , where it was almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops was roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 With Taejon captured , North Korean forces began surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it . The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver . The two divisions attempted to envelop the UN 's left flank , but became extremely spread out in the process . They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers , repeatedly pushing back US and South Korean forces . 
 American forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance in a series of engagements in the southern section of the country . Forces of the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment , newly arrived in the country , were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27 , opening a pass to the Pusan area . Soon after , North Korean forces took Chinju to the west , pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks . US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2 . Suffering mounting losses , the Korean People 's Army force in the west withdrew for several days to re @-@ equip and receive reinforcements . This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter .

 During the lull in fighting following the Battle of the Notch , Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered the US 25th Infantry Division , under Major General William B. Kean , to take up defensive positions on the Pusan Perimeter southern flank west of Masan . By August 15 , the 25th Infantry Division had moved into these positions . Rough terrain west of Masan limited the choice of the positions . The mountain group west of Masan was the first readily defensible ground east of the Chinju pass . The 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) mountain ridges of Sobuk @-@ san dominated the area and protected the Komam @-@ ni @-@ Haman @-@ Chindong @-@ ni road , the only means of north @-@ south communication west of Masan . 
 To the north , from the Masan @-@ Chinju highway to the Nam River , were several easily defensible positions . The most favorable was the high ground near Chungam @-@ ni , which controlled an important junction connecting the Masan road with the road over the Nam River to Uiryong . It was essential for the US 25th Infantry Division 's right flank to connect with the left flank of the US 24th Infantry Division at the confluence of the Nam and the Naktong Rivers . Therefore , the 25th Infantry Division also moved to protect the Komam @-@ ni road intersection where the Chindong @-@ ni @-@ Haman road met the Masan @-@ Chinju highway . 
 Meanwhile , the NK 6th Division was ordered to await reinforcements before continuing the attack . From north to south , the division had its 13th , 15th , and 14th Regiments . The first replacements arrived at Chinju on about August 12 . Approximately 2 @,@ 000 unarmed South Koreans conscripted in the Seoul area joined the division by August 15 . At Chinju , the NK 6th Division issued them grenades and told the recruits they would have to pick up weapons from killed and wounded soldiers on the battlefield . Another group of 2 @,@ 500 replacements conscripted in the Seoul area joined the 6th Division on August 21 , bringing the division 's strength to approximately 8 @,@ 500 men . In the last week of August and the first week of September , 3 @,@ 000 more recruits conscripted in southwest Korea joined the division . The 6th Division used this last body of recruits in labor details and only later employed them as combat troops . As a part of the North Korean build @-@ up in the south , the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan with another 10 @,@ 000 men . The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear . 
 On August 31 , 1950 , the 25th Division held a front of almost 30 miles ( 48 km ) , beginning in the north at the Namji @-@ ri bridge over the Naktong River and extending west on the hills south of the river to the Nam 's confluence with it . It then bent southwest up the south side of the Nam to where the Sobuk @-@ san mountain mass tapered down in its northern extremity to the river . There the line turned south along rising ground to Sibidang @-@ san , crossed the saddle on its south face through which passed the Chinju @-@ Masan railroad and highway , and continued southward up to Battle Mountain and on to P 'il @-@ bong . From P 'il @-@ bong the line dropped down spur ridge lines to the southern coastal road near Chindong @-@ ni . The US 35th Infantry Regiment held the northern 26 @,@ 000 yards ( 24 @,@ 000 m ) of the division line , from the Namji @-@ ri bridge to the Chinju @-@ Masan highway . The regiment was responsible for the highway . The regiment 's weakest point was a 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) gap along the Naktong River between most of F Company on the west and its 1st Platoon to the east . This platoon guarded the Namji @-@ ri cantilever steel bridge on the division 's extreme right at the boundary with the US 2nd Infantry Division across the Naktong River . South of the highway , the US 24th Infantry Regiment held the high ground west of Haman , including Battle Mountain and P 'il @-@ bong . Colonel John L. Throckmorton 's US 5th Infantry Regimental Combat Team held the southern spur of Sobuk @-@ san to the coastal road at Chindong @-@ ni . From Chindong @-@ ni some ROK Marine Corps units continued the line to the southern coast . Kean 's 25th Division command post was at Masan , the 35th Infantry command post was on the east side of the Chirwon @-@ Chung @-@ ni road , the 24th Infantry command post was at Haman and Throckmorton 's command post was at Chindong @-@ ni . By August 31 , the division was suffering manpower shortages , and a limited number of KATUSAs were brought in to replenish its ranks . 
 = = Battle = = 
 In the southern part of its sector , where the US 25th Infantry Division held the UN line , the NK I Corps planned a strong attack , coordinating it with an attack against the US 2nd Infantry Division to the north . The North Korean 6th and 7th Divisions received their attack orders on August 20 . The North Korean operations order called for the NK I Corps to assault all along the line at 22 : 00 on August 31 . The 6th Division , farthest south on the right flank , was to attack through Haman , Masan , and <unk> and capture <unk> , on the west side of the Naktong River delta 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Pusan , by September 3 . The division zone of attack was to be south of the Chinju @-@ Komam @-@ ni @-@ Masan highway . The 7th Division , next in line north of the 6th Division , was to attack north of the Masan highway , wheel left to the Naktong , and wait for the 6th Division on its right and the NK 9th Division on its left to join it . Part of the 7th Division was concentrated in the Uiryong area west of the Nam River . This plan pitted the 6th Division against the US 24th Infantry Regiment and the 7th Division against the US 35th Infantry Regiment . As a part of this plan , the NK 6th Division had been engaging the 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain for several weeks prior , to a stalemate . Kean , aware of a pending offensive and distrusting the 24th Infantry 's ability , began to compile a report on the regiment 's performance to determine how to improve its capabilities . The North Korean 6th Division struck the 24th Infantry at Haman on August 31 , and pushed it back after heavy engagements . The NK 6th Division and the US 24th Infantry Regiment remained locked in a bitter fight for the next week . 
 = = = North Korean crossing = = = 
 Meanwhile , the North Korean 7th Division troops committed all of their effort into attacking the US 35th Infantry line . At 23 : 30 on August 31 , a North Korean SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled high @-@ velocity gun from across the Nam fired shells into the position of G Company , 35th Infantry , overlooking the river . Within a few minutes , North Korean artillery was attacking all front @-@ line rifle companies of the regiment from the Namji @-@ ri bridge west . Under cover of this fire a reinforced regiment of the NK 7th Division crossed the Nam River and attacked F and G Companies , 35th Infantry . Other North Korean soldiers crossed the Nam on an underwater bridge in front of the paddy ground north of Komam @-@ ni and near the boundary between the 2nd Battalion , led by Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins , Jr . , holding the river front and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard G. Teeter 's 1st Battalion holding the hill line that stretched from the Nam River to Sibidang @-@ san and the Chinju @-@ Masan highway . The 35th Infantry , facing shortages of materiel and reinforcements , was under @-@ equipped but nonetheless prepared for an attack . 
 At the river ferry crossing site in the low ground between these two battalions , the regimental commander placed 300 ROK National Police , expecting them to hold there long enough to serve as a warning for the rest of the forces . Guns from the flanking hills there could cover the low ground with fire . Back at Komam @-@ ni he held the 3rd Battalion ready for use in counterattack to stop an enemy penetration should it occur . Unexpectedly , the ROK police companies near the ferry scattered at the first North Korean fire . At 00 : 30 , North Korean troops streamed through this hole in the line , some turning left to take G Company in its flank and rear , and others turned right to attack C Company , which was on a spur of ground west of the Komam @-@ ni road . Elements of C and D Companies formed a defense line along the dike at the north edge of Komam @-@ ni where US tanks joined them at dawn . The North Koreans , however , did not drive for the Komam @-@ ni road fork 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of the river as the US commander , Lieutenant Colonel Henry Fisher had expected ; instead , they turned east into the hills behind 2nd Battalion . 
 The position of B Company , 35th Infantry , on the 1 @,@ 100 feet ( 340 m ) Sibidang @-@ san , flanked the Masan road 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of Komam @-@ ni and gave the company a commanding view over the surrounding countryside . It was a key position in the 25th Division line , and Kean was aware the North Koreans would consider it important ground to target for attack . The North Korean preparatory barrage there lasted from 11 : 30 to midnight . Under this cover , two battalions of the NK 13th Regiment , 6th Division , moved up within 150 yards ( 140 m ) of the American foxholes . At the same time , North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks , SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns , and antitank guns moved toward Komam @-@ ni on the road at the foot of Sibidang @-@ san . An American M4A3 Sherman tank there destroyed a T @-@ 34 just after midnight , and a 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch bazooka team destroyed a self @-@ propelled gun and several 45 mm antitank guns . 
 On the crest of Sibidang @-@ san , an antipersonnel minefield stopped the first North Korean infantry assault . More attacks followed in quick succession , all of which were repulsed by the US troops ' superior firepower . By 02 : 30 the B Company riflemen were so depleted of ammunition that they began stripping machine @-@ gun bullets from the ammunition belts and using them in their rifles . The 1st Platoon of C Company , at the base of the mountain behind B Company , climbed Sibidang @-@ san in 45 minutes with an ammunition resupply for the company . Just before dawn the North Korean attack subsided . Daylight revealed a vast amount of abandoned North Korean equipment scattered on the slope just below the crest , including 33 machine @-@ guns . Among the North Korean dead was the commanding officer of the NK 13th Regiment . 
 At daybreak on September 1 , a relief force of C Company headquarters troops , led by American tanks , cleared the road to Sibidang @-@ san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon , B Company , with ammunition just in time for it to repel another North Korean assault . This failed assault resulted in the killing of 77 and capturing of 21 North Koreans . Although the 35th Infantry held all its original positions , except that of the forward platoon of G Company , 3 @,@ 000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines . The farthest eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north @-@ south road there . 
 In the meantime , the NK 6th Division had made breakthroughs in the US 24th Infantry sector to the south , overwhelming the regiment and forcing it back . The 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , on the ridges overlooking Haman , was pushed back as its soldiers retreated without orders . Survivors from the 24th Infantry 's 1st and 2nd battalions later appeared in the 35th 's lines , and the regimental commanders found that the entire regiment had crumbled under North Korean attack . Kean ordered the 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry to move in and help restore the 24th 's position . 
 = = = North Korean infiltration = = = 
 In a counterattack after daylight , K Company and tanks had partially regained control of the ridges overlooking Haman , but not completely . Large numbers of North Koreans were behind the battle positions of the 35th Infantry as far as the Chirwon @-@ ni and Chung @-@ ni areas , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) east of Komam @-@ ni and the front positions . The North Koreans continued to cross the Nam River after daylight on September 1 in the general area of the gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions . UN observation aircraft spotted an estimated four companies crossing there and directed fire of the 64th Field Artillery Battalion on the crossing force , which destroyed an estimated three @-@ fourths of it . Fighter planes then strafed the survivors . Later another large group of North Koreans were spotted in the open at the river later in the day and American aircraft directed artillery fire on the column , with an estimated 200 North Korean casualties . 
 The NK I Corps plan of attack below the Nam River was for its 6th Division to push east along the main Chinju @-@ Komam @-@ ni @-@ Masan highway through the 1st Battalion , 35th Infantry , and at the same time for major elements of its 7th Division to swing southeast behind the 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry , and cut the Chirwon road . This road crossed the Naktong River over the cantilever steel bridge at Namji @-@ ri from the US 2nd Infantry Division zone and ran south through Chirwon to join the main Masan highway 8 miles ( 13 km ) east of Komam @-@ ni near the village of Chung @-@ ni , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) northwest of Masan . These two avenues of approach , the Komam @-@ ni @-@ Masan highway and the Chirwon road converging at Chung @-@ ni , formed the axes of their attack plan . 
 US Engineer troops counterattacking up the secondary road toward Chirwon during September 1 made slow progress , and North Koreans stopped them in the early afternoon . The 35th Infantry was now surrounded by forces of the NK 6th and 7th Divisions , with an estimated three battalions of them behind its lines . Speaking later of the situation , Fisher said , " I never intended to withdraw . There was no place to go . I planned to go into a regimental perimeter and hold . " 
 = = = US 2 @-@ 27th Infantry counterattack = = = 
 By mid @-@ afternoon , Kean felt that the situation was a severe threat to the integrity of the division 's line . He ordered the 2nd Battalion , US 27th Infantry Regiment , to attack behind the 35th Infantry , because a large part of the division 's artillery there was under direct North Korean infantry attack . During the morning hours of September 1 , when the NK 7th Division troops had attacked , the first American unit they encountered was G Company , 35th Infantry , at the north shoulder of the gap . While some North Korean units peeled off to attack G Company , others continued on and engaged E Company , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) downstream from it , and still others attacked scattered units of F Company all the way to its 1st Platoon , which guarded the Namji @-@ ri bridge . There , at the extreme right flank of the 25th Division , this platoon drove off a North Korean force after a fierce fight . By September 2 , E Company had destroyed most of a North Korean battalion in heavy fighting . 
 Of all the 2nd Battalion units , G Company received the hardest blows . Before dawn of September 1 , North Korean troops had G Company platoons on separate hills under heavy assault . Shortly after 03 : 00 they overran the 3rd Platoon , Heavy Mortar Company , and drove it from its position . These mortarmen climbed Hill 179 and on its crest joined the 2nd Platoon of G Company . Meanwhile , the 3rd Platoon of G Company , on a low hill along the Nam River 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from its juncture with the Naktong River , was also under close quarters attack . After daylight , Captain LeRoy E. <unk> , G Company commander , requested artillery concentrations and air strikes , but they were slow to come . At 11 : 45 , the North Koreans had almost reached the crest of the hill , and only a narrow space separated the two forces . A few minutes later <unk> was killed , and Second Lieutenant George Roach , commanding the 3rd Platoon , again reported the situation and asked for an air strike . The US Air Force delivered the strike on the North Korean held side of the hill , and this checked the assaults . By this time many North Korean troops had captured and occupied foxholes in the platoon position and from there threw grenades into other parts of the position . One of the grenades killed Roach early in the afternoon . Sergeant First Class Junius Poovey , a squad leader , now assumed command . By 18 : 00 , Poovey had only 12 effective troops left in the platoon , 17 of the 29 men still living were wounded . With ammunition almost gone , Poovey requested and received authority to withdraw into the main G Company position . After dark , the 29 men , three of them carried on stretchers , withdrew , covered by the arrival of US tanks . The group reached the G Company position on Hill 179 at 23 : 30 . 
 = = = Stalemate = = = 
 While G Company held its positions on Hill 179 on September 2 against North Korean attack , 2nd Battalion , 27th Infantry started an attack northwest toward it at 17 : 00 from the Chung @-@ ni area . The battalion made slow progress against formidable North Korean forces . The night was extremely dark and the terrain along the <unk> @-@ ri ferry road was mountainous . After fighting throughout the night , the battalion reached a position south of the original defensive positions of G Company , 35th Infantry the next day at 15 : 00 . A coordinated attack by US armor , artillery , air , and infantry got under way and by 18 : 00 the battalion had re @-@ established the battle line . In this attack the 2nd Battalion , 27th Infantry , killed 275 North Koreans and recovered a large part of the equipment G Company had lost earlier . 
 The 2nd Battalion , 27th Infantry remained on the regained positions during the night of September 3 . At 08 : 00 the next morning , G Company , 35th Infantry , relieved it on the regained positions and started its attack back up the supply road . While this was in progress , word came that the North Koreans had again driven G Company from its newly reestablished position . The 2 @-@ 27th Infantry turned around , attacked , and once more restored the G Company positions . By 12 : 00 September 4 , the 2 @-@ 27th Infantry again turned over these positions to G Company and resumed its attack to the rear along the road in the gap between the 1st and 2nd Battalions , 35th Infantry . Almost immediately it was in contact with North Korean forces . Soon North Korean machine @-@ guns were firing on the US troops from three directions . Torrential rains fell and observation became poor . By this time , the 2 @-@ 27th Infantry was running short of ammunition . The commander ordered the battalion to withdraw 500 yards ( 460 m ) to favorable terrain so that it could resupply . 
 Resupply proved to be a difficult task . The battalion had cleared the supply route two days previously in its attack to the G Company position but now it was closed again . The battalion commander requested air supply and the next morning , September 5 , eight transport planes accomplished the resupply and the 2nd Battalion , 27th Infantry , was ready to resume its attack to the rear . By evening it had cleared the supply road and adjacent terrain of North Korean penetration for a distance of 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) to the rear of G Company 's front @-@ line positions . There the 2 @-@ 27th Infantry received orders to halt and prepare to attack northeast to link up with the 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry . 
 = = = US 3 @-@ 27th Infantry moves up = = = 
 After 2 @-@ 27th Infantry had left the Chung @-@ ni area on September 2 in its attack toward G Company , the North Koreans attacked the 24th Infantry command post and several artillery positions . To meet this new situation , General Kean ordered the remaining battalion of the 27th Infantry , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George H. DeChow , to attack and destroy the North Koreans operating there . 
 After an early morning struggle on September 3 against several hundred North Koreans in the vicinity of the artillery positions , DeChow 's battalion launched its attack at 15 : 00 over the high , rugged terrain west of the " Horseshoe , " as the deep curve in the Masan road was called , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of Komam @-@ ni . Its mission was to seize and secure the high ground dominating the Horseshoe , and then relieve the pressure on the 24th Infantry 's rear . Initially only one artillery piece was in position to support the attack . After the battalion advanced some distance , a North Korean force , estimated to number more than 1 @,@ 000 men , counterattacked it and inflicted heavy casualties , which included 13 officers . Additional US tanks moved up to help secure the exposed right flank and rear , and air strikes helped to contain the North Korean force . The battalion finally succeeded in taking the high ground . 
 The next morning , September 4 , instead of continuing the attack toward the 24th Infantry command post , 3rd Battalion , 27th Infantry was ordered to attack into the Komam @-@ ni area where North Korean troops were fighting in the US artillery positions . This attack got under way at 09 : 00 in the face of heavy small arms fire . In the afternoon , heavy rains slowed the attack , but after an all @-@ day battle , I and K Companies , with the help of numerous air strikes , captured the high ground dominating the Komam @-@ ni crossroads . Numerous casualties in the battalion had led Kean to attach C Company , 65th Engineer Combat Battalion , to it . The next day , September 5 , the 3rd Battalion , 27th Infantry turned its attack across rugged terrain toward Haman and drove through to the vicinity of the 24th Infantry command post . In its attack , the 3rd Battalion counted more than 300 North Korean dead in the area it traversed . 
 = = = Artillery attacked = = = 
 The series of events that caused Kean to change the direction of DeChow 's attack toward Komam @-@ ni began at 01 : 00 , September 3 . The 1st Battalion , 35th Infantry , protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea . Behind its positions on Sibidang @-@ san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands , and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road . On Sibidang @-@ san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1 , completely surrounded by barbed wire , booby traps , and flares , with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters . The battalion had the advantage of calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches . An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion . The fight there continued until dawn September 3 , when the 1st Battalion , 35th Infantry , counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions , and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men . The 35th units also had the advantage of well @-@ constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate . 
 In this night battle the 64th Field Artillery Battalion , supporting the 1st Battalion , became directly involved in the fighting . About 50 North Koreans infiltrated before dawn to A Battery 's position and assaulted it . North Koreans employing submachine guns overran two artillery @-@ machine @-@ gun perimeter positions , penetrating to the artillery pieces at 03 : 00 . There , Captain Andrew C. Anderson and his men fought hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the North Koreans . Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack , aided by the concentrations of fire from C Battery , 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby , which cut off the North Koreans from reinforcements . In defending its guns in this night battle , A Battery lost seven men killed and 12 wounded . 
 Fighting in support of the Nam River front in the northern part of the 25th Division sector were five batteries of the 159th and 64th Field Artillery Battalions , firing 105 mm howitzers , and one battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion which fired 155 mm howitzers , for a total of 36 guns . One 155 mm howitzer fired from Komam @-@ ni to the area north of Chungam @-@ ni , the route for the NK 6th Division 's supplies . Another forward artillery piece kept the <unk> @-@ ni bridge over the Nam under fire . The 25th Division artillery estimated it killed approximately 1 @,@ 825 North Korean soldiers during the first three days of September . In this critical time , the US Fifth Air Force added its firepower to that of the division artillery in support of the ground force . Walker attributed the UN victory in this sector directly to the extensive air support his division received in the battle . 
 = = = North Koreans repulsed = = = 
 Bitter , confused fighting continued behind the 35th Infantry 's line for the next week . Battalions , companies , and platoons , cut off and isolated , fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them . Airdrops also supplied relief forces trying to reach the front @-@ line units . Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips . In general , the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions , while at first one battalion , and later two battalions , of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3 @,@ 000 North Koreans operating to its rear . 
 Although the 25th Division generally was under less pressure from North Korean units after September 5 , there were still severe local attacks . On September 6 , 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry , moved north from the Haman area to join 2nd Battalion in the cleanup of North Korean troops behind the 35th Infantry and below the Nam River . Caught between the 35th Infantry on its hill positions along the river and the attacking 27th Infantry units , large numbers of North Koreans were killed . Sixteen different groups reportedly were dispersed with heavy casualties during the day . By morning of September 7 there was clear evidence that survivors of the NK 7th Division were trying to escape across the Nam River . However the North Koreans launched another attack against the 35th Infantry , which it quickly repulsed . The 25th Infantry Division buried more than 2 @,@ 000 North Korean dead , killed between September 1 and 7 behind its lines . This number did not include those killed in front of its positions . 
 Heavy rains caused the Nam and Naktong Rivers to rise on September 8 and 9 , reducing the danger of new crossings . On September 8 , after the 35th Infantry had been guarding it for a week , American F @-@ 82 Twin Mustangs mistakenly bombed the Namji @-@ ri bridge over the Naktong and with one 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb destroyed the 80 feet ( 24 m ) center span . Only the bridges north of the junction of the Nam with the Naktong were supposed to be under aerial attack at this time . Some of the local commanders thought that had the North Koreans bypassed this bridge and crossed the Naktong farther east there would have been nothing between them and Pusan . However , North Korean attacks against 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry occurred nightly . The approaches to the bridge on the north side were mined . At one time there were about 100 North Korean dead lying in that area . From September 9 to 16 , there were limited attacks on the 35th Infantry 's front but most of the North Koreans ' momentum had been broken and they could not muster strong attacks against the regiment again . 
 = = = North Korean withdrawal = = = 
 The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and forced them back on all fronts . On September 16 , however , 25th Infantry Division was still fighting North Korean forces behind its lines , and North Korean strong points existed on the heights of Battle Mountain , P 'il @-@ bong , and Sobuk @-@ san . Kean felt that the division could advance along the roads toward Chinju only when the mountainous center of the division front was clear . He therefore believed that the key to the advance of the 25th Division lay in its center where the North Koreans held the heights and kept the 24th Infantry Regiment under daily attack . The 27th Infantry on the left and the 35th Infantry on the right , astride the roads between Chinju and Masan held their positions and could not advance until the situation in front of the 24th Infantry improved . 
 On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned of Battle Mountain during the night , and the 1st Battalion , 24th Infantry , moved up and occupied it . On the right , the 35th Infantry began moving forward . There was only light resistance until it reached the high ground in front of Chungam @-@ ni where hidden North Korean soldiers in spider holes shot at 1st Battalion soldiers from the rear . The next day the 1st Battalion captured Chungam @-@ ni , and the 2nd Battalion captured the long ridge line running northwest from it to the Nam River . Meanwhile , the North Koreans still held strongly against the division left where the 27th Infantry had heavy fighting in trying to move forward . 
 The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area the night of September 18 – 19 . The NK 7th Division withdrew from south of the Nam River while the 6th Division sideslipped elements to cover the entire front . Covered by the 6th Division , the 7th had crossed to the north side of the Nam River by the morning of September 19 . Then the NK 6th Division had withdrawn from its positions on Sobuk @-@ san . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the Battle Mountain positions , which were no longer of strategic importance . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The 35th Infantry suffered 154 killed , 381 wounded , and two missing during the battle . The 27th Infantry lost a total of 118 killed , 382 wounded , and one captured during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , however this included five killed and 54 wounded at the Battle of the Bowling Alley and around 150 casualties at the First Battle of Naktong Bulge . In support of the Nam River operations , the 64th Field Artillery Battalion suffered 16 killed , 27 wounded , one captured and five missing , the 159th Field Artillery Battalion lost 18 killed and 41 wounded , and the 90th Field Artillery Battalion 15 killed , 54 wounded and one missing . The regiment had performed so well in repulsing the North Koreans that Kean nominated it for a Presidential Unit Citation . 
 The North Korean troops suffered heavily in the fight , most becoming casualties in the attack . By mid @-@ September , the NK 7th Division was reduced to just 4 @,@ 000 men , a loss of 6 @,@ 000 from when it was committed to the perimeter . Only 2 @,@ 000 from the NK 6th Division returned to North Korea , a loss of 80 percent of its strength . Large groups of troops from the divisions were captured as they attempted to return to North Korea , including up to 3 @,@ 000 troops . The attacking force of over 20 @,@ 000 had been reduced to only 6 @,@ 000 by the end of the fights at Masan . 
 The fight at Masan remained a bitter stalemate during the entire six weeks of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter . Each side attempted several offensives on the other in an attempt to force a withdrawal , but the North Koreans were unable to pierce the UN perimeter , and the UN troops were unable to overwhelm the North Koreans to the point they were forced to withdraw . The battle itself was a tactical tie , since neither side could decisively defeat the other , however the UN units achieved their strategic goal of preventing the North Koreans from advancing further east and threatening Pusan . Instead , they were able to hold the line against repeated attacks until the Inchon attack , and were thus successful in defeating the North Korean army in subsequent engagements .

 The Sikh diaspora is the modern Punjabi Sikh migration from the traditional area of the Punjab region . Sikhism is ( de facto ) an ethnic religion but welcomes converts , the Punjab region being the historic homeland of Sikhism . The Sikh diaspora is largely a subset of the Punjabi diaspora . 
 The starting point of the diaspora is commonly accepted to have begun after the fall of the Sikh Empire in 1849 and the Empire 's subsequent annexation into the British Raj . The most famous personification of the Sikh diaspora was the first , Maharajah Duleep Singh , the last Emperor of the Sikhs who was coerced into a lifetime exile by the British Raj . Since Duleep Singh 's exile , the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high ; however the destination for Punjabi Sikh migrants has changed during the ensuing 150 years . The development of the Punjabi Sikh diaspora concept has given diaspora Sikhs a conscious political and cultural identity , which forms a reference point for their ' Sikhism ' .

 The Sikhs as a political entity , distinct from other Indian traditions , can be said to have begun with the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru , Guru Arjan Dev Ji in 1606 , Sikh distinction was further enhanced by the establishment of the Sikh ' Pure ' brotherhood or Khalsa ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , by Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1699 . This gives the Sikhs , as an organized political grouping , a relatively recent history of around 400 years . Migrations of Sikhs during the era of the Gurus were limited to the boundaries of modern @-@ day India and Pakistan , and in particular restricted to the Sikh tribal heartland of the Punjab Region . The development of the Sikh Confederacy and the development of the Sikh Empire ( 1716 – 1849 ) , led to Sikhs migrating to conquered parts of their empire such as Ladakh and Peshawar . However these migrations were limited , transitory and unsustained , depending on the Empire 's fluctuating boundaries . During the time of the Sikh Empire , there was a net cultural immigration , with Napoleonic and British influences vying for the ' ear ' of the then Sikh Maharajah Ranjit Singh . With respect to the Sikh diaspora , the most important political aspect of this period was the historical establishment of a Sikh homeland ; the idea of a powerful Sikh state was a reality . 
 = = Annexation of the Punjab = = 
 Sikh migration from the Punjab began in earnest in the second half of the 19th century when the British Raj had successfully completed its annexation of the Punjab . The pivotal action in the British annexation was the lifetime exile of the then eleven @-@ year @-@ old Maharaja , Duleep Singh , thus making Singh the first ( although unwilling ) member of the Sikh diaspora . 
 Although a largely secular figure who did little for the Sikh body politic , Axel ( 2001 ) argues that Duleep Singh 's exile has had a major impact on the Sikh diaspora psyche . Axel ( 2001 ) says that Duleep Singh is the archetypal ' tragic hero ' figure in Sikh culture , " a King without a Kingdom , a Sikh separated from his people " ; the contrast between Duleep Singh and his strong ruler father , Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji , makes Duleep 's exile even more ' galling ' for the Sikhs and results in a strong sense of communal injustice , which is a later trait in the diaspora 's development . 
 Having annexed the Sikh Kingdom , the British Raj preferentially recruited Sikhs in the Indian Civil Service and , in particular , the British Indian Army , which led to migration of Sikhs to different parts of British India and the British Empire . <unk> artisans were transported from the Punjab to British East Africa to help in the building of railways , while many Sikhs found themselves in Australia working as <unk> , or <unk> and as labourers on cane plantations . 
 = = 20th century = = 
 The Sikhs made tremendous contributions to Punjab from 1857 to 1947 . Sikhs founded the city of Rawalpindi . Sikh agricultural and entrepreneurial skills brought prosperity to Sheikhupura , Sialkot , Jhelum , Multan , Sargodha , Gujrat , Ludhiana , Amritsar , <unk> . Lahore , the capital of undivided Punjab , had thriving Sikh neighborhoods . 
 The era of peace and prosperity turned into a nightmare in 1947 . The partition of Punjab between India and Pakistan was a seminal tragedy for Sikhs . The Sikh communities were practically wiped out from Lahore , Rawalpindi , Multan , Sialkot , Lyallpur , Jhelum , Gujrat , Sargodha , Sheikhupura and other districts of West Punjab . The birthplace of Sikhism , <unk> Sahib , was split away in West Punjab . Millions of Sikhs fled to freedom and safety in East Punjab in India . On the other hand , in East Punjab many Sikhs took revenge and slaughtered a great number of the Muslim population of Amritsar , Ludhiana , and <unk> in just three months . Other cities such as <unk> , Faridkot , Ambala , Moga , Jalandhar , and Batala had large casualties against Muslims . Most of the Muslims in East Punjab were wiped out in the middle of 1948 , but some converted just to stay alive . Such intense violence in East Punjab had caused many villages and cities to go through construction . 
 In 1960s and beyond many Sikhs migrated to the UK and North America in search of economic opportunities . Some of the Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan leader Idi Amin in 1972 . Sikhs are primarily an agrarian community and with the pressures of having only a limited amount of land , high birth rates and the desire to make a better living , the male offspring of Sikh farmers were encouraged to migrate to foreign countries . Subsequently the main ' push ' factor for Sikh migration has been economic with significant Sikh communities now being found in Canada , the United Kingdom , the United States , Malaysia , East Africa , Australia and Thailand . 
 = = Agitation for a homeland = = 
 Axel ( 2001 ) argues that the Sikh diaspora community , having established themselves in foreign countries , begin to fetishize the past and nurture idealized designs for their ' lost and imaginary ' Sikh empire . This comes into fruition to a certain degree with the establishment of Indian Punjab in 1966 as a Sikh majority state . However , <unk> ( 1998 ) argues that the marginalization and sense of grievance that Indian Sikhs were facing due to Indira Gandhi 's heavy @-@ handed tactics were amplified in the Sikh diaspora . Subsequently , the Sikh diaspora , especially in Canada and the UK become willing suppliers of logistical and financial support when the organic agitation for a separate Sikh nation , Khalistan , began in the late 1970s . The actions taken by the Indian government to counter the Sikh separatist movement , via 1984 's Operation Blue Star , had a seismic effect on the Sikh diaspora . Axel ( 2001 ) argues that the desecration of the Sikh 's holiest shrine , <unk> Sahib , and the following Sikh Genocide in which thousands of Sikhs were massacred ; led to a resurgence in Sikh religiosity and a strengthening of ties with their Sikh brethren in Punjab . Diaspora Sikhs felt betrayed by India , and the events of 1984 defined their Sikhism and underlined a distinct commonality shared with other diaspora Sikhs . Mark Tully describes 1984 's Operation Blue Star as the Sikh 's ' 9 / 11 ' , this was certainly the case for diaspora Sikhs , who in the main could only watch on in horror as the events of 1984 played out on TV . 
 In 1971 Dr <unk> Singh Chohan , an ex @-@ minister in a short @-@ lived government of Akali dissidents , saw an alignment of like @-@ minded Sikhs . Chohan placed a half @-@ page advertisement in The New York Times of 12 October 1971 , making several claims about Punjab as a Sikh homeland . However , Chohan won little sympathy from ordinary Sikhs . 
 <unk> summarises the change in Sikh diaspora community leaders post 1984 a being a " painful transition from a self @-@ confident community with haughty discourse , to the self @-@ defensive strategies of a vulnerable minority " . Organisations such as the International Sikh Youth Federation ( <unk> ) , the Babbar Khalsa and the Council of Khalistan emerged within the diaspora , and these agencies rallied against " Hindu imperialism " or " Indian nationalism " and lobbied to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization <unk> aligning the Sikh cause with other ethnic groups seeking freedom , citing cases of Jews , Palestinians , Kurds , <unk> , <unk> and Sri Lankan Tamils . 
 Axel ( 2001 ) argues that the history of the Sikh diaspora , its psyche of grievance and the violence inflicted on it , means that the notion of the Sikh diaspora as a community today inevitably converges on the notion of Khalistan . In addition to this , Axel points out the ' nightmare ' scenario facing the Sikh diaspora ; the Indian state ' demands ' the ' Unity @-@ in @-@ Diversity ' model of ' <unk> <unk> ' ( national integration ) which Axel contends is signified by " the denial of difference through surrender , assimilation and integration " . 
 Since the formation of the Khalsa , the Sikhs have defined themselves though their ' separateness ' and have differentiated themselves philosophically and physically from other Indian religious communities , thus the process of ' <unk> <unk> ' is a threat to <unk> itself . Any ' weakening ' or ' dilution ' <unk> in the Punjab , is doubly painful for the Sikh diaspora for it means a corresponding weakness in Khalistan , which , both real and imaginary , epitomizes the Sikh diasporic place today . 
 = = Sikh identity today = = 
 Whilst the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high , traditional patterns of Sikh migration that favored English speaking countries , particularly the United Kingdom , has changed in the past decade due to factors such as stricter immigration procedures . <unk> ( 2006 ) states that as a consequence of the ' fact ' that Sikh migration to the UK had " become virtually impossible since the late 1970s " , Sikh migration patterns altered to continental Europe . Italy has now emerged as a fast @-@ growing area for Sikh migration , with Reggio Emilia and the Vicenza province being areas of significant Sikh population clusters . The Italian Sikhs are generally involved in the areas of agriculture , agro @-@ processing , machine tools and horticulture . Canada has maintained a liberal immigration policy , and the Sikh community there is the second largest in proportion to the country 's population after only India , and about 2 @.@ 5 times the size of the American Sikh community . The largest North American Sikh community is thought to be located in South Vancouver , British Columbia and nearby Surrey , British Columbia , while Brampton , Ontario also has a large Sikh population . The Sikh migration to Australasia has also increased to a large extent in the first decade of the 21st century . 
 In the post @-@ 9 / 11 era , the Sikh diaspora in Europe and North America stand out as a visible minority often confused with radical Islamic groups because of their turbans . There have been numerous hate crimes targeted at Sikhs . France banned turban @-@ wearing Sikh students from publicly funded schools as part of a broader policy originally intended to <unk> Muslim head @-@ scarves . Western security think @-@ tanks quote the Air India bombing to justify profiling of Sikh travellers at airports . The soft influences of popular culture and the need for fitting in with peers are driving many young Sikhs to shed Khalsa symbols such as the turban and beard . Some second @-@ generation Sikhs growing up in the West do not have proficiency in the Punjabi language . On the other hand , small groups of Westerners have converted to Sikhism . There are now Sikh <unk> ( <unk> of churches and temples ) scattered across Europe , North America , Australia and Malaysia . The combination of these factors creates a new and more complex Sikh identity that may slowly emerge in the 21st century . 
 As globalisation progresses and India and the Punjab 's economies continue to expand , the question is whether the Sikh diaspora 's focus will shift from inward @-@ looking identity and Khalistan issues to <unk> @-@ looking global trade and homeland investment like the successful Jewish and Chinese diasporas . 
 = 2010 Nobel Peace Prize = 
 The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to imprisoned Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo " for his long and non @-@ violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China " . The laureate , once an eminent scholar , was reportedly little @-@ known inside the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) at the time of the award due to official censorship ; he is a veteran of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , and a co @-@ author of the Charter 08 manifesto for which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison on 25 December 2009 . Liu , who was backed by Václav Havel and Desmond Tutu , received the award among a record field of more than 200 nominees . 
 The decision , while widely praised by foreign intellectuals and politicians , was attacked by the Chinese government and the state media . A number of countries , including Saudi Arabia and Russia , also denounced the award and what they regarded as interference in China 's domestic affairs . Following the announcement , official censorship was applied within China — on the Internet , television , and in print media . The government strongly denounced the award , and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing to make a formal protest . The Chinese authorities arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate . Liu 's wife was put under house @-@ arrest before the decision of the Nobel Committee was announced . 
 Chinese diplomats moved to pressure other countries not to attend the award ceremony , which was scheduled for 10 December . Western missions in Oslo received warning letters from their Chinese counterparts ; the deputy foreign minister also warned countries of " the consequences " . In December , the Chinese foreign ministry continued the rhetorical assault , claiming " more than 100 countries and international organisations [ had ] expressed explicit support of China 's position " . In the end , 46 countries attended of the 65 invited ( People 's Republic of China and 19 other nations declined invitations ) . China 's official news agency , Xinhua , attacked the West for its " Cold @-@ War or even colonial mentality " , and for daring to " regard themselves as the judge , the teacher [ who ] assume that they can forever distort the fact and block the truth by using political maneuvers . " Strong rhetoric and denunciations of the West continued from official sources until after the ceremony . 
 Liu is the first person of Chinese nationality to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , and the first to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China . Liu is the third person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention after Germany 's Carl von Ossietzky ( 1935 ) and Burma 's Aung San Suu Kyi ( 1991 ) . As the laureate was absent , Liu 's place on the podium was unoccupied ; Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann read I Have No Enemies , an essay that Liu had written for his trial in December 2009 , in place of the acceptance speech . 
 = = Nomination and announcement = = 
 The Nobel Committee disclosed there were a record number of nominations in 2010 – a total of 237 , of which 38 were organisations . Although the committee has a policy of keeping nominations confidential for 50 years , some nominators made announcements . Among the nominees were Russian human rights activist Svetlana <unk> , the International Space Station , the Internet and its three founders Larry Roberts , Vint Cerf and Tim Berners @-@ Lee . Also on the list were Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo , Hu Jia , Gao Zhisheng , Chen Guangcheng , Bao Tong , and Rebiya Kadeer . 
 Liu was nominated by International PEN , the worldwide association of writers . Interested in Western philosophy , Liu made his reputation as a literary critic with a treatise on the state of modern Chinese literature : an article he published in 1986 that criticised Chinese writers for their dependence on the state , and their deficit in free @-@ thinking , caused a stir in the Chinese literary world . His challenging ideas caught the attention of the intellectuals ; he lectured all over China and abroad . He was in New York when the 1989 pro @-@ democracy movement erupted in China ; he returned immediately to China and spent most of his time amongst the protesters in Tiananmen Square . This , and his subsequent leadership role in the Charter 08 pro @-@ democracy manifesto for China , led the Chinese authorities to censor his views as subversive . Liu was jailed for 11 years on 25 December 2009 , for " inciting subversion of state power . " A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said " It would be completely wrong for the Nobel Prize committee to award the prize to [ Liu ] " . In January 2010 , Václav Havel and others — including the 14th Dalai Lama , André <unk> , Vartan Gregorian , New Zealand politician Mike Moore , Karel Schwarzenberg , Desmond Tutu and Grigory <unk> — published an article endorsing Liu . A professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , Xu <unk> , and others , addressed an open letter " to the European People " in support of Liu , while 14 exiled dissidents urged the Nobel Committee to pass over Liu 's nomination , arguing that Liu had maligned other dissidents , forsaken the oppressed Falun Gong and that his stance against the Chinese leadership had become too " soft " . 
 Agence France @-@ Presse reported that at a June meeting convened by the Chinese embassy in Oslo , Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying warned the Nobel Institute director and secretary of the Nobel Committee , Geir Lundestad , that giving the prize to Liu Xiaobo would be seen as an " unfriendly gesture " that would have negative consequences for relations between Oslo and Beijing . 
 On 7 October 2010 , Norwegian television networks reported that Liu Xiaobo was the front @-@ running candidate for the Prize . Irish bookmaker Paddy Power paid out two days before the announcement following an increase in bets . Shortly before the announcement , Liu 's wife , Liu Xia , declined telephone interviews , saying the police were at her home . Her telephone went unanswered once the announcement was made . Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjørn Jagland made the announcement on 8 October 2010 in Oslo , mentioning that the choice of Liu had become clear early in the process . The monetary component of the prize would be 10 million Swedish kronor ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 million ) . 
 The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2010 to Liu Xiaobo for his long and non @-@ violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China . The Norwegian Nobel Committee has long believed that there is a close connection between human rights and peace . Such rights are a prerequisite for the ' fraternity between nations ' of which Alfred Nobel wrote in his will ... The campaign to establish universal human rights also in China is being waged by many Chinese , both in China itself and abroad . Through the severe punishment meted out to him , Liu has become the foremost symbol of this wide @-@ ranging struggle for human rights in China . 
 At 2 pm on the day of announcement , a crowd of about 100 journalists , supporters , and friends who had gathered outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the <unk> resided were denied entry . The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment at the time of the announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well @-@ wishers . It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award . By that time , Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison . Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police ; one such celebration dinner in Beijing , attended by 20 people , was broken up by police , and the attendees were detained .

 = = = Chinese media = = = 
 The Chinese media avoided the story of Liu 's Peace Prize , in marked contrast with their previous announcements of other recipients of Nobel Prizes . The official Xinhua News Agency downplayed all but the literature prize , and most other mainland news portals followed the Xinhua lead ; popular internet portals such as Sina.com and <unk> deleted pages dedicated to stories related to all five Nobel Prizes . According to a well @-@ informed Twitter user , cited by the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong , the Information Office of the State Council issued a directive immediately after the announcement that " Liu Xiaobo " and " Peace Prize " would be prohibited search terms for microblog services across the country ; fora , blogs and other interactive media were forbidden from releasing any information . At 6 pm , the source said that although the official news release had been issued , all media were ordered by the Central Propaganda Department not to publish it . 
 Major domestic newspapers in China had coverage on their inner pages . Guangming Daily , Economic Daily , Beijing Daily , Beijing News , and Shanghai 's Wen Hui Bao published the Xinhua @-@ sanctioned report the following day . China Central Television 's main evening news programme , <unk> <unk> , did not report on it . Chinese journalists and dissidents said the Central Propaganda Department had instructed media to censor or otherwise under @-@ report on Liu Xiaobo and the peace prize award . 
 The Chinese government ordered the deletion of all print and broadcast stories on the topic ; In an editorial , the Communist Party – run Global Times attacked the Nobel Peace Prize as a " political tool of Western interests " that was being used to foment " endless political strife in Chinese society , causing a Soviet @-@ style breakup . " Another Global Times article said the award was " another expression of this prejudice , and behind it lies an extraordinary terror of China 's rise and the Chinese model " . It said the award was a concerted ideologically motivated attack on China 's economic interests by developed nations and foreign business interests who " even hope that China will one day collapse under the West 's ideological crusade . " 
 Foreign broadcast coverage , such as from the BBC and CNN , was blacked out whenever Liu was mentioned . In Guangdong , signal carriers for Hong Kong TVB were interrupted for approximately eight minutes during the 6 pm evening news programme , blocking the news item for the Nobel Peace Prize . 
 After a week of denunciation in China 's English @-@ language media , with most journals silent about the award except for perfunctory quotes from the foreign ministry , the country 's Chinese @-@ language media launched a concerted assault on Liu and the award , accompanied by renewed attacks in the English @-@ language media . Xinhua argued on 17 October that the Communist Party had made " unremitting efforts to promote and safeguard human rights " , and questioned how Liu 's actions had contributed to human rights progress for the Chinese people . The agency cited a journal from Saudi Arabia , and one from Russia , that had denounced the award ; it quoted the Pakistani Foreign Office as saying , " the politicization of the Nobel Peace Prize for the purposes of interference in the domestic affairs of states is not only contrary to the recognized principles of inter @-@ State conduct , but also a negation of the underlying spirit conceived by the founder of the Prize . " In what was described by Chinese media – watchers as a surprise because of its historical professionalism , China Youth Daily published an article containing Beijing students ' expressions of anger and disbelief over the decision to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu . The journal employed the traditional hard @-@ liner phrase " people with ulterior motives " ( <unk> ) — directed to at least one student . It further denounced the " farcical " Nobel decision to use the award as " a tool ... in their relentless effort to undermine China and frustrate its development " . 
 On 18 October , the Global Times published the results of a telephone poll of 866 Beijing , Shanghai , and Guangzhou residents , who , the journal said , were chosen at random : 507 of the respondents felt the committee owed the Chinese people an apology and should cancel the award to Liu ; more than half agreed Liu should remain incarcerated until he is paroled . The survey also showed " a low recognition of Liu among the public in China , as more than 75 percent of respondents had no idea who the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize was . " The Beijing Daily published an editorial on the day of the award ceremony entitled " Why not give the peace prize to Julian Assange ? " . It suggested that Assange , the head of WikiLeaks , was not awarded the prize because he could not " become a tool for Western forces in attacking countries with different ideologies ... even if this tool is serving out a prison sentence for violating the law . " 
 = = = Central government = = = 
 Following the announcement on 8 October 2010 , Xinhua relayed the Russian state @-@ owned news agency 's denunciation of the prize . China summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing " to officially share their opinion , their disagreement and their protest . " A PRC foreign ministry spokesman accused politicians from " some countries " for using the award to further their own political agendas : " This is not only disrespect for China 's judicial system but also puts a big question mark on their true intention . " The ministry 's statement , labelling the decision " a blasphemy " , was carried on Chinese state television . 
 The Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to people who contribute to national harmony , country @-@ to @-@ country friendship , advancing disarmament , and convening and propagandizing peace conferences . Liu was a criminal sentenced by the Chinese judicial authorities for violating Chinese law ... The Nobel committee 's decision to award such a person the peace prize runs contrary to and desecrates the prize . 
 China protested to Norway , saying that China – Norway relations had been damaged . A planned meeting in Beijing between Norwegian Fisheries Minister Lisbeth Berg @-@ Hansen and Chinese food control authorities was cancelled at the last minute , ostensibly because their counterparts had " other engagements " ; Norwegian officials said that a meeting , due to be held the same day between Berg @-@ Hansen and the Chinese vice @-@ minister for fisheries , had been cancelled in reaction to the award . Elsewhere , performances of a Norwegian musical starring Alexander Rybak scheduled for the following month also fell victim to the diplomatic fallout , according to the composer . In early December , Norway said its bilateral trade talks with China had been delayed indefinitely . Haakon <unk> , Norway 's negotiator , reported that the postponement was not directly linked to the award , but Henning Kristofferson , director of international relations of the BI Norwegian School of Management , said it was fairly obvious that the PRC government would " never hold a high @-@ level meeting with Norway shortly before or after the award ceremony " , having made it plain that the award to Liu was " a big mistake . " 
 = = = Law enforcement = = = 
 In the days immediately preceding the award ceremony , foreign media reported that Liu 's home was under tight security . By what a correspondent for The Guardian called " a peculiar coincidence " , construction barriers were erected on both sides of the road at the southern entrance of the residential complex which obscured the estate . Police cars were positioned on every nearby street corner ; uniformed and plain @-@ clothes police officers patrolled outside the apartment block , and a radio surveillance vehicle was stationed at the entrance to the compound . Neighbouring businesses were affected : the owner of a nearby restaurant was quoted as saying government officials had told him to close the business temporarily . 
 Liu Xia was under house @-@ arrest almost immediately after the announcement , and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband . She reported that she was denied visitors , her telephones were repeatedly down , and complained that even her elderly mother had not been able to get through to her . Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound , including Norwegian diplomats who had tried to visit her on 12 October ; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter . Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area . Thus , journalists and well @-@ wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement ; as she was being taken away to see her husband , Reuters heard her say " they are forcing me to leave Beijing " . Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police — that Tiananmen Mother Ding <unk> , and her husband Jiang <unk> , had not been seen or heard of for four days , and that their phones were cut off . Writer Jiang <unk> went missing just days after the Nobel announcement . 
 As exiled prominent activists and former activists were reportedly preparing to attend the award ceremony , some prominent individuals and activists inside China experienced travel problems . Economist Mao Yushi ( who had signed Charter 08 ) , Ai Weiwei , and the human @-@ rights lawyer Liu <unk> were all barred from outbound travel at Beijing 's airport , ostensibly because their departure from China could " endanger state security " . Liu 's lawyer , Mo <unk> , and Peking University law professor He <unk> were stopped from boarding their flight to London in November . The South China Morning Post reported that even the spouses and children of some outspoken intellectuals experienced outbound travel restrictions . Ai speculated that the refusal to let him board a flight for Korea may have been directly connected with the following week 's prize @-@ giving ceremony . Chinese Human Rights Defenders also believed that " officials are increasing their efforts to bar prominent members of Chinese civil society from travelling internationally as the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony approaches . " The BBC , citing the UN , said there was information that China had detained at least 20 activists prior to the ceremony ; it reported sources saying that 120 more activists were subjected to house arrest , travel restrictions , forced relocations , or " other acts of intimidation " ahead of the ceremony ; external Chinese sources put the figure of people so restricted at approximately 270 . 
 = = = Liu Xia and Liu Xiaobo = = = 
 Liu Xia expressed her gratitude to the Nobel Committee , Liu 's <unk> , and those who have been supporting him since 1989 , including the Tiananmen Mothers — family members or representatives of those who were killed , or had disappeared , in the military crackdown of the protests of 4 June 1989 . She said , " The prize should belong to all who signed Charter 08 and were jailed due to their support " . 
 Liu Xia informed the laureate of his award during a visit to Jinzhou Prison on 9 October 2010 , one day after the official announcement . She reported that Liu wept and dedicated the award to those who suffered as a result of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , saying : " The award is first and foremost for the Tiananmen martyrs " After Ms. Liu returned home , she was put under house arrest and was watched by armed guards . She expressed the desire to attend the prize @-@ giving in Norway in December , but was sceptical of her chances of being allowed to do so . Liu Xia wrote an open letter to 143 prominent figures , encouraging them to attend the award ceremony in Oslo . 
 = = = Intellectuals = = = 
 John Pomfret of The Washington Post said a wide spectrum of Chinese and foreigners believed that Liu 's award " could actually resonate more deeply within China than any similar act in years " . The open letter by Xu <unk> et al , which described Liu as " a splendid choice " because of his advancement of human rights causes and the peaceful fight against social injustice , amassed signatures from about 200 mainland intellectuals and activists ; it was posted in Chinese , English , French and Japanese on websites hosted outside China . Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that , although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed , " intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities " should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for . Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values , notwithstanding China 's economic performance . Writer Liao Yiwu , a close friend of Liu , described it as " a big moment in Chinese history " . Another writer , Yu Jie , said he spent the night awake with tears streaming down his face – " Twenty years ago Liu Xiaobo said that China needed someone with moral clarity about what China needs . Now he has become just that person , that he himself was looking for " , he said . Former Chinese diplomat Yang <unk> described it as a strong signal to the Chinese government to speed up political reform " or you will have a lot of enemies around you and within you . " 
 Exiled 1989 student leader Wang Dan said he was " ecstatic " . Human rights lawyer Li Heping called the award " huge encouragement for the Chinese people ... an affirmation that there are people around the world who really care about human rights and the legal system in China , that the world hasn 't forgotten us . " He added that others , such as Gao Zhisheng , Chen Guangcheng , and Hu Jia , also deserved the prize . The Globe and Mail said that while many activists agreed he was worthy of the award , some radical reformers within Chinese democracy movement , such as Wei <unk> , see the moderate Liu as the wrong choice due to his advocacy of a gradual path to constitutional democracy in China . 
 Renmin University professor Zhang Ming felt the award would not have much direct impact . However , economist Mao Yushi believed that there were many factors affecting political reform in China . He stated that the prize was an impetus from the international community for the process of reform that was already under way , and that the impact of the award to Liu would be felt by the current generation of leaders , and beyond .

 Liu was once an eminent scholar , but was reportedly little @-@ known inside the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) at the time of the award due to official censorship . Those who had heard about Liu had mixed views about him . Some clearly supported the government position , whereas one university student was quoted as saying " George Orwell probably had no idea that what he wrote would end up being the reality of China now . " " Liu Xiaobo " and " Nobel Peace Prize " became the most searched terms among internet users in China . However , some time after the release of the official response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry , government censors screened the news item , and there were reports of searches in China using Chinese search engines returning error pages . Web searches using Chinese search engines for " Liu Xiaobo " in Chinese without attaching the words " Peace Prize , " gave information about Liu . Yet most sites found " Liu " plus " Peace Prize " yield only the official foreign ministry response . CNN reported that any mention of " Nobel Prize " on microblogging sites was censored . One person claimed that his SIM card was deactivated after he sent a text message to a relative about the Nobel Peace Prize . Accustomed to circumventing Chinese internet censorship , bloggers and forum @-@ users used variants of Liu 's name and posted subtle or cryptic messages to express their elation about the award or sarcasm towards the state . The statement on 8 October by renowned blogger Han Han consisted of only a pair of double quote marks . 
 Less than three weeks after the announcement of the award to Liu , the Nobel Peace Prize website came under a cyber attack . There was an attempt to hack into the computer of the secretary of the Nobel Committee , Geir Lundestad by a forged email on 3 November . A number of individuals received an email containing a trojan horse purportedly disguised as a pdf @-@ file invitation to the award ceremony from the Oslo Freedom Forum . Investigators traced both the attack and the email to an intermediate server reportedly in a Taiwanese university . Experts say the address had been falsified , and the exact origin was unknown ; it was emphasised that no link to any party in mainland China could be established . After activists posted photographs of a symbolic empty chair on Internet fora and <unk> , censors responded by removing the images and making " empty chair " a banned search term . 
 = = = Hong Kong = = = 
 Many political groups — including the Democratic Party and the Hong Kong Journalists Association — welcomed the decision and congratulated Liu . The Journalists Association expressed their gratitude and encouragement for Liu 's award , and their hope for the early unconditional release of Liu . Hong Kong 's Chief Executive , Donald Tsang , and government ministers Leung Chun @-@ ying , and Gregory So , all declined to comment to the press . 
 The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong said Liu 's courage to stand up for the rights of all people — for the fourth time since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests — made him worthy of joining the company of other similarly persecuted peace prize recipients such as Nelson Mandela : " Liu is just one of a long line of like @-@ minded Chinese citizens to be silenced . The award will be seen in many quarters as acknowledging their sacrifice for the values it upholds . " Hong Kong @-@ based Phoenix Television , which transmits throughout China by satellite , limited its report to the foreign ministry 's statement denouncing the honour . 
 About twenty activists held a celebration in front of the central government liaison office . Their celebration was broken up and the activists were arrested for assault after a guard was accidentally sprayed with champagne . A human rights monitor , and a Democratic Party legislator , denounced the " absurd " reaction of the police . The loyalist Speaker of Hong Kong 's legislature turned down an adjournment motion on 15 October submitted by Leung Kwok @-@ hung that called for the release of Liu on grounds that such debate " lacked urgency and would not produce irreversible consequences " . On 17 October , thirty supporters of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China — organisers of the annual commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen protests — held a march to the central government liaison office , calling on the central government to release Liu and allow him to attend the prize @-@ giving in December . A candlelight ceremony was held in the city 's central business district to coincide with the award ceremony ; organisers said 1 @,@ 000 people attended . 
 The Chinese @-@ language press reported on rumours that Chinese officials had approached high @-@ level executives at TVB and <unk> , asking them not to broadcast the ceremony live on their channels ; executives affirmed their plans to broadcast — scheduling for the event was immutable . TVB News and now TV executives categorically denied having been contacted by Chinese authorities to pull the plug on coverage . An editorial in the South China Morning Post said : " this heavy @-@ handed reaction [ to Liu 's award ] is counterproductive to [ China 's ] image and the respect it wants as a peaceful superpower . Liu 's award did pose a dilemma , but having made its point at the outset Beijing had little further to gain . Attempts to meddle in the process did nothing to dignify its stand . "

 One day after the award announcement , President Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's office urged China to exercise greater tolerance of dissidents ; the president himself pleaded for the release of Liu , to " solve major human rights incidents with honesty and confidence . " Forty @-@ eight non @-@ governmental organisations jointly issued a two @-@ page statement expressing optimism for political change in China . The statement said that the world " stands in solidarity with [ the ] Chinese people who share Liu 's vision for a strong , prosperous and above all , democratic , China . " 
 The Taipei Times said the award suggested strong support for China 's democracy movement , and predicted the inevitability of change . " The CCP needs to decide whether to attempt to obstruct democracy or facilitate its development . If it chooses the former then history will pass it by , just as it did the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . If , however , the CCP decides to embrace change then it could ... remain a political force " like the Kuomintang in Taiwan .

 In advance of an official Chinese response to the Nobel Committee 's decision , Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre said that a Chinese complaint to the Norwegian government would be in vain , since the committee is independent of the Norwegian government , even though it is appointed by the Parliament of Norway . This official position was reiterated to the People 's Republic of China by their Norwegian ambassador . After the announcement , Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said the decision " directs a spotlight on the human rights situation in China , and underscores the links between development , democracy and universal human rights . " Norway summoned the Chinese ambassador to Norway to express its regret at China 's reaction , to urge for the release of Liu , and to remove restrictions on his wife . The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten revealed that Foreign Minister Støre had a pre @-@ emptive meeting with Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjørn Jagland , about Liu as the expected recipient , two weeks before the announcement . According to anonymous sources within both the Foreign Ministry and the Nobel Committee itself , Støre is said to have raised certain " concerns " . The Norwegian press quoted Jagland as saying that this enquiry was of such a peculiar kind that he would have to present the Nobel Committee with the minutes of the meeting . Former Nobel Committee chairman Ole <unk> <unk> and a number of Norwegian researchers and politicians criticised Støre for breaching protocol and meddling in the work of the Committee . 
 Norwegian peace activist and author , Fredrik S. Heffermehl criticised the Nobel Committee for failing to follow Alfred Nobel 's dying wish to promote disarmament , by giving the award to Liu . Heffermehl said that less than 50 percent of the awards made after World War II had been made in accordance with Nobel 's will .

 While the Cuban and Venezuelan governments were notably critical , leading politicians in the Western world welcomed the news and called for the release of Liu . Non @-@ aligned and developing countries such as Russia , Brazil and India , many Asian and Middle Eastern countries were silent . UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon recognised China 's " remarkable economic advances [ that have ] lifted millions out of poverty " , and said he hoped " any differences on this decision will not detract from advancement of the human rights agenda globally or the high prestige and inspirational power of the award " . President of the United States Barack Obama lauded Liu 's eloquence and courage , while his government called for his immediate release . 
 The European Union and member governments praised the decision , and also called on China to release Liu . European Commission President José Manuel Barroso stated that " the decision of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee is a strong message of support to all those around the world who , sometimes with great personal sacrifice , are struggling for freedom and human rights . " The Polish foreign ministry said it was appreciative of the decision to award Liu . Japan greeted the award and emphasised the need for respect of human rights , but did not call for Liu 's release ; Premier Naoto Kan told a parliamentary committee Liu 's release was " desirable " . The Australian prime minister , Julia Gillard , said Australia was strongly against Liu 's imprisonment , and " welcome [ d ] the fact that his work has been recognised internationally now with the Nobel Peace Prize " , while the Australian Greens leader Bob Brown described the decision as " inspiring " . Brown contrasted Norway 's courage with the " sheer ignorance and <unk> of most of Australia 's politicians on the plight of campaigning democrats in China " . The Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper expressed his delight , and said he hoped the award " would cause our friends in the Chinese government to look seriously at that issue of his release from prison . " 
 However , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez sided with China , saying the award should be given to those who " have done the most for fraternity between nations , the abolition or reduction of standing armies and promotion of peace congresses " . Pakistan and Cuba denounced the choice , saying Liu was exactly " the type of ' dissident ' that the United States has been designing for decades to use ... as fifth columns in those countries that they disagree with because those countries dissent from [ American ] hegemony . " The United Arab Emirates expressed regret over the " politically motivated " decision to award Liu , which it said was " against the UAE 's fundamental belief in respecting other nations ' sovereignty and non @-@ interference . " 
 On 8 December , the United States House of Representatives voted by 402 to 1 to congratulate Liu and honour his " promotion of democratic reform in China , and the courage with which he has borne repeated imprisonment ... and [ call ] on the government of China to cease censoring media and internet reporting of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo and to cease its campaign of defamation against Liu Xiaobo . " The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded by accusing US lawmakers of possessing an " arrogant and unreasonable attitude " and " lacking respect for China 's judicial sovereignty . " Ahead of the award ceremony , Barack Obama said " Mr Liu Xiaobo is far more deserving of this award than I was ... [ He ] reminds us that human dignity also depends upon the advance of democracy , open society , and the rule of law ... The values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible . "

 The Dalai Lama expressed confidence that China would one day enjoy responsible governance through the efforts of Liu and others calling for democracy and freedom . He praised the award as " the international community 's recognition of the increasing voices among the Chinese people in pushing China towards political , legal and constitutional reforms . " Former Polish president Lech Wałęsa said he was " very satisfied " , describing the award as " a challenge for China and the entire world , [ which ] must declare whether it is ready to help China enter a zone where there is respect for the principles and values " . 
 However , Andre <unk> and Konstantin <unk> , who were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics , attacked the Nobel committee as " retired Norwegian politicians who have spent all their careers in a safe environment , in an oil @-@ rich modern country . They try to extend their views of the world , how the world should work and how democracy works in another country . " They also felt that China should be given due credit for undisputed improvements in human rights and the economy over the last 10 years . <unk> questioned : " What is a dictatorship ? It is not as if people are being constantly killed there , " The pair were rebutted by 2010 Nobel literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa , who said it was a timely reminder that China was still a dictatorship and quite monolithic regarding politics , and that the award was " a tribute to all Chinese dissidents and all Chinese who want not just economic but also political growth and progress in China . " 
 Human Rights Watch said the 2010 award honours " all those in China who struggle daily to make the government more accountable " and " shatter [ s ] the myth where the Communist Party presents itself as the voice of the Chinese people " . Canadian academic Professor Josephine Chiu @-@ Duke believed that many Communist Party members were " hoping that China can be free , democratic and civilized " , and hoped that the award would " encourag [ e ] more Chinese to speak up . " Former British diplomat in Beijing , Kerry Brown , lamented that , economically powerful though China is , its sole Nobel laureate languished in prison . 
 The Secretary General of Amnesty International , said : " the Chinese government might see this is as a victory , but they would be mistaken ... Because , while the other chairs in the packed hall on the day of the awards ceremony will each hold only one person , Liu 's empty chair will hold ... the thousands of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience [ who were ] victims of prosecution and persecution simply for having the courage to voice their views . " On the other hand , in an article appearing in China Daily , David Gosset of the China Europe International Business School said the award was " a sad paradox , a prize without any real winner , which generates mistrust and perplexity when understanding and clarity are most needed " . Gosset believed that only citizens were able to define the exact terms and pace of democratisation in their own country , and lamented the " fallacy " of implicitly associating the PRC with German Nazism or South African apartheid , and emphasised that China , a developing country with a per capita GDP of $ 3 @,@ 700 , could hardly adopt the socio @-@ political standards of the developed world without attenuating its development . He also argued that the choice of Liu was divisive in view of China 's memory of Western imperialism , and of Alfred Nobel 's dying wish to reward a person " who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations " . Professor Sidney Rittenberg said : " One does not have to approve of Mr Liu 's imprisonment in order to disapprove of his choice as a Nobel laureate ... Not only have courageous , intelligent individuals like Mr Liu made no tangible contribution to China 's advance , not only have their activities and his choice for a Nobel Prize made life more difficult for China 's dissidents — but the main point is that his advocacy of a multiparty system for the China of today would almost certainly lead to disaster , if carried out . To wit , Iran after the overthrow of the shah . " 
 = = = Media = = = 
 State @-@ owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti immediately criticised the prize as a " political tool " — a denunciation swiftly picked up and relayed by Xinhua . Radio Free Europe reported Solidarnost ( in Russia ) planned to hold a public rally in support of Liu in Saint Petersburg , but the authorities refused permission . In the end , 10 activists staged a protest outside the Chinese consulate there . 
 In an editorial , The Guardian said " to many western ears , the clamour of China 's markets is louder than the pleas of its dissidents . The Nobel committee is one of few institutions with sufficient status to be heard around the world . Its most coveted prize can now amplify Mr Liu 's voice . " The Telegraph said that the award was justified not only by Liu 's own courage , but was " a rebuke to Western governments , so hypnotised by China 's riches and cowed by self @-@ interest that they have shut their eyes and ears to the regime 's abuses of human rights . " 
 The New York Times applauded the award : " Beijing is used to throwing its weight around these days — on currency , trade , the South China Sea and many other issues . Too many governments , and companies , are afraid to push back . Maybe someone in China ’ s leadership will now figure out that bullying is not a strategy for an aspiring world power . " The French daily , Libération , referred to Liu as " the Chinese Havel " , saying " the Chinese government wanted to show the world that nothing would stop it from silencing its critics . However , China is today a part of the international community , and must respect the norms it accepted when it signed up for UN membership . The pressure it exerted upon the Nobel prize committee not to award Liu is unacceptable . " 
 On the other hand , an article in The Guardian pointed out Liu 's support for " the total westernisation of China " amongst other policies , such as the US invasion of Iraq , and on the tenor of the debate in the West : " Liu Xiaobo 's politics have been reduced to a story of a heroic individual who upholds human rights and democracy . His views are largely omitted to avoid a discussion about them , resulting in a one @-@ sided debate . " Its survey of 500 press articles published in Hong Kong about Liu showed " only 10 were critical of the man or peace prize . " 
 News agencies reported the Confucius Peace Prize , established at the suggestion of Global Times in response to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to a jailed dissident . The organiser denied any involvement of the Chinese government in the award and the Minister of Culture said they only became aware of the prize due to the press coverage . Hong Kong 's Ming Pao , which had obtained a copy of the letter from the organisers of the Confucius award to the ' winner ' , suggested that this was indeed unofficial – the letter did not bear the Ministry of Culture 's official seal . Die Welt said the rival award was " stupid " . 
 The Economist recalled how the Soviet Union prevented Andrei Sakharov from accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 , and suggested that Chinese leadership would probably have expected such a comparison . Both it and Die Welt made direct reference to the creation of a similar German National Prize for Art and Science by Nazi Germany after von Ossietzky was prohibited from leaving the country to collect the 1935 prize .

 In the lead @-@ up to the award ceremony , the Chinese authorities began a campaign through state media to criticise both Liu and the prize ; the Chinese foreign service in Beijing and abroad targeted Western government officials , urging them to stay away from the award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December and refrain from issuing any statements of support for Liu . At least two European embassies in Norway were sent letters by their Chinese counterparts , denouncing the prize for being an interference in China 's internal affairs and reaffirming their stance that Liu had committed crimes in China . One diplomat said his embassy 's letter from the Chinese embassy requested obliquely that they " refrain from attending any activity directed against China . " The Norwegian Nobel Committee said its invitation to the Chinese ambassador to attend the prize @-@ giving was returned unanswered . The Chinese Vice Foreign Minister also warned countries supporting Liu 's award that they would have to " take responsibility for the consequences " . 
 In December , the Chinese foreign ministry continued to denounce the award as " interference by a few clowns " . It said " more than 100 countries and international organisations [ had ] expressed explicit support of China 's position opposing this year 's peace prize . " However , according to the Nobel Committee , only the 65 countries with diplomatic missions were invited ; acceptances had been received from 46 countries , including the previously non @-@ committal India , while China and 19 others — Afghanistan , Algeria , Argentina , Cuba , Egypt , Iran , Iraq , Kazakhstan , Morocco , Nepal , Pakistan , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Sri Lanka , Sudan , Tunisia , Venezuela and Vietnam — declined invitations to the award ceremony " for various reasons " . On the eve of the award ceremony , China continued the rhetoric against the Nobel Committee and the West . A spokesman said : " We hope that those countries who have received invitations can tell right from wrong and uphold justice . It 's not an issue of human rights . It 's an issue of interfering in other countries ' internal affairs " ; the Nobel committee continued to be criticised for " encouraging crime " ; the Global Times repeated earlier suggestions that the award was a Western conspiracy against Beijing , a " charge against China 's ideology , aiming to undermine the benign surroundings for China 's future development . " 
 Colombia , Serbia , the Philippines and Ukraine initially announced they would not attend the ceremony , but later accepted the invitation . The Philippines ultimately did not attend : President Benigno Aquino III defended the Philippine non @-@ attendance as " in our national interest " ; the Philippine government , which had been heavily criticised in its national press for its decision , revealed its hope that China would show clemency to five Filipinos on death row for drug trafficking .

 The award ceremony , held as planned in Oslo City Hall on the afternoon of 10 December , was attended by about 1 @,@ 000 VIPs , diplomats and guests . Representing Norway were King Harald V , Queen Sonja and a number of politicians and officials ; among the 48 foreign dignitaries was the US House Speaker , Nancy Pelosi . The Chinese group was 46 @-@ strong , and included astrophysicist Professor Fang <unk> , Yang <unk> , and exiled former Tiananmen student leaders Chai Ling , Wu <unk> , Feng <unk> , and Fang Zheng , whose legs were crushed by a tank ; the Hong Kong delegation comprised Albert Ho , Emily Lau , and Lee <unk> @-@ yan . Outside the hall , pro @-@ democracy and human rights activists demonstrated ; about 50 China supporters held a protest outside the Norwegian Parliament . 
 The hall was decked with an immense portrait of Liu for the event . During the ceremony , the Nobel committee chairman Thorbjørn Jagland credited China 's leaders with the " extraordinary " economic transformation that has lifted millions of people out of poverty , but said they " must regard criticism as positive " considering the nation 's new status as a world power . Liu 's award marks the third occasion that the Prize has been bestowed upon a person in prison or detention , after Carl von Ossietzky ( 1935 ) and Aung San Suu Kyi ( 1991 ) ; Liu and Ossietzky were the only ones not to be present or represented by close family at the awards ceremony . The Nobel diploma and the prize were symbolically placed by Jagland on an empty chair meant for the absent laureate . Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann read I Have No Enemies , an essay by Liu written for his trial in December 2009 . 
 The proceedings were televised by the international media , but broadcast signals of CNN and BBC inside China were reportedly blocked . Images of and references to ' empty chair ' also became the target of official censorship . After the ceremony , the official Chinese news agency , Xinhua , continued the rhetoric against the award : 
 There are always some who cling to the Cold @-@ War or even colonial mentality , even in this 21st century . They regard themselves as the judge , the teacher , even though they have never been selected by the people of developing countries . They have never experienced the real life in developing countries , but they tend to act like the Savior wherever they go . They assume that they can forever distort the fact and block the truth by using political maneuvers . 
 Following the ceremony , an evening rally of more than 1 @,@ 000 people in Oslo called for Liu 's release . The marchers headed for the Grand Hotel , where laureates traditionally greet the crowd from the balcony . Assembled Chinese activists and dissidents said they were inspired by the award , that it was a much @-@ needed morale @-@ booster , and expressed hope that it would be a catalyst to resurrect the moribund Chinese pro @-@ democracy movement . Yang <unk> said : " The most important change is the change in people 's hearts ... this is the greatest achievement [ of this award ] , " The Global Times said of the ceremony : " It ’ s unimaginable that such a farce , the like of which is more commonly seen in cults , is being staged on the civilised continent of Europe " . On the other hand , a huge image with three empty chairs and five cranes adorned the front page the edition of 12 December of the Southern Metropolis Daily ; ambiguously , the headline read : " 2010 Asian Para Games Are Ready to Start Tonight in Guangzhou " . China Digital Times offered the interpretation that ' crane ' in Chinese ( he ) is a homonym for ' congratulations ' and the first character of ' peace ' . 
 The Nobel Peace Prize Concert to commemorate the 2010 prize was held on 11 December , the night following the award ceremony , as is the tradition . It was hosted by Denzel Washington and Anne Hathaway . The roster of confirmed performers announced before the award included Herbie Hancock , Florence and the Machine , Colbie Caillat , Elvis Costello . Those who were confirmed later included Barry Manilow , Jamiroquai , A. R. Rahman , India.Arie , Robyn and Sivert <unk> . 
 = Tropical Depression Five ( 2010 ) = 
 Tropical Depression Five was an Atlantic tropical cyclone that lasted for 12 hours , although its remnants persisted for almost another week . Its precursor was from a non @-@ tropical trough east of Florida , and on August 10 it developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico . It was the fifth depression of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season . The system was declassified as a tropical cyclone the following day , a remnant circulation later moved over Louisiana and Mississippi , producing heavy rainfall and causing flooding . Along the Florida coast , the system produced heavy waves that contributed to two deaths . Moving inland , the remnants of the depression reached central Alabama before turning southward . The system nearly redeveloped into a tropical cyclone on August 16 after it again reached the Gulf of Mexico , but it became disorganized and turned northward into Mississippi . The depression twice caused BP to delay work in building a relief well to combat the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the depression were from a dissipating cold front that extended from the northeast Gulf of Mexico across Florida on August 7 , connected to a weak non @-@ tropical low pressure area located several hundred miles east @-@ southeast of Jacksonville , Florida . The system had disorganized convection – thunderstorms – and moved generally southwestward after drifting against the Gulf Stream . Conditions were initially unfavorable for development , due to strong upper @-@ level wind shear and land interaction . By late August 9 , the low reached the southeastern Gulf of Mexico , and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) noted a medium chance for tropical or subtropical development , due to an anticipated decrease in wind shear . The convection gradually increased and became better organized , and a Hurricane Hunters flight late on August 10 confirmed the development of Tropical Depression Five about 120 miles ( 190 km ) west of Fort Myers , Florida . 
 Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone , the tropical depression had a broad circulation and organized deep convection . It was located over very warm water temperatures , although the upper @-@ level environment was not conducive for significant intensification . Easterly wind shear was forecast , but the NHC anticipated the depression strengthening to 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) before making landfall in Louisiana . Under the influence of a mid @-@ level ridge to its north , the depression was forecast to track generally northwestward . Early on August 11 , the convection diminished significantly due to the entrainment of dry air and vertical wind shear from a nearby upper @-@ level low . The circulation became difficult to locate ; however , conditions favored the redevelopment of the thunderstorm activity . One tropical cyclone prediction model forecast significant intensification to a minimum pressure of 968 mbar , and other models forecast the depression would reach hurricane status upon making landfall . As it continued to the northwest , the circulation remained broad and disorganized , and convection remained minimal . Late on August 11 , a Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the depression was no longer a tropical cyclone , and in post @-@ analysis , the NHC determined that the depression was only a tropical cyclone for 12 hours . Redevelopment was not anticipated . 
 The remnants of Tropical Depression Five moved ashore on Louisiana on August 12 , by which time the circulation had become better defined . A small circular area of convection was observed on radar approaching New Orleans , supported by diffluence from an anticyclone over Georgia . The system moved slowly , turning northeastward and tracking inland along southern Mississippi on August 13 . By late on August 14 , the remnants reached central Alabama and began to move southward due to a ridge to its north . The next day it reached the Florida Panhandle , and before the low reached open waters , the NHC assessed a 50 % chance for redevelopment due to favorable conditions . Early on August 16 , the low reached the Gulf of Mexico , and a Hurricane Hunters flight reported a weak circulation and convection that was disorganized and disassociated . Upper @-@ level conditions remained only marginally favorable , although the NHC noted that " only a small increase in organization would result in the formation of a tropical depression . " Early on August 18 , the remnants of the system dissipated over Southwestern Mississippi . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone , the system dropped locally heavy rainfall in portions of southern Florida . Palm Beach International Airport recorded 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 5 @.@ 7 cm ) on August 8 , a record for the date . The system spawned a weak tornado near Boca Raton , which downed a few trees and damaged shingles from one house . In Sarasota , high tides from the system affected 200 sea turtle nests , of which 20 had to be transported to a safer location . Once in the Gulf of Mexico , the developing system threatened the area affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill ; this prompted BP to stop operations temporarily in constructing a relief well . The same event occurred a week later when the depression was threatening to redevelop . 
 Upon issuing the first advisory on Tropical Depression Five , the NHC issued a tropical storm warning from Destin , Florida to Intracoastal City , Louisiana , including Lake Pontchartrain and New Orleans . Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal issued a state of emergency due to the threat from the depression . The remnants of the depression produced rough surf and riptides along the coast . In Panama City Beach , Florida , one man was hospitalized , and on Anna Maria Island , two elderly people died after being swept away by rip currents ; the deaths were believed to have been fatigue @-@ induced heart attacks , and not drowning . In the final advisory on the depression , the NHC noted the potential for the system to produce heavy rainfall across the southern United States . Accordingly , local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for 12 Louisiana parishes and 8 Mississippi counties . While the depression moved through the region , it dropped heavy rainfall of up to 8 in ( 20 cm ) around the New Orleans area , flooding streets as well as entering one apartment complex . Rainfall from the system extended as far inland as Atlanta , Georgia , where thunderstorms damaged three houses . 
 As the remnants moved southward toward the Gulf of Mexico , its associated thunderstorms struck Mobile , Alabama and produced heavy rainfall , estimated up to 4 in ( 10 cm ) . The rainfall flooded several streets and damaged the city 's water line , and 1 @,@ 921 customers were left without power . When the remnants affected Mississippi a second time , the system dropped heavy rainfall that resulted in flash flooding near Sibley . The system caused about $ 1 million in damage after floodwaters washed out a bridge and entered several buildings . As the system approached Louisiana for a second time , local National Weather Offices issued a coastal flood watch and a flash flood watch . Sixteen hours of intense rainfall occurred in Avoyelles Parish , flooding at least 40 buildings . Lightning killed three cows and destroyed a house , and damage was estimated around $ 750 @,@ 000 . Further inland , the remnants interacted with a stationary cold front over central Tennessee , causing $ 22 million in damage after heavy rainfall affected bridges , roads , and properties . 
 = Netley Castle = 
 Netley Castle is a former artillery fort constructed in either 1542 or 1544 by Henry VIII in the village of Netley , Hampshire . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire , and it defended Southampton Water near the Solent . The castle included a central , stone keep with two flanking gun platforms and was garrisoned by ten men . It was decommissioned during the English Civil War and by 1743 it was overgrown and in ruins . In the 19th century the property was gradually converted into a private house , being extended in a Gothic style , complete with octagonal towers . Between 1939 and 1998 it was used as a nursing home , until the high costs of maintenance led to its closure . Following an archaeological survey , it was then converted into nine residential flats . It is protected under UK law as a Grade II * listed building . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 16th – 17th centuries = = = 
 Netley Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry then broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and he took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 Netley Castle was built next to Southampton Water between the mouths of the Hamble and Itchen rivers , 250 metres ( 820 ft ) south @-@ west of the remains of Netley Abbey . Netley Abbey had been recently dissolved by Henry , and material from the site was reused to build the castle . William Paulet , later the Marquess of Winchester , was in charge of the construction , which took place in either 1542 or 1544 and Henry granted him various estates to pay for the support of the fort and its garrison . The castle took the form of a central keep , 19 @.@ 5 by 14 metres ( 64 by 46 ft ) across with deep embrasures along the battlements , and a gun platform on either side ; its design resembled that at nearby Southsea . It was initially garrisoned with two soldiers , six gunners and a porter , under the command of a captain . 
 It was still garrisoned in the mid @-@ 1620s and was probably still in active service at the start of the English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament in 1642 . Captain <unk> , a Parliamentary naval commander , seized Netley at the end of that year and decommissioned it as a fortification . During the Interregnum , the castle was restored to use , due to concerns about a potential Royalist invasion , but was abandoned as obsolete after the restoration of Charles II to the throne . By the time that Alexander Pope visited in 1734 , the castle was overgrown and in ruins . 
 = = = 18th – 20th centuries = = = 
 William Chamberlayne inherited the castle in 1826 and built a crenellated tower on the south @-@ east end of the property the following year , inspired by a proposal by the antiquarian Horace Walpole that the castle be made habitable . A description of the castle around this time suggested it stood " in the midst of a thicket of trees , on a little hill close to the beach " and formed " a striking object seen from the water " . It became popular with artists , and J. M. W. Turner visited and sketched the castle and its new tower , probably in 1832 . 
 George Hunt leased the castle in 1841 and it was turned into a private house under the supervision of the architect George Guillame . Hunt remained at Netley until 1857 , by when the castle had an oriel window overlooking the sea , and the battlements had been blocked in to allow the construction of a second storey to the building . George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873 , building a stone wall around the front of property . 
 Sir Henry Crichton bought the castle in 1881 , along with the surrounding gardens , orchards , pond and a boat house . The architect John Sedding remodelled the castle between approximately 1885 and 1890 , creating a Gothic styled house , adding another storey and a new wing . After Crichton 's death in 1922 his wife remained in the house until her death in 1936 , when the property and the surrounding grounds were sold at auction . 
 Middlesex County Council bought the castle in 1939 and converted it into a nursing home for elderly men ; it passed into the control of the National Health Service in 1948 and continued to be used as a nursing home . It proved expensive to maintain and the surrounding land was gradually sold off , until the Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust finally decided to close it in 1998 .

 <unk> Limited , a firm of property developers , purchased Netley Castle in 2000 and converted it into nine private residential flats , at a cost of £ 1 @.@ 7 million , during which process an archaeological survey was made of the property . It is protected under UK law as a Scheduled Monument and a Grade II * listed building . 
 The castle is now approximately 62 by 14 metres ( 203 by 46 ft ) across and 13 @.@ 5 metres ( 44 ft ) tall , surrounded by 1 @.@ 54 hectares ( 3 @.@ 8 acres ) of land .

 Badajoz ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; formerly written Badajos in English ) is the capital of the Province of Badajoz in the autonomous community of Extremadura , Spain . It is situated close to the Portuguese border , on the left bank of the river Guadiana . The population in 2011 was 151 @,@ 565 . 
 Conquered by the Moors in the 8th century , Badajoz became a Moorish kingdom , the Taifa of Badajoz . After the <unk> , the area was disputed between Spain and Portugal for several centuries with alternating control resulting in several wars including the Spanish War of Succession ( 1705 ) , the Peninsular War ( 1808 – 1811 ) , the Storming of Badajoz ( 1812 ) , and the Spanish Civil War ( 1936 ) . Spanish history is largely reflected in the town . 
 Badajoz is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida @-@ Badajoz . Prior to the merger of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz , Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric 's inception in 1255 . The city has a degree of eminence , crowned as it is by the ruins of a Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river , which flows between the castle @-@ hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal . The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history ; even the Badajoz Cathedral , built in 1238 , resembles a fortress , with its massive walls . Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz and AD Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB <unk> basketball club . It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport .

 Archaeological finds unearthed in the Badajoz area have been dated to the Bronze Age . Megalithic tombs are dated as far back as 4000 BC , while many of the steles found are from the Late Bronze Age . Other finds include weapons such as axes and swords , everyday items of pottery and utensils , and various items of jewellery such as bracelets . Archaeological excavations have revealed remnants from the Lower Paleolithic period . Artifacts have also been found at the Roman town of Colonia <unk> in the Badajoz area , although a significant number of larger artifacts were found in Mérida . 
 With the invasion of the Romans , which started in 218 BC during the Second Punic War , Badajoz and Extremadura became part of the administrative district called Hispania Ulterior ( Farther Spain ) , which was later divided by Emperor Augustus into Hispania Ulterior Baetica and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania ; Badajoz became part of Lusitania . Though the settlement is not mentioned in Roman history , Roman villas such as the La <unk> Villa have been discovered in the area , while Visigothic constructions have also been found in the vicinity . 
 = = = Founding to Middle Ages = = = 
 Badajoz attained importance during the reign of Moorish rulers such as the Umayyad caliphs of Córdoba , and the Almoravids and Almohads of North Africa . From the 8th century , the Umayyad dynasty controlled the region until the early 11th century . The official foundation of Badajoz was laid by the <unk> nobleman Ibn Marwan , around 875 , after he had been expelled from Mérida . Under Ibn Marwan , the city was the seat of an effective autonomous rebel state which was quenched only in the 10th century . In 1021 ( or possibly 1031 ) , it became the capital of a small Muslim kingdom , the Taifa of Badajoz ; with some 25 @,@ 000 inhabitants . Badajoz was known as <unk> ( Arabic : <unk> ) during Muslim rule . The invasion of Badajoz by Christian rulers in 1086 under Alfonso VI of Castile , overturned the rule of the Moors . In addition to an invasion by the Almoravids of Morocco in 1067 , Badajoz was later invaded by the Almohads in 1147 . 
 Badajoz was captured by Alfonso IX of León on 19 March 1230 . Shortly after its conquest , in the time of Alfonso X the Wise of Castile , a bishopric see was established and work was initiated on the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista . In 1336 , during the reign of Alfonso XI of Castile , the troops of King Afonso IV of Portugal besieged the city . However , soon afterwards , the Castilian @-@ Leonese troops , which included Pedro Ponce de León the Elder and Juan Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Coronel , second lord of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and son of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán , defeated the troops of Alfonso IV in the Battle of Villanueva de Barcarrota . Their victory forced the king of Portugal to desert the city and it fell into neglect . 
 In medieval times , the Sánchez de Badajoz family dominated the area as the lords of Barcarrota , near Badajoz , acquiring the property in 1369 when it was granted to <unk> Sánchez de Badajoz by Enrique II . They temporarily lost Barcarrota after a tiff with the Portuguese but soon regained control . <unk> Sánchez 's grandson of the same name , son of Garci Sánchez de Badajoz , was both lord of Barcarrota and Mayor of Badajoz in 1434 . Garci Sánchez de Badajoz , probably his son , was a notable writer , and one of his descendants , Diego Sánchez de Badajoz , was also a notable playwright ; his <unk> en metro was published posthumously in 1554 . 
 The first hospital was founded in the town by Bishop Fray Pedro de Silva in 1485 . Those affected by the plague epidemic were treated here in 1506 . During the 16th century the city experienced a cultural renaissance thanks to personalities such as the painter Luis de Morales , the composer Juan Vázquez , the humanist Rodrigo <unk> , the poet Joaquin Romero de Cepeda , the playwright Diego Sánchez de Badajoz , the Dominican mystic Fray Luis de Granada and architect Gaspar Méndez . In 1524 , a board meeting between representatives of Spain and Portugal took place in the Old Town Hall in the city to clarify the status of their territorial arrangements , attended by Hernando Colón , Juan Vespucio , Sebastián Caboto , Juan Sebastián Elcano , Diego Ribeiro and Esteban Gómez . With reason to assert their rights to the Portuguese Crown , Philip II of Spain briefly moved his court to Badajoz in August 1580 . Queen Anne of Austria died in the city two months later , and on 5 December 1580 , Philip moved out of the city . From 1580 until 1640 , as a result of the absence of war , the city flourished once again . According to the historian Vicente Navarro del Castillo , some 428 residents of Badajoz contributed to the Spanish conquest of the Americas , including Pedro de Alvarado , Luis de Moscoso , Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas ( father of Inca Garcilaso ) and Hernán Sánchez de Badajoz . In 1640 the city was attacked during the Portuguese Restoration War . 
 = = = 1660 – 1811 = = = 
 The battle for control of the town and its fortress continued with attacks by the Portuguese in 1660 . In 1705 , during the Spanish War of Succession , Badajoz was controlled by the Allies following the death of the heirless King Charles II . It was taken by Spain , prompting Philip V , grandson of Louis XI of France , to take over the reins of Spain itself . In 1715 Portugal signed a peace agreement with Spain and surrendered its claims to Badajoz in lieu of Spain 's cession of Sacramento territory in the La Plata area in South America . The Peace Treaty of Badajoz was signed between Spain and Portugal on 6 June 1801 . The Portuguese , feeling that an attack by French troops stationed in Ciudad Rodrigo was imminent , agreed to cede Olivenza to Spain and declared that it would close its ports to British ships . This agreement was revoked in 1807 as its terms were breached when the Treaty of <unk> was signed between Spain and France on 27 October 1807 . 
 During the Peninsular War , Badajoz was unsuccessfully attacked by the French in 1808 and 1809 . However , on 10 March 1811 , the Spanish commander , José Imaz , was bribed into surrendering to a French force under Marshal Soult . A British and Portuguese army , commanded by Marshal Beresford , endeavoured to retake it and on 16 May 1811 defeated a relieving force at Albuera , but the siege was abandoned the following month .

 In 1812 , Arthur Wellesley , Earl of Wellington ( and future duke ) , again attempted to take Badajoz , which had a French garrison of about 5 @,@ 000 men . Siege operations commenced on 16 March ; by early April , there were three practicable breaches in the walls . These were assaulted by two British divisions on 6 April , reputed to be " Wellington 's bloodiest siege " , with a loss of some 5 @,@ 000 British soldiers out of 15 @,@ 000 , after a five @-@ hour onslaught the storming of the breaches failed . The French also lost some 1 @,@ 200 of their 5 @,@ 000 soldiers in the battle . Despite the failure at the breaches , the castle and another section of undamaged wall had been attacked and the town was successfully taken by the British . Wellington wrote to Lord Liverpool , " The capture of Badajos affords as strong an instance of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed , but I anxiously hope that I shall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as that to which they were put last night . " However , Wellington 's storming of San Sebastián in 1813 was much like that of Badajoz . 
 Pedro Caro , 3rd Marquis of la Romana , died at Badajoz on 23 January 1811 in a fit of apoplexy , seized at the moment when he was leaving his house to concert a plan of military operations with Lord Wellington . In the Siege of Badajoz , a detachment of the 45th Regiment of Foot ( later amalgamated with the 95th to form the Sherwood Foresters Regiment ) succeeded in getting into the castle first and the red <unk> of Lt. James MacPherson of the 45th regiment was hoisted in place of the French flag to indicate the fall of the castle . This feat is commemorated on 6 April each year , when red jackets are flown on regimental flag staffs and at Nottingham Castle . Volume 23 of the Museum of Foreign Literature , Science and Art , published in 1833 , described Badajoz as " one of the richest and most beautiful towns in the south of Spain , whose inhabitants had witnessed its siege in silent terror for one and twenty days , and who had been shocked by the frightful massacre . " On 5 August 1883 there was an attempted revolt by the armed forces when a climate of confusion and chaos prevailed .

 The Spanish Civil War in Badajoz in the 1930s was a gruesome affair . During the war , Badajoz was taken by the Nationalists in the Battle of Badajoz . <unk> , several thousand of the town 's inhabitants , both men and women , were taken to the town 's bullring after the battle and after machine guns were set up on the barriers around the ring , an indiscriminate slaughter began . On 14 August 1936 , hundreds of Republicans were shot at the Plaza de Toros . In the course of the night , another 1 @,@ 200 were brought in . Overall it is estimated that over 4 @,@ 000 people were murdered by the Nationalists after the battle . Even those who tried to cross the Portuguese border were captured and sent back to Badajoz . The troops who committed the killings at Badajoz were under the command of general Juan Yagüe , who , after the civil war , was appointed Minister of Aviation by Franco . For the actions of his troops at Badajoz , Yagüe was popularly known as the " Butcher of Badajoz " .

 After the war , the town continued to grow , although since 1960 it has suffered significant migrations to other Spanish regions and other European countries . During the following decades , the predominant economic activity of the city increasingly fell within the tertiary sector , and today Badajoz is a major commercial centre in southwestern Spain and an important bridge between Spain and Portugal for trade and cultural relations . On 6 November 1997 , a heavy flood devastated several neighbourhoods of the city , causing the deaths of 21 people and devastating the property of hundreds . The catastrophe was caused by the Atlantic extratropical trough crossing the Iberian Peninsula and inundating the <unk> and <unk> brooks , which are usually dry . The neighbourhood of Cerro de Reyes , near the confluence of both streams , received the brunt of the damage caused by the flood .

 = William Robinson Brown = 
 William Robinson " W. R. " Brown ( January 17 , 1875 – August 4 , 1955 ) was an American corporate officer of the Brown Company of Berlin , New Hampshire . He was also an influential Arabian horse breeder , the founder and owner of the Maynesboro Stud , and an authority on Arabian horses . 
 After graduating from Williams College , Brown joined the family corporation , then known as the Berlin Mills Company , and became manager of the Woods Products Division , overseeing the company 's woodlands and logging operations . He became an early advocate for sustainable forest management practices , was a member of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission from 1909 until 1952 , and served on the boards of several forestry organizations . As chair of the Forestry Commission , Brown helped send sawmills to Europe during World War I to assist the war effort . He was influenced by the Progressive movement , instituting employee benefits such as company @-@ sponsored care for injured workers that predated modern workers ' compensation laws . As a Republican , he served as a presidential elector for New Hampshire in 1924 . 
 Brown founded the Maynesboro Stud in 1912 with foundation bloodstock from some of the most notable American breeders of Arabian horses . He looked abroad for additional horses , particularly from the Crabbet Arabian Stud , and imported Arabian horses from England , France and Egypt . At its peak , Maynesboro was the largest Arabian horse breeding operation in the United States . In 1929 , he wrote The Horse of the Desert , still considered an authoritative work on the Arabian breed . He served as President of the Arabian Horse Club of America from 1918 until 1939 . Brown was a remount agent and had a special interest in promoting the use of Arabian horses by the U.S. Army Remount Service . To prove the abilities of Arabians , he organized and participated in a number of endurance races of up to 300 miles ( 480 km ) , which his horses won three times , retiring the U.S. Mounted Service Cup . This accomplishment occurred even though The Jockey Club donated $ 50 @,@ 000 to the U.S. Army to buy Thoroughbreds that tried but failed to beat the Arabians . Brown 's legacy as a horse breeder was significant . Today , the term " CMK " , meaning " Crabbet / Maynesboro / Kellogg " is a label for specific lines of " Domestic " or " American @-@ bred " Arabian horses , many of which descend from Brown 's breeding program . In 2012 , the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society held a 100th anniversary celebration of the stud 's founding . 
 Although Brown family members sold personal assets to keep the Brown Company afloat during the Great Depression , including Brown 's dispersal of his herd of Arabian horses in 1933 , the business went into receivership in 1934 . Brown remained in charge of the Woods Division through the company 's second bankruptcy filing in 1941 . He retired from the company in 1943 and died of cancer in 1955 . His final book , Our Forest Heritage , was published posthumously , and his innovations in forest management became industry standards .

" His father , who had been out of town on the day of the record attempt , reviewed the results , inquired as to the amount of cut lumber that was actually shipped to customers , and then commented , " Hum , that was good . " His father promoted Brown to full general manager of the Woods Division in 1902 . He was an officer of the corporation , and managed the company 's <unk> as director of woods operations until 1943 . When Brown began his career , the company owned 400 @,@ 000 acres ( 160 @,@ 000 ha ) of land . At its peak , the company owned , and Brown supervised , 3 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 520 @,@ 000 ha ) , as many as 40 logging camps , plus an inland fleet of more than 30 boats . The loggers used at least 2500 horses to haul logs , and the company @-@ owned railroad had more than 800 freight cars . 
 The Brown family was later described as " progressive and ... ahead of their times " , and had innovative ideas about wood products manufacturing and scientific forest management . During Brown 's tenure , the company was one of the first to initiate modern forest management practices and to attempt to conserve the forest for future industry use . He was particularly critical of the damage done by portable sawmills . Brown understood that the pulp mills of his time were dependent on locally accessible timber , and concluded that sustainable practices were important to the industry . He built upon the sustainable forestry practices advocated by company forester Austin Cary , who had been recruited from the U.S. Forest Service . In 1919 , Brown set up a tree nursery on the north shore of <unk> Lake that researched sustained yield practices and at its peak was the largest tree nursery in the United States . His innovations in forest management became industry standards ; researchers at Plymouth State College concluded that he " led the Brown company to international prominence as a source for scientific research and development . " 
 Brown was influenced by the Progressive movement as applied to business . He paid his workers above the prevailing wage , instituted safety programs , hired a doctor to care for loggers in the camps , and , prior to modern workers ' compensation laws , had the company pay for hospitalization of injured workers . He also attempted to improve camp conditions for the workers by banning card games and requiring the loggers to take showers , but those particular reform efforts " were not well received . " The Brown family took considerable interest in the city of Berlin . Various family members started a public kindergarten , built a community club with a gym , swimming pool , and bowling alley , provided soup to the sick , and gave Christmas presents to local children . Brown himself helped found a number of civic and business self @-@ help organizations including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests , established in 1901 ; the New Hampshire <unk> Owners Association , a fire @-@ protection group established in 1910 ; and similar fire @-@ protection groups in Maine and Vermont . He set up a series of effective forest @-@ fire lookout towers , possibly the first in the nation , and by 1917 had helped establish a forest @-@ fire insurance company . In 1909 , after helping draft the legislation creating New Hampshire 's State Forestry Department , he became a member of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission ; and its chair from 1910 until 1952 , playing a significant role in shaping the forestry practices and laws of the state . Brown also served on the boards of several industry groups , including the American Forestry Association , Society of American Foresters , Canadian Pulp and Paper Association , and the Forest Research Council . He represented the U.S. at the first World Forestry Congress held in Rome in 1926 . 
 During World War I , in his capacity as chair of the New England Forestry Commission , Brown worked with the War Industries Board to send 10 sawmills abroad . The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain 's need for lumber . When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million board feet of lumber per month , Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there , but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of his poor vision , as he was partially blind in one eye . 
 The Great Depression had a significant impact on the Brown Company . Berlin at that time had a population of about 20 @,@ 000 people , most of whom either worked for the company or provided services to the families of company employees . The Brown family had borrowed heavily during the 1920s to fund expansion , and , as stated by a company employee , had become " complacent and overly optimistic . " The family 's nepotism may also have become a disadvantage . Reduced demand for the company 's products forced it to take out short @-@ term loans to provide operating capital , and by 1931 the international financial situation led to major losses in the value of the company 's bonds . As a result , in the winter of 1931 – 32 the Brown Company could not obtain the necessary financing for its logging operations , when it normally needed to employ 4 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 loggers to cut timber each winter . Family members sold off personal holdings to try to keep the company solvent , and W. R. Brown dispersed his entire herd of Arabian horses . In 1933 , he negotiated a cooperative financing plan with the City of Berlin and the State of New Hampshire , ratified by the state legislature , to fund the woods operations , keeping Berlin 's local residents employed . The company was nevertheless forced to file for bankruptcy in 1935 , after having gone into receivership the previous year . A court @-@ appointed president took over , but Brown continued as head of the Woods Division . Brown 's agreement with the City of Berlin lasted until 1941 , when the company again filed for bankruptcy . Ultimately the Brown family ceased to have a significant role on the board of directors and the company was sold to outside investors . Brown officially retired from the company in 1943 , but his brother O. B. remained on the board of directors until 1960 .

 Brown bought his first Arabian horses in 1910 and founded the Maynesboro Stud near Berlin in 1912 . The farm was named after the original settlement in the area , <unk> , located in the White Mountains in an area also known as the Great North Woods Region . The main stallion barn , although moved from its original location , has been preserved and restored by the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society , which is also restoring the work horse barns of the Brown Company . On September 15 , 2012 , the society celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Maynesboro Stud . 
 At its peak , Maynesboro was the largest Arabian stud farm in the United States . In 1919 , Brown had 88 horses , some at his main farm in New Hampshire , and others at farms he owned in Decorah , Iowa , and Cody , Wyoming . He is credited as the breeder of 194 horses , and became known as one of the most knowledgeable breeders and authorities on Arabians . He served as President of the Arabian Horse Club of America , now part of the Arabian Horse Association , from 1918 until 1939 . 
 = = = Foundation stock = = = 
 As he built Maynesboro , Brown studied the pedigrees of almost every purebred Arabian in the USA at the time . He believed the Arabian was actually a separate subspecies of horse , a once @-@ popular but now discredited theory . He found that , even though developed in the desert , Arabians adapted well to the severe winter weather of his New England farm . 
 When he started Maynesboro , Brown obtained his original foundation bloodstock from his oldest brother , Herbert , who had purchased * Abu Zeyd , a stallion bred by the Crabbet Arabian Stud in England . * Abu Zeyd was considered the best son of his famous sire , <unk> . Herbert Brown obtained the stallion from the estate of Homer Davenport following Davenport 's death in 1912 . The Maynesboro stud also acquired 10 mares from the Davenport estate . Brown considered * Abu Zeyd an ideal representative of the Arabian breed , and when the stallion died , Brown donated the skeleton to the American Museum of Natural History . His other American purchases included most of the horses owned by Spencer Borden 's Interlachen Farms in Massachusetts , following Borden 's decision to disperse his herd . These horses included animals descended from the breeding program of Randolph Huntington , one of the first people in the United States to breed purebred Arabians . Brown also obtained Borden 's extensive collection of literary works on horsemanship , Arab culture , and the Arabian horse , which included 8th @-@ century <unk> manuscripts . Following this start , he looked abroad for additional bloodstock , eventually importing 33 horses into the United States . 
 = = = International purchases = = = 
 Many American breeders had purchased horses from the Crabbet Stud , which at the time Brown founded Maynesboro was owned by Lady Anne Blunt and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt . American breeders obtained some of Crabbet 's best Arabians during the early 1900s owing to the turmoil within the Blunt family . The couple separated in 1906 , and following Lady Anne 's death in 1917 , Blunt 's daughter Judith , Lady Wentworth , became involved in a rancorous and expensive estate battle with Wilfrid over the Crabbet lands and horses . Wilfrid , needing to appease creditors , sold many of the stud 's best horses to international buyers for low prices . Through an agent , Brown purchased 20 Crabbet horses in 1918 , although for reasons unknown , only 17 actually made it to Maynesboro ; he paid only £ <unk> for the entire lot . The most significant animal purchased was the well @-@ known stallion * Berk , who died in America after siring only four foals , much to the dismay of Lady Wentworth , who was trying to buy back the best breeding stock lost to Crabbet because of her father 's actions . Brown bought two additional Crabbet @-@ bred horses from England in 1923 , although not directly from Lady Wentworth . 
 One of the most notable Crabbet @-@ bred stallions Brown eventually kept at Maynesboro was * Astraled , who had come to America in 1909 . This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts , but after siring only two purebred foals in New England , was sold to the remount , shipped west , and lived in obscurity in Oregon , where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring . * Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923 , who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire . * Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro , but that group of foals included his most notable American @-@ bred son , <unk> . 
 Brown traveled to Europe with the U.S. Army Remount Service in 1921 , visiting a number of major European studs in Austria , France , and Hungary . He met Lady Wentworth at Crabbet on the way home , but did not purchase any of her horses . He imported several Arabian mares from France in 1921 and 1922 , in part owing to France 's reputation for producing excellent cavalry horses . 
 In 1929 , Brown traveled to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan in search of desertbred horses . According to Brown 's wife , the two apparently did not get along well , and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow never made it to America . Following that trip , Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert , still considered to be one of the best works written about the Arabian horse .
